This layer is sometimes called sial because its bulk composition is richer in silicates and aluminium minerals and has a lower density compared to the oceanic crust, called sima which is richer in magnesium silicate minerals and is denser. Changes in seismic wave velocities have shown that at a certain depth (the Conrad discontinuity), there is a reasonably sharp contrast between the more felsic upper continental crust and the lower continental crust, which is more mafic in character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe continental crust consists of various layers, with a bulk composition that is intermediate to felsic. The average density of continental crust is about 2.7?g/cm3, less dense than the ultramafic material that makes up the mantle, which has a density of around 3.3?g/cm3. Continental crust is also less dense than oceanic crust, whose density is about 2.9?g/cm3. At 25 to 70?km, continental crust is considerably thicker than oceanic crust, which has an average thickness of around 7ÿ10?km. About 40% of Earth's surface is currently occupied by continental crust.[1]\\r\\nIt makes up about 70% of the volume of Earth's crust.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the surface of continental crust mainly lies above sea level, its existence allowed land life to evolve from marine life. Its existence also provides broad expanses of shallow water known as epeiric seas and continental shelves where complex metazoan life could become established during early Paleozoic time, in what is now called the Cambrian explosion.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll continental crust ultimately derives from the fractional differentiation of oceanic crust over many millions of years.[4] This process has occurred, and continues to occur today, primarily as a result of the volcanism associated with subduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is little evidence of continental crust prior to 3.5 Ga.[4] About 20% of the continental crust's current volume was formed by 3.0 Ga.[5] There was relatively rapid development on shield areas consisting of continental crust between 3.0 and 2.5 Ga.[4] During this time interval, about 60% of the continental crust's current volume was formed.[5] The remaining 20% has formed during the last 2.5 Ga.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast to the persistence of continental crust, the size, shape, and number of continents are constantly changing through geologic time. Different tracts rift apart, collide and recoalesce as part of a grand supercontinent cycle.[6]\\r\\nThere are currently about 7 billion cubic kilometers of continental crust, but this quantity varies because of the nature of the forces involved. The relative permanence of continental crust contrasts with the short life of oceanic crust. Because continental crust is less dense than oceanic crust, when active margins of the two meet in subduction zones, the oceanic crust is typically subducted back into the mantle. Continental crust is rarely subducted (this may occur where continental crustal blocks collide and overthicken, causing deep melting under mountain belts such as the Himalayas or the Alps). For this reason the oldest rocks on Earth are within the cratons or cores of the continents, rather than in repeatedly recycled oceanic crust; the oldest intact crustal fragment is the Acasta Gneiss at 4.01 Ga, whereas the oldest oceanic crust (located on the Pacific Plate offshore of Kamchatka) is from the Jurassic (~180 Ma). Continental crust and the rock layers that lie on and within it are thus the best archive of Earth's history.[1][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe height of mountain ranges is usually related to the thickness of crust. This results from the isostasy associated with orogeny (mountain formation). The crust is thickened by the compressive forces related to subduction or continental collision. The buoyancy of the crust forces it upwards, the forces of the collisional stress balanced by gravity and erosion. This forms a keel or mountain root beneath the mountain range, which is where the thickest crust is found.[8]\\r\\nThe thinnest continental crust is found in rift zones, where the crust is thinned by detachment faulting and eventually severed, replaced by oceanic crust. The edges of continental fragments formed this way (both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, for example) are termed passive margins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe high temperatures and pressures at depth, often combined with a long history of complex distortion, cause much of the lower continental crust to be metamorphic - the main exception to this being recent igneous intrusions. Igneous rock may also be \\"underplated\\" to the underside of the crust, i.e. adding to the crust by forming a layer immediately beneath it.\\r\\n\\r\\nContinental crust is produced and (far less often) destroyed mostly by plate tectonic processes, especially at convergent plate boundaries. Additionally, continental crustal material is transferred to oceanic crust by sedimentation. New material can be added to the continents by the partial melting of oceanic crust at subduction zones, causing the lighter material to rise as magma, forming volcanoes. Also, material can be accreted horizontally when volcanic island arcs, seamounts or similar structures collide with the side of the continent as a result of plate tectonic movements. Continental crust is also lost through erosion and sediment subduction, tectonic erosion of forearcs, delamination, and deep subduction of continental crust in collision zones.[9]\\r\\nMany theories of crustal growth are controversial, including rates of crustal growth and recycling, whether the lower crust is recycled differently from the upper crust, and over how much of Earth history plate tectonics has operated and so could be the dominant mode of continental crust formation and destruction.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a matter of debate whether the amount of continental crust has been increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant over geological time. One model indicates that at prior to 3.7 Ga ago continental crust constituted less than 10% of the present amount.[11]\\r\\nBy 3.0 Ga ago the amount was about 25%, and following a period of rapid crustal evolution it was about 60% of the current amount by 2.6 Ga ago.[12] The growth of continental crust appears to have occurred in spurts of increased activity corresponding to five episodes of increased production through geologic time.[13]","input":"What is formed on top of continental crust?"},{"output":"19 BCE","context":"","input":"When was the western wall built in jerusalem?"},{"output":"James, son of Zebedee","context":"James, son of Zebedee (Hebrew: ???????? Ya?qob, Greek: ???; died 44?AD) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, and traditionally considered the first apostle to be martyred. He was a son of Zebedee and Salome, and brother of John the Apostle. He is also called James the Greater or James the Great to distinguish him from James, son of Alphaeus and James the brother of Jesus (James the Just). James the son of Zebedee is the patron saint of Spaniards, and as such is often identified as Santiago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe son of Zebedee and Salome, James is styled \\"the Greater\\" to distinguish him from the Apostle James \\"the Less\\". He was the brother of John, the beloved disciple, and probably the elder of the two.[1]\\r\\nHis parents seem to have been people of means. Zebedee, his father, was a fisherman of the Sea of Galilee, who probably lived in or near Bethsaida, present Galilee, Israel, perhaps in Capernaum, and had some boatmen or hired men. Salome, his mother, was one of the pious women who afterwards followed Christ and \\"ministered unto him of their substance\\", and his brother John was personally known to the high-priest, and must have had wherewithal to provide for the Mother of Jesus.[1]\\r\\nIt is probable that his brother had not received the technical training of the rabbinical schools; in this sense they were unlearned and without any official position among the Jews. But, according to the social rank of their parents, they must have been men of ordinary education, in the common walks of Jewish life. James is described as one of the first disciples to join Jesus. The Synoptic Gospels state that James and John were with their father by the seashore when Jesus called them to follow him.[Matt. 4:21-22][Mk. 1:19-20] James was one of only three apostles whom Jesus selected to bear witness to his Transfiguration.[2] James and John[3] (or, in another tradition, their mother[4]) asked Jesus to grant them seats on his right and left in his glory. Jesus rebuked them, and the other ten apostles were annoyed with them. James and his brother wanted to call down fire on a Samaritan town, but were rebuked by Jesus.[Lk 9:51-6] The Acts of the Apostles records that \\"Herod the king\\" (traditionally identified with Herod Agrippa) had James executed by sword. He is the only apostle whose martyrdom is recorded in the New Testament. He is, thus, traditionally believed to be the first of the twelve apostles martyred for his faith.[Acts 12:1-2] Nixon suggests that this may have been caused by James' fiery temper,[5] for which he and his brother earned the nickname Boanerges or \\"Sons of Thunder\\".[Mark 3:17] F. F. Bruce contrasts this story to that of the Liberation of Saint Peter, and notes that \\"James should die while Peter should escape\\" is a \\"mystery of divine providence\\".[6]\\r\\nThe English name \\"James\\" comes from Italian \\"Giacomo\\", a variant of \\"Giacobo\\" derived from Iacobus (Jacob) in Latin, itself from the Greek ??? \\"Iakbos\\", from Hebrew ???????. In French, Jacob evolves into \\"Jacques\\". In eastern Spain, Iacobus (Jacobus) became \\"Jacome\\" or \\"Jaime\\"; in Catalan language, it became \\"Jaume\\". Santiago is the local Galician or Spanish (Castilian) evolution of Vulgar Latin Sanctu Iacobu \\"Saint James\\".[7] \\"Tiago\\" is a popular deglutination native to Portuguese language (santiago > san-tiago = S?o Tiago); it crossed with old Diago to give \\"Diego\\" in Spanish and \\"Diogo\\" in Portuguese, which is also the Spanish name of Saint Didacus of Alcal.[citation needed] For example, Miguel de Cervantes in his famous Don Quixote uses \\"San Diego\\" instead of \\"Santiago\\".\\r\\nSaint James is the patron saint of Spain and, according to legend, his remains are held in Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. (The name Santiago is the local evolution of Vulgar Latin Sanctu Iacobu, \\"Saint James\\".) The traditional pilgrimage to the grave of the saint, known as the \\"Way of St. James\\", has been the most popular pilgrimage for Western European Catholics from the Early Middle Ages onwards, although its modern revival and popularity stems from Walter Starkie's 1957 book, The Road to Santiago. The Pilgrims of St. James.[7] Some 237,886 pilgrims registered in 2014 as having completed the final 100?km walk (200?km by bicycle) to Santiago to qualify for a Compostela.[8] When 25 July falls on a Sunday, it is a \\"Jubilee\\" year (an A?o Santo Jubilar Compostelano or A?o Santo Jacobeo) and a special east door is opened for entrance into Santiago Cathedral. Jubilee years fall every 5, 6, and 11 years. In the 2004 Jubilee year, 179,944[9] pilgrims received a Compostela. In 2010 the number had risen to 275,135.[10]\\r\\nThe feast day of St. James is celebrated on 25 July on the liturgical calendars of the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran and certain Protestant churches. He is commemorated on 30 April in the Orthodox Christian liturgical calendar (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 30 April currently falls on 13 May of the modern Gregorian Calendar).\\r\\nThe site of martyrdom is located within the Armenian Apostolic Cathedral of St. James in the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem. The Chapel of St. James the Great, located to the left of the sanctuary, is the traditional place where he was martyred when King Agrippas ordered him to be beheaded (Acts 12:1-2). His head is buried under the altar, marked by a piece of red marble and surrounded by six votive lamps.[11]\\r\\nThe 12th-century Historia Compostelana commissioned by bishop Diego Gelmrez provides a summary of the legend of St. James as it was believed at Compostela. Two propositions are central to it: first, that St. James preached the gospel in Iberia as well as in the Holy Land; second, that after his martyrdom at the hands of Herod Agrippa his disciples carried his body by sea to Iberia, where they landed at Padr܇n on the coast of Galicia, and took it inland for burial at Santiago de Compostela.\\r\\nThe translation of his relics from Judea to Galicia in the northwest of Iberia was effected, in legend, by a series of miraculous happenings: decapitated in Jerusalem with a sword by Herod Agrippa himself, his body was taken up by angels, and sailed in a rudderless, unattended boat to Iria Flavia in Iberia, where a massive rock closed around his relics, which were later removed to Compostela.\\r\\nAccording to ancient local tradition, on 2 January AD 40, the Virgin Mary appeared to James on the bank of the Ebro River at Caesaraugusta, while he was preaching the Gospel in Iberia. She appeared upon a pillar, Nuestra Se?ora del Pilar, and that pillar is conserved and venerated within the present Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar, in Zaragoza, Spain. Following that apparition, St. James returned to Judea, where he was beheaded by King Herod Agrippa I in the year 44.[12][13]\\r\\nThe tradition at Compostela placed the discovery of the relics of the saint in the time of king Alfonso II (791-842) and of bishop Theodemir of Iria. These traditions were the basis for the pilgrimage route that began to be established in the 9th century, and the shrine dedicated to James at Santiago de Compostela, in Galicia in Spain, became the most famous pilgrimage site in the Christian world. The Way of St. James is a trio of routes that cross Western Europe and arrive at Santiago through Northern Spain. Eventually James became the patron saint of Spain.\\r\\nJames suffered martyrdom[Acts 12:1-2] in AD 44. According to the tradition of the early Church, he had not yet left Jerusalem at this time.[14] An argument supporting this assertion is based on St Paul's Epistle to the Romans, written after AD 44, in which he expressed his intention to avoid \\"building on someone else's foundation\\"[Rom. 15:20] by visiting Spain[Rom. 15:23-24], suggesting that he knew of no previous evangelisation in Hispania.\\r\\nThe tradition was not unanimously admitted afterwards, while numerous modern scholars, following Louis Duchesne and T. E. Kendrick,[15] reject it. (According to Kendrick, even if one admits the existence of miracles, James' presence in Spain is impossible.) The Bollandists however defended it (their Acta Sanctorum, July, VI and VII, gives further sources). The suggestion began to be made from the 9th century that, as well as evangelizing in Iberia, his body may have been brought to Compostela. No earlier tradition places the burial of St. James in Hispania. A rival tradition places the relics of the apostle in the church of St. Saturnin at Toulouse; if any physical relics were ever involved, they might plausibly have been divided between the two.\\r\\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia (1908) registered several \\"difficulties\\" or bases for doubts of this tradition, beyond the late appearance of the legend:\\r\\nAlthough the tradition that James founded an apostolic see in Iberia was current in the year 700, no certain mention of such tradition is to be found in the genuine writings of early writers nor in the early councils; the first certain mention we find in the ninth century, in Notker, a monk of St. Gall (Martyrologia, 25 July), Walafrid Strabo (Poema de XII Apostoli), and others.\\r\\nThe authenticity of the relics at Compostela was asserted in the Bull of Pope Leo XIII, Omnipotens Deus, of 1 November 1884.\\r\\nAn even later tradition states that he miraculously appeared to fight for the Christian army during the legendary battle of Clavijo, and was henceforth called Santiago Matamoros (Saint James the Moor-slayer). ?Santiago, y cierra, Espa?a! (\\"St. James and strike for Spain\\") was the traditional battle cry of medieval Spanish (Christian) armies. Cervantes has Don Quixote explaining that \\"the great knight of the russet cross was given by God to Spain as patron and protector\\".[16]\\r\\nA similar miracle is related about San Milln. The possibility that a cult of James was instituted to supplant the Galician cult of Priscillian (executed in 385) who was widely venerated across the north of Iberia as a martyr at the hands of the bishops rather than as a heretic should not be overlooked. This was cautiously raised by Henry Chadwick in his book on Priscillian;[12] it is not the traditional Roman Catholic view. The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1908, however, is quite cautious about the origins of the cult (see above at \\"Controversy\\").\\r\\nJames' emblem was the scallop shell (or \\"cockle shell\\"), and pilgrims to his shrine often wore that symbol on their hats or clothes. The French for a scallop is coquille St. Jacques, which means \\"cockle (or mollusk) of St. James\\". The German word for a scallop is Jakobsmuschel, which means \\"mussel (or clam) of St. James\\"; the Dutch word is Jacobsschelp, meaning \\"shell of St. James\\".\\r\\nThe military Order of Santiago, named after James, was founded in Spain in the 12th century to fight the Moors. Later, as in other orders of chivalry, the membership became a mark of honor.\\r\\nJames had a special place in the Central African Kingdom of Kongo because of his association with the founding of Christianity in the country in the late 15th century. Portuguese sailors and diplomats brought the saint to Kongo when they first reached the country in 1483. When King Afonso I of Kongo whose Kongo name was Mvemba a Nzinga, the second Christian king, was facing a rival, his brother Mpanzu a Kitima, in battle, he reported that a vision of Saint James and the Heavenly Host appeared in the sky, frightened Mpanzu a Kitima's soldiers, and gave Afonso the victory. As a result, he declared that Saint James' feast day (25 July) be celebrated as a national holiday.\\r\\nOver the years, Saint James day became the central holiday of Kongo. Taxes were collected on that day, and men eligible for military duty were required to appear armed. There were usually regional celebrations as well as one at the capital.

They are located at the Standedge (pronounced Stannige) crossing point between Marsden and Diggle, across the boundary between the West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester conurbations. Before boundary changes in 1974, both ends of the tunnel were in the West Riding of Yorkshire.\\r\\nThe canal tunnel is on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal. It opened in 1811 and is the longest and oldest of the four and is the longest and highest canal tunnel in the United Kingdom.[1] The first, single-track railway tunnel was completed by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1848 on the line between Huddersfield and Manchester and a second, parallel, single-track tunnel opened in 1871. The LNWR opened a third, double-track tunnel in 1894. All four tunnels are linked by cross-tunnels or adits at strategic intervals, which allowed the railway tunnels to be built quickly, reducing the need for construction shafts, as waste could be removed by boat.\\r\\nOf the railway tunnels, only the one built in 1894 is currently used for rail traffic. Closed in 1943, the canal tunnel was re-opened in May 2001. The Standedge Tunnel Visitor Centre, at the Marsden end, is a base for boat trips into the tunnel and hosts an exhibition depicting the different crossings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Standedge Tunnel is the longest, deepest and highest canal tunnel in Britain. It is 5,500 yards (5,000?m) long, 636 feet (194?m) underground at its deepest point, and 643 feet (196?m) above sea level.[2]\\r\\nBenjamin Outram was the consulting engineer for the construction of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal (then known as the Huddersfield Canal) which was authorised by an act of Parliament on 4 April 1794 to link Ashton-under-Lyne and Huddersfield via a tunnel. His report in October 1793 estimated the cost of the canal and tunnel at S178,478. Nicholas Brown surveyed the route. Outram thought that the hill through which the tunnel was to be cut was composed of gritstone and strong shale and should not present any difficulties. He expected to start work on the 5,456-yard (4,989?m) tunnel at a dip in the hill at Red Brook and from both ends and use steam engines to keep the works drained.[3]\\r\\nWork began with Outram acting as engineer and Brown acting as superintendent and surveyor. In July 1795, John Evans was appointed to manage the boring of the tunnel. By mid-1796, 795 yards (727?m) of tunnel had been cut, some of which had been lined, but much effort had been spent on constructing small tunnels to supply waterwheels which would raise spoil and water from the intermediate adits. By the autumn, there was concern that such work was expensive but had not contributed anything to the task in hand and soon afterwards, Outram abandoned the attempt to build extra workfaces in order to concentrate on working from both ends. Although cheaper, this choice extended the completion date. Tunnelling was hampered by much larger quantities of water entering the workings than had been expected. In September 1797, Outram advised the management committee that Thomas Lee, the first contractor to be employed on the tunnel works, had made large losses as a result of the difficulties and could not complete his contract. He was awarded more money for timber, an increased rate per yard for completion and an extra year in which to finish.[4]\\r\\nBy the middle of 1799, 1,000 yards (910?m) of the tunnel had been finished and a further 1,000 yards (910?m) had been excavated but not completed. In October 1800, the Peak Forest Canal Company, who were keen to trade through the tunnel, suggested that a tram road should be built to bypass the tunnel until it was completed but although Outram looked at this option, no action was taken. The next tunnel contract failed to attract any takers so John Varley, who had been working on repairs to parts of the canal which had been damaged by floods, was asked to do some tunnelling. Next, Matthew Fletcher, who had experience of mining, was asked for an opinion. He suggested that time could be saved by tunnelling in both directions from Redbrook pit which was being kept dry by a large steam engine. He estimated that this would cost an additional S8,000 but although the committee tried to find a contractor to carry out the work, none could be found and tunnelling continued from both ends.[5]\\r\\nOutram left the project in 1801 after work had stopped for a lengthy period.[6] In late 1804, the committee began to address the issue of how the tunnel would be worked and a sub-committee visited the Harecastle Tunnel on the Trent and Mersey Canal, the Butterley Tunnel on the Cromford Canal and the Norwood Tunnel on the Chesterfield Canal. After seeing them, they recommended that a towing path should be built through the tunnel but the extra cost and delays could not be afforded. Desperately short of money, the canal company obtained a new act of Parliament in 1806 to raise additional finance and to allow an extra toll for using the tunnel to be charged.[7] In 1807, Thomas Telford was asked for advice on construction and planning and produced a detailed plan which was carefully followed until the work was completed.[6] On 9 June 1809, the two ends of the tunnel finally met. Nearly two years after that, on 26 March 1811, the tunnel was declared to be complete and a grand opening ceremony was held on 4 April. A party of invited guests, followed by several working boats, entered the tunnel at Diggle and completed the journey to Marsden in one hour and forty minutes. The tunnel had cost some S160,000 and was the most expensive canal tunnel built in Britain.[7]\\r\\nWhen the tunnel eventually opened, the canal became a through route, 13 years after the rest of it had been completed and 17 years after work first began, at a cost of S123,803. Despite multiple problems, the building of the Huddersfield Narrow canal showed that the technique of quantity surveying had advanced greatly. Telford's report covered every expenditure to the last bucket - it was followed to the letter until the canal finally opened. Between 1811 and 1840, the tunnel was used on average by 40 boats daily.[8] The canal tunnel was brick-lined in places though bare rock was left exposed in others.[9]\\r\\nThe canal tunnel is only wide enough for one narrowboat for much of its length and to save on cost, as in some other canal tunnels in England, a tow-path was not provided in the tunnel. As canal boats were horse-drawn, the boats had to be legged through the tunnel ÿ a process where one or more boatmen lay on the cargo and pushed against the roof or walls of the tunnel with their legs. Professional leggers were paid one Shilling and six Pence for working a boat through the tunnel which took one hour and twenty minutes for an empty boat and three hours with a full load.[10]\\r\\nThere are several widened points in the tunnel which were originally designed to be passing places. However, due to intense competition between boat crews, two-way operation in the tunnel was found to be impractical. The canal company introduced a new method of working where one end of the tunnel was closed off by a locked chain preventing access to the tunnel unless authorised. A similar system is used today.[9]\\r\\nThe Huddersfield Narrow Canal was purchased by the 'Huddersfield and Manchester Railway' in 1846. The canal tunnel proved most beneficial in assisting with the construction of the first railway tunnel at this location as no vertical shafts were needed in the construction and the canal was an easy way to help remove the large amount of spoil excavated. Several cross-passages were retained.[9]\\r\\nThe last commercial boat to use the tunnel passed through in 1921 and the canal was officially closed in 1944 after which it soon fell into disrepair.\\r\\nMost quotes on the internet state the last boat through the tunnel was the Rolt/Aickman expedition in the leaky Ailsa Craig in 1948 when the tunnel was in unknown condition.[11] Tom Rolt, writing in 1948, stated that he had recently traversed the tunnel. The journey took two hours, speed was kept very low intentionally so as to avoid damage to the boat.[12] The canal was blocked at several locations on both sides of the Pennines. The tunnel became unsafe and was closed by large iron gates at each end.\\r\\nA local newspaper described a trip organised by the Railway and Canal Historical Society in 1961 to commemorate 150 years since building work on the canal was complete. A narrowboat left Marsden around 11?a.m. and emerged from the Diggle portal around 1?p.m.[13]\\r\\nThe canal tunnel was the beneficiary of a S5 million restoration project as part of an effort to re-open the entire canal. Several rock-lined parts of the tunnel were found to be unstable. Where possible, these were stabilised by rock bolts, or where impractical, concrete was used to stabilise the rock face. The tunnel re-opened in May 2001.\\r\\nMost modern canal boats are diesel-powered. When the canal was reopened, it was felt that it would not be safe for boaters to navigate the tunnel under their own diesel power due to the extreme length of the tunnel and the lack of ventilation. Instead, electric tug boats hauled narrowboats through the tunnel.[14] Typical operation was to tightly bind three or four boats together in a long row with the electric tug at the head. The cavalcade would then proceed slowly through the tunnel with the boat crews travelling in the tug and a British Waterways operative steering the last boat in the chain. Nobody was allowed to travel on the intermediate boats. Despite rudimentary protection measures such as strips of thick rubber conveyor belting being put in place on the boat gunwales and roofs, extensive impact damage to the intermediate unsteered boats was quite common with this method of working.\\r\\nIn September 2007, it was identified that significant repairs were required to one of the electric tug modules and British Waterways carried out a trial run for self-steer operation. The trip boat Pennine Moonraker was taken through the tunnel under her own power by owner John Lund, shadowed by a BW electric tug.\\r\\nSince the 2009 season, boats have been allowed to travel through the tunnel under their own power, with a chaperone on the boat, followed by a service vehicle through a parallel disused railway tunnel.[15][16]\\r\\nThere are three railway tunnels running parallel to each other and the canal tunnel. The railway tunnels are level for their whole length providing the only section of level track on the line where water troughs could be installed to provide steam locomotives with fresh water supplies without the requirement for the train to stop.\\r\\nThe central single-track tunnel was completed in 1848 by the London and North Western Railway. This has a length of 3 miles, 57 yards (4,803 m). The tunnel is located immediately to the south of, but at a slightly higher level than, the canal tunnel.[17][18]\\r\\nThe 1848 tunnel soon proved to be a bottleneck for rail traffic between Huddersfield and Manchester. In 1871 a second, parallel, single-track tunnel was opened. This has a length of 3 miles, 57 yards (4,803 m) and is situated to the south of the first rail tunnel.\\r\\nThe double-track tunnel was opened by the London and North Western Railway in 1894. This has a length of 3 miles, 60 yards (4,806 m). For most of its length, it is situated to the north of the canal tunnel but passes over the canal tunnel just inside each tunnel entrance. The canal tunnel was extended at the Diggle end as part of the construction works of the 1894 tunnel.[19] It is the fifth-longest rail tunnel in Britain after the new High Speed 1 tunnels, Severn Tunnel and the Sheffield to Manchester route's Totley Tunnel.[17] Only the 1894 rail tunnel is still operational although all three rail tunnels are still maintained. The 1848 tunnel provides an emergency escape route for the other tunnels and has been made accessible to road vehicles such as fire engines and ambulances.\\r\\nThe 1848 single-track rail tunnel closed in 1966, with the 1871 single-track tunnel closing four years later in 1970.[20] Network Rail proposed the reinstatement of rail traffic through the 1848 and 1871 tunnels to increase capacity on the trans-Pennine route, however following a re-appraisal in the light of the decision to electrify the Leeds-Manchester trans-Pennine line, it was reported in 2012 that reinstatement was unnecessary.[21]\\r\\nThe Standedge Tunnel Visitor Centre at the Marsden end of the tunnel is located in the former warehouse used for transshipment of goods from canal barge to packhorse between 1798 when the canal reached Marsden and 1811 when the tunnel opened. The centre contains exhibitions on the history of the tunnels, the canal tunnel's recent restoration and the Huddersfield Narrow Canal.\\r\\nTunnel End Cottages which formerly housed canal maintenance workers, houses a cafe and the booking office for 30-minute boat trips into the tunnel. The trips use electric tugs that push a passenger-carrying barge.\\r\\nThe visitor centre is about half a mile (0.8?km) west of Marsden railway station which can be reached via the towpath of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal which runs adjacent to the station. Adjacent to the railway station is the headquarters of the National Trust's Marsden Moor Estate which includes a public exhibition, Welcome to Marsden, that gives an overview of the area and its transport history.[22]","input":"What is the longest canal tunnel in uk?"},{"output":"Good Housekeeping article published in May 1896","context":"A peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or PB&J, includes one or more layers of peanut butter and one or more layers of either jelly or jam on bread.

It is also called the Partition of Africa and by some the Conquest of Africa. In 1870, only 10 percent of Africa was under European control; by 1914 it had increased to almost 90 percent of the continent, with only Ethiopia (Abyssinia), the Dervish state (a portion of present-day Somalia)[1] and Liberia still being independent.\\r\\nThe Berlin Conference of 1884, which regulated European colonisation and trade in Africa, is usually referred to as the starting point of the scramble for Africa.[2] Consequent to the political and economic rivalries among the European empires in the last quarter of the 19th century, the partitioning, or splitting up of Africa was how the Europeans avoided warring amongst themselves over Africa.[3] The later years of the 19th century saw the transition from \\"informal imperialism\\" (hegemony), by military influence and economic dominance, to direct rule, bringing about colonial imperialism.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Portuguese established the first firm post-Middle Ages European settlements, trade posts, permanent fortifications and ports of call along the coast of the African continent, from the beginning of the Age of Discovery during the 15th century. But Europeans showed comparatively little interest in (and less knowledge of) the interior for some two centuries thereafter.\\r\\nEuropean exploration of the African interior began in earnest at the end of the 18th century. By 1835, Europeans had mapped most of northwestern Africa. In the middle decades of the 19th century, famous European explorers included David Livingstone and H. M. Stanley, each of whom mapped vast areas of Southern Africa and Central Africa. Arduous expeditions in the 1850s and 1860s by Richard Burton, John Speke and James Grant located the great central lakes and the source of the Nile. By the end of the 19th century Europeans had charted the Nile from its source, traced the courses of the Niger, Congo and Zambezi Rivers, and realised the vast resources of Africa.\\r\\nEven as late as the 1870s, European states still controlled only ten percent of the African continent, with all their territories located near the coast. The most important holdings were Angola and Mozambique, held by Portugal; the Cape Colony, held by the United Kingdom; and Algeria, held by France. By 1914, only Ethiopia and Liberia remained independent of European control.[5]\\r\\nTechnological advances facilitated European expansion overseas. Industrialisation brought about rapid advancements in transportation and communication, especially in the forms of steam navigation, railways and telegraphs. Medical advances also played an important role, especially medicines for tropical diseases. The development of quinine, an effective treatment for malaria, made vast expanses of the tropics more accessible for Europeans.\\r\\nSub-Saharan Africa, one of the last regions of the world largely untouched by \\"informal imperialism\\", was also attractive to Europe's ruling elites for economic, political and social reasons. During a time when Britain's balance of trade showed a growing deficit, with shrinking and increasingly protectionist continental markets due to the Long Depression (1873ÿ96), Africa offered Britain, Germany, France, and other countries an open market that would garner them a trade surplus: a market that bought more from the colonial power than it sold overall.[4]\\r\\nIn addition, surplus capital was often more profitably invested overseas, where cheap materials, limited competition, and abundant raw materials made a greater premium possible. Another inducement for imperialism arose from the demand for raw materials unavailable in Europe, especially copper, cotton, rubber, palm oil, cocoa, diamonds, tea, and tin, to which European consumers had grown accustomed and upon which European industry had grown dependent. Additionally, Britain wanted the southern and eastern coasts of Africa for stopover ports on the route to Asia and its empire in India.[6]\\r\\nHowever, in Africa ÿ excluding the area which became the Union of South Africa in 1910 ÿ the amount of capital investment by Europeans was relatively small, compared to other continents. Consequently, the companies involved in tropical African commerce were relatively small, apart from Cecil Rhodes's De Beers Mining Company. Rhodes had carved out Rhodesia for himself; Lopold II of Belgium later, and with considerable brutality, exploited the Congo Free State. These events might detract from the pro-imperialist arguments of colonial lobbyists such as the Alldeutscher Verband, Francesco Crispi and Jules Ferry, who argued that sheltered overseas markets in Africa would solve the problems of low prices and over-production caused by shrinking continental markets.\\r\\nJohn A. Hobson argued in Imperialism that this shrinking of continental markets was a key factor of the global \\"New Imperialism\\" period.\\r\\nWilliam Easterly of New York University, however, disagrees with the link made between capitalism and imperialism, arguing that colonialism is used mostly to promote state-led development rather than \\"corporate\\" development. He has stated that \\"imperialism is not so clearly linked to capitalism and the free markets... historically there has been a closer link between colonialism/imperialism and state-led approaches to development.\\"[7]\\r\\nThe rivalry between Britain, France, Germany, and the other European powers accounts for a large part of the colonization.\\r\\nWhile tropical Africa was not a large zone of investment, other overseas regions were. The vast interior between Egypt and the gold and diamond-rich southern Africa had strategic value in securing the flow of overseas trade. Britain was under political pressure to secure lucrative markets against encroaching rivals in China and its eastern colonies, most notably India, Malaya, Australia and New Zealand. Thus, it was crucial to secure the key waterway between East and Westthe Suez Canal. However, a theory that Britain sought to annex East Africa during the 1880 onwards, out of geostrategic concerns connected to Egypt (especially the Suez Canal),[8][9] has been challenged by historians such as John Darwin (1997) and Jonas F. Gjers? (2015).[10][11]\\r\\nThe scramble for African territory also reflected concern for the acquisition of military and naval bases, for strategic purposes and the exercise of power. The growing navies, and new ships driven by steam power, required coaling stations and ports for maintenance. Defense bases were also needed for the protection of sea routes and communication lines, particularly of expensive and vital international waterways such as the Suez Canal.[12]\\r\\nColonies were also seen as assets in \\"balance of power\\" negotiations, useful as items of exchange at times of international bargaining. Colonies with large native populations were also a source of military power; Britain and France used large numbers of British Indian and North African soldiers, respectively, in many of their colonial wars (and would again be utilised in the coming World Wars). In the age of nationalism there was pressure for a nation to acquire an empire as a status symbol; the idea of \\"greatness\\" became linked with the sense of duty underlying many nations' strategies.[12]\\r\\nIn the early 1880s, Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza was exploring the Kingdom of Kongo for France, at the same time Henry Morton Stanley explored it on behalf of Lopold II of Belgium, who would have it as his personal Congo Free State (see section below). France occupied Tunisia in May 1881, which may have convinced Italy to join the German-Austrian Dual Alliance in 1882, thus forming the Triple Alliance. The same year, Britain occupied Egypt (hitherto an autonomous state owing nominal fealty to the Ottoman Empire), which ruled over Sudan and parts of Chad, Eritrea, and Somalia. In 1884, Germany declared Togoland, the Cameroons and South West Africa to be under its protection; and France occupied Guinea. French West Africa (AOF) was founded in 1895, and French Equatorial Africa in 1910.[13][14]\\r\\nGermany was hardly a colonial power before the New Imperialism period, but would eagerly participate in this race. Fragmented in various states, Germany was only unified under Prussia's rule after the 1866 Battle of K?niggr?tz and the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. A rising industrial power close on the heels of Britain, Germany began its world expansion in the 1880s. After isolating France by the Dual Alliance with Austria-Hungary and then the 1882 Triple Alliance with Italy, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck proposed the 1884ÿ85 Berlin Conference, which set the rules of effective control of a foreign territory. Weltpolitik (world policy) was the foreign policy adopted by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1890, with the aim of transforming Germany into a global power through aggressive diplomacy, the acquisition of overseas colonies, and the development of a large navy.\\r\\nSome Germans, claiming themselves of Friedrich List's thought, advocated expansion in the Philippines and Timor; others proposed to set themselves up in Formosa (modern Taiwan), etc. At the end of the 1870s, these isolated voices began to be relayed by a real imperialist policy[citation needed], backed by mercantilist thesis. In 1881, Hbbe-Schleiden, a lawyer, published Deutsche Kolonisation, according to which the \\"development of national consciousness demanded an independent overseas policy\\".[15] Pan-Germanism was thus linked to the young nation's imperialist drives[citation needed]. In the beginning of the 1880s, the Deutscher Kolonialverein was created, and got its own magazine in 1884, the Kolonialzeitung. This colonial lobby was also relayed by the nationalist Alldeutscher Verband. Generally, Bismarck was opposed to widespread German colonialism[citation needed], but he had to resign at the insistence of the new German Emperor Wilhelm II on 18 March 1890. Wilhelm II instead adopted a very aggressive policy of colonisation and colonial expansion.\\r\\nGermany's expansionism would lead to the Tirpitz Plan, implemented by Admiral von Tirpitz, who would also champion the various Fleet Acts starting in 1898, thus engaging in an arms race with Britain. By 1914, they had given Germany the second-largest naval force in the world (roughly three-fifths the size of the Royal Navy). According to von Tirpitz, this aggressive naval policy was supported by the National Liberal Party rather than by the conservatives, implying that imperialism was supported by the rising middle classes.[16]\\r\\nGermany became the third-largest colonial power in Africa. Nearly all of its overall empire of 2.6 million square kilometres and 14 million colonial subjects in 1914 was found in its African possessions of Southwest Africa, Togoland, the Cameroons, and Tanganyika. Following the 1904 Entente cordiale between France and the British Empire, Germany tried to isolate France in 1905 with the First Moroccan Crisis. This led to the 1905 Algeciras Conference, in which France's influence on Morocco was compensated by the exchange of other territories, and then to the Agadir Crisis in 1911. Along with the 1898 Fashoda Incident between France and Britain, this succession of international crises reveals the bitterness of the struggle between the various imperialist nations, which ultimately led to World War I.\\r\\nItaly took possession of parts of Eritrea in 1870[17][18] and 1882. Following its defeat in the First ItaloÿEthiopian War (1895ÿ1896), it acquired Italian Somaliland in 1889ÿ90 and the whole of Eritrea (1899). In 1911, it engaged in a war with the Ottoman Empire, in which it acquired Tripolitania and Cyrenaica (modern Libya). In 1919 Enrico Corradiniwho fully supported the war, and later merged his group in the early fascist party (PNF)developed the concept of Proletarian Nationalism, supposed to legitimise Italy's imperialism by a mixture of socialism with nationalism:\\r\\nWe must start by recognizing the fact that there are proletarian nations as well as proletarian classes; that is to say, there are nations whose living conditions are subject...to the way of life of other nations, just as classes are. Once this is realised, nationalism must insist firmly on this truth: Italy is, materially and morally, a proletarian nation.[19]\\r\\nThe Second Italo-Abyssinian War (1935ÿ36), ordered by the Fascist Benito Mussolini, would actually be one of the last colonial wars (that is, intended to colonise a foreign country, as opposed to wars of national liberation), occupying Ethiopiawhich had remained the last independent African territory, apart from Liberia.\\r\\nDavid Livingstone's explorations, carried on by Henry Morton Stanley, excited imaginations with Stanley's grandiose ideas for colonisation; but these found little support owing to the problems and scale of action required, except from Lopold II of Belgium, who in 1876 had organised the International African Association (the Congo Society). From 1869 to 1874, Stanley was secretly sent by Lopold II to the Congo region, where he made treaties with several African chiefs along the Congo River and by 1882 had sufficient territory to form the basis of the Congo Free State. Lopold II personally owned the colony from 1885 and used it as a source of ivory and rubber.\\r\\nWhile Stanley was exploring Congo on behalf of Lopold II of Belgium, the Franco-Italian marine officer Pierre de Brazza travelled into the western Congo basin and raised the French flag over the newly founded Brazzaville in 1881, thus occupying today's Republic of the Congo. Portugal, which also claimed the area due to old treaties with the native Kongo Empire, made a treaty with Britain on 26 February 1884 to block off the Congo Society's access to the Atlantic.\\r\\nBy 1890 the Congo Free State had consolidated its control of its territory between Leopoldville and Stanleyville, and was looking to push south down the Lualaba River from Stanleyville. At the same time, the British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes was expanding north from the Limpopo River, sending the Pioneer Column (guided by Frederick Selous) through Matabeleland, and starting a colony in Mashonaland.\\r\\nTo the west, in the land where their expansions would meet, was Katanga, site of the Yeke Kingdom of Msiri. Msiri was the most militarily powerful ruler in the area, and traded large quantities of copper, ivory and slaves  and rumors of gold reached European ears. The scramble for Katanga was a prime example of the period. Rhodes and the BSAC sent two expeditions to Msiri in 1890 led by Alfred Sharpe, who was rebuffed, and Joseph Thomson, who failed to reach Katanga. Leopold sent four CFS expeditions. First, the Le Marinel Expedition could only extract a vaguely worded letter. The Delcommune Expedition was rebuffed. The well-armed Stairs Expedition was given orders to take Katanga with or without Msiri's consent. Msiri refused, was shot, and the expedition cut off his head and stuck it on a pole as a \\"barbaric lesson\\" to the people. The Bia Expedition finished the job of establishing an administration of sorts and a \\"police presence\\" in Katanga.\\r\\nThus, the half million square kilometers of Katanga came into Leopold's possession and brought his African realm up to 2,300,000 square kilometres (890,000?sq?mi), about 75 times larger than Belgium. The Congo Free State imposed such a terror regime on the colonised people, including mass killings and forced labour, that Belgium, under pressure from the Congo Reform Association, ended Leopold II's rule and annexed it in 1908 as a colony of Belgium, known as the Belgian Congo.\\r\\nThe brutality of King Leopold II of Belgium in his former colony of the Congo Free State,[20][21] now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was well documented; up to 8 million of the estimated 16 million native inhabitants died between 1885 and 1908.[22] According to the former British diplomat Roger Casement, this depopulation had four main causes: \\"indiscriminate war\\", starvation, reduction of births and diseases.[23] Sleeping sickness ravaged the country and must also be taken into account for the dramatic decrease in population; it has been estimated that sleeping sickness and smallpox killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower Congo River.[24]\\r\\nEstimates of the total death toll vary considerably. As the first census did not take place until 1924, it is difficult to quantify the population loss of the period. Casement's report set it at three million.[25] William Rubinstein wrote: \\"More basically, it appears almost certain that the population figures given by Hochschild are inaccurate. There is, of course, no way of ascertaining the population of the Congo before the twentieth century, and estimates like 20 million are purely guesses. Most of the interior of the Congo was literally unexplored if not inaccessible.\\"[26] See Congo Free State for further details including numbers of victims.\\r\\nA similar situation occurred in the neighbouring French Congo. Most of the resource extraction was run by concession companies, whose brutal methods, along with the introduction of disease, resulted in the loss of up to 50 percent of the indigenous population.[27] The French government appointed a commission, headed by de Brazza, in 1905 to investigate the rumoured abuses in the colony. However, de Brazza died on the return trip, and his \\"searingly critical\\" report was neither acted upon nor released to the public.[28] In the 1920s, about 20,000 forced labourers died building a railroad through the French territory.[29]\\r\\nFrench diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps had obtained many concessions from Isma'il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt and Sudan, in 1854ÿ56, to build the Suez Canal. Some sources estimate the workforce at 30,000,[30] but others estimate that 120,000 workers died over the ten years of construction due to malnutrition, fatigue and disease, especially cholera.[31] Shortly before its completion in 1869, Khedive Isma'il borrowed enormous sums from British and French bankers at high rates of interest. By 1875, he was facing financial difficulties and was forced to sell his block of shares in the Suez Canal. The shares were snapped up by Britain, under its Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, who sought to give his country practical control in the management of this strategic waterway. When Isma'il repudiated Egypt's foreign debt in 1879, Britain and France seized joint financial control over the country, forcing the Egyptian ruler to abdicate, and installing his eldest son Tewfik Pasha in his place. The Egyptian and Sudanese ruling classes did not relish foreign intervention.\\r\\nDuring the 1870s, European initiatives against the slave trade caused an economic crisis in northern Sudan, precipitating the rise of Mahdist forces.[32] In 1881, the Mahdist revolt erupted in Sudan under Muhammad Ahmad, severing Tewfik's authority in Sudan. The same year, Tewfik suffered an even more perilous rebellion by his own Egyptian army in the form of the Urabi Revolt. In 1882, Tewfik appealed for direct British military assistance, commencing Britain's administration of Egypt. A joint British-Egyptian military force ultimately defeated the Mahdist forces in Sudan in 1898. Thereafter, Britain (rather than Egypt) seized effective control of Sudan.\\r\\nThe occupation of Egypt, and the acquisition of the Congo were the first major moves in what came to be a precipitous scramble for African territory. In 1884, Otto von Bismarck convened the 1884ÿ85 Berlin Conference to discuss the African problem. The diplomats put on a humanitarian fa?ade by condemning the slave trade, prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages and firearms in certain regions, and by expressing concern for missionary activities. More importantly, the diplomats in Berlin laid down the rules of competition by which the great powers were to be guided in seeking colonies. They also agreed that the area along the Congo River was to be administered by Lopold II of Belgium as a neutral area, known as the Congo Free State, in which trade and navigation were to be free. No nation was to stake claims in Africa without notifying other powers of its intentions. No territory could be formally claimed prior to being effectively occupied. However, the competitors ignored the rules when convenient and on several occasions war was only narrowly avoided.[33]\\r\\nBritain's administration of Egypt and the Cape Colony contributed to a preoccupation over securing the source of the Nile River. Egypt was overrun by British forces in 1882 (although not formally declared a protectorate until 1914, and never an actual colony); Sudan, Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda were subjugated in the 1890s and early 20th century; and in the south, the Cape Colony (first acquired in 1795) provided a base for the subjugation of neighboring African states and the Dutch Afrikaner settlers who had left the Cape to avoid the British and then founded their own republics. Theophilus Shepstone annexed the South African Republic (or Transvaal) in 1877 for the British Empire, after it had been independent for twenty years. In 1879, after the Anglo-Zulu War, Britain consolidated its control of most of the territories of South Africa. The Boers protested, and in December 1880 they revolted, leading to the First Boer War (1880ÿ81). British Prime Minister William Gladstone signed a peace treaty on 23 March 1881, giving self-government to the Boers in the Transvaal. The Jameson Raid of 1895 was a failed attempt by the British South Africa Company and the Johannesburg Reform Committee to overthrow the Boer government in the Transvaal. The Second Boer War, fought between 1899 and 1902, was about control of the gold and diamond industries; the independent Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (or Transvaal) were this time defeated and absorbed into the British Empire.\\r\\nThe French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the coasts of West Africa (modern day Senegal) eastward, through the Sahel along the southern border of the Sahara, a huge desert covering most of present-day Senegal, Mali, Niger, and Chad. Their ultimate aim was to have an uninterrupted colonial empire from the Niger River to the Nile, thus controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the Caravan routes through the Sahara. The British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in Southern Africa (modern South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Swaziland, and Zambia), with their territories in East Africa (modern Kenya), and these two areas with the Nile basin.\\r\\nThe Sudan (which in those days included most of present-day Uganda) was the key to the fulfillment of these ambitions, especially since Egypt was already under British control. This \\"red line\\" through Africa is made most famous by Cecil Rhodes. Along with Lord Milner, the British colonial minister in South Africa, Rhodes advocated such a \\"Cape to Cairo\\" empire, linking the Suez Canal to the mineral-rich Southern part of the continent by rail. Though hampered by German occupation of Tanganyika until the end of World War I, Rhodes successfully lobbied on behalf of such a sprawling African empire.\\r\\nIf one draws a line from Cape Town to Cairo (Rhodes's dream), and one from Dakar to the Horn of Africa (now Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia), (the French ambition), these two lines intersect somewhere in eastern Sudan near Fashoda, explaining its strategic importance. In short, Britain had sought to extend its East African empire contiguously from Cairo to the Cape of Good Hope, while France had sought to extend its own holdings from Dakar to the Sudan, which would enable its empire to span the entire continent from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea.\\r\\nA French force under Jean-Baptiste Marchand arrived first at the strategically located fort at Fashoda, soon followed by a British force under Lord Kitchener, commander in chief of the British Army since 1892. The French withdrew after a standoff and continued to press claims to other posts in the region. In March 1899, the French and British agreed that the source of the Nile and Congo Rivers should mark the frontier between their spheres of influence.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlthough the 1884ÿ85 Berlin Conference had set the rules for the Scramble for Africa, it had not weakened the rival imperialists. The 1898 Fashoda Incident, which had seen France and the British Empire on the brink of war, ultimately led to the signature of the Entente Cordiale of 1904, which countered the influence of the European powers of the Triple Alliance. As a result, the new German Empire decided to test the solidity of such influence, using the contested territory of Morocco as a battlefield.\\r\\nThus, Kaiser Wilhelm II visited Tangiers on 31 March 1905 and made a speech in favor of Moroccan independence, challenging French influence in Morocco. France's influence in Morocco had been reaffirmed by Britain and Spain in 1904. The Kaiser's speech bolstered French nationalism, and with British support the French foreign minister, Thophile Delcass, took a defiant line. The crisis peaked in mid-June 1905, when Delcass was forced out of the ministry by the more conciliation-minded premier Maurice Rouvier. But by July 1905 Germany was becoming isolated and the French agreed to a conference to solve the crisis. Both France and Germany continued to posture up until the conference, with Germany mobilizing reserve army units in late December and France actually moving troops to the border in January 1906.\\r\\nThe 1906 Algeciras Conference was called to settle the dispute. Of the thirteen nations present, the German representatives found their only supporter was Austria-Hungary. France had firm support from Britain, the US, Russia, Italy and Spain. The Germans eventually accepted an agreement, signed on 31 May 1906, whereby France yielded certain domestic changes in Morocco but retained control of key areas.\\r\\nHowever, five years later the Second Moroccan Crisis (or Agadir Crisis) was sparked by the deployment of the German gunboat Panther to the port of Agadir on 1 July 1911. Germany had started to attempt to surpass Britain's naval supremacythe British navy had a policy of remaining larger than the next two naval fleets in the world combined. When the British heard of the Panther's arrival in Morocco, they wrongly believed that the Germans meant to turn Agadir into a naval base on the Atlantic.\\r\\nThe German move was aimed at reinforcing claims for compensation for acceptance of effective French control of the North African kingdom, where France's pre-eminence had been upheld by the 1906 Algeciras Conference. In November 1911 a convention was signed under which Germany accepted France's position in Morocco in return for territory in the French Equatorial African colony of Middle Congo (now the Republic of the Congo).\\r\\nFrance and Spain subsequently established a full protectorate over Morocco (30 March 1912), ending what remained of the country's formal independence. Furthermore, British backing for France during the two Moroccan crises reinforced the Entente between the two countries and added to Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would culminate in the First World War.\\r\\nFollowing the Berlin Conference at the end of the 19th century, the British, Italians, and Ethiopians sought to claim lands owned by the Somalis such as the Warsangali Sultanate, the Ajuran Sultanate and the Gobroon Dynasty.\\r\\nThe Dervish State was a state established by Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, a Somali religious leader who gathered Muslim soldiers from across the Horn of Africa and united them into a loyal army known as the Dervishes. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands sought after by the Ethiopians and the European powers. The Dervish State successfully repulsed the British Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region.[34] Due to these successful expeditions, the Dervish State was recognised as an ally by the Ottoman and German empires. The Turks also named Hassan Emir of the Somali nation,[35] and the Germans promised to officially recognise any territories the Dervishes were to acquire.[36]\\r\\nAfter a quarter of a century of holding the British at bay, the Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920 as a direct consequence of Britain's use of aircraft.[37]\\r\\nBetween 1904 and 1908, Germany's colonies in German South-West Africa and German East Africa were rocked by separate, contemporaneous native revolts against their rule. In both territories the threat to German rule was quickly defeated once large-scale reinforcements from Germany arrived, with the Herero rebels in German South-West Africa being defeated at the Battle of Waterberg and the Maji-Maji rebels in German East Africa being steadily crushed by German forces slowly advancing through the countryside, with the natives resorting to guerrilla warfare. German efforts to clear the bush of civilians in German South-West Africa then resulted in a genocide of the population.\\r\\nIn total, as many as 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Namaqua (50% of the total Namaqua population) either starved, died of thirst, or were worked to death in camps such as Shark Island Concentration Camp between 1904 and 1908. Characteristic of this genocide was death by starvation and the poisoning of the population's wells whilst they were trapped in the Namib Desert.\\r\\nIn its earlier stages, imperialism was generally the act of individual explorers as well as some adventurous merchantmen. The colonial powers were a long way from approving without any dissent the expensive adventures carried out abroad. Various important political leaders, such as Gladstone, opposed colonisation in its first years. However, during his second premiership between 1880 and 1885 he could not resist the colonial lobby in his cabinet, and thus did not execute his electoral promise to disengage from Egypt. Although Gladstone was personally opposed to imperialism, the social tensions caused by the Long Depression pushed him to favor jingoism: the imperialists had become the \\"parasites of patriotism\\" (John A. Hobson).[38] In France, then Radical politician Georges Clemenceau also adamantly opposed himself to it: he thought colonisation was a diversion from the \\"blue line of the Vosges\\" mountains, that is revanchism and the patriotic urge to reclaim the Alsace-Lorraine region which had been annexed by the German Empire with the 1871 Treaty of Frankfurt. Clemenceau actually made Jules Ferry's cabinet fall after the 1885 Tonkin disaster. According to Hannah Arendt in The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), this expansion of national sovereignty on overseas territories contradicted the unity of the nation state which provided citizenship to its population. Thus, a tension between the universalist will to respect human rights of the colonised people, as they may be considered as \\"citizens\\" of the nation state, and the imperialist drive to cynically exploit populations deemed inferior began to surface. Some, in colonising countries, opposed what they saw as unnecessary evils of the colonial administration when left to itself; as described in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1899)published around the same time as Kipling's The White Man's Burdenor in Louis-Ferdinand Cline's Journey to the End of the Night (1932).\\r\\nColonial lobbies emerged to legitimise the Scramble for Africa and other expensive overseas adventures. In Germany, France, and Britain, the middle class often sought strong overseas policies to ensure the market's growth. Even in lesser powers, voices like Enrico Corradini claimed a \\"place in the sun\\" for so-called \\"proletarian nations\\", bolstering nationalism and militarism in an early prototype of fascism.\\r\\nHowever, by the end of World War I the colonial empires had become very popular almost everywhere in Europe: public opinion had been convinced of the needs of a colonial empire, although most of the metropolitans would never see a piece of it. Colonial exhibitions had been instrumental in this change of popular mentalities brought about by the colonial propaganda, supported by the colonial lobby and by various scientists. Thus, the conquest of territories were inevitably followed by public displays of the indigenous people for scientific and leisure purposes. Karl Hagenbeck, a German merchant in wild animals and a future entrepreneur of most Europeans zoos, thus decided in 1874 to exhibit Samoa and Sami people as \\"purely natural\\" populations. In 1876, he sent one of his collaborators to the newly conquered Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and Nubians. Presented in Paris, London, and Berlin these Nubians were very successful. Such \\"human zoos\\" could be found in Hamburg, Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Milan, New York City, Paris, etc., with 200,000 to 300,000 visitors attending each exhibition. Tuaregs were exhibited after the French conquest of Timbuktu (visited by Ren Cailli, disguised as a Muslim, in 1828, thereby winning the prize offered by the French Socit de Gographie); Malagasy after the occupation of Madagascar; Amazons of Abomey after Behanzin's mediatic defeat against the French in 1894. Not used to the climatic conditions, some of the indigenous exposed died, such as some Galibis in Paris in 1892.[39]\\r\\nGeoffroy de Saint-Hilaire, director of the Parisian Jardin d'acclimatation, decided in 1877 to organise two \\"ethnological spectacles\\", presenting Nubians and Inuit. The public of the Jardin d'acclimatation doubled, with a million paying entrances that year, a huge success for these times. Between 1877 and 1912, approximately thirty \\"ethnological exhibitions\\" were presented at the Jardin zoologique d'acclimatation.[40] \\"Negro villages\\" would be presented in Paris' 1878 and 1879 World's Fair; the 1900 World's Fair presented the famous diorama \\"living\\" in Madagascar, while the Colonial Exhibitions in Marseilles (1906 and 1922) and in Paris (1907 and 1931) would also display human beings in cages, often nudes or quasi-nudes.[41] Nomadic \\"Senegalese villages\\" were also created, thus displaying the power of the colonial empire to all the population.\\r\\nIn the US, Madison Grant, head of the New York Zoological Society, exposed Pygmy Ota Benga in the Bronx Zoo alongside the apes and others in 1906. At the behest of Grant, a prominent scientific racist and eugenicist, zoo director Hornaday placed Ota Benga in a cage with an orangutan and labeled him \\"The Missing Link\\" in an attempt to illustrate Darwinism, and in particular that Africans like Ota Benga are closer to apes than were Europeans. Other colonial exhibitions included the 1924 British Empire Exhibition and the successful 1931 Paris \\"Exposition coloniale\\".\\r\\nFrom the beginning of the 20th century onward, the elimination or control of disease in tropical countries became a driving force for all colonial powers.[42] The sleeping sickness epidemic in Africa was arrested due to mobile teams systematically screening millions of people at risk.[43] In the 20th century, Africa saw the biggest increase in its population due to lessening of the mortality rate in many countries due to peace, famine relief, medicine, and above all, the end or decline of the slave trade.[44] Africa's population has grown from 120 million in 1900[45] to over 1 billion today.[46]\\r\\nDuring the New Imperialism period, by the end of the 19th century, Europe added almost 9,000,000 square miles (23,000,000?km2) ÿ one-fifth of the land area of the globe ÿ to its overseas colonial possessions. Europe's formal holdings now included the entire African continent except Ethiopia, Liberia, and Saguia el-Hamra, the latter of which would be integrated into Spanish Sahara. Between 1885 and 1914, Britain took nearly 30% of Africa's population under its control; 15% for France, 11% for Portugal, 9% for Germany, 7% for Belgium and 1% for Italy.[citation needed] Nigeria alone contributed 15 million subjects, more than in the whole of French West Africa or the entire German colonial empire. It was paradoxical that Britain, the staunch advocate of free trade, emerged in 1914 with not only the largest overseas empire thanks to its long-standing presence in India, but also the greatest gains in the \\"scramble for Africa\\", reflecting its advantageous position at its inception. In terms of surface area occupied, the French were the marginal victors but much of their territory consisted of the sparsely populated Sahara.\\r\\nThe political imperialism followed the economic expansion, with the \\"colonial lobbies\\" bolstering chauvinism and jingoism at each crisis in order to legitimise the colonial enterprise. The tensions between the imperial powers led to a succession of crises, which finally exploded in August 1914, when previous rivalries and alliances created a domino situation that drew the major European nations into World War I. Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia to avenge the murder by Serbian agents of Austrian crown prince Francis Ferdinand, Russia would mobilise to assist allied Serbia, Germany would intervene to support Austria-Hungary against Russia. Since Russia had a military alliance with France against Germany, the German General Staff, led by General von Moltke decided to realise the well prepared Schlieffen Plan to invade and quickly knock France out of the war before turning against Russia in what was expected to be a long campaign. This required an invasion of Belgium which brought Britain into the war against Germany, Austria-Hungary and their allies. German U-Boat campaigns against ships bound for Britain eventually drew the United States into what had become World War I. Moreover, using the Anglo-Japanese Alliance as an excuse, Japan leaped onto this opportunity to conquer German interests in China and the Pacific to become the dominating power in the Western Pacific, setting the stage for the Second Sino-Japanese War (starting in 1937) and eventually World War II.\\r\\nAfter the First World War, Germany's possessions were partitioned among Britain (which took a sliver of western Cameroon, Tanzania, western Togo, and Namibia), France (which took most of Cameroon and eastern Togo) and Belgium (which took Rwanda and Burundi).\\r\\nLater, during the Interwar period, with the Second Italo-Ethiopian War Italy would annex Ethiopia, which formed together with Eritrea and Italian Somaliland the Italian East Africa (A.O.I., \\"Africa Orientale Italiana\\", also defined by the fascist government as L'Impero).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British were primarily interested in maintaining secure communication lines to India, which led to initial interest in Egypt and South Africa. Once these two areas were secure, it was the intent of British colonialists such as Cecil Rhodes to establish a Cape-Cairo railway and to exploit mineral and agricultural resources. Control of the Nile was viewed as a strategic and commercial advantage.\\r\\nLiberia was the only nation in Africa that was a colony and a protectorate of the United States. Liberia was founded, colonised, established and controlled by the American Colonization Society, a private organisation established in order to relocate freed African-American and Caribbean slaves from the United States and the Caribbean islands in 1821. Liberia declared its independence from the American Colonization Society on July 26, 1847. Liberia is Africa's oldest democratic republic, and the second-oldest black republic in the world (after Haiti).\\r\\nEthiopia maintained its independence from Italy after the Battle of Adwa which resulted in the Treaty of Addis Ababa. With the exception of the occupation between 1936 and 1941 by Benito Mussolini's military forces, Ethiopia is Africa's oldest independent nation.\\r\\nThe new scramble for Africa began with the emergence of the Afro-Neo-Liberal capitalist movement in Post-Colonial Africa.[48] When African nations began to gain independence during the Post World War II Era, their post colonial economic structures remained undiversified and linear. In most cases, the bulk of a nations economy relied on cash crops or natural resources. The decolonisation process kept independent African nations at the mercy of colonial powers due to structurally-dependent economic relations.[49] Structural Adjustment Programs led to the privatization and liberalization of many African political and economic systems, forcefully pushing Africa into the global capitalist market.[50] The economic decline in the 1990s fostered democratization by the World Bank intervening in the political and economic affairs of Africa once again.[51] All of these factors led to Africas forced development under Western ideological systems of economics and politics.[52]\\r\\nIn the era of globalization, many African countries have emerged as petro-states (for example Sudan, Cameroon, Nigeria, Angola). These are nations with an economic and political partnership between transnational oil companies and the ruling elite class in oil-rich African nations.[53] Numerous countries have entered into a neo-imperial relationship with Africa during this time period. Mary Gilmartin notes that material and symbolic appropriation of space [is] central to imperial expansion and control; nations in the globalization era who invest in controlling land internationally are engaging in neo-imperialism.[54] Chinese (and other Asian countries) state oil companies have entered Africas highly competitive oil sector. China National Petroleum Corporation purchased 40% of Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company. Furthermore, Sudan exports 50ÿ60% of its domestically produced oil to China, making up 7% of Chinas imports. China has also been purchasing equity shares in African oil fields, invested in industry related infrastructure development and acquired continental oil concessions throughout Africa.[55]","input":"What two countries in africa remained free from imperial control?"},{"output":"Italian: cartone","context":"A cartoon is a type of two-dimensional illustration, possibly animated. While the specific definition has changed over time, modern usage refers to (a) a typically non-realistic or semi-realistic artistic style of drawing or painting, (b) an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor, or (c) a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. An artist who creates cartoons is called a cartoonist.[1]\\r\\nThe concept originated in the Middle Ages and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as a painting, fresco, tapestry, or stained glass window. In the 19th century, it came to refer to humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers, and after the early 20th century, it referred to comic strips and animated films.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA cartoon (from Italian: cartone and Dutch: kartonwords describing strong, heavy paper or pasteboard) is a full-size drawing made on sturdy paper as a study or modello for a painting, stained glass or tapestry. Cartoons were typically used in the production of frescoes, to accurately link the component parts of the composition when painted on damp plaster over a series of days (giornate).[3]\\r\\nSuch cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design so that a bag of soot patted or \\"pounced\\" over the cartoon, held against the wall, would leave black dots on the plaster (\\"pouncing\\"). Cartoons by painters, such as the Raphael Cartoons in London, and examples by Leonardo da Vinci, are highly prized in their own right. Tapestry cartoons, usually coloured, were followed with the eye by the weavers on the loom.[2][4]\\r\\nIn modern print media, a cartoon is an illustration or series of illustrations, usually humorous in intent. This usage dates from 1843, when Punch magazine applied the term to satirical drawings in its pages,[5] particularly sketches by John Leech.[6] The first of these parodied the preparatory cartoons for grand historical frescoes in the then-new Palace of Westminster. The original title for these drawings was Mr Punch's face is the letter Q and the new title \\"cartoon\\" was intended to be ironic, a reference to the self-aggrandizing posturing of Westminster politicians.\\r\\nCartoons can be divided into gag cartoons, which include editorial cartoons, and comic strips.\\r\\nModern single-panel gag cartoons, found in magazines, generally consist of a single drawing with a typeset caption positioned beneath, ormuch less oftena speech balloon.[7] Newspaper syndicates have also distributed single-panel gag cartoons by Mel Calman, Bill Holman, Gary Larson, George Lichty, Fred Neher and others. Many consider New Yorker cartoonist Peter Arno the father of the modern gag cartoon (as did Arno himself). The roster of magazine gag cartoonists includes names like Charles Addams, Charles Barsotti and Chon Day.\\r\\nBill Hoest, Jerry Marcus and Virgil Partch began as magazine gag cartoonists and moved to syndicated comic strips. Richard Thompson is noteworthy in the area of newspaper cartoon illustration; he illustrated numerous feature articles in The Washington Post before creating his Cul de Sac comic strip. The sports section of newspapers usually featured cartoons, sometimes including syndicated features such as Chester \\"Chet\\" Brown's All in Sport.\\r\\nEditorial cartoons are found almost exclusively in news publications and news websites. Although they also employ humor, they are more serious in tone, commonly using irony or satire. The art usually acts as a visual metaphor to illustrate a point of view on current social and/or political topics. Editorial cartoons often include speech balloons and sometimes use multiple panels. Editorial cartoonists of note include Herblock, David Low, Jeff MacNelly, Mike Peters and Gerald Scarfe.[2]\\r\\nComic strips, also known as cartoon strips in the United Kingdom, are found daily in newspapers worldwide, and are usually a short series of cartoon illustrations in sequence. In the United States, they are not commonly called \\"cartoons\\" themselves, but rather \\"comics\\" or \\"funnies\\". Nonetheless, the creators of comic stripsas well as comic books and graphic novelsare usually referred to as \\"cartoonists\\". Although humor is the most prevalent subject matter, adventure and drama are also represented in this medium. Some noteworthy cartoonists of humorous comic strips are Scott Adams, Steve Bell, Charles Schulz, E. C. Segar, Mort Walker and Bill Watterson.[2]\\r\\nPolitical cartoons are like illustrated editorial that serve visual commentaries on political events. They offer subtle criticism which are cleverly quoted with humour and satire to the extent that the criticized does not get embitered.\\r\\nThe pictorial satire of William Hogarth is regarded as a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th century England.[8] George Townshend produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.[8][9] The medium began to develop in the latter part of the 18th century under the direction of its great exponents, James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and caricature, and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.[10] By calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account for their behaviour, many of Gillray's satires were directed against George III, depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of revolutionary France and Napoleon.[10] George Cruikshank became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray, from 1815 until the 1840s. His career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications.\\r\\nBy the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many other countries featured cartoons commenting on the politics of the day. Thomas Nast, in New York City, showed how realistic German drawing techniques could redefine American cartooning.[11] His 160 cartoons relentlessly pursued the criminal characteristic of the Tweed machine in New York City, and helped bring it down. Indeed, Tweed was arrested in Spain when police identified him from Nast's cartoons.[12] Sir John Tenniel was the toast of London.[13]\\r\\nPolitical cartoons can be humorous or satirical, sometimes with piercing effect. The target of the humor may complain, but they can seldom fight back. Lawsuits have been very rare; the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century in Britain came in 1921, when J. H. Thomas, the leader of the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the British Communist Party. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of \\"Black Friday\\", when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out Miners' Federation. To Thomas, the framing of his image by the far left threatened to grievously degrade his character in the popular imagination. Soviet-inspired communism was a new element in European politics, and cartoonists unrestrained by tradition tested the boundaries of libel law. Thomas won the lawsuit and restored his reputation.[14]\\r\\nCartoons have also found their place in the world of science, mathematics and technology. Cartoons related to chemistry are, for example, xkcd, which varies its subject matter, and the Wonderlab, which looks at daily life in the lab. In the U.S., one well-known cartoonist for these fields is Sidney Harris. Not all, but many of Gary Larson's cartoons have a scientific flavor.\\r\\nBooks with cartoons are usually reprints of newspaper cartoons.\\r\\nOn some occasions, new gag cartoons have been created for book publication, as was the case with Think Small, a 1967 promotional book distributed as a giveaway by Volkswagen dealers. Bill Hoest and other cartoonists of that decade drew cartoons showing Volkswagens, and these were published along with humorous automotive essays by such humorists as H. Allen Smith, Roger Price and Jean Shepherd. The book's design juxtaposed each cartoon alongside a photograph of the cartoon's creator.\\r\\nBecause of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early animated movies, cartoon came to refer to animation, and the word \\"cartoon\\" is currently used in reference to both animated cartoons and gag cartoons.[15] While animation designates any style of illustrated images seen in rapid succession to give the impression of movement, the word \\"cartoon\\" is most often used as a descriptor for television programs and short films aimed at children, possibly featuring anthropomorphized animals,[16] superheroes, the adventures of child protagonists and/or related themes.\\r\\nAt the end of the 1980s, \\"cartoon\\" was shortened in some cases to create the word \\"toon\\", which came into use with the combined live-action/animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). Two years later, the animated TV series Tiny Toon Adventures (1990) demonstrated the use of the term.","input":"What is the origin of the word cartoon?"},{"output":"2,765 seat main auditorium and the 668 seat Playhouse Theatre","context":"The Queen Elizabeth Theatre is a performing arts venue in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Eleven Madison Park in New York City is the current top restaurant, [4] the first American restaurant to top the list since Thomas Keller's The French Laundry in 2004.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe list originated as a one-off stunt by the staff of Restaurant magazine, who came up with the idea at the Shaston Arms public house in London's Carnaby Street.[6] It was more successful than they expected and soon became established as a major event in the culinary world.[6]\\r\\nThe World's 50 Best Restaurants list is compiled from the votes of the \\"Worlds 50 Best Restaurants Academy\\", a group of 27 panels established to make the ranking.[7] The world is divided into regions, with a chairperson in each region appointed for their knowledge of their part of the restaurant world. These chairs each selected a voting panel of 35 members, who cast a total of 5,859 votes.\\r\\nThere is no list of nominees; each member of the international voting panel votes for their own personal choice of seven restaurants. To ensure that there are winners from many regions, judges are encouraged to vote for up to three restaurants in their own region, with the rest cast outside their home region. No voting member is allowed to vote for their own restaurant, or one in which they have an economic interest, and voters must have eaten in the restaurants they nominate within the past 18 months ÿ although it is not possible to ensure that they have.\\r\\nThe criteria are different from those of the Michelin Guide or other guides, which has allowed restaurants like Momofuku Ssam Bar, Asador Etxebarri and St. John to hold their own among the molecular or traditional cuisine of restaurants such as The Fat Duck, Les Ambassadeurs or The French Laundry.\\r\\nThe World's 50 Best Restaurants list has been criticised; writing in The Guardian in 2003 Matthew Fort described the list as \\"humbug\\".[10] The French food writer and critic Fran?ois-Rgis Gaudry says the ranking lacks reliability,[11] while the Spanish chef Martn Berasategui spoke of \\"rigged\\" ranking, manipulated by an \\"important international food company\\" in order to \\"cause damage\\" to the Michelin guide.[12] The list has also been criticised[by whom?] as lacking female representation and being overly Eurocentric.[13]","input":"What's the number 1 restaurant in the world?"},{"output":"the hot luminous core, called a planetary nebula nucleus (PNN)","context":"A planetary nebula, often abbreviated as PN or plural PNe, is a kind of emission nebula consisting of an expanding, glowing shell of ionized gas ejected from old red giant stars late in their lives.[2] The word \\"nebula\\" is Latin for mist or cloud, and the term \\"planetary nebula\\" is a misnomer that originated in the 1780s with astronomer William Herschel because when viewed through his telescope, these objects resemble the rounded shapes of planets. Herschel's name for these objects was popularly adopted and has not been changed.[3][4] They are a relatively short-lived phenomenon, lasting a few tens of thousands of years, compared to a typical stellar lifetime of several billion years.[5]\\r\\nA mechanism for formation of most planetary nebulae is thought to be the following: at the end of the star's life, during the red-giant phase, the outer layers of the star are expelled by strong stellar winds. After most of the red giant's atmosphere is dissipated, the ultraviolet radiation of the hot luminous core, called a planetary nebula nucleus (PNN), ionizes the outer layers earlier ejected from the star.[2] Absorbed ultraviolet light energises the shell of nebulous gas around the central star, causing it to appear as a brightly coloured planetary nebula.\\r\\nPlanetary nebulae likely play a crucial role in the chemical evolution of the Milky Way by expelling elements to the interstellar medium from stars where those elements were created. Planetary nebulae are also observed in more distant galaxies, yielding useful information about their chemical abundances.\\r\\nStarting from the 1990s, Hubble Space Telescope images have revealed many planetary nebulae to have extremely complex and varied morphologies. About one-fifth are roughly spherical, but the majority are not spherically symmetric. The mechanisms that produce such a wide variety of shapes and features are not yet well understood, but binary central stars, stellar winds and magnetic fields may play a role.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first planetary nebula discovered was the Dumbbell Nebula in the constellation of Vulpecula. It was observed by Charles Messier in 1764 and listed as M27 in his catalogue of nebulous objects.[6] To early observers with low-resolution telescopes, M27 and subsequently discovered planetary nebulae resembled the giant planets like Uranus. William Herschel, discoverer of Uranus, eventually coined the term \\"planetary nebula\\".[6][7] At first, Herschel thought the objects were stars surrounded by material that was condensing into planets rather than what is now known to be evidence of dead stars that have incinerated any orbiting planets.[8]\\r\\nThe nature of planetary nebulae was unknown until the first spectroscopic observations were made in the mid-19th century. Using a prism to disperse their light, William Huggins was one of the earliest astronomers to study the optical spectra of astronomical objects.[7] On August 29, 1864, Huggins was the first to analyze the spectrum of a planetary nebula when he observed Cat's Eye Nebula.[6] His observations of stars showed that their spectra consisted of a continuum of radiation with many dark lines superimposed. He later found that many nebulous objects such as the Andromeda Nebula (as it was then known) had spectra that were quite similar. Those nebulae were later shown to be collections of stars now called galaxies.\\r\\nHowever, when Huggins looked at the Cat's Eye Nebula, he found a very different spectrum. Rather than a strong continuum with absorption lines superimposed, the Cat's Eye Nebula and other similar objects showed a number of emission lines.[7] The brightest of these was at a wavelength of 500.7?nanometres, which did not correspond with a line of any known element.[9]\\r\\nAt first, it was hypothesized that the line might be due to an unknown element, which was named nebulium. A similar idea had led to the discovery of helium through analysis of the Sun's spectrum in 1868.[6] While helium was isolated on Earth soon after its discovery in the spectrum of the Sun, \\"nebulium\\" was not. In the early 20th century, Henry Norris Russell proposed that, rather than being a new element, the line at 500.7?nm was due to a familiar element in unfamiliar conditions.[6]\\r\\nPhysicists showed in the 1920s that in gas at extremely low densities, electrons can occupy excited metastable energy levels in atoms and ions that would otherwise be de-excited by collisions that would occur at higher densities.[10] Electron transitions from these levels in nitrogen and oxygen ions (O+, O2+ (a.k.a. O?iii), and N+) give rise to the 500.7?nm emission line and others.[6] These spectral lines, which can only be seen in very low density gases, are called forbidden lines. Spectroscopic observations thus showed that nebulae were made of extremely rarefied gas.[11]\\r\\nThe central stars of planetary nebulae are very hot.[2] Only when a star has exhausted most of its nuclear fuel can it collapse to such a small size. Planetary nebulae came to be understood as a final stage of stellar evolution. Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae are expanding. This led to the idea that planetary nebulae were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space at the end of its life.[6]\\r\\nTowards the end of the 20th century, technological improvements helped to further the study of planetary nebulae.[13] Space telescopes allowed astronomers to study light wavelengths outside those that the Earth's atmosphere transmits. Infrared and ultraviolet studies of planetary nebulae allowed much more accurate determinations of nebular temperatures, densities and elemental abundances.[14][15] Charge-coupled device technology allowed much fainter spectral lines to be measured accurately than had previously been possible. The Hubble Space Telescope also showed that while many nebulae appear to have simple and regular structures when observed from the ground, the very high optical resolution achievable by telescopes above the Earth's atmosphere reveals extremely complex structures.[16][17]\\r\\nUnder the Morgan-Keenan spectral classification scheme, planetary nebulae are classified as Type-P, although this notation is seldom used in practice.[18]\\r\\nStars greater than 8?solar masses (M) will likely end their lives in dramatic supernovae explosions, while planetary nebulae seemingly only occur at the end of the lives of intermediate and low mass stars between 0.8?M to 8.0?M.[19] Progenitor stars that form planetary nebulae will spend most of their lifetimes converting their hydrogen into helium in the star's core by nuclear fusion at about 15?million K. This generated energy creates outward pressure from fusion reactions in the core, equally balancing the crushing inward pressures of the star's gravity.[20] Hence, all single intermediate to low-mass stars on the main sequence can last for tens of millions to billions of years.\\r\\nWhen the hydrogen source in the core starts to diminish, gravity starts compressing the core, causing a rise in temperature to about 100 million K.[21] Such higher core temperatures then make the star's cooler outer layers expand to create much larger red giant stars. This end phase causes a dramatic rise in stellar luminosity, where the released energy is distributed over a much larger surface area, even though the average surface temperature is lower. In stellar evolution terms, stars undergoing such increases in luminosity are known as asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB).[21]\\r\\nFor the more massive asymptotic giant branch stars that form planetary nebulae, whose progenitors exceed about 3M, their cores will continue to contract. When temperatures reach about 100?million K, the available helium nuclei fuse into carbon and oxygen, so that the star again resumes radiating energy, temporarily stopping the core's contraction. This new helium burning phase (fusion of helium nuclei) forms a growing inner core of inert carbon and oxygen. Above it is a thin helium-burning shell, surrounded in turn by a hydrogen-burning shell. However, this new phase lasts only 20,000 years or so, a short period compared to the entire lifetime of the star.\\r\\nIn either scenario, the venting of atmosphere continues unabated into interstellar space, but when the outer surface of the exposed core reaches temperatures exceeding about 30,000?K, there are enough emitted ultraviolet photons to ionize the ejected atmosphere, causing the gas to shine as a planetary nebula.[21]\\r\\nAfter a star passes through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, the short planetary nebula phase of stellar evolution begins[13] as gases blow away from the central star at speeds of a few kilometers per second. The central star is the remnant of its AGB progenitor, an electron-degenerate carbon-oxygen core that has lost most of its hydrogen envelope due to mass loss on the AGB.[13] As the gases expand, the central star undergoes a two-stage evolution, first growing hotter as it continues to contract and hydrogen fusion reactions occur in the shell around the core and then slowly cooling when the hydrogen shell is exhausted through fusion and mass loss.[13] In the second phase, it radiates away its energy and fusion reactions cease, as the central star is not heavy enough to generate the core temperatures required for carbon and oxygen to fuse.[6][13] During the first phase, the central star maintains constant luminosity,[13] while at the same time it grows ever hotter, eventually reaching temperatures around 100,000?K. In the second phase, it cools so much that it does not give off enough ultraviolet radiation to ionize the increasingly distant gas cloud. The star becomes a white dwarf, and the expanding gas cloud becomes invisible to us, ending the planetary nebula phase of evolution.[13] For a typical planetary nebula, about 10,000?years[13] passes between its formation and recombination of the star.[6]\\r\\nPlanetary nebulae may play a very important role in galactic evolution. Newly born stars consist almost entirely of hydrogen and helium,[23] but as stars evolve through the Asymptotic Giant Branch phase,[24] they create heavier elements via nuclear fusion which are eventually expelled by strong stellar winds.[25] Planetary nebulae usually contain larger proportions of elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, and these are recycled into the interstellar medium via these powerful winds. In turn, planetary nebulae greatly enrich the Milky Way and their nebulae with these heavier elements ÿ collectively known by astronomers as metals and specifically referred to by the metallicity parameter Z.[26]\\r\\nSubsequent generations of stars formed from such nebulae also tend to have higher metallicities. Although these metals are present in stars in relatively tiny amounts, they have marked effects on stellar evolution and fusion reactions. When stars formed earlier in the universe they theoretically contained smaller quantities of heavier elements.[27] Known examples are the metal poor Population II stars. (See Stellar population).[28][29] Identification of stellar metallicity content is found by spectroscopy.\\r\\nA typical planetary nebula is roughly one light year across, and consists of extremely rarefied gas, with a density generally from 100 to 10,000 particles per cm3.[30] (The Earth's atmosphere, by comparison, contains 2.5G1019 particles per cm3.) Young planetary nebulae have the highest densities, sometimes as high as 106 particles per cm3. As nebulae age, their expansion causes their density to decrease. The masses of planetary nebulae range from 0.1 to 1?solar masses.[30]\\r\\nRadiation from the central star heats the gases to temperatures of about 10,000?K.[31] The gas temperature in central regions is usually much higher than at the periphery reaching 16,000ÿ25,000?K.[32] The volume in the vicinity of the central star is often filled with a very hot (coronal) gas having the temperature of about 1,000,000?K. This gas originates from the surface of the central star in the form of the fast stellar wind.[33]\\r\\nNebulae may be described as matter bounded or radiation bounded. In the former case, there is not enough matter in the nebula to absorb all the UV photons emitted by the star, and the visible nebula is fully ionized. In the latter case, there are not enough UV photons being emitted by the central star to ionize all the surrounding gas, and an ionization front propagates outward into the circumstellar envelope of neutral atoms.[34]\\r\\nAbout 3000 planetary nebulae are now known to exist in our galaxy,[35] out of 200 billion stars. Their very short lifetime compared to total stellar lifetime accounts for their rarity. They are found mostly near the plane of the Milky Way, with the greatest concentration near the galactic center.[36]\\r\\nOnly about 20% of planetary nebulae are spherically symmetric (for example, see Abell 39).[37] A wide variety of shapes exist with some very complex forms seen. Planetary nebulae are classified by different authors into: stellar, disk, ring, irregular, helical, bipolar, quadrupolar,[38] and other types,[39] although the majority of them belong to just three types: spherical, elliptical and bipolar. Bipolar nebulae are concentrated in the galactic plane, likely produced by relatively young massive progenitor stars; and bipolars in the galactic bulge appear to prefer orienting their orbital axes parallel to the galactic plane.[40] On the other hand, spherical nebulae are likely produced by the old stars similar to the Sun.[33]\\r\\nThe huge variety of the shapes is partially the projection effectthe same nebula when viewed under different angles will appear different.[41] Nevertheless, the reason for the huge variety of physical shapes is not fully understood.[39] Gravitational interactions with companion stars if the central stars are binary stars may be one cause. Another possibility is that planets disrupt the flow of material away from the star as the nebula forms. It has been determined that the more massive stars produce more irregularly shaped nebulae.[42] In January 2005, astronomers announced the first detection of magnetic fields around the central stars of two planetary nebulae, and hypothesized that the fields might be partly or wholly responsible for their remarkable shapes.[43][44]\\r\\nPlanetary nebulae have been detected as members in four Galactic globular clusters: Messier 15, Messier 22, NGC 6441 and Palomar 6. Evidence also points to the potential discovery of planetary nebulae in globular clusters in the galaxy M31.[45] However, there is currently only one case of a planetary nebula discovered in an open cluster that is agreed upon by independent researchers.[46][47][48] That case pertains to the planetary nebula PHR 1315-6555 and the open cluster Andrews-Lindsay 1. Indeed, through cluster membership PHR 1315-6555 possesses among the most precise distances established for a planetary nebula (i.e., a 4% distance solution). The cases of NGC 2818 and NGC 2348 in Messier 46, exhibit mismatched velocities between the planetary nebulae and the clusters, which indicates they are line-of-sight coincidences.[36][49][50] A subsample of tentative cases that may potentially be cluster/PN pairs includes Abell 8 and Bica 6,[51][52] and He 2-86 and NGC 4463.[53]\\r\\nTheoretical models predict that planetary nebulae can form from main-sequence stars of between one and eight solar masses, which puts the progenitor star's age at greater than 40 million years. Although there are a few hundred known open clusters within that age range, a variety of reasons limit the chances of finding a planetary nebula within.[36] For one reason, the planetary nebula phase for more massive stars is on the order of thousands of years, which is a blink of the eye in cosmic terms. Also, partly because of their small total mass, open clusters have relatively poor gravitational cohesion and tend to disperse after a relatively short time, typically from 100 to 600 million years.[54]\\r\\nThe distances to planetary nebulae are generally poorly determined.[56] It is possible to determine distances to the nearest planetary nebula by measuring their expansion rates. High resolution observations taken several years apart will show the expansion of the nebula perpendicular to the line of sight, while spectroscopic observations of the Doppler shift will reveal the velocity of expansion in the line of sight. Comparing the angular expansion with the derived velocity of expansion will reveal the distance to the nebula.[16]\\r\\nThe issue of how such a diverse range of nebular shapes can be produced is a debatable topic. It is theorised that interactions between material moving away from the star at different speeds gives rise to most observed shapes.[39] However, some astronomers postulate that close binary central stars might be responsible for the more complex and extreme planetary nebulae.[57] Several have been shown to exhibit strong magnetic fields,[58] and their interactions with ionized gas could explain some planetary nebulae shapes.[44]\\r\\nThere are two main methods of determining metal abundances in nebulae. These rely on recombination lines and collisionally excited lines. Large discrepancies are sometimes seen between the results derived from the two methods. This may be explained by the presence of small temperature fluctuations within planetary nebulae. The discrepancies may be too large to be caused by temperature effects, and some hypothesize the existence of cold knots containing very little hydrogen to explain the observations. However, such knots have yet to be observed.[59]\\r\\nPreceding evolutionary stage:\\r\\nSubsequent evolutionary stage:\\r\\nGeneral topics:\\r\\nOtherwise related:\\r\\nAlternative developments:","input":"What is at the center of a planetary nebula?"},{"output":"Gathering Blue","context":"The Giver Quartet is a series of four young adult novels by Lois Lowry.

The capital of the Bouches-du-Rh?ne department and Provence-Alpes-C?te d'Azur region, Marseille, on France's south coast, is the country's second largest city, after Paris, with a population of 852,516 in 2012,[1] and an area of 241?km2 (93?sq?mi), the 3rd-largest metropolitan area in France after Paris and Lyon.[3]\\r\\nKnown to the ancient Greeks and Romans as Massalia[4] (Greek: ϫϫ?ϫ, Massala),[5][page?needed][6] Marseille was the most important trading centre in the region and the main commercial port of the French Republic. Marseille is now France's largest city on the Mediterranean coast and the largest port for commerce, freight and cruise ships. The city was European Capital of Culture, together with Ko?ice, Slovakia, in 2013. It hosted the FIFA World Cup 1998 and the UEFA Euro 2016, and will be the European Capital of Sport in 2017. The city is home to several campuses of Aix-Marseille University and part of one of the largest metropolitan conurbations in France, the Metropolis of Aix-Marseille-Provence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarseille is the second-largest city in France after Paris and the centre of the third-largest metropolitan area in France after Paris and Lyon. To the east, starting in the small fishing village of Callelongue on the outskirts of Marseille and stretching as far as Cassis, are the Calanques, a rugged coastal area interspersed with small fjord-like inlets. Further east still are the Sainte-Baume (a 1,147?m (3,763?ft) mountain ridge rising from a forest of deciduous trees), the city of Toulon and the French Riviera. To the north of Marseille, beyond the low Garlaban and Etoile mountain ranges, is the 1,011?m (3,317?ft) Mont Sainte Victoire. To the west of Marseille is the former artists' colony of l'Estaque; further west are the C?te Bleue, the Gulf of Lion and the Camargue region in the Rh?ne delta. The airport lies to the north west of the city at Marignane on the tang de Berre.[7]\\r\\nThe city's main thoroughfare (the wide boulevard called the Canebire) stretches eastward from the Old Port (Vieux Port) to the Rforms quarter. Two large forts flank the entrance to the Old PortFort Saint-Nicolas on the south side and Fort Saint-Jean on the north. Further out in the Bay of Marseille is the Frioul archipelago which comprises four islands, one of which, If, is the location of Chateau d'If, made famous by the Dumas novel The Count of Monte Cristo. The main commercial centre of the city intersects with the Canebire at rue St Ferrol and the Centre Bourse (the main shopping mall). The centre of Marseille has several pedestrianised zones, most notably rue St Ferrol, Cours Julien near the Music Conservatory, the Cours Honor-d'Estienne-d'Orves off the Old Port and the area around the H?tel de Ville. To the south east of central Marseille in the 6th arrondissement are the Prefecture and the monumental fountain of Place Castellane, an important bus and metro interchange. To the south west are the hills of the 7th arrondissement, dominated by the basilica of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde. The railway stationGare de Marseille Saint-Charlesis north of the Centre Bourse in the 1st arrondissement; it is linked by the Boulevard d'Athnes to the Canebire.[7]\\r\\nMarseille has a Mediterranean climate (K?ppen Csa) with mild, humid winters and warm to hot, mostly dry summers. December, January, and February are the coldest months, averaging temperatures of around 12?C (54?F) during the day and 4?C (39?F) at night. July and August are the hottest months, averaging temperatures of around 28ÿ30?C (82ÿ86?F) during the day and 19?C (66?F) at night in the Marignane airport (35?km (22?mi) from Marseille) but in the city near the sea the average high temperature is 27?C (81?F) in July.[8]\\r\\nMarseille is officially the sunniest major city in France with over 2,900 hours of sunshine while the average sunshine in France is around 1,950 hours. It is also the driest major city with only 512?mm (20?in) of precipitation annually, especially thanks to the Mistral, a cold, dry wind originating in the Rh?ne Valley that occurs mostly in winter and spring and which generally brings clear skies and sunny weather to the region. Less frequent is the Sirocco, a hot, sand-bearing wind, coming from the Sahara Desert. Snowfalls are infrequent; over 50% of years do not experience a single snowfall.\\r\\nThe hottest temperature was 40.6?C (105.1?F) on 26 July 1983 during a great heat wave, the lowest temperature was ?14.3?C (6.3?F) on 13 February 1929 during a strong cold wave, but 100?F (38?C) or 20?F (?7?C) temperatures are uncommon.\\r\\nMarseille was originally founded circa 600 BC as the Greek colony of Massalia and populated by settlers from Phocaea (modern Fo?a, Turkey). It became the preeminent Greek polis in the Hellenized region of southern Gaul. The city-state sided with the Roman Republic against Carthage during the Second Punic War (218-201 BC), retaining its independence and commercial empire throughout the western Mediterranean even as Rome expanded into Western Europe and North Africa. However, the city lost its independence following the Roman Siege of Massilia in 49 BC, during Caesar's Civil War, in which Massalia sided with the exiled faction at war with Julius Caesar.\\r\\nMarseille continued to prosper as a Roman city, becoming an early center of Christianity during the Western Roman Empire. The city maintained its position as a premier maritime trading hub even after its capture by the Visigoths in the 5th century AD, although the city went into decline following the sack of 739 AD by the forces of Charles Martel. It became part of the County of Provence during the 10th century, although its renewed prosperity was curtailed by the Black Death of the 14th century and sack of the city by the Crown of Aragon in 1423. The city's fortunes rebounded with the ambitious building projects of Ren of Anjou, Count of Provence, who strengthened the city's fortifications during the mid-15th century. During the 16th century the city hosted a naval fleet with the combined forces of the Franco-Ottoman alliance, which threatened the ports and navies of Genoa and the Holy Roman Empire.\\r\\nMarseille lost a significant portion of its population during the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720, but the population had recovered by mid century. In 1792 the city became a focal point of the French Revolution and was the birthplace of France's national anthem, La Marseillaise. The Industrial Revolution and establishment of the French Empire during the 19th century allowed for further expansion of the city, although it was occupied by the German Wehrmacht in November 1942 and subsequently heavily damaged during World War II. The city has since become a major center for immigrant communities from former French colonies, such as French Algeria.\\r\\nMarseille is a major French centre for trade and industry, with excellent transportation infrastructure (roads, sea port and airport). Marseille Provence Airport, is the fourth largest in France. In May 2005, the French financial magazine L'Expansion named Marseille the most dynamic of France's large cities, citing figures showing that 7,200 companies had been created in the city since 2000.[11] Marseille is also France's second largest research centre with 3,000 research scientists within Aix Marseille University.[citation needed] As of 2014[update], the Marseille metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $60.3 billion, or $36,127 per capita (purchasing power parity).[12]\\r\\nHistorically, the economy of Marseille was dominated by its role as a port of the French Empire, linking the North African colonies of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia with Metropolitan France. The Old Port was replaced as the main port for trade by the Port de la Joliette during the Second Empire and now contains restaurants, offices, bars and hotels and functions mostly as a private marina. The majority of the port and docks, which experienced decline in the 1970s after the oil crisis, have been recently redeveloped with funds from the European Union. Fishing remains important in Marseille and the food economy of Marseille is fed by the local catch; a daily fish market is still held on the Quai des Belges of the Old Port.\\r\\nThe economy of Marseille and its region is still linked to its commercial port, the first French port and the fifth European port by cargo tonnage, which lies north of the Old Port and eastern in Fos-sur-Mer. Some 45,000 jobs are linked to the port activities and it represents 4 billion euros added value to the regional economy.[13] 100?million tons of freight pass annually through the port, 60% of which is petroleum, making it number one in France and the Mediterranean and number three in Europe. However, in the early 2000s, the growth in container traffic was being stifled by the constant strikes and social upheaval.[14] The port is among the 20th firsts in Europe for container traffic with 1,062,408 TEU and new infrastructures have already raised the capacity to 2M TEU.[15] Petroleum refining and shipbuilding are the principal industries, but chemicals, soap, glass, sugar, building materials, plastics, textiles, olive oil, and processed foods are also important products.[citation needed] Marseille is connected with the Rh?ne via a canal and thus has access to the extensive waterway network of France. Petroleum is shipped northward to the Paris basin by pipeline. The city also serves as France's leading centre of oil refining.\\r\\nIn recent years, the city has also experienced a large growth in service sector employment and a switch from light manufacturing to a cultural, high-tech economy.[citation needed] The Marseille region is home to thousands of companies, 90% of which are small and medium enterprises with less than 500 employees.[16][full citation needed] Among the most famous ones are CMA CGM, container-shipping giant; Compagnie maritime d'expertises (Comex), world leader in sub-sea engineering and hydraulic systems; Airbus Helicopters, an Airbus division; Azur Promotel, an active real estate development company; La Provence, the local daily newspaper; RTM, Marseille's public transport company; and Socit Nationale Maritime Corse Mditerrane (SNCM), a major operator in passenger, vehicle and freight transportation in the Western Mediterranean. The urban operation Euromditerrane has developed a large offer of offices and thus Marseille hosts one of the main business district in France.\\r\\nMarseille is the home of three main technopoles: Chateau-Gombert (technological innovations), Luminy (biotechnology) and La Belle de Mai (17,000 sq.m. of offices dedicated to multimedia activities).[17][18]\\r\\nThe port is also an important arrival base for millions of people each year, with 2.4 million including 890,100 from cruise ships.[13] With its beaches, history, architecture and culture (24 museums and 42 theatres), Marseille is one of the most visited cities in France, with 4.1 million visitors in 2012.[19] Marseille is ranked 86th in the world for business tourism and events, advancing from the 150th spot one year before.[citation needed] The number of congress days hosted on its territory increased from 109,000 in 1996 to almost 300,000 in 2011.[citation needed] They take place in three main sites, Le Palais du Pharo, Le Palais des Congrs et des Expositions (Parc Chanot) and the World Trade Center.[20] In 2012 Marseille hosted the World Water Forum. Several urban projects have been developed to make Marseille attractive. Thus new parks, museums, public spaces and real estate projects aim to improve the city cadre de vie (Parc du 26e Centenaire, Old Port of Marseille,[21] numerous places in Euromediterrannee) to attract firms and people. Marseille municipality acts to develop Marseille as a regional nexus for entertainment in the south of France with high concentration of museums, cinemas, theatres, clubs, bars, restaurants, fashion shops, hotels, and art galleries.\\r\\nUnemployment in the economy fell from 20% in 1995 to 14% in 2004.[22] However, Marseille unemployment rate remains higher than the national average. In some parts of Marseille, youth unemployment is reported to be as high as 40%.[23]\\r\\nThe city of Marseille is divided into 16 municipal arrondissements, which are themselves informally divided into quartiers (111 in total). The arrondissements are regrouped in pairs, into 8 secteurs, each with a mayor and council (like the arrondissements in Paris and Lyon).[24]\\r\\nMunicipal elections are held every six years and are carried out by secteur. There are 303 councillors in total, two-thirds sitting in the secteur councils and one third in the city council.\\r\\nFrom 1950 to the mid-1990s, Marseille was a socialist and communist stronghold. The socialist Gaston Defferre was consecutively re-elected six times as Mayor of Marseille from 1953 until his death in 1986. He was succeeded by Robert Vigouroux of the RDSE. Jean-Claude Gaudin of the right-wing UMP was elected mayor in 1995. Gaudin was re-elected in 2001 and 2008.\\r\\nIn recent years, the Communist Party has lost most of its strength in the northern boroughs of the city, whereas the far-right National Front has received significant support.\\r\\nAt the last municipal election in 2008, Marseille was divided between the northern boroughs dominated by the left and the more affluent southern part dominated by the right, with the centre and eastern parts of the city as battlegrounds, allowing for a narrow re-election of the UMP administration.\\r\\nThe cantons of Marseille?:\\r\\nMarseille is also divided in 12 cantons, each of them returning two member of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rh?ne dpartement.\\r\\nBecause of its pre-eminence as a Mediterranean port, Marseille has always been one of the main gateways into France. This has attracted many immigrants and made Marseille a cosmopolitan melting pot. By the end of the 18th century about half the population originated from elsewhere in Provence mostly and also from southern France.[25][26][page?needed]\\r\\nEconomic conditions and political unrest in Europe and the rest of the world brought several other waves of immigrants during the 20th century: Greeks and Italians started arriving at the end of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century, up to 40% of the city's population was of Italian origin;[27] Russians in 1917; Armenians in 1915 and 1923; Vietnamese in the 1920s, 1954 and after 1975;[28] Corsicans during the 1920s and 1930s; Spanish after 1936; North Africans (both Arab and Berber) in the inter-war period; Sub-Saharan Africans after 1945; the pieds-noirs from the former French Algeria in 1962; and then from Comoros. In 2006, it was reported that 70,000 city residents were considered to be of Maghrebi origin, mostly from Algeria. The second largest group in Marseille in terms of single nationalities were from the Comoros, amounting to some 45,000 people.[27]\\r\\nCurrently, over one third of the population of Marseille can trace their roots back to Italy.[29] Marseille also has the second-largest Corsican and Armenian populations of France. Other significant communities include Maghrebis, Turks, Comorians, Chinese, and Vietnamese.[30]\\r\\nIn 1999, in several arrondissements, about 40% of the young people under 18 were of Maghrebi origin (at least one immigrant parent).[31]\\r\\nSince 2013 immigrants from Eastern Europe travel to work in the city of Marseille, attracted by better job opportunities and the good climate of this Mediterranean city. The main nationalities are Romanians and Poles.[32]\\r\\nMajor religious communities in Marseille include:\\r\\nMarseille is a city that has its own unique culture and is proud of its differences from the rest of France.[35] Today it is a regional centre for culture and entertainment with an important opera house, historical and maritime museums, five art galleries and numerous cinemas, clubs, bars and restaurants.\\r\\nMarseille has a large number of theatres, including la Crie, le Gymnase and the Thatre Toursky. There is also an extensive arts centre in La Friche, a former match factory behind the St-Charles station. The Alcazar?(fr), until the 1960s a well known music-hall and variety theatre, has recently been completely remodelled behind its original fa?ade and now houses the central municipal library.[36] Other music venues in Marseille are L'Embobineuze and GRIM.\\r\\nMarseille has also been important in the arts. It has been the birthplace and home of many French writers and poets, including Victor Glu?(fr), Valre Bernard?(fr), Pierre Bertas, Edmond Rostand and Andr Roussin. The small port of l'Estaque on the far end of the Bay of Marseille became a favourite haunt for artists, including Auguste Renoir, Paul Czanne (who frequently visited from his home in Aix), Georges Braque and Raoul Dufy.\\r\\nMarseille served as the European Capital of Culture for 2013 along with Ko?ice.[37] Marseille-Provence 2013 (MP2013) featured more than 900 cultural events held throughout Marseille and the surrounding communities. These cultural events generated more than 11 million visits.[38] The European Capital of Culture was also the occasion to unveil more than 600 million euros in new cultural infrastructure in Marseille and it environs, including the iconic MuCEM designed by Rudy Ricciotti.\\r\\nThe most commonly used tarot deck takes its name from the city; it has been called the Tarot de Marseille since the 1930sa name coined for commercial use by the French cardmaker and cartomancer Paul Marteau, owner of BÿP Grimaud. Previously this deck was called Tarot italien (Italian Tarot) and even earlier it was simply called Tarot. Before being de Marseille, it was used to play the local variant of tarocchi before it became used in cartomancy at the end of the 18th century, following the trend set by Antoine Court de Gbelin. The name Tarot de Marseille (Marteau used the name ancien Tarot de Marseille) was used by contrast to other types of Tarots such as Tarot de Besan?on; those names were simply associated with cities where there were many cardmakers in the 18th century (previously several cities in France were involved in cardmaking).[39]\\r\\nAnother local tradition is the making of santons, small hand-crafted figurines for the traditional Proven?al Christmas creche. Since 1803, starting on the last Sunday of November, there has been a Santon Fair in Marseille; it is currently held in the Cours d'Estienne d'Orves, a large square off the Vieux-Port.\\r\\nMarseille's main cultural attraction was, since its creation at the end of the 18th century and until the late 1970s, the Opra. Located near the Old Port and the Canebire, at the very heart of the city, its architectural style was comparable to the classical trend found in other opera houses built at the same time in Lyon and Bordeaux. In 1919, a fire almost completely destroyed the house, leaving only the stone colonnade and peristyle from the original fa?ade.[40][41] The classical fa?ade was restored and the opera house reconstructed in a predominantly Art Deco style, as the result of a major competition. Currently the Opra de Marseille stages six or seven operas each year.[42]\\r\\nSince 1972, the Ballet national de Marseille has performed at the opera house; its director from its foundation to 1998 was Roland Petit.\\r\\nThere are several popular festivals in different neighborhoods, with concerts, animations, and outdoor bars, like the Fte du Panier in June. On 21 June, there are dozens of free concerts in the city as part of the Fte de la Musique. Music from all over the world in introduced. Being a free event, many Marseille residents attend.\\r\\nMarseille hosts a Gay Pride event in early July. In 2013, Marseille hosted Europride, an international LGBT event, 10 Julyÿ20.[43] At the beginning of July, there is the International Documentary Festival.[44] At the end of September, the electronic music festival Marsatac takes place. In October, the Fiesta des Suds offers many concerts of world music.[45]\\r\\nMarseille is also well known in France for its hip hop music.[46] Bands like IAM originated from Marseille and initiated the rap phenomenon in France. Other known groups include Fonky Family, Psy 4 de la Rime (including rappers Soprano and Alonzo), and Keny Arkana. In a slightly different way, ragga music is represented by Massilia Sound System.\\r\\nMarseille has been the setting for many films, mostly produced in France or Hollywood.\\r\\nThe French television series Plus belle la vie is set in an imaginary quartier, Le Mistral, of Marseille. It is filmed in the Panier quartier of Marseille.\\r\\nThe Netflix series Marseille is set in the city in the 2010s.\\r\\nMarseille is listed as a major centre of art and history. The city has many museums and galleries and there are many ancient buildings and churches of historical interest.\\r\\nMost of the attractions of Marseille (including shopping areas) are located in the 1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th arrondissements. These include:[57][58]\\r\\nIn addition to the two in the Centre de la Vieille Charit, described above, the main museums are:[61]\\r\\nThe main attractions outside the city centre include:[58]\\r\\nA number of the faculties of the three universities that comprise Aix-Marseille University are located in Marseille:\\r\\nIn addition Marseille has three grandes coles:\\r\\nThe main French research bodies including the CNRS, INSERM and INRA are all well represented in Marseille. Scientific research is concentrated at several sites across the city, including Luminy, where there are institutes in developmental biology (the IBDML), immunology (CIML), marine sciences and neurobiology (INMED), at the CNRS Joseph Aiguier campus and at the Timone hospital site (known for work in microbiology). Marseille is also home to the headquarters of the IRD, which promotes research into questions affecting developing countries.\\r\\nThe city is served by an international airport, Marseille Provence Airport, located in Marignane. The airport is the fifth busiest French airport, and known the 4th most important European traffic growth in 2012.[75] An extensive network of motorways connects Marseille to the north and west (A7), Aix-en-Provence in the north (A51), Toulon (A50) and the French Riviera (A8) to the east.\\r\\nGare de Marseille Saint-Charles is Marseille's main railway station. It operates direct regional services to Aix-en-Provence, Brian?on, Toulon, Avignon, Nice, Montpellier, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Nantes, etc. Gare Saint-Charles is also one of the main terminal stations for the TGV in the south of France making Marseille reachable in three hours from Paris (a distance of over 750?km) and just over one and a half hours from Lyon. There are also direct TGV lines to Lille, Brussels, Nantes, Geneva and Strasbourg as well as Eurostar services to London. In addition, the night train (Intercits de Nuit) from Luxembourg and Strasbourg stops here on its way to Nice, whereas the night train from Paris to Nice serves the Gare de Blancarde.\\r\\nThere is a new long distance bus station adjacent to new modern extension to the Gare Saint-Charles with destinations mostly to other Bouches-du-Rh?ne towns, including buses to Aix-en-Provence, Cassis, La Ciotat and Aubagne. The city is also served with 11 other regional trains stations in the east and the north of the city.\\r\\nMarseille has a large ferry terminal, the Gare Maritime, with services to Corsica, Sardinia, Algeria and Tunisia.\\r\\nMarseille is connected by the Marseille Mtro train system operated by the Rgie des transports de Marseille (RTM). It consists of two lines: Line 1 (blue) between Castellane and La Rose opened in 1977 and Line 2 (red) between Sainte-Marguerite-Dromel and Bougainville opened between 1984 and 1987. An extension of the Line 1 from Castellane to La Timone was completed in 1992, another extension from La Timone to La Fourragre (2.5?km (1.6?mi) and 4 new stations) was opened in May 2010. The Mtro system operates on a turnstile system, with tickets purchased at the nearby adjacent automated booths. Both lines of the Mtro intersect at Gare Saint-Charles and Castellane. Three bus rapid transit lines are under construction to better connect the Mtro to farther places (Castellane -> Luminy?; Capitaine Gze ÿ La Cabucelle -> Vallon des Tuves?; La Rose -> Chateau Gombert ÿ Saint Jrome).\\r\\nAn extensive bus network serves the city and suburbs of Marseille, with 104 lines and 633 buses. The three lines of the tramway,[76] opened in 2007, go from the CMA CGM Tower towards Les Caillols.\\r\\nAs in many other French cities, a bike-sharing service nicknamed \\"Le vlo\\", free for trips of less than half an hour, was introduced by the city council in 2007.[77]\\r\\nA free ferry service operates between the two opposite quays of the Old Port. From 2011 ferry shuttle services operate between the Old Port and Pointe Rouge; in spring 2013 it will also run to l'Estaque.[78] There are also ferry services and boat trips available from the Old Port to Frioul, the Calanques and Cassis.\\r\\nThe city boasts a wide variety of sports facilities and teams. The most popular team is the city's football club, Olympique de Marseille, which was the finalist of the UEFA Champions League in 1991, before winning the competition in 1993. The club also became finalists of the UEFA Cup in both 1999 and 2004. The club had a history of success under then-owner Bernard Tapie. The club's home, the Stade Vlodrome, which can seat around 67,000 people, also functions for other local sports, as well as the national rugby team. Stade Velodrome hosted a number of games during the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 2007 Rugby World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2016. The local rugby teams are Marseille XIII and Marseille Vitrolles Rugby.[citation needed] Marseille is famous for its important ptanque activity, it is even renown as the ptanque capitale.[79] In 2012 Marseille hosted the Ptanque World Championship and the city hosts every year the Mondial la Marseillaise de ptanque, the main ptanque competition.\\r\\nSailing is a major sport in Marseille. The wind conditions allow regattas in the warm waters of the Mediterranean.[citation needed] Throughout most seasons of the year it can be windy while the sea remains smooth enough to allow sailing. Marseille has been the host of 8 (2010) Match Race France events which are part of the World Match Racing Tour. The event draws the world's best sailing teams to Marseille. The identical supplied boats (J Boats J-80 racing yachts) are raced two at a time in an on the water dogfight which tests the sailors and skippers to the limits of their physical abilities. Points accrued count towards the World Match Racing Tour and a place in the final event, with the overall winner taking the title ISAF World Match Racing Tour Champion. Match racing is an ideal sport for spectators in Marseille, as racing in close proximity to the shore provides excellent views. The city was also considered as a possible venue for 2007 America's Cup.[80]\\r\\nMarseille is also a place for other water sports such as windsurfing and powerboating. Marseille has three golf courses. The city has dozens of gyms and several public swimming pools. Running is also popular in many of Marseille's parks such as Le Pharo and Le Jardin Pierre Puget. An annual footrace is held between the city and neighbouring Cassis: the Marseille-Cassis Classique Internationale.[citation needed]\\r\\nMarseille was the birthplace of:\\r\\nThe following personalities died in Marseille:\\r\\nMarseille is currently officially twinned with 13 cities:[85]\\r\\nIn addition, Marseille has signed various types of formal agreements of cooperation with 27 cities all over the world:[88]","input":"What city in france was originally a greek state?"},{"output":"Mesopotamia","context":"Ur (Sumerian: Urim;[1] Sumerian Cuneiform: ?????? URIM2KI or ?????? URIM5KI;[2] Akkadian: Uru;[3] Arabic: ?????) was an important Sumerian city-state in ancient Mesopotamia, located at the site of modern Tell el-Muqayyar (Arabic: ?? ????????) in south Iraq's Dhi Qar Governorate.[4] Although Ur was once a coastal city near the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian Gulf, the coastline has shifted and the city is now well inland, on the south bank of the Euphrates, 16 kilometres (9.9?mi) from Nasiriyah in modern-day Iraq.[5]\\r\\nThe city dates from the Ubaid period circa 3800?BC, and is recorded in written history as a city-state from the 26th century BC, its first recorded king being Mesannepada. The city's patron deity was Nanna (in Akkadian, Sin), the Sumerian and Akkadian (Assyrian-Babylonian) moon god, and the name of the city is in origin derived from the god's name, URIM2KI being the classical Sumerian spelling of LAK-32.UNUGKI, literally \\"the abode (UNUG) of Nanna (LAK-32)\\".[5]\\r\\nThe site is marked by the partially restored ruins of the Ziggurat of Ur, which contained the shrine of Nanna, excavated in the 1930s. The temple was built in the 21st century BC (short chronology), during the reign of Ur-Nammu and was reconstructed in the 6th century BC by Nabonidus, the Assyrian born last king of Babylon. The ruins cover an area of 1,200 metres (3,900?ft) northwest to southeast by 800 metres (2,600?ft) northeast to southwest and rise up to about 20 metres (66?ft) above the present plain level.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city, said to have been planned by Ur-Nammu, was apparently divided into neighborhoods, with merchants living in one quarter, artisans in another. There were streets both wide and narrow, and open spaces for gatherings. Many structures for water resource management and flood control are in evidence.[7]\\r\\nHouses were constructed from [mudbricks] and mud plaster. In major buildings, the masonry was strengthened with [bitumen] and reeds. For the most part, foundations are all that remain today. People were often buried (separately and alone; sometimes with jewelery, pots, and weapons) in chambers or shafts beneath the house floors.[7]\\r\\nUr was surrounded by sloping ramparts 8 metres high and 25ÿ25 metres wide, bordered in some places by a brick wall. Elsewhere, buildings were integrated into the ramparts. The Euphrates river complimented these fortifications on the city's western side.[7]\\r\\nArchaeological discoveries have shown unequivocally that Ur was a major urban center on the Mesopotamian plain. Especially the discovery of the Royal Tombs have confirmed its splendour. These tombs, which date to the Early Dynastic IIIa period (approximately in the 25th or 24th century BC), contained immense amounts of luxury items made out of precious metals, and semi-precious stones, all of which would have required importation from long distances (Iran, Afghanistan, India, Asia Minor, the Persian Gulf).[6] This wealth, unparalleled up to then, is a testimony of Ur's economic importance during the Early Bronze Age.[8]\\r\\nArchaeological research of the region has also contributed greatly to our understanding of the landscape and long-distance interactions that took place during these ancient times. Ur was a major port on the Persian Gulf, which extended much further inland than it does today, and controlled much of the trade into Mesopotamia. Imports to Ur came from many parts of the world. The imported objects include precious metals such as gold and silver, and semi-precious stones, namely lapis lazuli and carnelian.[7]\\r\\nIt is thought that Ur had a stratified social system including slaves (captured foreigners), farmers, artisans, doctors, scribes, priests. High-ranking priests apparently enjoyed great luxury and lived in mansions.[7]\\r\\nTens of thousands of texts, including contracts, business records, and court documents, record the city's complex economic and legal systems. These texts have been recovered from temples, the palace, and individual houses.[7]\\r\\nWhen Ur was founded, the Persian Gulf's water level was 2.5 meters higher than it is today. Ur is therefore thought to have had marshy surroundings, and used canals only for transportation, not for irrigation. Fish, birds, tubers, and reeds might have supported Ur economically without the need for an agricultural revolution sometimes hypostatized as a prerequisite to urbanization.[9][10]\\r\\nArchaeologists have discovered the evidence of an early occupation at Ur during the Ubaid period (ca. 6500 to 3800 BC). These early levels were sealed off with a sterile deposit of soil that was interpreted by excavators of the 1920s as evidence for the Great Flood of the Book of Genesis and Epic of Gilgamesh. It is now understood that the South Mesopotamian plain was exposed to regular floods from the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers, with heavy erosion from water and wind, which may have given rise to the Mesopotamian and derivative Biblical Great Flood stories.[11] The further occupation of Ur only becomes clear during its emergence in the third millennium BC (although it must already have been a growing urban center during the fourth millennium). The third millennium BC is generally described as the Early Bronze Age of Mesopotamia, which ends approximately after the demise of the Third Dynasty of Ur in the 21st century BC.\\r\\nThere are two main sources which inform scholars about the importance of Ur during the Early Bronze Age. The first is a large body of cuneiform documents, mostly from the empire of the so-called Third Dynasty of Ur, at the very end of the third millennium. This was the most centralized bureaucratic state the world had yet known. Concerning the earlier centuries, the Sumerian King List provides a tentative political history of ancient Sumer. . So far evidence for the earliest periods of the Early Bronze Age in Mesopotamia is very limited. Mesannepada is the first king mentioned in the Sumerian King List, and appears to have lived in the 26th century BC. That Ur was an important urban centre already then seems to be indicated by a type of cylinder seal called the City Seals. These seals contain a set of proto-cuneiform signs which appear to be writings or symbols of the name of city-states in ancient Sumer. Many of these seals have been found in Ur, and the name of Ur is prominent on them.[12]\\r\\nUr came under the control of the Akkadian Empire founded by Sargon the Great between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC. This was a period when the Semitic-speaking Akkadians of Mesopotamia gained ascendancy over the Sumerians, and indeed much of the ancient Near East.\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Akkadian Empire in the mid-22nd century BC, southern Mesopotamia came to be ruled for a few decades by the Gutians, a barbarian people originating in the Zagros Mountains to the northeast of Mesopotamia, while the Assyrian branch reasserted their independence in the north of Mesopotamia.\\r\\nThe third dynasty was established when the king Ur-Nammu came to power, ruling between ca. 2047?BC and 2030?BC. During his rule, temples, including the ziggurat, were built, and agriculture was improved through irrigation. His code of laws, the Code of Ur-Nammu (a fragment was identified in Istanbul in 1952) is one of the oldest such documents known, preceding the Code of Hammurabi by 300?years. He and his successor Shulgi were both deified during their reigns, and after his death he continued as a hero-figure: one of the surviving works of Sumerian literature describes the death of Ur-Nammu and his journey to the underworld.[13] About that time, the houses in the city were two-storied villas with 13 or 14 rooms, with plastered interior walls.[14][dubious ÿ discuss]\\r\\nUr-Nammu was succeeded by Shulgi, the greatest king of the Third Dynasty of Ur, who solidified the hegemony of Ur and reformed the empire into a highly centralized bureaucratic state. Shulgi ruled for a long time (at least 42?years) and deified himself halfway through his rule.[15]\\r\\nThe Ur empire continued through the reigns of three more kings with Semitic Akkadian names,[11] Amar-Sin, Shu-Sin, and Ibbi-Sin. It fell around 1940?BC to the Elamites in the 24th regnal year of Ibbi-Sin, an event commemorated by the Lament for Ur.[16][17]\\r\\nAccording to one estimate, Ur was the largest city in the world from c. 2030 to 1980?BC. Its population was approximately 65,000 (or 0.1 per cent share of global population then).[18]\\r\\nThe city of Ur lost its political power after the demise of the Third Dynasty of Ur. Nevertheless, its important position which kept on providing access to the Persian Gulf ensured the ongoing economic importance of the city during the second millennium BC. The splendour of the city, the might of the empire, the greatness of king Shulgi, and undoubtedly the efficient propaganda of the state endured throughout Mesopotamian history. Shulgi was a well known historical figure for at least another two thousand years, while historical narratives of the Mesopotamian societies of Assyria and Babylonia kept names, events, and mythologies in remembrance. The city came to be ruled by the first dynasty (Amorite) of Babylonia which rose to prominence in southern Mesopotamia in the 18th century BC. After the fall of Hammurabi's short lived Babylonian Empire, it later became a part of the native Akkadian ruled Sealand Dynasty for over 270?years, and was reconquered into Babylonia by the successors of the Amorites, the Kassites in the 16th century BC. During the Kassite Dynastic period Ur, along with the rest of Babylonia, came under sporadic control of the Elamites and Middle Assyrian Empire.\\r\\nThe city, along with the rest of southern Mesopotamia and much of the Near East, Asia Minor, North Africa and southern Caucasus, fell to the north Mesopotamian Assyrian Empire from the 10th to late 7th centuries BC. From the end of the 7th century BC Ur was ruled by the so-called Chaldean Dynasty of Babylon. In the 6th century BC there was new construction in Ur under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. The last Babylonian king, Nabonidus (who was Assyrian born, and not a Chaldean), improved the ziggurat. However the city started to decline from around 550?BC and was no longer inhabited after about 500?BC by which time Babylonia had fallen to the Persian Achaemenid Empire.[11] The demise of Ur was perhaps owing to drought, changing river patterns, and the silting of the outlet to the Persian Gulf.\\r\\nUr may be the city of Ur Kasdim mentioned in the Book of Genesis (Biblical Hebrew ????) as the birthplace of the Hebrew and Muslim patriarch Avram (Abraham; Aramaic: Oraham, Arabic: Ibrahim), traditionally believed to be some time in the 2nd millennium BC. There are however conflicting traditions and scholarly opinions identifying Ur Kasdim with the sites of Sanliurfa, Urkesh, Urartu or Kutha.\\r\\nUr is mentioned four times in the Torah or Old Testament, with the distinction \\"of the Kasdim/Kasdin\\"traditionally rendered in English as \\"Ur of the Chaldees\\". The Chaldeans were already settled in the vicinity by around 850?BC, but were not the rulers of Ur until the late 7th century BC, around 550 BC. The name is found in Genesis 11:28, Genesis 11:31, and Genesis 15:7. In Nehemiah 9:7, a single passage mentioning Ur is a paraphrase of Genesis. (Nehemiah 9:7)\\r\\nThe Book of Jubilees states that Ur was founded in 1688 Anno Mundi (year of the world) by 'Ur son of Kesed, presumably the offspring of Arphaxad, adding that in this same year wars began on Earth.\\r\\nIn 1625, the site was visited by Pietro Della Valle, who recorded the presence of ancient bricks stamped with strange symbols, cemented together with bitumen, as well as inscribed pieces of black marble that appeared to be seals.\\r\\nEuropean archaeologists did not identify Tell el-Muqayyar as the site of Ur until Henry Rawlinson successfully deciphered some bricks from that location, brought to England by William Loftus in 1849.[20]\\r\\nThe site was first excavated in 1853 and 1854, on behalf of the British Museum and with instructions from the Foreign Office, by John George Taylor, British vice consul at Basra from 1851 to 1859.[21][22][23] Taylor uncovered the Ziggurat of Ur and a structure with an arch later identified as part of the \\"Gate of Judgment\\".[24]\\r\\nIn the four corners of the ziggurat's top stage, Taylor found clay cylinders bearing an inscription of Nabonidus (Nabuna\`id), the last king of Babylon (539?BC), closing with a prayer for his son Belshar-uzur (Bel-?arra-Uzur), the Belshazzar of the Book of Daniel. Evidence was found of prior restorations of the ziggurat by Ishme-Dagan of Isin and Shu-Sin of Ur, and by Kurigalzu, a Kassite king of Babylon in the 14th century BC. Nebuchadnezzar also claims to have rebuilt the temple.\\r\\nTaylor further excavated an interesting Babylonian building, not far from the temple, part of an ancient Babylonian necropolis. All about the city he found abundant remains of burials of later periods. Apparently, in later times, owing to its sanctity, Ur became a favorite place of sepulchres, so that even after it had ceased to be inhabited, it continued to be used as a necropolis.\\r\\nTypical of the era, his excavations destroyed information and exposed the tell. Natives used the now loosened, 4000-year-old bricks and tile for construction for the next 75?years, while the site lay unexplored,[25][dubious ÿ discuss] the British Museum having decided to prioritize archaeology in Assyria.[24]\\r\\nAfter Taylor's time, the site was visited by numerous travelers, almost all of whom have found ancient Babylonian remains, inscribed stones and the like, lying upon the surface. The site was considered rich in remains, and relatively easy to explore. After some soundings were made in 1918 by Reginald Campbell Thompson, H. R. Hall worked the site for one season for the British Museum in 1919, laying the groundwork for more extensive efforts to follow.[26][27]\\r\\nExcavations from 1922 to 1934 were funded by the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania and led by the archaeologist Sir Charles Leonard Woolley.[28][29][30] A total of about 1,850 burials were uncovered, including 16 that were described as \\"royal tombs\\" containing many valuable artifacts, including the Standard of Ur. Most of the royal tombs were dated to about 2600?BC. The finds included the unlooted tomb of a queen thought to be Queen Puabi[31]the name is known from a cylinder seal found in the tomb, although there were two other different and unnamed seals found in the tomb. Many other people had been buried with her, in a form of human sacrifice. Near the ziggurat were uncovered the temple E-nun-mah and buildings E-dub-lal-mah (built for a king), E-gi-par (residence of the high priestess) and E-hur-sag (a temple building). Outside the temple area, many houses used in everyday life were found. Excavations were also made below the royal tombs layer: a 3.5-metre-thick (11?ft) layer of alluvial clay covered the remains of earlier habitation, including pottery from the Ubaid period, the first stage of settlement in southern Mesopotamia. Woolley later wrote many articles and books about the discoveries.[32] One of Woolley's assistants on the site was the archaeologist Max Mallowan. The discoveries at the site reached the headlines in mainstream media in the world with the discoveries of the Royal Tombs. As a result, the ruins of the ancient city attracted many visitors. One of these visitors was the already famous Agatha Christie, who as a result of this visit ended up marrying Max Mallowan.\\r\\nDuring this time the site was accessible from the BaghdadÿBasra railway, from a stop called \\"Ur Junction\\".[33]\\r\\nWhen the Royal Tombs at Ur, was first discovered, they had no idea how big it actually was. They started by digging two trenches in the middle of the desert to see if they could find anything that would allow them to keep digging. They originally split into two teams. Team A and team B. Both teams spent the first few months digging a trench and had found evidence of burial grounds by collecting small pieces of golden jewelry and pottery. This was called at the time the \\"gold trench\\". At this time, the first season of digging had come to a close, and Woolley returned to England. In Autumn, Woolley returned and continued to dig into the second season. By the end of the second season, he had uncovered a courtyard surrounded by many rooms.[34] In their third season of digging they had uncovered their biggest find yet, a building that was believed to have been built by the orders of the king, and the second building to be where the high priestess lived. As the fourth and fifth season came to a close, they had discovered so many items, that most of their time was now spent recording the objects they found instead of actually digging objects. They had found many items from gold jewelry to clay pots and stones. There were a few Lyres that were inside of the tombs as well. One of the most significant objects that was discovered was the Standard of Ur. At the end of their sixth season they had excavated 1850 burials and deemed 17 of them to be \\"Royal Tombs\\"Woolley had finished his work excavating the Royal Tombs of UR in 1934. Inside princess Puabi's tomb, there was a chest in the middle of the room. Underneath that chest was a hole in the ground that led to what was called the \\"King's grave\\" PG-789. It was believed to be the kings grave because it was buried next to the queen. In the \\"King's Grave\\" were 63 attendants who were all equipped with copper helmets and swords. It is thought to be his army buried with him. Another large room was uncovered, PG-1237, called the \\"Great death pit\\". This large room had 74 bodies, 68 of which were women. There were only two artifacts in the tomb, both of which were Lyres.\\r\\nMost of the treasures excavated at Ur are in the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. At the Penn Museum the exhibition \\"Iraq's Ancient Past\\",[35] which includes many of the most famous pieces from the Royal Tombs, opened to visitors in late Spring 2011. Previously, the Penn Museum had sent many of its best pieces from Ur on tour in an exhibition called \\"Treasures From the Royal Tombs of Ur.\\" It traveled to eight American museums, including those in Cleveland, Washington and Dallas, ending the tour at the Detroit Institute of Art in May 2011.\\r\\nIn 2009, an agreement was reached for a joint University of Pennsylvania and Iraqi team to resume archaeological work at the site of Ur.[36]\\r\\nThough some of the areas that were cleared during modern excavations have sanded over again, the Great Ziggurat is fully cleared and stands as the best-preserved and most visible landmark at the site.[37] The famous Royal tombs, also called the Neo-Sumerian Mausolea, located about 250 metres (820?ft) south-east of the Great Ziggurat in the corner of the wall that surrounds the city, are nearly totally cleared. Parts of the tomb area appear to be in need of structural consolidation or stabilization.\\r\\nThere are cuneiform (Sumerian writing) on many walls, some entirely covered in script stamped into the mud-bricks. The text is sometimes difficult to read, but it covers most surfaces. Modern graffiti has also found its way to the graves, usually in the form of names made with coloured pens (sometimes they are carved). The Great Ziggurat itself has far more graffiti, mostly lightly carved into the bricks. The graves are completely empty. A small number of the tombs are accessible. Most of them have been cordoned off. The whole site is covered with pottery debris, to the extent that it is virtually impossible to set foot anywhere without stepping on some. Some have colours and paintings on them. Some of the \\"mountains\\" of broken pottery are debris that has been removed from excavations. Pottery debris and human remains form many of the walls of the royal tombs area. It can only be speculated whether this is of ancient making or modern restoration, but it is a fact that they are, literally, filled up with pottery debris.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn May 2009, the United States Army returned the Ur site to the Iraqi authorities, who hope to develop it as a tourist destination.[38]\\r\\nSince 2009, the non-profit organization Global Heritage Fund (GHF) has been working to protect and preserve Ur against the problems of erosion, neglect, inappropriate restoration, war and conflict. GHF's stated goal for the project is to create an informed and scientifically grounded Master Plan to guide the long-term conservation and management of the site, and to serve as a model for the stewardship of other sites.[39]\\r\\nSince 2013, the institution for Development Cooperation of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs DGCS and the SBAH, the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage of the Iraqi Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, have started a cooperation project for \\"The Conservation and Maintenance of Archaeological site of UR\\". In the framework of this cooperation agreement, the executive plan, with detailed drawings, is in progress for the maintenance of the Dublamah Temple (design concluded, works starting), the Royal Tombs -Mausolea 3rd Dynasty- (in progress) and the Ziqqurat (in progress). The first updated survey in 2013 has produced a new aerial map derived by the flight of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) operated in March 2014. This is the first high resolution map, derived from more than 100 aerial photograms, with an accuracy of 20?cm or less. A preview of the ORTHO-PHOTOMAP of Archaeological Site of UR is available here.","input":"What was the ancient name for modern-day iraq?"},{"output":"the Supreme Court","context":"The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (in case citations, D.C. Cir.) known informally as the D.C. Circuit, is the federal appellate court for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Appeals from the D.C. Circuit, as with all the U.S. Courts of Appeals, are heard on a discretionary basis by the Supreme Court. It should not be confused with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which is limited in jurisdiction by subject matter rather than geography, or with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which is roughly equivalent to a state supreme court in the District of Columbia, established in 1970 to relieve the D.C. Circuit from having to take appeals from the local D.C. trial court.\\r\\nWhile it has the smallest geographic jurisdiction of any of the United States courts of appeals, the D.C. Circuit, with eleven active judgeships, is arguably the most important inferior appellate court. The court is given the responsibility of directly reviewing the decisions and rulemaking of many federal independent agencies of the United States government based in the national capital, often without prior hearing by a district court. Aside from the agencies whose statutes explicitly direct review by the D.C. Circuit, the court typically hears cases from other agencies under the more general jurisdiction granted to the Courts of Appeals under the Administrative Procedure Act. Given the broad areas over which federal agencies have power, this often gives the judges of the D.C. Circuit a central role in affecting national U.S. policy and law. Because of this, the D.C. Circuit is often referred to as the second most powerful court in the United States, second only to the Supreme Court[1]\\r\\nA judgeship on the D.C. Circuit is often thought of as a stepping-stone for appointment to the Supreme Court. As of February?2016[update], three of the nine justices on the Supreme Court are alumni of the D.C. Circuit: Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Elena Kagan was nominated by Bill Clinton to the same seat that Roberts would later fill, but was never given a vote in the Senate. In addition, Chief Justices Fred M. Vinson and Warren Burger, as well as Associate Justices Wiley Blount Rutledge and Antonin Scalia, served on the D.C. Circuit before their elevations to the Supreme Court. In 1987, the Reagan Administration put forth two failed nominees from the D.C. Circuit: former Judge Robert Bork, who was rejected by the Senate, and former (2001ÿ2008) Chief Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg (no relation to Ruth Bader Ginsburg), who withdrew his nomination after it became known that he had used marijuana as a college student and professor in the 1960s and 1970s.\\r\\nUnlike the Courts of Appeals for the other geographical districts where home-state senators have the privilege of holding up confirmation by the \\"blue slip\\" process, because the D.C. Circuit does not represent any state, confirmation of nominees is often procedurally and practically easier. However, in recent years, several nominees were stalled and some were ultimately not confirmed because senators claimed that the court had become larger than necessary to handle its caseload. The court has a history of reversing the Federal Communications Commission's major policy actions.[2]\\r\\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit meets at the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse, near Judiciary Square in downtown Washington, D.C.\\r\\nFrom 1984 to 2009, there were twelve seats on the D.C. Circuit. One of those seats was eliminated by the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 on January 7, 2008, with immediate effect, leaving the number of authorized judgeships at eleven. (The eliminated judgeship was instead assigned to the Ninth Circuit, with the assignment taking effect on January 21, 2009).\\r\\nDecisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeals are published in the Federal Reporter, an unofficial reporter from Thomson Reuters.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Congress established this court in 1893 as the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, it had a Chief Justice, and the other judges were called Associate Justices, which was similar to the structure of the Supreme Court. The Chief Justiceship was a separate seat: the President would appoint the Chief Justice, and that person would stay Chief Justice until he left the court.\\r\\nOn June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 869 and 62 Stat. 985 became law. These acts made the Chief Justice a Chief Judge. In 1954, another law, 68 Stat. 1245, clarified what was implicit in those laws: that the Chief Judgeship was not a mere renaming of the position but a change in its status that made it the same as the Chief Judge of other inferior courts.\\r\\nChief judges have administrative responsibilities with respect to their circuits, and preside over any panel on which they serve unless the circuit justice (i.e., the Supreme Court justice responsible for the circuit) is also on the panel. Unlike the Supreme Court, where one justice is specifically nominated to be chief, the office of chief judge rotates among the circuit judges. To be chief, a judge must have been in active service on the court for at least one year, be under the age of 65, and have not previously served as chief judge. A vacancy is filled by the judge highest in seniority among the group of qualified judges. The chief judge serves for a term of seven years or until age 70, whichever occurs first. The age restrictions are waived if no members of the court would otherwise be qualified for the position.\\r\\nWhen the office was created in 1948, the chief judge was the longest-serving judge who had not elected to retire on what has since 1958 been known as senior status or declined to serve as chief judge. After August 6, 1959, judges could not become or remain chief after turning 70 years old. The current rules have been in operation since October 1, 1982.\\r\\nThe court has eleven seats for active judges after the elimination of seat seven under the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. The seat that was originally the Chief Justiceship is numbered as Seat 1; the other seats are numbered in order of their creation. If seats were established simultaneously, they are numbered in the order in which they were filled. Judges who retire into senior status remain on the bench but leave their seat vacant. That seat is filled by the next circuit judge appointed by the President.","input":"What is the most important court in the us?"},{"output":"Pac-Man","context":"The golden age of arcade video games was the era of greatest popularity and technological innovation for arcade video games. The exact time period is disputed, but key moments include the release of Space Invaders in 1978 and the introduction of vector display technology in 1979. The golden age lasted until the 1980s, when home video game consoles like the NES were introduced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the exact years differ, all timelines overlap in the early 1980s. Technology journalist Jason Whittaker, in The Cyberspace Handbook, places the beginning of the golden age in 1978, with the release of Space Invaders.[1] Video game journalist Steven L. Kent, in his book The Ultimate History of Video Games, places it at 1979 to 1983.[2] The book pointed out that 1979 was the year that Space Invaders[3] ÿ which he credits for ushering in the golden age[4] ÿ was gaining considerable popularity in the United States,[3] and the year that saw the advent of vector display technology which in turn spawned many of the popular early arcade games. However, 1983 was the period that began \\"a fairly steady decline\\" in the coin-operated video game business and when many arcades started disappearing.[2]\\r\\nThe History of Computing Project places the golden age of video games between 1971 and 1983, covering the \\"mainstream appearance of video games as a consumer market\\" and \\"the rise of dedicated hardware systems and the origin of multi-game cartridge based systems\\".[5] 1971 was chosen as an earlier start date by the project for two reasons: the creator of Pong filed a pivotal patent regarding video game technology, and it was the release of the first arcade video game machine, Computer Space.[6]\\r\\nSean Newton, 3D arcade model builder and author of the book Bits, Sticks, and Buttons states that the defining transitional point which finally ended the first era of arcade gaming (known as the \\"Black and White Age\\") and subsequently ushered in the Golden Age was with the North American release of Midway's Space Invaders. The game brought forth with it the power of the microprocessor, as well as a cult phenomenon impact which had only been felt up to that point by Atari's Pong. Following Space Invaders, Atari's Asteroids and Namco's Pac-Man further solidified the strength of the Golden Age.[citation needed]\\r\\nOther opinions place this period's beginning in the late 1970s, when color arcade games became more prevalent and video arcades themselves started appearing outside of their traditional bowling alley and bar locales, through to its ending in the mid-1980s.[7] The golden age of arcade games largely coincided with, and partly fueled, the second generation of game consoles and the microcomputer revolution.\\r\\nThe golden age was a time of great technical and design creativity in arcade games. The era saw the rapid spread of video arcades across North America, Europe, and Asia. The number of video game arcades in North America, for example, more than doubled between 1980 and 1982;[8] reaching a peak of 10,000 video game arcades across the region (compared to 4,000 as of 1998).[9] Beginning with Space Invaders, video arcade games also started to appear in supermarkets, restaurants, liquor stores, gas stations and many other retail establishments looking for extra income.[10] Video game arcades at the time became as common as convenience stores, while arcade games like Pac-Man and Space Invaders would appear in most locations across the United States, including even funeral homes.[11] The sales of arcade video game machines increased significantly during this period, from $50?million in 1978 to $900?million in 1981,[8] with 500,000 arcade machines sold in the United States at prices ranging as high as $3000 in 1982 alone.[12] By 1982, there were 24,000 full arcades, 400,000 arcade street locations and 1.5 million arcade machines active in North America.[13] The market was very competitive; the average life span of an arcade game was four to six months. Some games like Robby Roto failed because they were too complex to learn quickly, and others like Star Fire because they were too unfamiliar to the audience. Qix was briefly very popular but, Taito's Keith Egging later said, \\"too mystifying for gamers ... impossible to master and when the novelty wore off, the game faded\\".[14] At around this time, the home video game industry (second-generation video game consoles and early home computer games) emerged as \\"an outgrowth of the widespread success of video arcades\\" at the time.[15]\\r\\nIn 1980, the U.S. arcade video game industry's revenue generated from quarters tripled to $2.8?billion.[16] By 1981, the arcade video game industry in the United States was generating an annual revenue of over $5?billion[1][17] with some estimates as high as $10.5?billion for all video games (arcade and home) in the U.S. that year, which would be three times the amount spent on movie tickets in 1981.[18] The total revenue for the U.S. arcade video game industry in 1981 was estimated at more than $7?billion[19] though some analysts estimated the real amount may have been much higher.[19] By 1982, video games accounted for 87% of the $8.9 billion in commercial games sales in the United States.[20] In 1982, the arcade video game industry's revenue in quarters was estimated at $8?billion[21] surpassing the annual gross revenue of both pop music ($4?billion) and Hollywood films ($3?billion) combined that year.[21][22] It also exceeded the revenues of all major sports combined at the time,[22] earning three times the combined ticket and television revenues of Major League Baseball, basketball, and American football, as well as earning twice as much as all the casinos in Nevada combined.[23] This was also more than twice as much revenue as the $3.8?billion generated by the home video game industry (during the second generation of consoles) that same year;[21] both the arcade and home markets combined added up to a total revenue between $11.8?billion and $12.8?billion for the U.S. video game industry in 1982. In comparison, the U.S. video game industry in 2011 generated total revenues between $16.3 billion and $16.6 billion.[24]\\r\\nPrior to the golden age, pinball machines were more popular than video games. The pinball industry reached a peak of 200,000 machine sales and $2.3 billion revenue in 1979, which had declined to 33,000 machines and $464 million in 1982.[20] In comparison, the best-selling arcade games of the golden age, Space Invaders and Pac-Man, had each sold over 360,000[25] and 400,000[26] cabinets, respectively, with each machine costing between $2000 and $3000 (specifically $2400 in Pac-Man's case).[27] In addition, Space Invaders had grossed $2?billion in quarters by 1982,[22] while Pac-Man had grossed over $1?billion by 1981[28] and $2.5?billion by the late 1990s.[29][30] In 1982, Space Invaders was considered the highest-grossing entertainment product of its time, with comparisons made to the then highest-grossing film Star Wars,[22][31] which had grossed $486?million,[31] while Pac-Man is today considered the highest-grossing arcade game of all time.[32] Many other arcade games during the golden age also had hardware unit sales at least in the tens of thousands, including Ms. Pac-Man with over 115,000 units, Asteroids with 70,000,[11] Donkey Kong with over 60,000,[33] Defender with 55,000,[34] Galaxian with 40,000,[35] Donkey Kong Junior with 35,000,[33] Mr. Do! with 30,000,[36] and Tempest with 29,000 units.[37] A number of arcade games also generated revenues (from quarters) in the hundreds of millions, including Defender with more than $100?million[17] in addition to many more with revenues in the tens of millions, including Dragon's Lair with $48?million and Space Ace with $13?million.[38]\\r\\nThe most successful arcade game companies of this era included Taito (which ushered in the golden age with the shooter game Space Invaders[4] and produced other successful arcade action games such as Gun Fight and Jungle King), Namco (the Japanese company that created Galaxian, Pac-Man, Pole Position and Dig Dug) and Atari (the company that introduced video games into arcades with Computer Space and Pong, and later produced Asteroids). Other companies such as Sega (who later entered the home console market against its former arch rival, Nintendo), Nintendo (whose mascot, Mario, was introduced in 1981's Donkey Kong), Bally Midway Manufacturing Company (which was later purchased by Williams), Cinematronics, Konami, Centuri, Williams and SNK also gained popularity around this era.\\r\\nArcades catering to video games began to gain momentum in the late 1970s with games such as Space Invaders (1978), Asteroids (1979), and Galaxian (1979), and became widespread in 1980 with Pac-Man, Missile Command, Berzerk, Defender, and others. The central processing unit in these games allowed for more complexity than earlier discrete circuitry games such as Atari's Pong (1972). The arcade boom that began in the late 1970s is credited with establishing the basic techniques of interactive entertainment and for driving down hardware prices to the extent of allowing the PC to become a technological and economic reality.[39]\\r\\nWhile color monitors had been used by several racing video games before (such as Indy 800[40] and Speed Race Twin[41]), it was during this period that RGB color graphics became widespread, following the release of Galaxian in 1979.[42] Namco's Rally-X in 1980 featured multi-directional scrolling,[43] and introduced a radar tracking the player position.[44] Sega's Space Tactics that year was a space combat game allowing multi-directional scrolling from a first-person perspective.[45] The following year, Namco's Bosconian allowed the player's ship to freely move across open space that scrolls in all directions.[46] By the early 1980s, scrolling had become popular among arcade video games and would make its way to third-generation consoles, where it would prove nearly as pivotal as the move to 3D graphics on later fifth-generation consoles.[47]\\r\\nThe Golden Age also saw developers experimenting with vector displays, which produced crisp lines that couldn't be duplicated by raster displays. A few of these vector games became great hits, such as 1979's Asteroids, 1980's Battlezone and Tempest and 1983's Star Wars from Atari, as well as 1982's Star Trek from Sega. However, vector technology fell out of favor with arcade game companies due to the high cost of repairing vector displays.\\r\\nSeveral developers at the time were also experimenting with pseudo-3D and stereoscopic 3D using 2D sprites on raster displays. In 1979, Nintendo's Radar Scope introduced a three-dimensional third-person perspective to the shoot 'em up genre, later imitated by shooters such as Konami's Juno First and Activision's Beamrider in 1983.[48] In 1981, Sega's Turbo was the first racing game to feature a third-person rear view format,[49] and use sprite scaling with full-colour graphics.[50] Namco's Pole Position featured an improved rear-view racer format in 1982 that would remain the standard for the genre; the game provided a perspective view of the track, with its vanishing point swaying side to side as the player approaches corners, accurately simulating forward movement into the distance.[51] That same year, Sega released Zaxxon, which introduced the use of isometric graphics and shadows;[52] and SubRoc-3D, which introduced the use of stereoscopic 3D through a special eyepiece;[53]\\r\\nThis period also saw significant advances in digital audio technology. Space Invaders in 1978 was the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple chromatic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, though it was dynamic and changed pace during stages.[54] Rally-X in 1980 was the first game to feature continuous background music,[55] which was generated using a dedicated sound chip, a Namco 3-channel PSG.[44] That same year saw the introduction of speech synthesis, which was first used in Stratovox, released by Sun Electronics in 1980,[55] followed soon after by Namco's King & Balloon, which was an early example of multiple CPUs, using two Z80 microprocessors, the second to drive a DAC for speech.[56] Multi-CPUs were used by several arcade games the following year, including Frogger, which used two Z80 microprocessors and an AY-3-8910 PSG sound chip,[57] and Scramble, which used two Z80 microprocessors and two AY-3-8910 sound chips.[58] In 1983, Gyruss, known for its stereo sound and musical score, utilized multi CPUs, which included two Z80 microprocessors, one 6809 microprocessor, and one 8039 microprocessor, along with five AY-3-8910 sound chips and a DAC for the sound.[59] That same year, the Namco Pole Position system used two Z8002 microprocessors and one Z80 microprocessor, along with a Namco 6-channel stereo PSG sound chip for the sound.[60]\\r\\nDevelopers also experimented with laserdisc players for delivering full motion video based games with movie-quality animation. The first laserdisc video game to exploit this technology was 1983's Astron Belt from Sega,[61][62] soon followed by Dragon's Lair from Cinematronics; the latter was a sensation when it was released (and, in fact, the laserdisc players in many machines broke due to overuse). While laserdisc games were usually either shooter games with full-motion video backdrops like Astron Belt or interactive movies like Dragon's Lair, Data East's 1983 game Bega's Battle introduced a new form of video game storytelling: using brief full-motion video cutscenes to develop a story between the game's shooting stages, which would years later become the standard approach to video game storytelling. By the mid-1980s, the genre dwindled in popularity, as laserdiscs were losing out to the VHS format and the laserdisc games themselves were losing their novelty,[63] due to their linearity and, in many cases, depending less on reflexes than on memorizing sequences of moves.\\r\\nWith the enormous success of the early games, dozens of developers jumped into the development and manufacturing of video arcade games. Some simply copied the \\"invading alien hordes\\" idea of Space Invaders and turned out successful imitators like Namco's Galaxian, Galaga, and Gaplus, though they took the shoot 'em up genre further with new gameplay mechanics, more complex enemy patterns, and richer graphics.[64][65] Galaxian introduced a \\"risk-reward\\" concept,[66] while Galaga was one of the first games with a bonus stage.[67] Sega's 1980 release Space Tactics was an early first-person space combat game with multi-directional scrolling as the player moved the cross-hairs on the screen.[45]\\r\\nOthers tried new concepts and defined new genres. Rapidly evolving hardware allowed new kinds of games which allowed for different styles of gameplay. In 1980, Namco released Pac-Man, which popularized the maze chase genre, and Rally-X, which featured a radar tracking the player position on the map.[44] Games such as the pioneering 1981 games Donkey Kong and Qix in 1981 introduced new types of games where skill and timing are more important than shooting as fast as possible, with Nintendo's Donkey Kong in particular setting the template for the platform game genre.[68] Namco's Bosconian in 1981 introduced a free-roaming style of gameplay where the player's ship freely moves across open space, while also including a radar tracking player & enemy positions.[46] Bega's Battle in 1983 introduced a new form of video game storytelling: using brief full-motion video cutscenes to develop a story between the game's shooting stages.[63] Other examples of innovative games are Atari Games' Paperboy in 1984 where the goal is to successfully deliver newspapers to customers, and Namco's Phozon where the object is to duplicate a shape shown in the middle of the screen. The theme of Exidy's Venture is dungeon exploration and treasure-gathering. One innovative game, Q*Bert, played upon the user's sense of depth perception to deliver a novel experience.\\r\\nSome games of this era were so popular that they entered popular culture. The first to do so was Space Invaders. The game was so popular upon its release in 1978 that an urban legend blamed it for a national shortage of 100 yen coins in Japan, leading to a production increase of coins to meet demand for the game[69][70] (although 100 yen coin production was lower in 1978 and 1979 than in previous or subsequent years,[71][72] and the claim does not withstand logical scrutiny: arcade operators would have emptied out their machines and taken the money to the bank, thus keeping the coins in circulation).[72] It would soon have a similar impact in North America, where it has appeared or is referenced in numerous facets of popular culture. Soon after the release of Space Invaders, hundreds of favourable articles and stories about the emerging video game medium aired on television and were printed in newspapers and magazines. The Space Invaders Tournament held by Atari in 1980 was the first video game competition and attracted more than 10,000 participants, establishing video gaming as a mainstream hobby.[73] By 1980, 86% of the 13ÿ20 population in the United States had played arcade video games,[74] and by 1981, there were more than 35 million gamers visiting video game arcades in the United States.[75]\\r\\nThe game that most affected popular culture in North America was Pac-Man. Its release in 1980 caused such a sensation that it initiated what is now referred to as \\"Pac-Mania\\" (which later became the title of the last coin-operated game in the series, released in 1987). Released by Namco, the game featured a yellow, circle-shaped creature trying to eat dots through a maze while avoiding pursuing enemies. Though no one could agree what the \\"hero\\" or enemies represented (they were variously referred to as ghosts, goblins or monsters), the game was extremely popular. The game spawned an animated television series, numerous clones, Pac-Man-branded foods, toys, and a hit pop song, \\"Pac-Man Fever\\". The game's popularity was such that President Ronald Reagan congratulated a player for setting a record score in Pac-Man.[76] Pac-Man was also responsible for expanding the arcade game market to involve large numbers of female audiences across all age groups.[77] Though many popular games quickly entered the lexicon of popular culture, most have since left, and Pac-Man is unusual in remaining a recognized term in popular culture, along with Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Mario and Frogger.\\r\\nArcade games at the time affected on the music industry, revenues for which had declined by $400?million between 1978 and 1981 (from $4.1 billion to $3.7 billion), a decrease that was directly credited to the rise of arcade games at the time.[78] Successful songs based on video games also began appearing. The pioneering electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) sampled Space Invaders sounds in their 1978 self-titled album and the hit single \\"Computer Game\\" from the same album,[79] the latter selling over 400,000 copies in the United States.[80] In turn, YMO would have a major influence on much of the video game music produced during the 8-bit and 16-bit eras.[81] Other pop songs based on Space Invaders soon followed, including \\"Disco Space Invaders\\" (1979) by Funny Stuff,[79] \\"Space Invaders\\" (1980) by Playback,[82] and the hit songs \\"Space Invader\\" (1980) by The Pretenders[79] and \\"Space Invaders\\" (1980) by Uncle Vic.[83] The game was also the basis for Player One's \\"Space Invaders\\" (1979), which in turn provided the bassline for Jesse Saunders' \\"On and On\\" (1984),[84][85] the first Chicago house music track.[86] The song \\"Pac-Man Fever\\" reached No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over a?million singles in 1982,[87] while the album Pac-Man Fever sold over a?million records, with both receiving Gold certifications.[88] That same year, R. Cade and the Video Victims also produced an arcade-inspired album, Get Victimized, featuring songs such as \\"Donkey Kong\\".[89] In 1984, former YMO member Haruomi Hosono produced an album entirely from Namco arcade game samples entitled Video Game Music, an early example of a chiptune record[90] and the first video game music album.[91] Arcade game sounds also had a strong influence on the hip hop,[92] pop music (particularly synthpop)[93] and electro music genres during the early 1980s.[94] The booming success of video games at the time led to music magazine Billboard listing the 15 top-selling video games alongside their record charts by 1982.[15] More than a decade later, the first electroclash record, I-F's \\"Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass\\" (1997), has been described as \\"burbling electro in a vocodered homage to Atari-era hi-jinks\\",[95] particularly Space Invaders which it was named after.[96]\\r\\nArcade games also influenced the film industry; beginning with Space Invaders, arcade games began appearing at many movie theaters,[11] while early films based on video games were also produced, most notably Tron, which grossed over $33?million in 1982[97] which began the Tron franchise which included a video game adaptation that grossed more than the film.[98] Other films based on video games included the 1983 films WarGames (where Matthew Broderick plays Galaga at an arcade),[99] Nightmares, and Joysticks, the 1984 film The Last Starfighter, and the anime Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen! in 1986. Arcades also appeared in many other films at the time, such as Dawn of the Dead (where they play Gun Fight and F-1) in 1978,[100] Used Cars and Midnight Madness in 1980, Take This Job and Shove It and Puberty Blues in 1981, the 1982 releases Rocky III, Fast Times At Ridgemont High, Koyaanisqatsi and The Toy, the 1983 releases Psycho II, Spring Break and Never Say Never Again, the 1984 releases Footloose, The Karate Kid (where Elisabeth Shue plays Pac-Man), The Terminator and The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, the 1985 releases Back to the Future, The Goonies and The Boys Next Door[101] and Ferris Bueller's Day Off[99] and Something Wild in 1986.[101]\\r\\nIn more recent years, there have been critically acclaimed films based on the golden age of arcade games, such as The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters and Chasing Ghosts: Beyond the Arcade in 2007. Since 2010, many arcade-related films have been released including Wreck It Ralph (2012) and Pixels (2015 film) (2015). Steven Spielberg is slated to direct Ready Player One another arcade-themed film based upon the novel by Ernest Cline.\\r\\nThe period saw the emergence of a gaming media, publications dedicated to video games, in the form of video game journalism and strategy guides.[22] The enormous popularity of video arcade games led to the very first video game strategy guides;[102] these guides (rare to find today) discussed in detail the patterns and strategies of each game, including variations, to a degree that few guides seen since can match. \\"Turning the machine over\\"making the score counter overflow and reset to zerowas often the final challenge of a game for those who mastered it, and the last obstacle to getting the highest score.\\r\\nSome of these strategy guides sold hundreds of thousands of copies at prices ranging from $1.95 to $3.95 in 1982[102] (equivalent to between $5.00 and $10.00 in 2017).[103] That year, Ken Uston's Mastering Pac-Man sold 750,000 copies, reaching No. 5 on B. Dalton's mass-market bestseller list, while Bantam's How To Master the Video Games sold 600,000 copies, appearing on The New York Times mass-market paperback list.[102] By 1983, 1.7 million copies of Mastering Pac-Man had been printed.[104]\\r\\nThe games below are some of the most popular and/or influential games of the era.[105]\\r\\nFor arcade games, success was usually judged by either the number of arcade hardware units sold to operators, or the amount of revenue generated, from the number of coins (such as quarters or 100 yen coins) inserted into machines,[131] and/or the hardware sales (with arcade hardware prices often ranging from $1000 to $4000). This list only includes arcade games that have sold more than 10,000 hardware units.\\r\\nThe golden age cooled around the mid-1980s as copies of popular games began to saturate the arcades. Arcade video game revenues in the United States had declined from $8 billion in 1981 and $7 billion in 1982 to $5 billion in 1983,[143] reaching a low of $4 billion in 1986.[144] Despite this, arcades would remain commonplace through to the early 1990s as there were still new genres being explored. In 1987, arcades experienced a short resurgence with Double Dragon, which started the golden age of beat 'em up games, a genre that would peak in popularity with Final Fight two years later.[145] In 1988, arcade game revenues in the United States rose back up to $6.4 billion, largely due to the rising popularity of violent action games in the beat 'em up and run and gun shooter genres.[144] After yet another relative decline,[145] U.S. arcade video game revenues had fallen to $2.1 billion by 1991,[146] by which time the sales of arcade machines had declined, with 4000 unit sales being considered a hit at the time.[147]\\r\\nOne of the causes of decline was new generations of personal computers and video game consoles that sapped interest from arcades. In the early 1990s, the Genesis (Mega Drive outside most of North America) and Super NES (the Super Famicom in Japan) greatly improved home play and some of the technology was even integrated into a few video arcade machines.\\r\\nThe Golden Age of Video Arcade Games spawned numerous cultural icons and even gave some companies their identity. Elements from games such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Frogger, and Centipede are still recognized in today's popular culture.\\r\\nPac-Man and Dragon's Lair joined Pong for permanent display at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. for their cultural impact in the United States. No other video game has been inducted since.[148]\\r\\nThe success of these early video games has led many hobbyists who were teenagers during the Golden Age to collect some of these classic games. Since few have any commercial value any longer, they can be acquired for US$200 to US$750 (though fully restored games can cost much more).\\r\\nSome fans of these games have companies devoted to restoring the classic games, and others, such as Arcade Renovations, which produces reproduction art for classic arcade games, focus solely on one facet of the restoration activity. Many of these restorers have set up websites full of tips and advice on restoring games to mint condition. There are also several newsgroups devoted to discussion around these games, and a few conventions, such as California Extreme,[149] dedicated to classic arcade gaming.","input":"What is the most popular arcade game of all time?"},{"output":"Burj Khalifa in Dubai","context":"This list of tallest buildings in the world ranks skyscrapers by height. Only buildings with continuously occupiable floors are included, thus non-building structures, including towers, are not included. (See List of tallest buildings and structures.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe international non-profit organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of \\"The World's Tallest Building\\" and sets the standards by which buildings are measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world.[3] The organization currently ranks Burj Khalifa in Dubai as the tallest at 828?m (2,717?ft).[3] The CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete, however, and some buildings listed within these list articles are not considered complete by the CTBUH.\\r\\nIn 1996, as a response to the dispute as to whether the Petronas Towers or the Sears Tower was taller,[4] the council listed and ranked buildings in four categories:\\r\\nSpires are considered integral parts of the architectural design of buildings, to which changes would substantially change the appearance and design of the building, whereas antennas may be added or removed without such consequences. The Petronas Towers, with their spires, are thus ranked higher than the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) with its antennas, despite the Petronas Towers' lower roofs and lower highest point.\\r\\nUntil 1996, the world's tallest building was defined by the height to the top of the tallest architectural element, including spires but not antennae. This led to a rivalry between the Bank of Manhattan Building and the Chrysler Building. The Bank of Manhattan Building employed only a short spire and was 282.5 m (927 ft) tall and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large 38.1 m (125 ft) spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of 318.9 m (1,046 ft), although it had a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires were excluded.\\r\\nUpset by Chrysler's victory, Shreve & Lamb, the consulting architects of the Bank of Manhattan Building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor. They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly 30 m (100 ft) above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and inaccessible.[6]\\r\\nAt present, the Burj Khalifa tops the list by some margin, regardless of which criterion is applied.[7][8]\\r\\nAs of 2017, this list includes all 51 buildings (completed and architecturally topped out) which reach a height of 350 metres (1,148?ft) or more, as assessed by their highest architectural feature. Six of the last seven buildings to have held the record as 'tallest building' are still found in the list, with the exception being the North Tower of the original World Trade Center after its destruction in the September 11 attacks of 2001. If the twin towers were still standing today they would occupy numbers 24 and 25 on the list (or 23 and 24 since it can be assumed One World Trade Center would have never been built).\\r\\nBurj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, is the world's tallest building.\\r\\nShanghai Tower in Shanghai, China, is the 2nd tallest building.\\r\\nThe Abraj Al-Bait Towers in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, is the 3rd tallest building.\\r\\nPing An Finance Centre, in Guangdong, China, is the 4th tallest building.\\r\\nLotte World Tower in Seoul, South Korea, is the 5th tallest building.\\r\\nOne World Trade Center in New York City, is the 6th tallest building and the tallest in the Western Hemisphere.\\r\\nCTF Finance Centre in Guangzhou, China, is the 7th tallest building.\\r\\nTaipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan, was the world's tallest building from 2004 to 2010; it is now 8th.\\r\\nThe Shanghai World Financial Center is the 9th tallest building and the 3rd tallest in China.\\r\\nThe International Commerce Centre in Hong Kong, is currently the 10th tallest building.\\r\\nThe Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, were the tallest buildings from 1998 to 2004, and are still the tallest twin buildings.\\r\\nWillis Tower, formerly Sears Tower, in Chicago, United States, was the tallest building from 1974 to 1998.\\r\\nNew York City's Empire State Building was the tallest building from 1931 to 1972, and is the 5th tallest building in the United States.\\r\\nJin Mao Tower in Shanghai, China is the 10th tallest building in China.\\r\\nThis measurement disregards distinctions between architectural and non-architectural extensions, and simply measures to the highest point. This measurement is useful for air traffic obstacle determinations, and is also a wholly objective measure. However, this measurement includes extensions that are easily added, removed, and modified from a building and are independent of the overall structure.\\r\\nThis measurement only recently came into use, when the Petronas Towers passed the Sears Tower (now called Willis Tower) in height. The former was considered taller because its spires were considered architectural, while the latter's antennae were not. This led to the split of definitions, with the Sears Tower claiming the lead in this and the height-to-roof (now highest occupied floor) categories, and with the Petronas claiming the lead in the architectural height category.\\r\\nThis is a list of buildings taller than 350 metres that are currently under construction. More than half of the buildings are located in China.\\r\\nThe following list shows the tallest completed buildings located in each continent listed by greatest to least height:","input":"What is the talkest building in the world?"},{"output":"450 to 340 Mya","context":"The Lachlan Fold Belt (LFB) or Lachlan Orogen is a geological subdivision of the east part of Australia.  It is a zone of folded and faulted rocks of similar age. It dominates New South Wales and Victoria, also extending into Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland.  It was formed in the Middle Paleozoic from 450 to 340 Mya.  It was earlier known as Lachlan Geosyncline.  It covers an area of 200,000?km2.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the west is the Delamerian Orogen from the early Palaeozoic (550 to 470 Mya). On the east side is found the Narooma Accretionary Complex (or Narooma Terrane) from 445 Mya, and the New England Orogen from late Palaeozoic to early Mesozoic (310 - 210 Mya).  These boundary orogens along with the Lachlan Orogen make up the Tasman Orogenic System In Australia, which along with the extension into the neighbouring parts of Gondwana make up the Tasmanides.  North of the Lachlan Fold belt is the Thomson Orogen in the north east and centre of Queensland.  Sometimes the Lachlan Orogen is included with the Thomson Orogen and known as the 'Lachlan-Thomson Orogen'.  The Great Artesian Basin has been laid down over the top of the LFB in northwestern New South Wales and western Queensland and the Murray-Darling Basin covers the southwest of New South Wales.  The Sydney Basin is on the top of the LFB around Sydney and Wollongong on the east coast of New South Wales.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Victoria the western limit of the LFB is defined by the Stawell-Ararat Fault.  Westwards of this fault is the Moornambool Metamorphic Complex.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orogen is of the accretionary or 'Turkic' type.  It has also been classified as a 'Carpathian' type orogen, i.e. one where subduction rate is greater than that of plate convergence.[2] In such a case the 'hinge', at which subduction starts, tend to move further seawards over time (rollback).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tasman Line outlines the Precambrian margin of eastern Australia.  The Delamerian Orogen follows this line, and the western side of the Lachlan Orogen also follows this curve.  The central and east parts of the Orogen are aligned in a northÿsouth direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the present time the fold belt is about 1000?km wide.  However the original width was 2000 to 3000?km wide, with the excess size absorbed by folding and thrusting.\\r\\n\\r\\nRock beds are folded in chevron folds.  They are cut by thin skinned thrusts.  Other faults separate the different terranes making up the orogen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the concept of plate tectonics was accepted, the LFB was described as the Lachlan Geosyncline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of terranes has been applied to the LFB with the term Lachlan Superterrane being used for the Lachlan Mudpile.  Geomagnetic poles cannot be reliably determined for Devonian or older rocks thanks to the folding.  In Victoria van den Berg used the terms Whitelaw Terrane for the Western Lachlan, and Benambra Terrane for the Central and Eastern Lachlan.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther terrane subdivision have included Melbourne, Stawell, Howqua, Girilambone Terranes, as well as Cowra, Tumut and Hill End Troughs; and Parkes and Molong Zones; and the Wagga Omeo Belt.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the LFB was greatly affected by the Late\\r\\nOrdovician to Early Silurian Benambran Orogeny\\r\\n(also led to the formation of the Wagga-Omeo Zone).\\r\\nThe Middle Devonian Tabberabberan Orogeny\\r\\naffected the entire LFB and terminated the precratonic\\r\\nstage of its development.\\r\\nThe Carboniferous Kanimblan Orogeny was the\\r\\nterminal event and converted the LFB into a\\r\\nneocraton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two high temperature low pressure regions of metamorphism.  The Wagga Omeo Metamorphic Belt is a large region in the Central Lachlan between the Kancoona-Kiera Shear Zone and the Gilmore Shear Zone.  Other metamorphic complexes are Kuark, Camblong, Cooma, and Jerangle in the eastern side.  These zones made up the Eastern Metamorphic Belt, named by Vallance in 1969.  In these high temperature belts, the temperature peaked at 700C and the pressure was 350 MPa, with a thermal gradient of 65 /km.  This same high temperature regime produced migmatite and S-type granite from the Ordovician sediments.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlueschist formed by intermediate to high pressure metamorphism is found in melange at Port Sorell and the Arthur Lineament in Tasmania, and Howqua Melange and Heathcote Melange in Victoria.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSlate has been formed in other parts of the fold belt indicating intermediate pressure and low temperature.\\r\\n\\r\\nGranite plutons have formed in many parts of the LFB where there has been significant heating.  They were formed at the time of extension, when hot asthenosphere rose towards the surface.  Granites cover 61000?km2.  There are 875 lithological units of granite.\\r\\nThere are 100 volcanic units derived from the same magma as the granites.\\r\\n[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basement of the belt is Cambrian oceanic crust which was formed in a back arc basin or a fore arc basin. An ancient shoreline of Australia, called the cratonic margin existed off the east coast of the Delamerian Orogen in western New South Wales, Western Victoria and Western Tasmania. In the early Ordovician there was a shallow marine shelf called the Gnalta Shelf, over the top of the Koonenberry Belt near Broken Hill. At the same time there were marine conditions in Amadeus Basin where Horn Valley Siltstone was formed, and Georgina Basin where the Coolibah Formation deposited. The Larapintine Sea formed a shallow marine connection through central Australia to the Canning Basin in Western Australia. Sediments formed on the continental shelf of the continent from this time appear in western Tasmania and north west New South Wales. A subduction zone consumed the Pacific crust below the Delamerian coast, but this subduction moved 1000?km oceanwards. An island arc was formed on the northern end of the 900?km long trench. This was the Macquarie Volcanic Arc.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the continent and the island arc or trench, deep water sediments in the form of turbidites appeared in the Central Lachlan Orogen. These were derived from the western Delamerian Orogen and from the south west Ross Orogen, which is now left behind in Antarctica. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ordovician volcanoes of the arc are now found around Parkes, Wellington, Molong and east of Condobolin, Cowra and Boorowa. The east Lachlan Orogen containing Adaminaby Group Turbidites is now to the east and south of the Macquarie Arc. All its boundaries with the Macquarie Arc are faults, indicating that this is a separate terrane, also known as the Adaminaby Superterrane. In the Late Ordovician the turbidites were overlaid by a black shale. The back arc region was extended at this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 447?to?443 million years ago in the Bolindian to Llandovery, the arc collided with the back arc, ending the Benambran Cycle. The turbidites were deformed, biotite formed, and the arc was thrust over or under the turbidites.[citation needed][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Middle Llandovery, the Pacific plate boundary moved a few hundred km to the east. A new subduction zone dipping westwards lasted from the end of the Silurian into the Late Devonian. The whole of the Lachlan Fold Belt became a back arc area with a new volcanic arc formed to the east in what is now the New England Orogen. Extension stretched the LFB forming rifts, and shelves, along with intrusion of granites and volcanism. This was the Tabberabberan Orogeny. \\r\\n\\r\\nDeformation happened in the west 450 to 395 Mya and in the east 400 to 380 Mya. Extensional basins occur in the central and east parts of the fold belt. Oceanic subduction (or underthrusting) is evidenced for the western and central parts by slivers of ophiolite and blueschist metamorphism. These are known as Coolac serpentinite, and Honeysuckle Beds east of Tumut; The Kiandra Beds north of Batlow and the Tumut Pond Serpentinite Belt on the west side of Talbingo Dam.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Narooma Terrane migrated 2500?km westwards on the moving Pacific plate and became attached to the Adaminaby Superterrane in Silurian times. Conodont fossils in the Narooma Chert prove the age of the terrane to be from late Cambrian to middle Ordovician. The Narooma Terrane exposure is between Narooma and Eurobodalla and also between Burewarra Point and Durras around Batemans Bay on the south coast of New South Wales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe western parts under New South Wales and Queensland are mostly heavily weathered and or covered in younger sediments of the Great Artesian Basin or Great Australian Basin and Murray-Darling Basin. The underlying structure can still be explored through magnetic, gravity and seismic geophysical measurements.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 84?million years ago The Tasman Sea started to form by seafloor spreading. This split off a segment of the coast to form the Lord Howe Rise, part of Zealandia. Around then, Bass Strait was extended moving Tasmania away from the rest of Australian Mainland.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurbidites from submarine fans, trench complexes, volcanic arcs, oceanic crust and micro continents dominate lithological components. The individual rock types are mostly sandstone and shale interbedded, with chert, and metavolcanics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree broad subdivisions of Lachlan Fold Belt are Western, Central and Eastern. The Western Lachlan, which lies in Victoria includes the Stawell and Melbourne Zones.  The eastern boundary of the Western Lachlan is the Mount WellingtonMount Useful Fault Zone (east of Melbourne).  The Central Lachlan includes the Tabberabbera Zone and the Wagga-Omeo Metamorphic Belt.  The Eastern Lachlan extends to the east of the Gilmore Fault Zone, a shear zone on the edge of the WOMB.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Macquarie Volcanic Arc formed about 1000?km off the coast.  The Yarrimbah Formation is exposed west of Parkes.  It consists of siliceous siltstones, formed in deep water.  It is the most western part of the Arc.  The RockleyÿGulgong Volcanic Belt.  Budhang Chert Member is found  near Oberon.  The Molong Volcanic Belt lies between Cowra and Boorowa.  The Adaminaby Group, from another terrane, was thrust northwards over the top of the Molong Volcanic Belt. The Kenyu Formation is from Late Ordovician and contains conglomerate. The Wagga Belt rocks are thrust eastwards over the top of the Junee-Narromine Volcanic Belt of the Macquarie arc.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe upper crust contains chevron folded turbidites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lower crust contains duplexed oceanic lithosphere, and magmatic underplating.\\r\\n\\r\\nStructures in the Eastern thrust belt are oriented north-south.  It has thick skinned deformation in the west and thin skinned in the east.","input":"When were the units of the lachlan fold belt formed?"},{"output":"Fort Caroline","context":"The city of Jacksonville, Florida began to grow in the late 18th century as Cow Ford, settled by British colonists. Its major development occurred in the late nineteenth century, when it became a winter vacation destination for tourists from the North and Midwest. Its development was halted or slowed by the Great Fire of 1901, the Florida Land Bust of the 1920s, and the economic woes of the 1960s and 70s. Since the late 20th century, the city has experienced steady growth, with a new federal building constructed in downtown in 2003.\\r\\nSince 1940, Jacksonville has also been a major port for the United States Navy. The city is a thriving metropolis with over a million citizens. Due to its consolidated city-county government structure, it has the largest municipal population among Florida cities, as well as the largest land area of any city in the contiguous United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaeological evidence indicates 6,000 years of human habitation in the area. Pottery has been found dating to 2500 BC, nearly the oldest in the United States and second to artifacts of the Savannah River area. In the 16th century, the beginning of the historical record period, the area was inhabited by the Mocama, a coastal subgroup of the Timucua indigenous Native Americans. At the time of contact with Europeans, most Mocama villages in present-day Jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom known as the Saturiwa, centered on Fort George Island near the mouth of the St. Johns River.[1] They had a complex society, well-adapted to the environmental conditions of the area.\\r\\nIn 1513, Spanish explorers landed in Florida and claimed their discovery for Spain (see Spanish Florida). The first Europeans to visit the area were Spanish missionaries and explorers from this period. In February 1562, French naval officer Jean Ribault and a 150 settlers arrived seeking land for a safe haven for the French Huguenots, Protestants suffering religious persecution in France. Ribault explored the mouth of the St. Johns River before moving north and establishing the colony of Charlesfort on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina. Ribault returned to France for supplies, but tensions from French Wars of Religion had broken out during his absence. His return to Florida was delayed as a result. Without leadership or provisions, the colonists abandoned Charlesfort. In 1564 Ribault's former lieutenant, Ren Goulaine de Laudonnire, launched a new expedition to found a colony on the St. Johns River. On June 22, 1564, the settlers established Fort Caroline atop the St. Johns Bluff.\\r\\nLaudonnire made an alliance with the local tribe of Timucua Indians, the Saturiwa. He also forged friendly relations with their competitors, the Utina tribe, who lived upriver to the south (around what is now Palatka and the Lake George area). Ribault intended to resupply Fort Caroline in early 1565, but was again delayed. As a result, the colony faced famine, three mutinies, and eventually warfare with the Utina. Ribault finally reached the fort with a relief expedition in the summer, and assumed command of the settlement. In the meantime, the Spanish admiral Pedro Menndez de Avils had established the colony of St. Augustine 35 miles to the south, with the express mission to displace the French.\\r\\nWhen he arrived, Ribault launched a naval expedition of 200 sailors and 400 soldiers to dislodge the Spanish, but a storm at sea incapacitated them for several days and caused numerous deaths. On September 20, 1565, Menndez marched his men overland to Fort Caroline, defended by 200 or 250 people, and killed everyone except for 50 women and children and 26 men who escaped. The Spanish picked up the survivors of Ribault's fleet, and summarily executed all but 20.\\r\\nThe Spanish took over Fort Caroline, renaming it as San Matteo. In 1568 the French and Spanish confronted each other again here, when Dominique de Gourgues burned it to the ground. The Spanish rebuilt the fort, but abandoned it in 1569. The Spanish next built Fort San Nicolas further upriver to protect the rear flank of St. Augustine. \\"San Nicolas\\" served as their name for the Jacksonville area, a placename which survives in the neighborhood of St. Nicholas. The fort was located on the east side of the St. Johns, where Bishop Kenny High School now stands. The fort was abandoned in the late 17th century.\\r\\nFrance and Spain were defeated by the British in the French and Indian War. During the war the British had defeated the Spanish in Cuba and occupied the island, whereas Florida had hardly seen any fighting. As part of the negotiations between the two nations in the aftermath of the war, Spain would cede Florida to Great Britain in exchange for the return of Cuba. The British agreed and Florida was ceded to the United Kingdom in 1763. The British soon constructed the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British named the \\"Cow Ford\\", both names ostensibly reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river there.[2][3][4] The British divided Florida into the two colonies of British East Florida and British West Florida.[5]\\r\\nThe British government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the French and Indian War in order to encourage settlement. In order to induce settlers to move to the two new colonies reports of Florida's natural wealth were published in England. A large number of British colonists who were \\"energetic and of good character\\" moved to Florida, mostly coming from South Carolina, Georgia and England though there was also a group of settlers who came from the colony of Bermuda. This would be the first permanent English-speaking population in what is now Duval County, Baker County, St. Johns County and Nassau County. The British built good public roads and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result of these initiatives northeastern Florida prospered economically in a way it never did under Spanish rule. Furthermore, the British governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the Floridas and in the meantime they were, with the advice of councils, to establish courts. This would be the first introduction of much of the English-derived legal system which Florida still has today including trial-by-jury, habeas corpus and county-based government.[6][7]\\r\\nThe British gave control of the territory back to Spain in 1783. Americans of English descent and Americans of Scots-Irish descent began moving into northern Florida from the backwoods of Georgia and South Carolina. Though technically not allowed by the Spanish authorities, the Spanish were never able to effectively police the border region and the backwoods settlers from the United States would continue to migrate into Florida unchecked. These migrants, mixing with the already present English-speaking settlers who had lived in Florida since the British period, would be the progenitors of the population known as Florida Crackers.[8] The Spanish also accepted slaves from the newly created United States if they converted to Catholicism.\\r\\nBetween 1812 and 1814 during the War of 1812 between the US and Britain, the US Navy assisted American settlers in Florida in \\"The Patriot War\\", a covert attempt to seize control of Florida from the Spanish. They began with invasions of Fernandina and Amelia Island.[9] Spain sold the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821 and, by 1822, Jacksonville's current name had come into use, to honor General Andrew Jackson. It first appears on a petition sent on June 15, 1822 to U.S. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, asking that Jacksonville be named a port of entry. The city is named for Andrew Jackson, military governor of the Florida Territory and eventual President of the United States. U.S. settlers led by Isaiah D. Hart wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832. Remembered as the city's most important founding father, Hart is memorialized with the Isaiah D. Hart Bridge over the St. Johns.\\r\\nDuring the American Civil War, Jacksonville was a key supply point for hogs and cattle leaving Florida and aiding the Confederate cause. Throughout most of the war, the US Navy maintained a blockade around Florida's ports, including Jacksonville. In October 1862 Union forces captured a Confederate battery in the Battle of St. Johns Bluff and occupied Jacksonville. Throughout the war Jacksonville would change hands several times, though never with a battle. On February 20, 1864, Union soldiers from Jacksonville marched inland and confronted the Confederate Army at the Battle of Olustee.[10][11]\\r\\nThe battle was a devastating loss for the Union and a decisive victory for the Confederacy.[12] Soldiers on both sides were veterans of the great battles in the eastern and western theaters of war, but many of them remarked in letters and diaries that they had never experienced such terrible fighting.[11] The Confederate dead were buried at Oaklawn Cemetery in nearby Lake City.[13] The Union losses caused Northern authorities to question the necessity of further Union involvement in the militarily insignificant region of northern Florida. On the morning of 22 February, as the Union forces were still retreating to Jacksonville, the 54th Massachusetts was ordered to counter-march back to Ten-Mile Station. The locomotive of a train carrying wounded Union soldiers had broken down and the wounded were in danger of capture. When the 54th Massachusetts arrived, the men attached ropes to the engine and cars and manually pulled the train approximately three miles to Camp Finnegan, where horses were secured to help pull the train. After that, the train was pulled by both men and horses to Jacksonville for a total distance of ten miles. It took forty-two hours to pull the train that distance.[14][15]\\r\\nThe US Transport Maple Leaf was sunk at Jacksonville, April 1, 1864.[16] The U.S. Transport General Hunter was sunk in the St. John's River, April 16, 1864, close to where the Maple Leaf was sunk.[17]\\r\\nBy the end of the war in 1865, a Union commander commented that Jacksonville had become \\"pathetically dilapidated, a mere skeleton of its former self, a victim of war.\\"\\r\\nFollowing the Civil War, during Reconstruction and afterward, Jacksonville and nearby St. Augustine became popular winter resorts for the rich and famous of the Gilded Age. Visitors arrived by steamboat and (beginning in the 1880s) by railroad, and wintered at dozens of hotels and boarding houses. The 1888 Subtropical Exposition was held in Jacksonville and attended by President Grover Cleveland, but the Florida-style world's fair did not lead to a lasting boost for tourism in Jacksonville. The area declined in importance as a resort destination after Henry Flagler extended the Florida East Coast Railroad to the south, reaching Palm Beach in 1894 and the Miami area in 1896. This drew tourism to the southern Atlantic Coast.\\r\\nJacksonville's prominence as a winter resort was dealt another blow by major yellow fever epidemics in 1886 and 1888. During the second one, nearly ten percent of the more than 4,000 victims died, including the city's mayor.[18] In the absence of scientific knowledge concerning the cause of yellow fever, nearly half of the city's panicked residents fled despite the imposition of quarantines. Inbound and outbound mail was fumigated in an effort to reduce contagion. Jacksonville's reputation as a healthful tourist destination suffered.\\r\\nDuring the SpanishÿAmerican War, gunrunners helping the Cuban rebels used Jacksonville as the center for smuggling illegal arms and supplies to the island. Duval County sheriff and future state governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, was one of the many gunrunners operating out of the city. Author Stephen Crane travelled to Jacksonville to cover the war.\\r\\nOn May 3, 1901, downtown Jacksonville was ravaged by the Great Firethe largest-ever urban fire in the Southeastern United States, which started when hot ash from a shantyhouse's chimney landed on the drying moss at Cleaveland's Fiber Factory. At half past noon most of the Cleaveland workers were at lunch, but by the time they returned the entire city block was engulfed in flames. The fire destroyed the business district and rendered 10,000 residents homeless in the course of eight hours. Florida Governor William S. Jennings declared a state of martial law in Jacksonville and dispatched several state militia units to help. Reconstruction started immediately, and the city was returned to civil authority on May 17. Despite the widespread damage, only seven deaths were reported.\\r\\nYoung architect Henry John Klutho had just returned to New York from a year in Europe when he read about the Jacksonville fire and, seeing a rare opportunity, he headed south. Klutho and other architects, enamored by the \\"Prairie Style\\" of architecture then being popularized by architect Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago and other Midwestern cities, designed exuberant local buildings with a Florida flair. While many of Klutho's buildings were demolished by the 1980s, a number of his creations remain, including the St. James Building from 1911 (a former department store that is now Jacksonville's City Hall) and the Morocco Temple from 1910. The Klutho Apartments, in Springfield, were recently restored and converted into office space by local charity Fresh Ministries. Despite the losses of the last several decades, Jacksonville still has one of the largest collections of Prairie Style buildings (particularly residences) outside the Midwest.\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, before Hollywood, the motion picture industry was based in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In need of a winter headquarters, moviemakers were attracted to Jacksonville due to its warm climate, exotic locations, excellent rail access, and cheaper labor, earning the city the title of \\"The Winter Film Capital of the World.\\" New York-based Kalem Studios was the first to open a permanent studio in Jacksonville in 1908. Over the course of the next decade, more than 30 silent film companies established studios in town, including Metro Pictures (later MGM), Edison Studios, Majestic Films, King Bee Film Company, Vim Comedy Company, Norman Studios, Gaumont Studios and the Lubin Manufacturing Company. Comedic actor and Georgia native Oliver \\"Babe\\" Hardy began his motion picture career here in 1914. He starred in over 36 short silent films his first year acting. With the closing of Lubin in early 1915, Oliver moved to New York then New Jersey to find film jobs. Acquiring a job with the Vim Company in early 1915, he returned to Jacksonville in the spring of 1917 before relocating to Los Angeles in October 1917. The first motion picture made in Technicolor and the first feature-length color movie produced in the United States, The Gulf Between, was also filmed on location in Jacksonville in 1917.\\r\\nJacksonville was especially important to the African American film industry. One notable individual in this regard is the European American producer Richard Norman, who created a string of films starring black actors in the vein of Oscar Micheaux and the Lincoln Motion Picture Company. In contrast to the degrading parts offered in certain white films such as The Birth of a Nation, Norman and his contemporaries sought to create positive stories featuring African Americans in what he termed \\"splendidly assuming different roles.\\"\\r\\nJacksonville's mostly conservative residents, however, objected to the hallmarks of the early movie industry, such as car chases in the streets, simulated bank robberies and fire alarms in public places, and even the occasional riot. In 1917, conservative Democrat John W. Martin was elected mayor on the platform of taming the city's movie industry. By that time, southern California was emerging as the major movie production center, thanks in large part to the move of film pioneers like William Selig and D.W. Griffith to the area. These factors quickly sealed the demise of Jacksonville as a major film destination.\\r\\nThe 1920s brought significant real estate development and speculation to the city during the great Florida land boom (and bust). Hordes of train passengers passed through Jacksonville on their way south to the new tourist destinations of South Florida, as most of the passenger trains arriving from the population centers of the North were routed through Jacksonville.\\r\\nThe Riverside Theater, which opened in 1927,[19] was the first theater in Florida to show talking pictures.[20][21]\\r\\nCompletion of the Dixie Highway (portions of which became U.S. 1) in the 1920s began to draw significant automobile traffic as well. An important entry point to the state since the 1870s, Jacksonville now justifiably billed itself as the \\"Gateway to Florida.\\"\\r\\nA significant part of Jacksonville's growth in the 20th century came from the presence of navy bases in the region. October 15, 1940, Naval Air Station Jacksonville (\\"NAS Jax\\") on the westside became the first navy installation in the city. This base was a major training center during World War II, with over 20,000 pilots and aircrewmen being trained there. After the war, the Navy's elite Blue Angels were established at NAS Jax. Today NAS Jax is the third largest navy installation in the country and employs over 23,000 civilian and active-duty personnel.\\r\\nIn June 1941, land in the westernmost side of Duval County was earmarked for a second naval air facility. This became NAS Cecil Field, which during the Cold War was designated a Master Jet Base, the only one in the South. RF-8 Crusaders out of Cecil Field detected missiles in Cuba, precipitating the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1993, the Navy decided to close NAS Cecil Field, and this was completed in 1999. The land once occupied by this installation is now known as the \\"Cecil Commerce Center\\" and contains one of the campuses of Florida Community College which now offers civil aeronautics classes.\\r\\nDecember 1942 saw the addition of a third naval installation to Jacksonville: Naval Station Mayport at the mouth of the St. Johns River. This port developed through World War II and today is the home port for many types of navy ships, most notably the aircraft carrier USS?John F. Kennedy from 1995 to 26 July 2007, when Big John was towed away, eventually to be mothballed in Philadelphia (see more at http://www.jacksonville.com/usskennedy). NS Mayport current employs about 14,000 personnel.\\r\\nJacksonville is also not far from Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in St. Marys, Georgia, which is home to part of the US Navy's nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) fleet.\\r\\nThe naval base became a key training ground in the 1950s and 1960s and as such, the population of the city rose dramatically. More than half of the residents in Jacksonville had some tie to the naval base, whether it be a relative stationed there, or due to employment opportunities, by 1970, necessitating the opening of an international airport in the area.\\r\\nOn December 29, 1963, a fire[22] gutted the first couple of stories of the Hotel Roosevelt on Adams Street, killing 22 people, setting a record for the highest one-day death toll in Jacksonville history. The hotel was later abandoned, with most businesses inside moving to the nearby Hotel George Washington.\\r\\nOffshore Power Systems (OPS) was a 1970 joint venture between Westinghouse Electric Company, who constructed nuclear generating plants, and Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock, who had recently merged with Tenneco, to create floating nuclear power plants at the Port of Jacksonville.[23][24] Construction of the new facility was projected to cost $200 million and create 10,000 new jobs when completed in 1976.[25] Contracts were signed by Public Service Electric and Gas Company with PSE&G paying for the startup costs for the manufacturing facility.[23] Westinghouse named Zeke Zechella to be president of OPS in 1972.[26]\\r\\nOPS obtained 850+ acres (3.4 km2) on Blount Island from the Jacksonville Port Authority (JPA) for $2,000/acre,[24] then installed infrastructure using over 1,000 workers. A total of $125 million was invested in the property and facility,[24] however; no plants were ever built.[23]\\r\\nBecause of its high visibility and patronage, the Hemming Park and surrounding stores were the site of numerous civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s. Black Sit-ins began on August 13, 1960 when students asked to be served at the segregated lunch counter at Woolworths, Morrison's Cafeteria and other eateries. They were denied service and kicked, spit at and addressed with racial slurs. This came to a head on \\"Ax Handle Saturday\\", August 27, 1960. A group of 200 middle aged and older white men (allegedly some were also members of the Ku Klux Klan) gathered in Hemming Park armed with baseball bats and ax handles. They attacked the protesters conducting sit-ins. The violence spread, and the white mob started attacking all African-Americans in sight. Rumors were rampant on both sides that the unrest was spreading around the county (in reality, the violence stayed in relatively the same location, and did not spill over into the mostly-white, upper-class Cedar Hills neighborhood, for example). A black street gang called the \\"Boomerangs\\" attempted to protect the demonstrators.[27] Police, who had not intervened when the protesters were attacked, now became involved, arresting members of the Boomerangs and other black residents who attempted to stop the beatings.[28][29][30]\\r\\nNat Glover, who worked in Jacksonville law enforcement for 37 years, including eight years as Sheriff of Jacksonville, recalled stumbling into the riot. Glover said he ran to the police, expecting them to arrest the thugs, but was told to leave town or risk being killed.[31]\\r\\nSeveral whites had joined the black protesters on that day. Richard Charles Parker, a 25-year-old student attending Florida State University was among them. White protesters were the object of particular dislike by racists, so when the fracas began, Parker was hustled out of the area for his own protection. The police had been watching him and arrested him as an instigator, charging him with vagrancy, disorderly conduct and inciting a riot. After Parker stated that he was proud to be a member of the NAACP, Judge John Santora sentenced him to 90 days in jail.[32] Jacksonville remained as two cities, one white and one black well into the 1970s and beyond. Throughout this time there remained a \\"Colored Town\\" section that was almost exclusively Black with its own businesses, professional offices, restaurants, theaters and was a near photo-negative reflection of the nearly all-white downtown area. Ghettos and shacks could be seen below the highways into the 1970s and beyond.[33]\\r\\nJacksonville is one of the few cities on the Eastern coast that have been largely spared from the wrath of hurricanes. Despite the damage and destruction that Hurricane Dora caused in Jacksonville, the very next day, September 11, 1964, over 20,000 fans attended a live concert at the Gator Bowl Stadium by the British rock-and-roll band, \\"The Beatles.\\"[citation needed] The winds were blowing so hard that Ringo Starr's drumset had to be nailed down to the stage.[citation needed]\\r\\nDora was the only storm in recorded history to affect Jacksonville with hurricane-force winds, though the city has been affected by weaker storms as well as hurricanes that lost intensity before reaching the area. In September 1999, after Hurricane Floyd struck the Bahamas, over one million Floridians were evacuated from coastal areas, many of them from Jacksonville. Mayor John Delaney announced the mandatory evacuation of the Jacksonville Beaches and other low lying neighborhoods early on September 14; in total, nearly 80,000 Jacksonville residents left their homes. Ultimately the storm turned northward 125 miles off the coast, causing only minor damage in Jacksonville and the southeastern US before making ground in North Carolina. In September 2017, Jacksonville experienced record flooding from Hurricane Irma.\\r\\nThrough the 1960s Jacksonville, like most other large cities in the US, suffered from the effects of urban sprawl. To compensate for the loss of population and tax revenue and end waste and corruption, voters elected to consolidate the government of Jacksonville with the government of Duval County. The move was carried out on October 1, 1968, and Hans Tanzler, elected mayor of Jacksonville the year before, became the first mayor of the consolidated government. Jacksonville became the largest city in Florida and the 13th largest in the United States, and has a greater land area than any other American city outside Alaska. All areas of Duval County are considered part of Jacksonville besides the four independent municipalities of Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and Baldwin, although residents of these towns vote in city elections and are eligible for services provided by Jacksonville.\\r\\nClaude Yates began the \\"quiet revolution\\" with the Yates Manifesto and J. J. Daniel was chairman of the Local Government Study Commission. Lex Hester was Executive Director of the commission and the key architect of Jacksonville's consolidated government, transition coordinator and chief administrative officer following consolidation.[34]","input":"What was the original name of jacksonville florida?"},{"output":"April 3, 1973","context":"The history of mobile phones covers mobile communication devices that connect wirelessly to the public switched telephone network.\\r\\nWhile the transmission of speech by radio has a long history, the first devices that were wireless, mobile, and also capable of connecting to the standard telephone network are much more recent. The first such devices were barely portable compared to today's compact hand-held devices, and their use was clumsy.\\r\\nAlong with the process of developing a more portable technology, and a better interconnections system, drastic changes have taken place in both the networking of wireless communication and the prevalence of its use, with smartphones becoming common globally and a growing proportion of Internet access now done via mobile broadband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the devices existed that are now referred to as mobile phones or cell phones, there were some precursors. In 1908, a Professor Albert Jahnke and the Oakland Transcontinental Aerial Telephone and Power Company claimed to have developed a wireless telephone. They were accused of fraud and the charge was then dropped, but they do not seem to have proceeded with production.[2] Beginning in 1918, the German railroad system tested wireless telephony on military trains between Berlin and Zossen.[3] In 1924, public trials started with telephone connection on trains between Berlin and Hamburg. In 1925, the company Zugtelephonie AG was founded to supply train telephony equipment and, in 1926, telephone service in trains of the Deutsche Reichsbahn and the German mail service on the route between Hamburg and Berlin was approved and offered to first-class travelers.[4]\\r\\nFiction anticipated the development of real world mobile telephones. In 1906, the English caricaturist Lewis Baumer published a cartoon in Punch magazine entitled \\"Forecasts for 1907\\" in which he showed a man and a woman in London's Hyde Park each separately engaged in gambling and dating on wireless telephony equipment.[5] Then, in 1926, the artist Karl Arnold created a visionary cartoon about the use of mobile phones in the street, in the picture \\"wireless telephony\\", published in the German satirical magazine Simplicissimus.[6]\\r\\nThe Second World War made military use of radio telephony links. Hand-held radio transceivers have been available since the 1940s. Mobile telephones for automobiles became available from some telephone companies in the 1940s. Early devices were bulky, consumed high power, and the network supported only a few simultaneous conversations. Modern cellular networks allow automatic and pervasive use of mobile phones for voice and data communications.\\r\\nIn the United States, engineers from Bell Labs began work on a system to allow mobile users to place and receive telephone calls from automobiles, leading to the inauguration of mobile service on 17 June 1946 in St. Louis, Missouri. Shortly after, AT&T offered Mobile Telephone Service. A wide range of mostly incompatible mobile telephone services offered limited coverage area and only a few available channels in urban areas. The introduction of cellular technology, which allowed re-use of frequencies many times in small adjacent areas covered by relatively low powered transmitters, made widespread adoption of mobile telephones economically feasible.\\r\\nIn the USSR, Leonid Kupriyanovich, an engineer from Moscow, in 1957-1961 developed and presented a number of experimental pocket-sized communications radio. The weight of one model, presented in 1961, was only 70 g and could fit on a palm.[7][8] However, in the USSR the decision at first to develop the system of the automobile \\"Altai\\" phone was made.[9]\\r\\nIn 1965, Bulgarian company \\"Radioelektronika\\" presented on the Inforga-65 international exhibition in Moscow the mobile automatic phone combined with a base station. Solutions of this phone were based on a system developed by Leonid Kupriyanovich. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to 15 customers.[10]\\r\\nThe advances in mobile telephony can be traced in successive generations from the early \\"0G\\" services like MTS and its successor Improved Mobile Telephone Service, to first-generation (1G) analog cellular network, second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks, third-generation (3G) broadband data services to the state-of-the-art, fourth-generation (4G) native-IP networks.\\r\\nIn 1949, AT&T commercialized Mobile Telephone Service. From its start in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1946, AT&T introduced Mobile Telephone Service to one hundred towns and highway corridors by 1948. Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5,000 customers placing about 30,000 calls each week. Calls were set up manually by an operator and the user had to depress a button on the handset to talk and release the button to listen. The call subscriber equipment weighed about 80 pounds (36?kg)[11]\\r\\nSubscriber growth and revenue generation were hampered by the constraints of the technology. Because only three radio channels were available, only three customers in any given city could make mobile telephone calls at one time.[12] Mobile Telephone Service was expensive, costing 15 USD per month, plus 0.30 to 0.40 USD per local call, equivalent to about 176 USD per month and 3.50 to 4.75 per call in 2012 USD.[11]\\r\\nIn the UK, there was also a vehicle-based system called \\"Post Office Radiophone Service,\\"[13] which was launched around the city of Manchester in 1959, and although it required callers to speak to an operator, it was possible to be put through to any subscriber in Great Britain. The service was extended to London in 1965 and other major cities in 1972.\\r\\nAT&T introduced the first major improvement to mobile telephony in 1965, giving the improved service the obvious name of Improved Mobile Telephone Service. IMTS used additional radio channels, allowing more simultaneous calls in a given geographic area, introduced customer dialing, eliminating manual call setup by an operator, and reduced the size and weight of the subscriber equipment.[11]\\r\\nDespite the capacity improvement offered by IMTS, demand outstripped capacity. In agreement with state regulatory agencies, AT&T limited the service to just 40,000 customers system wide. In New York City, for example, 2,000 customers shared just 12 radio channels and typically had to wait 30 minutes to place a call.[11]\\r\\nRadio Common Carrier[14] or RCC was a service introduced in the 1960s by independent telephone companies to compete against AT&T's IMTS. RCC systems used paired UHF 454/459?MHz and VHF 152/158?MHz frequencies near those used by IMTS. RCC based services were provided until the 1980s when cellular AMPS systems made RCC equipment obsolete.\\r\\nSome RCC systems were designed to allow customers of adjacent carriers to use their facilities, but equipment used by RCCs did not allow the equivalent of modern \\"roaming\\" because technical standards were not uniform. For example, the phone of an Omaha, Nebraskaÿbased RCC service would not be likely to work in Phoenix, Arizona. Roaming was not encouraged, in part, because there was no centralized industry billing database for RCCs. Signaling formats were not standardized. For example, some systems used two-tone sequential paging to alert a mobile of an incoming call. Other systems used DTMF. Some used Secode 2805, which transmitted an interrupted 2805?Hz tone (similar to IMTS signaling) to alert mobiles of an offered call. Some radio equipment used with RCC systems was half-duplex, push-to-talk LOMO equipment such as Motorola hand-helds or RCA 700-series conventional two-way radios. Other vehicular equipment had telephone handsets and rotary dials or pushbutton pads, and operated full duplex like a conventional wired telephone. A few users had full-duplex briefcase telephones (radically advanced for their day)\\r\\nAt the end of RCC's existence, industry associations were working on a technical standard that would have allowed roaming, and some mobile users had multiple decoders to enable operation with more than one of the common signaling formats (600/1500, 2805, and Reach). Manual operation was often a fallback for RCC roamers.\\r\\nIn 1969 Penn Central Railroad equipped commuter trains along the 360 kilometres (220?mi) New York-Washington route with special pay phones that allowed passengers to place telephone calls while the train was moving. The system re-used six frequencies in the 450?MHz band in nine sites.[12]\\r\\nIn the UK, Channel Islands and elsewhere the \\"Rabbit\\" phone system was briefly used, being a hybrid of \\"cell\\" base stations and handsets. One major limitation was that you had to be less than 300 feet (closer with buildings) from a base due to power limitations on a portable device. [15][better?source?needed] With modern technology a similar variant is being considered for Apple's new 4G \\"smart watch\\" so they can be used in large events in a broadly similar way to a femtocell.\\r\\nIn Europe, several mutually incompatible mobile radio services were developed.\\r\\nIn 1966 Norway had a system called OLT which was manually controlled. Finland's ARP, launched in 1971, was also manual as was the Swedish MTD. All were replaced by the automatic NMT, (Nordic Mobile Telephone) system in the early 1980s.\\r\\nIn July 1971 Readycall was introduced in London by Burndept after obtaining a special concession to break the Post Office monopoly to allow selective calling to mobiles of calls from the public telephone system. This system was available to the public for a subscription of S16 month. A year later the service was extended to two other UK towns.[16]\\r\\nWest Germany had a network called A-Netz launched in 1952 as the country's first public commercial mobile phone network. In 1972 this was displaced by B-Netz which connected calls automatically.\\r\\nIn December 1947, Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young, Bell Labs engineers, proposed hexagonal cells for mobile phones in vehicles.[17] At this stage, the technology to implement these ideas did not exist, nor had the frequencies been allocated. Two decades would pass before Richard H. Frenkiel, Joel S. Engel and Philip T. Porter of Bell Labs expanded the early proposals into a much more detailed system plan. It was Porter who first proposed that the cell towers use the now-familiar directional antennas to reduce interference and increase channel reuse (see picture at right)[18] Porter also invented the dial-then-send method used by all cell phones to reduce wasted channel time.\\r\\nIn all these early examples, a mobile phone had to stay within the coverage area serviced by one base station throughout the phone call, i.e. there was no continuity of service as the phones moved through several cell areas. The concepts of frequency reuse and handoff, as well as a number of other concepts that formed the basis of modern cell phone technology, were described in the late 1960s, in papers by Frenkiel and Porter. In 1970 Amos E. Joel, Jr., a Bell Labs engineer,[19] invented a \\"three-sided trunk circuit\\" to aid in the \\"call handoff\\" process from one cell to another. His patent contained an early description of the Bell Labs cellular concept, but as switching systems became faster, such a circuit became unnecessary and was never implemented in a system.\\r\\nA cellular telephone switching plan was described by Fluhr and Nussbaum in 1973,[20] and a cellular telephone data signaling system was described in hipatitas by Hachenburg et al.[21]\\r\\nThe first fully automated mobile phone system for vehicles was launched in Sweden in 1956. Named MTA (Mobiltelefonisystem A), it allowed calls to be made and received in the car using a rotary dial. The car phone could also be paged. Calls from the car were direct dial, whereas incoming calls required an operator to locate the nearest base station to the car. It was developed by Sture Laurn and other engineers at Televerket network operator. Ericsson provided the switchboard while Svenska Radioaktiebolaget (SRA) and Marconi provided the telephones and base station equipment. MTA phones consisted of vacuum tubes and relays, and weighed 40 kilograms (88?lb). In 1962, an upgraded version called Mobile System B (MTB) was introduced. This was a push-button telephone, and used transistors and DTMF signaling to improve its operational reliability. In 1971 the MTD version was launched, opening for several different brands of equipment and gaining commercial success.[22][23] The network remained open until 1983 and still had 600 customers when it closed.\\r\\nIn 1958 development began on a similar system for motorists in the USSR.[24] The \\"Altay\\" national civil mobile phone service was based on Soviet MRT-1327 standard. The main developers of the Altay system were the Voronezh Science Research Institute of Communications (VNIIS) and the State Specialized Project Institute (GSPI). In 1963 the service started in Moscow, and by 1970 was deployed in 30 cities across the USSR. Versions of the Altay system are still in use today as a trunking system in some parts of Russia.\\r\\nIn 1959 a private telephone company in Brewster, Kansas, USA, the S&T Telephone Company, (still in business today) with the use of Motorola Radio Telephone equipment and a private tower facility, offered to the public mobile telephone services in that local area of NW Kansas. This system was a direct dial up service through their local switchboard, and was installed in many private vehicles including grain combines, trucks, and automobiles. For some as yet unknown reason, the system, after being placed online and operated for a very brief time period, was shut down. The management of the company was immediately changed, and the fully operable system and related equipment was immediately dismantled in early 1960, not to be seen again.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1966, Bulgaria presented the pocket mobile automatic phone RAT-0,5 combined with a base station RATZ-10 (RATC-10) on Interorgtechnika-66 international exhibition. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to six customers (\\"Radio\\" magazine, 2, 1967; \\"Novosti dnya\\" newsreel, 37, 1966).\\r\\nOne of the first successful public commercial mobile phone networks was the ARP network in Finland, launched in 1971. Posthumously, ARP is sometimes viewed as a zero generation (0G) cellular network, being slightly above previous proprietary and limited coverage networks.[citation needed]\\r\\nPrior to 1973, mobile telephony was limited to phones installed in cars and other vehicles.[19] Motorola was the first company to produce a handheld mobile phone. On April 3, 1973, Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher and executive, made the first mobile telephone call from handheld subscriber equipment, placing a call to Dr. Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs, his rival.[25][26][27] The prototype handheld phone used by Dr. Cooper weighed 1.1 kilograms (2.4?lb) and measured 23 by 13 by 4.5 centimetres (9.1 by 5.1 by 1.8?in). The prototype offered a talk time of just 30 minutes and took 10 hours to re-charge.[28]\\r\\nJohn F. Mitchell,[29][30][31] Motorola's chief of portable communication products and Cooper's boss in 1973, played a key role in advancing the development of handheld mobile telephone equipment. Mitchell successfully pushed Motorola to develop wireless communication products that would be small enough to use anywhere and participated in the design of the cellular phone.[32][33]\\r\\nNewer technology has been developed and rolled out in a series of waves or generations. The \\"generation\\" terminology only became widely used when 3G was launched, but is now used retroactively when referring to the earlier systems.\\r\\nFirst automatic analogue cellular systems deployed were NTT's system first used in Tokyo in 1979, later spreading to the whole of Japan, and NMT in the Nordic countries in 1981.\\r\\nThe first analogue cellular system widely deployed in North America was the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS).[34] It was commercially introduced in the Americas in 13 October 1983, Israel in 1986, and Australia in 1987. AMPS was a pioneering technology that helped drive mass market usage of cellular technology, but it had several serious issues by modern standards. It was unencrypted and easily vulnerable to eavesdropping via a scanner; it was susceptible to cell phone \\"cloning\\" and it used a Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) scheme and required significant amounts of wireless spectrum to support.\\r\\nOn 6 March 1983, the DynaTAC 8000X mobile phone launched on the first US 1G network by Ameritech. It cost $100m to develop, and took over a decade to reach the market.[35] The phone had a talk time of just thirty-five minutes and took ten hours to charge. Consumer demand was strong despite the battery life, weight, and low talk time, and waiting lists were in the thousands.[36][37]\\r\\nMany of the iconic early commercial cell phones such as the Motorola DynaTAC Analog AMPS were eventually superseded by Digital AMPS (D-AMPS) in 1990, and AMPS service was shut down by most North American carriers by 2008.\\r\\nIn February 1986 Australia launched its Cellular Telephone System by Telecom Australia. Peter Reedman was the first Telecom Customer to be connected on 6 January 1986 along with five other subscribers as test customers prior to the official launch date of 28 February.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, the 'second generation' mobile phone systems emerged. Two systems competed for supremacy in the global market: the European developed GSM standard and the U.S. developed CDMA standard. These differed from the previous generation by using digital instead of analog transmission, and also fast out-of-band phone-to-network signaling. The rise in mobile phone usage as a result of 2G was explosive and this era also saw the advent of prepaid mobile phones.\\r\\nIn 1991 the first GSM network (Radiolinja) launched in Finland. In general the frequencies used by 2G systems in Europe were higher than those in America, though with some overlap. For example, the 900?MHz frequency range was used for both 1G and 2G systems in Europe, so the 1G systems were rapidly closed down to make space for the 2G systems. In America the IS-54 standard was deployed in the same band as AMPS and displaced some of the existing analog channels.\\r\\nIn 1993, IBM Simon was introduced. This was possibly the world's first smartphone. It was a mobile phone, pager, fax machine, and PDA all rolled into one. It included a calendar, address book, clock, calculator, notepad, email, and a touchscreen with a QWERTY keyboard.[38] The IBM Simon had a stylus you used to tap the touch screen with. It featured predictive typing that would guess the next characters as you tapped. It had applications, or at least a way to deliver more features by plugging a PCMCIA 1.8 MB memory card into the phone.[39] Coinciding with the introduction of 2G systems was a trend away from the larger \\"brick\\" phones toward tiny 100ÿ200 grams (3.5ÿ7.1?oz) hand-held devices. This change was possible not only through technological improvements such as more advanced batteries and more energy-efficient electronics, but also because of the higher density of cell sites to accommodate increasing usage. The latter meant that the average distance transmission from phone to the base station shortened, leading to increased battery life while on the move.\\r\\nThe second generation introduced a new variant of communication called SMS or text messaging. It was initially available only on GSM networks but spread eventually on all digital networks. The first machine-generated SMS message was sent in the UK on 3 December 1992 followed in 1993 by the first person-to-person SMS sent in Finland. The advent of prepaid services in the late 1990s soon made SMS the communication method of choice among the young, a trend which spread across all ages.\\r\\n2G also introduced the ability to access media content on mobile phones. In 1998 the first downloadable content sold to mobile phones was the ring tone, launched by Finland's Radiolinja (now Elisa). Advertising on the mobile phone first appeared in Finland when a free daily SMS news headline service was launched in 2000, sponsored by advertising.\\r\\nMobile payments were trialed in 1998 in Finland and Sweden where a mobile phone was used to pay for a Coca-Cola vending machine and car parking. Commercial launches followed in 1999 in Norway. The first commercial payment system to mimic banks and credit cards was launched in the Philippines in 1999 simultaneously by mobile operators Globe and Smart.\\r\\nThe first full internet service on mobile phones was introduced by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in 1999.\\r\\nAs the use of 2G phones became more widespread and people began to use mobile phones in their daily lives, it became clear that demand for data (such as access to browse the internet) was growing. Further, experience from fixed broadband services showed there would also be an ever-increasing demand for greater data speeds. The 2G technology was nowhere near up to the job, so the industry began to work on the next generation of technology known as 3G. The main technological difference that distinguishes 3G technology from 2G technology is the use of packet switching rather than circuit switching for data transmission.[40] In addition, the standardization process focused on requirements more than technology (2 Mbit/s maximum data rate indoors, 384 kbit/s outdoors, for example).\\r\\nInevitably this led to many competing standards with different contenders pushing their own technologies, and the vision of a single unified worldwide standard looked far from reality. The standard 2G CDMA networks became 3G compliant with the adoption of Revision A to EV-DO, which made several additions to the protocol while retaining backwards compatibility:\\r\\nAll these were put in place to allow for low latency, low bit rate communications such as VoIP.[41]\\r\\nThe first pre-commercial trial network with 3G was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in the Tokyo region in May 2001. NTT DoCoMo launched the first commercial 3G network on 1 October 2001, using the WCDMA technology. In 2002 the first 3G networks on the rival CDMA2000 1xEV-DO technology were launched by SK Telecom and KTF in South Korea, and Monet in the US. Monet has since gone bankrupt. By the end of 2002, the second WCDMA network was launched in Japan by Vodafone KK (now Softbank). European launches of 3G were in Italy and the UK by Three/Hutchison group, on WCDMA. 2003 saw a further eight commercial launches of 3G, six more on WCDMA and two more on the EV-DO standard.\\r\\nDuring the development of 3G systems, 2.5G systems such as CDMA2000 1x and GPRS were developed as extensions to existing 2G networks. These provide some of the features of 3G without fulfilling the promised high data rates or full range of multimedia services. CDMA2000-1X delivers theoretical maximum data speeds of up to 307 kbit/s. Just beyond these is the EDGE system which in theory covers the requirements for 3G system, but is so narrowly above these that any practical system would be sure to fall short.\\r\\nThe high connection speeds of 3G technology enabled a transformation in the industry: for the first time, media streaming of radio (and even television) content to 3G handsets became possible,[42] with companies such as RealNetworks[43] and Disney[44] among the early pioneers in this type of offering.\\r\\nIn the mid-2000s (decade), an evolution of 3G technology began to be implemented, namely High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA). It is an enhanced 3G (third generation) mobile telephony communications protocol in the High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) family, also coined 3.5G, 3G+ or turbo 3G, which allows networks based on Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity. Current HSDPA deployments support down-link speeds of 1.8, 3.6, 7.2 and 14.0 Mbit/s.\\r\\nBy the end of 2007, there were 295 million subscribers on 3G networks worldwide, which reflected 9% of the total worldwide subscriber base. About two thirds of these were on the WCDMA standard and one third on the EV-DO standard. The 3G telecoms services generated over $120 billion of revenues during 2007 and at many markets the majority of new phones activated were 3G phones. In Japan and South Korea the market no longer supplies phones of the second generation.\\r\\nAlthough mobile phones had long had the ability to access data networks such as the Internet, it was not until the widespread availability of good quality 3G coverage in the mid-2000s (decade) that specialized devices appeared to access the mobile web. The first such devices, known as \\"dongles\\", plugged directly into a computer through the USB port. Another new class of device appeared subsequently, the so-called \\"compact wireless router\\" such as the Novatel MiFi, which makes 3G Internet connectivity available to multiple computers simultaneously over Wi-Fi, rather than just to a single computer via a USB plug-in.\\r\\nSuch devices became especially popular for use with laptop computers due to the added portability they bestow. Consequently, some computer manufacturers started to embed the mobile data function directly into the laptop so a dongle or MiFi wasn't needed. Instead, the SIM card could be inserted directly into the device itself to access the mobile data services. Such 3G-capable laptops became commonly known as \\"netbooks\\". Other types of data-aware devices followed in the netbook's footsteps. By the beginning of 2010, E-readers, such as the Amazon Kindle and the Nook from Barnes & Noble, had already become available with embedded wireless Internet, and Apple had announced plans for embedded wireless Internet on its iPad tablet devices later that year.\\r\\nBy 2009, it had become clear that, at some point, 3G networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth-intensive applications like streaming media.[45] Consequently, the industry began looking to data-optimized 4th-generation technologies, with the promise of speed improvements up to 10-fold over existing 3G technologies. The first two commercially available technologies billed as 4G were the WiMAX standard (offered in the U.S. by Sprint) and the LTE standard, first offered in Scandinavia by TeliaSonera.\\r\\nOne of the main ways in which 4G differed technologically from 3G was in its elimination of circuit switching, instead employing an all-IP network. Thus, 4G ushered in a treatment of voice calls just like any other type of streaming audio media, utilizing packet switching over Internet, LAN or WAN networks via VoIP.[46]\\r\\nBefore a universal charger standard was agreed upon in the late 2000s users needed an adaptor which was often the same brand as their phone to recharge the battery.\\r\\nAs of 14?June?2007[update], all new mobile phones applying for a license in China are required to use a USB port as a power port for battery charging.[48][49] This was the first standard to use the convention of shorting D+ and D?.[50]\\r\\nIn September 2007, the Open Mobile Terminal Platform group (a forum of mobile network operators and manufacturers such as Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and LG) announced that its members had agreed on Micro-USB as the future common connector for mobile devices.[51][52]\\r\\nThe GSM Association (GSMA) followed suit on 17 February 2009,[53][53][54][55][56] and on 22 April 2009, this was further endorsed by the CTIA ÿ The Wireless Association,[57] with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) announcing on 22 October 2009 that it had also embraced the Universal Charging Solution as its \\"energy-efficient one-charger-fits-all new mobile phone solution,\\" and added: \\"Based on the Micro-USB interface, UCS chargers will also include a 4-star or higher efficiency ratingup to three times more energy-efficient than an unrated charger.\\"[58]\\r\\nIn June 2009, many of the world's largest mobile phone manufacturers signed an EC-sponsored Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), agreeing to make most data-enabled mobile phones marketed in the European Union compatible with a common External Power Supply (common EPS). The EU's common EPS specification (EN 62684:2010) references the USB Battery Charging Specification and is similar to the GSMA/OMTP and Chinese charging solutions.[59][60] In January 2011, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) released its version of the (EU's) common EPS standard as IEC 62684:2011.[61]\\r\\nAs well as the now-common cellular phone, there is also the very different approach of connecting directly from the handset to an Earth-orbiting satellite. Such mobile phones can be used in remote areas out of reach of wired networks or where construction of a cellular network is uneconomic.\\r\\nThe Inmarsat system is the oldest, originally developed in 1979 for safety of life at sea, and uses a series of satellites in geostationary orbits to cover the majority of the globe. Several smaller operators use the same approach with just one or two satellites to provide a regional service. An alternative approach is to use a series of low Earth orbit satellites much closer to Earth. This is the basis of the Iridium and Globalstar satellite phone services.","input":"When was the first handheld mobile phone invented?"},{"output":"pain perdu","context":"French toast is a dish made of bread soaked in eggs and milk, then fried. Alternative names and variants include eggy bread,[1] Bombay toast,[2] German toast,[3][4] gypsy toast,[5] poor knights (of Windsor),[6] and Torrija.[4]\\r\\nThe earliest known reference to French toast is in the Apicius, a collection of Latin recipes dating to the 4th or 5th century, where it is described as simply aliter dulcia (\\"another sweet dish\\").[7] The recipe depicts soaking in milk, but not egg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the names suppe dorate, soupys yn dorye, tostes dores, and payn purdyeu, the dish was widely known in medieval Europe and often served with game birds and meats.[citation needed] A fourteenth-century German recipe uses the name Arme Ritter (\\"poor knights\\"),[4][8] a name also used in English[6] and the Nordic languages. Also in the fourteenth century, Taillevent presented a recipe for \\"tostes dores\\".[9] Italian 15th-century culinary expert Martino da Como offers a recipe. The word \\"soup\\" in the dish's name refers to bread soaked in a liquid, a sop.[10]\\r\\nThe first modern French Toast is from Montreal, Canada. Where they make tons of syrup to go with it.\\r\\nThe usual French name is pain perdu (French:?[p?? p??dy]?(?listen), \\"lost bread\\", reflecting its use of stale or otherwise \\"lost\\" bread - which gave birth to the metaphoric term pain perdu for sunk costs.[11] It may also be called pain dor, \\"golden bread\\".[12] There are fifteenth-century English recipes for pain perdu.[4][13][14]\\r\\nAn Austrian and Bavarian term is pafese or pofese, from zuppa pavese, referring to Pavia, Italy.[15] In Hungary, it is commonly called bundskenyr (lit. \\"furry bread\\").[16]\\r\\nSlices of bread are soaked or dipped in a mixture of beaten eggs, often whisked with milk or cream. Sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla are variously added to the mixture. The bread is then fried in butter or olive oil until browned and cooked through. Day-old bread is often used, both for its thrift and because it will soak up more egg mixture without falling apart.[17]\\r\\nThe cooked slices may be served with sugar or sweet toppings such as jam, honey, fruit,[18] or maple syrup.\\r\\nAccording to the Compleat Cook (1659) as quoted in the OED, the bread was dipped in milk only, with the egg mixture added afterwards.[19]\\r\\nAlternatively, the bread may be soaked in wine, rosewater, or orange juice, either before or after cooking.[20][21]\\r\\nIn France, pain perdu may be eaten as a dessert, or more rarely as an afternoon tea snack (\\"go?ter\\"). It is very rarely eaten as a breakfast.[22]\\r\\n\\"Roast paan\\" literally \\"Roasted bread\\" is a similar recipe prepared in Maldives. It is usually made by dipping bread slices in a mixture of egg and condensed milk and then fried.\\r\\nTorrija is a similar recipe traditionally prepared in Spain for Lent and Holy Week. It is usually made by soaking stale bread in milk or wine with honey and spices. It is dipped in beaten egg and fried with olive oil. This cooking technique breaks down the fibres of the bread and results in a pastry with a crispy outside and smooth inside.[23] It is often sprinkled with cinnamon as a final touch.\\r\\nTorrijas or torrejas were first mentioned by the Spanish composer, poet and playwright Juan del Encina (1468ÿ1533) in his Cancionero, published in 1496. In \\"Anda ac pastor\\" one reads: \\"En cantares nuevos / gocen sus orejas, / miel e muchos huevos / para hacer torrejas, / aunque sin dolor / pari܇ al Redemptor\\".[24]\\r\\nHong Kong-style French toast (Chinese: lÌ; Cantonese Yale: sids; literally: \\"western toast\\") is typically prepared by combining multiple slices of bread with peanut butter or fruit jam filling, then dipped in beaten egg and deep fried. It is served with butter, and topped with golden syrup or honey. It is a typical offering in Hong Kong teahouses (cha chaan teng).[25] Other types of filling that can be found are meat floss, kaya jam, ham or beef satay.[25][26]\\r\\nFrench toast is commonly served as a breakfast food in India. It differs from other versions in that it generally omits any dairy or sweet component. French toast is generally made by beating plain eggs (salt is optional) and dipping pieces of white sliced bread in them for a brief soak, after which they are pan fried. During the cooking process, savory ingredients such as fried onions, cilantro leaves, diced tomato, or chopped green chilis may be added. Once the egg is set, the slices of French toast are often served with tomato ketchup.\\r\\nIn New Orleans Louisiana Creole cuisine, French toast is known as pain perdu and is most commonly served as breakfast.[27] The recipe calls for New Orleans-style French bread; the batter is an egg-based custard that may include spirits.[27][28][29] Common toppings include cane syrup, strongly-flavored honey, or fruit syrups; a dusting of powdered sugar is also traditional.[28][29]\\r\\nIn Portugal and Brazil French Toast is called 'Rabanada'. It is made with diagonal slices of French bread soaked in a mix of milk and eggs, deep fried and covered with cinnamon and sugar. It is a typical Christmas dessert brought to Brazil by Portuguese ancestors.","input":"What is the french word for french toast?"},{"output":"Filipino","context":"There are some 120 to 187 languages and dialects in the Philippines, depending on the method of classification.[4][5][6] Almost all are Malayo-Polynesian languages. A number of Spanish-influenced creole varieties generally called Chavacano are also spoken in certain communities. The 1987 constitution designates Filipino as the national language and an official language along with English. While Filipino is used for communication across the country's diverse linguistic groups and is used in popular culture, the government operates mostly using English. Including second-language speakers, there are more speakers of Tagalog than English in the Philippines.[7] The other regional languages are given official auxiliary status in their respective places according to the constitution but does not specify any language in particular.[8] Some of these regional languages are also used in education.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe indigenous scripts of the Philippines (such as the Kulitan, Tagbanwa and others) are used very little; instead, Filipino languages are today written in the Latin script because of the Spanish and American colonial experience. Baybayin, though generally not understood, is one of the most well-known of the indigenous Filipino scripts and is used mainly in artistic applications such as on the Philippine banknotes, where the word \\"Pilipino\\" is inscribed using the writing system. Additionally, the Arabic script is used in the Muslim areas in the southern Philippines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1987 Constitution declares Filipino as the national language of the country. Filipino and English are the official languages, with the recognition of the regional languages as auxiliary official in their respective regions (though not specifying any particular languages). Spanish and Arabic are to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish was the official language of the country for more than three centuries under Spanish colonial rule, and became the lingua franca of the Philippines in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1863, a Spanish decree introduced universal education, creating free public schooling in Spanish.[10] It was also the language of the Philippine Revolution, and the 1899 Malolos Constitution effectively proclaimed it as the official language of the First Philippine Republic.[11] National hero Jos Rizal wrote most of his works in Spanish. Luciano de la Rosa established that Spanish was spoken by a total of 60% of the population in the early 20th century as a first, second or third language. Following the American occupation of the Philippines and the imposition of English, the use of Spanish declined gradually, especially after the 1940s.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the U.S. occupation and civil regime, English began to be taught in schools. By 1901, public education used English as the medium of instruction. Around 600 educators (called \\"Thomasites\\") who arrived in that year aboard the USAT Thomas replaced the soldiers who also functioned as teachers. The 1935 Constitution added English as an official language alongside Spanish. A provision in this constitution also called for Congress to \\"take steps toward the development and adoption of a common national language based on one of the existing native languages.\\" On November 12, 1937, the First National Assembly created the National Language Institute. President Manuel L. Quez܇n appointed native Waray speaker Jaime C. De Veyra to chair a committee of speakers of other regional languages. Their aim was to select a national language among the other regional languages. Ultimately, Tagalog was chosen as the base language December 30, 1937, on the basis that it was the most widely spoken and developed local language.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1939, President Manuel L. Quez܇n renamed the Tagalog language as Wikang Pambansa (\\"national language\\" in English translation).[13] The language was further renamed in 1959 as Pilipino by Secretary of\\r\\nEducation Jose Romero. The 1973 constitution declared the Pilipino language to be co-official, along with English, and mandated the development of a national language, to be known as Filipino.  In addition, Spanish regained its official status when President Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 155, s. 1973.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present constitution, ratified in 1987, designates Filipino and English as joint official languages. Filipino also had the distinction of being a national language that was to be \\"developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages.\\" Although not explicitly stated in the constitution, Filipino is in practice almost completely composed of the Tagalog language as spoken in the capital, Manila; however, organizations such as the University of the Philippines began publishing dictionaries such as the UP Diksyonaryong Filipino in which words from various Philippine languages were also included. The present constitution is also the first to give recognition to other regional languages. The constitution also made mention of Spanish and Arabic, both of which are to be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nFilipino is an official language of education and also the major language of the broadcast media and cinema, but less important than English as a language of publication (except in some domains, like comic books) and less important for academic-scientific-technological discourse. Filipino is used as a lingua franca in all regions of the Philippines as well as within overseas Filipino communities, and is the dominant language of the armed forces (except perhaps for the small part of the commissioned officer corps from wealthy or upper-middle-class families) and of a large part of the civil service, most of whom are non-Tagalogs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are different forms of diglossia that exist in the case of regional languages. Locals may use their mother tongue or the regional lingua franca to communicate amongst themselves, but sometimes switch to foreign languages when addressing outsiders. Another is the prevalence of code-switching to English when speaking in both their first language and Tagalog.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution of the Philippines provides for the use of the vernacular languages as official auxiliary languages in provinces where Filipino is not the lingua franca. Filipinos at large are polyglots; In the case where the vernacular language is a regional language, Filipinos would speak in Filipino when speaking in formal situations while the regional languages are spoken in non-formal settings. This is evident in major urban areas outside Metro Manila like Camarines Norte in the Bikol-speaking area, and Davao in the Cebuano-speaking area. As of  2017[update], the case of Ilocano and Cebuano are becoming more of bilingualism than diglossia due to the publication of materials written in these languages.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diglossia is more evident in the case of other languages such as Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Bikol, Waray, Hiligaynon, Sambal, and Maranao, where the written variant of the language is becoming less and less popular to give way to the use of Filipino. Although Philippine laws consider some of these languages as \\"major languages\\" there is little, if any, support coming from the government to preserve these languages. This may be bound to change, however, given current policy trends.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere still exists another type of diglossia, which is between the regional languages and the minority languages. Here, we label the regional languages as acrolects while the minority languages as the basilect. In this case, the minority language is spoken only in very intimate circles, like the family or the tribe one belongs to. Outside this circle, one would speak in the prevalent regional language, while maintaining an adequate command of Filipino for formal situations. Unlike the case of the regional languages, these minority languages are always in danger of becoming extinct because of speakers favoring the more prevalent regional language. Moreover, most of the users of these languages are illiterate[specify] and as expected, there is a chance that these languages will no longer be revived due to lack of written records.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from the two official nationwide languages used in the Philippines, namely, Filipino and English, other languages have been proposed as additional nationwide languages. Among the most prominent proposals are Japanese[16][17], and Spanish.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Ethnologue, a total of 182 native languages are spoken in the nation and four languages have been classified as extinct: Dicamay Agta, Katabaga, Tayabas Ayta and Villaviciosa Agta.[19] Except for English, Spanish, Chavacano and varieties of Chinese (Hokkien, Cantonese and Mandarin), all of the languages belong to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 12 indigenous languages with at least one million native speakers:\\r\\n\\r\\nOne or more of these is spoken natively by more than 90% of the population.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Philippine language sub-family identified by Robert Blust includes languages of north Sulawesi and the Yami language of Taiwan, but excludes the SamaÿBajaw languages of the Tawi-Tawi islands, as well as a couple of North Bornean languages spoken in southern Palawan.\\r\\n\\r\\nEskayan is an artificial auxiliary language created as the embodiment of a Bohol nation in the aftermath of the PhilippineÿAmerican War. It is used by about 500 people.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilippine languages are often referred to by Filipinos as dialects, partly as a relic of the inaccurate vocabulary used in literature during the American period (1898ÿ1946).[13] While there are indeed many hundreds of dialects in the Philippines, they represent variations of no fewer than 120 distinct languages, and many of these languages maintain greater differences than those between established European languages like French and Spanish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vast differences between the languages can be seen in the following translations of the Philippine national proverb:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amount of dialectal variation varies from language to language. Languages like Tagalog, Kapampangan and Pangasinan are known to have very moderate dialectal variation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe languages of the Bicol Region, however, there is great dialectal variation. There are cities and towns which have their own dialects and varieties. Below is the sentence \\"Were you there at the market for a long time?\\" translated into certain varieties of Bikol. The translation is followed by dialect and corresponding language, and a city/town in Bicol where they are spoken. The final translation is in Tagalog.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow is a chart of Philippine languages. While there have been misunderstandings on which ones should be classified as language and which ones should be classified as dialect, the chart confirms that most have similarities, yet are not mutually comprehensible. These languages are arranged according to the regions they are natively spoken (from north to south, then east to west).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a language spoken by the Tao people (also known as Yami) of Orchid Island of Taiwan which is not included in the language of the Philippines. Their language, Tao (or Yami) is part of the Batanic languages which includes Ivatan, Babuyan, and Itbayat of the Batanes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow are population estimates from the 2000 Philippine census by the Philippine Statistics Authority on the number of Filipinos who speak the following 18 languages as a native language.\\r\\n\\r\\nEndangered and extinct languages in the Philippines are based on the 3rd world volume released by UNESCO in 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nDegree of endangerment (UNESCO standard)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a separate study by Thomas N. Headland, the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Dallas, and the University of North Dakota called Thirty Endangered Languages in the Philippines, the Philippines has 32 endangered languages, but 2 of the listed languages in the study are written with 0 speakers, noting that they are extinct or probably extinct. All of the listed languages are Negrito languages, the oldest languages in the Philippines.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been numerous proposals to conserve the many languages of the Philippines. According to the Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino, there are 135 ethno-linguistic groups in the country, each having their own distinct Philippine language.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the proposals include (1) \\"establishing a dictionary & sentence construction manual\\" for each of the 135 living languages in the country, (2) \\"video documentation\\" of all Philippine languages, (3) \\"revival of the ancient scripts of the Philippines\\" where each ethnic group's own script shall be revived and used in schools along with the currently-used Roman script in communities where those script/s used to be known, (4) \\"teaching of ethnic mother languages first\\" in homes and schools before the teaching of Filipino and foreign languages (English or Arabic), and (5) \\"using the ethnic mother language and script first in public signs\\" followed by Filipino and foreign languages (English and/or Arabic) and scripts, for example, using Sebwano first followed by Filipino and English underneath the sign.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, only the fourth proposal has been made by the national government of the Philippines.[23] A National Script bill has been filed in Congress in support of the third and fifth proposal, however, the bill only mandates the usage of the ancient script compatible with the national language, which is Filipino.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nArabic is used by some Filipino Muslims in both a liturgical and instructional capacity since the arrival of Islam and establishment of several Sultanates in the 14th century. Along with Malay, Arabic was the lingua franca of the Malay Archipelago among Muslim traders and the Malay aristocracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1987 Constitution mandates that Arabic (along with Spanish) is to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis. As of  2015[update] Arabic is taught for free and is promoted in some Islamic centres predominantly in the southernmost parts of Philippines. It is used primarily in religious activities and education (such as in a madrasa or Islamic school) and rarely for official events or daily conversation. In this respect, its function and use is somewhat like the traditional roles of Latin and Spanish in Filipino Catholicism vis--vis other currently spoken languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first significant exposure of Filipinos to the English language occurred in 1762 when the British invaded Manila, but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence. English later became more important and widespread during American rule between 1898 and 1946, and remains an official language of the Philippines.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish is used in official documents of business, government, the legal system, medicine, the sciences and as a medium of instruction. Filipinos prefer textbooks for subjects like calculus, physics, chemistry, biology, etc., written in English rather than Filipino.[dubious  ÿ discuss] However, the topics are usually taught, even in colleges, in Tagalog or the local language. By way of contrast, native languages are often heard in colloquial and domestic settings, spoken mostly with family and friends. The use of English attempts to give an air of formality, given its use in school, government and various ceremonies.[citation needed] A percentage of the media such as cable television and newspapers are also in English; major television networks such as ABS-CBN and GMA and all AM radio stations broadcast primarily in Filipino. However, a 2009 article by a UNICEF worker reported that the level of spoken English language in the Philippines was poor. The article reported that aspiring Filipino teachers score the lowest in English out of all of the subjects on their licensing exams.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nA large influx of English (American English) words has been assimilated into Tagalog and the other native languages called Taglish or Bislish. There is a debate, however, on whether there is diglossia or bilingualism, between Filipino and English. Filipino is also used both in formal and informal situations. Though the masses would prefer to speak in Filipino, government officials tend to speak in English when performing government functions.[according to whom?] There is still resistance to the use of Filipino in courts and the drafting of national statutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 22, 2007, three Malolos City regional trial courts in Bulacan decided to use Filipino, instead of English, in order to promote the national language. Twelve stenographers from Branches 6, 80 and 81, as model courts, had undergone training at Marcelo H. del Pilar College of Law of Bulacan State University College of Law following a directive from the Supreme Court of the Philippines. De la Rama said it was the dream of former Chief Justice Reynato Puno to implement the program in other areas such as Laguna, Cavite, Quez܇n, Nueva cija, Batangas, Rizal, and Metro Manila.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiplomatic ties with the Ming dynasty among some established states or kingdoms in Luzon and direct interactions and trade overall within the archipelago as a whole may go as far back as the early 10th century. Mandarin Chinese is the medium of instruction in Chinese schools and the lingua franca of mainland and overseas Chinese. However, the Lan-nang variant of Hokkien Chinese is the majority language the Chinese in the Philippines, who immigrated from the Fujian (pronounced locally as Fukkien or Hokkien) province in China. Other varieties of Chinese such as Hakka and Yue Chinese (especially Cantonese) are spoken among a few Chinese in the Philippines whose ancestral roots trace all the way back from the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in Southern China.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with Spanish, many native languages have co-opted numerous loanwords from Chinese, in particular words that refer to cuisine, household objects, and Philippine kinship terminology.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese first came to the Philippines around the 11th century CE, the first country they emigrated to, as well as in waves from the 15th century, 17th century, late 19th century, 1900s, 1930s, and the 1940s.[27][28][29][30] There is a small Japanese community and a school for Japanese in Metro Manila due to the number of Japanese companies. Also there is a large community of Japanese and Japanese descendants in Laguna province, Baguio City, and in the Davao Region. Davao City is a home to a large population of Japanese descendants. Japanese laborers were hired by American companies like the National Fiber Company (NAFCO) in the first decades of the 20th century to work in abaca plantations. Japanese were known for their hard work and industry. During World War II, Japanese schools were present in Davao City.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalay is spoken as a lingua franca in the southernmost parts of the Philippines, from Zamboanga down to Tawi-Tawi among a minority of the Tausug, Sama-Bajau, and Yakan peoples. It is also spoken as a daily language by the Malaysians and Indonesians who have settled, or do business in the Philippines. It is also spoken in southern Palawan to some extent. It is not spoken among the Maranao and Maguindanao peoples. Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and the southern Philippines are largely Islamic and the liturgical language of Islam is Arabic, but the vast majority of Muslims in the Philippines have little practical knowledge of Arabic beyond limited religious terminology.\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient Malaysian and Indonesian cultures and civilizations in ancient Malaya, Sumatra and Java influenced the history, lifestyles, and culture of the Filipino peoples. The Malay language, along with Philippine languages belonging to the Malayo-Polynesian language family, has also had an immense influence on many languages spoken in the Philippines. This is because Old Malay used to be the lingua franca throughout the archipelago, a good example of this is Magellan's translator Enrique using Malay to converse with the native Sugbuanon (Cebuano) during this time period.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of Old Malay and Javanese languages spoken in Philippine history can be seen in the language of the 10th century Laguna Copperplate Inscription.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Spanish had first arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, Old Malay was spoken among the aristocracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is believed that Ferdinand Magellans Moluccan slave Enrique could converse with the local leaders in Cebu Island, confirming to Magellan his arrival in Southeast Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Indonesian is taught as a foreign language in the Department of Linguistics and Asian Languages in the University of the Philippines. Also, the Indonesian School in Davao City teaches the language to preserve the culture of Indonesian immigrants there. The Indonesian Embassy in Manila also offers occasional classes for Filipinos and foreigners.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2013, the Indonesian Embassy in the Philippines has given basic Indonesian language training to members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview, Department of Education Secretary Armin Luistro[32] said that the country's government should promote Indonesian and Malaysian, which are both related to Filipino and other Philippine languages. Thus, the possibility of offering it as an optional subject in public schools is being studied.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince pre-Spanish times, there have been small Indian communities in the Philippines. Indians tend to be able to speak Tagalog and the other native languages, and are often fluent in English. Among themselves, Sindhi and Punjabi are used. Urdu is spoken among the Pakistani community. Only few South Asians, such as Pakistani, as well as the recent newcomers like speakers of Tamil, Nepali and Marathi retain their own respective languages.[27][33][34][35][36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish was introduced in the islands after 1565, when the Spanish conquistador Miguel L܇pez de Legazpi set sail from Mexico and founded the first Spanish settlement on Ceb~. Though its usage is not as widespread as before, Spanish has had a significant influence in the various local Philippine languages such as providing numerous loan words.[25] Several Spanish-based creole language varieties collectively known as Chabacano have also emerged. The current 1987 constitution makes mention of Spanish in which it provides that Spanish (along with Arabic) is to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1593, the first printing press in the Philippine islands was founded and it released the first (albeit polyglot) book, the Doctrina Christiana that same year. In the 17th century, Spanish religious orders founded the first universities in the Philippines, some of which are considered the oldest in Asia. During colonial rule through Mexico, Spanish was the language of education, trade, politics, and religion, and by the 19th century, became the colony's lingua franca although it was mainly used by the educated Filipinos.[38] In 1863, a Spanish decree introduced a system of public education, creating free public schooling in Spanish. In the 1890s, the Philippines had a prominent group of Spanish-speaking scholars called the Ilustrados, such as Jos Rizal. Some of these scholars participated in the Philippine Revolution and later in the struggle against American occupation. Both the Malolos Constitution and the Lupang Hinirang (national anthem) were written in Spanish.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder U.S. rule, the English language began to be promoted instead of Spanish. The use of Spanish began to decline as a result of the introduction of English into the public schools as a language of instruction.[10] The 1935 constitution establishing the Philippine Commonwelath designated both English and Spanish as official languages. The 1950 census stated that Filipinos who spoke Spanish as a first or second language made up only 6% of the population. In 1990, the census reported that the number had dwindled to just 2,500. A 2012 survey estimates that while around 3 million people can speak Spanish with varying degrees of competency, only around 439,000 people can speak the language at a native level.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish briefly lost its status as an official language upon promulgation of the 1973 constitution but regained official status two months later when President Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 155.[14] In the 1987 constitution, Spanish is designated as an \\"optional and voluntary language\\" but does not mention it as an \\"official language\\". Spanish was dropped as a college requirement during Coraz܇n Aquino's administration. Former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, a third-language Spanish speaker, introduced legislation to re-establish the instruction of Spanish in 2009 in the state education system. Today, the language is still spoken by Filipino-Spanish mestizos and Spanish families who are mainly concentrated in Metro Manila, Iloilo and Cebu. It remains a required subject in some academic institutions, such as the University of Santo Toms in Manila and the University of San Carlos in Cebu. \\r\\n\\r\\nMany historical documents, land titles, and works of literature are written in Spanish and are still not translated into Filipino languages, despite the fact that some such as land titles have legal value. Spanish, through colonization has contributed the largest number of loanwords and expressions in Tagalog, Cebuano, and other Philippine languages.[40] The Academia Filipina de la Lengua Espanola (Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language), established in 1924, is a founding member of the Association of Academies of the Spanish Language; an association of the various Spanish academies of the world which cooperate in the standardizing and promotion of the Spanish language. Among its past and present academics are former President Arroyo, former Foreign Affairs Secretary Alberto Romulo, and Archbishop of Ceb~ Cardinal Ricardo Vidal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several Spanish-based creole languages in the Philippines, collectively called Chavacano.

Mr. Walt says very little; Mr. Hutchinson speaks in a very drawn-out and pompous, overly affected manner (claiming that he finds \\"the air here [in Torquay] most invigorating\\") that immediately irritates Basil. Basil becomes increasingly irate as Hutchinson makes unreasonable requests and asks for specific directions to a meeting. While Basil draws Hutchinson a map containing an abbreviation of Post Office (\\"P. Off\\"), Mr. Walt misinterprets a comment from Basil; Walt thinks he himself is being told to \\"P-off\\". Basil also produces picture cards for Manuel to understand what he is saying, after which Manuel produces a card of his own: \\"OK\\". After Sybil finally finishes on the phone, she informs Basil that a friend of Audrey's discovered the presence of three hotel inspectors in town. This information raises Basil's blood pressure several notches; determined to work out who the inspectors are, he realises with horror that any of the guests he's been monstering could be one of them.\\r\\nWhile Mr. Hutchinson is requesting to reserve the television to watch a documentary he is interested in, he says something which makes Basil's hair stand on end: \\"In my professional activities I am in constant contact with hotels.\\" This?ÿ combined with Hutchinson's neediness, his suggestions on how the hotel could be improved, and his overinflated style of speaking?ÿ convinces Basil that Hutchinson is actually an inspector; he changes his attitude towards Hutchinson, instead treating him like a VIP. He escorts him to the dining room, where lunch is about to be served. Basil ends up overlooking Mr. Walt, who is forced to wait after his bottle of wine proves to be corked (just after Basil is forced to dig out the bad cork so he can serve the wine), even though Hutchinson is taking a phone call. Sybil quietly reveals to Basil that Mr. Hutchinson is in fact a cutlery salesman (she had overheard his conversation). Feeling conned, Basil promises revenge on Hutchinson. However, Basil's relief is short-lived when ÿ during a conversation with Basil ÿ Mr. Walt casually mentions that he is in Torquay \\"on business with two colleagues.\\" This convinces Basil that Walt is actually the inspector. In order to avoid making a bad impression on Walt, Basil tries to pacify Hutchinson...who is annoyed because some spur-of-the-moment table-switching (by Basil, who else?) has caused confusion in the kitchen, and led to Hutchinson being served several dishes he did not order (actually, Walt did). To stifle Hutchinson's complaining, Basil gags him and then subtly punches him, rendering him unconscious.\\r\\nHutchinson regains consciousness and starts punching Basil at reception desk, who uncharacteristically accepts it without retaliation, since they are in Mr. Walt's presence. Hutchinson storms off to gather his things, declaring that he does not expect to receive a bill. Walt is flabbergasted, especially when Basil tries to bribe him against mentioning this recent chain of events when he reviews the hotel. Basil immediately goes into hysterics, realising how much he has just risked the hotel's reputation. Mr. Walt reveals he is actually an outboard motors salesman, and consoles Basil. Thinking he is in the clear, Basil thanks Walt for staying at Fawlty Towers and then runs to the kitchen with Manuel, who stops Mr. Hutchinson from leaving just long enough so that Basil can \\"say adios\\". Basil then slaps pies on Mr. Hutchinson's face and crotch, while Manuel pours cream into his briefcase. Hutchinson is marched to the door and forcibly ejected from the hotel by a vengeful Basil, who kisses Manuel on the head for his help. Returning to the reception desk, Basil welcomes John, Brian and Chris ÿ three smartly-dressed businessmen, who have just witnessed the bouncing of Hutchinson ÿ to Fawlty Towers.

The lyrical content depended on the artist and could consist of sex, drugs, violence, vandalism and distrust of and often degradation of women, but also of love for a city, love for friends and relaxing words. There was also a slurred lazy or \\"smooth\\" way of rapping in order to clarify words and stay in rhythmic cadence.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike other earlier rap acts that also utilized funk samples (such as EPMD and the Bomb Squad), G-funk often utilized fewer, unaltered samples per song.[2] Music theorist Adam Krims has described G-funk as \\"a style of generally West Coast rap whose musical tracks tend to deploy live instrumentation, heavy on bass and keyboards, with minimal (sometimes no) sampling and often highly conventional harmonic progressions and harmonies\\".[3] Dr. Dre, a pioneer of the G-funk genre, normally uses live musicians to replay the original music of sampled records. This enabled him to produce music that had his own sounds, rather than a direct copy of the sample.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nG-funk, given its name by Laylaw from Lawhouse Production, became a very popular genre of hip hop in the 1990s. Although G-funk originated in Los Angeles, the subgenre drew a large amount of influence from the earlier Bay Area-based sound known as Mobb music of the mid- to late 1980s, pioneered by Oakland rappers like Too Short & E-40. Too Short had experimented with looping sounds from classic P-Funk records over bass-heavy tracks during this period. However, unlike Bay Area Mobb music, Southern California-born G-funk used more portamento synthesizers and less live instrumentation. Too Short's lazy, drawl-heavy delivery was also a major influence on later G-funk rappers like Snoop Dogg.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has been some debate over who should be considered the \\"father of G-funk\\". Dr. Dre is generally believed to have developed the sound,[6] but Cold187um and KMG of Above the Law, Laylaw for Lawhouse Production have claimed that they developed the sound. Cold187um and KMG claim that Dr. Dre did not credit the group for pioneering the style when he released The Chronic, his Death Row debut album.[7] They both released records on Ruthless Records prior to that. Warren G and Snoop Dogg were with Cold187um before joining Dr. Dre and Death Row. On Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle album, Warren G and Daz Dillinger from Tha Dogg Pound claim they produced \\"Ain't No Fun\\", even though Dre is credited as the album's sole producer.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest use of sine wave synthesizers and Parliament-Funkadelic-style bass grooves in Dr. Dre's work appeared on N.W.A's single \\"Alwayz into Somethin'\\" from their 1991 album Efil4zaggin, and on N.W.A's early compilation album N.W.A. and the Posse on which he produced a song with the same style called Dope Man, when Dr. Dre's 1992 Death Row debut album The Chronic was released, the album was immensely successful, and consequently made g-funk a popular genre of hip hop.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother early G-funk pioneer, also from Compton, was rapper and producer DJ Quik, who was already using P-Funk instrumentals as early as 1991 in his debut album Quik Is the Name, though his most recognizable G-funk album would be 1995's Safe & Sound and also Battlecat, whose aesthetic is a progression from the early-'90s G-Funk sound pioneered by the group Above the Law, characterized by phat synth bass lines and soulful keys. Other well known artists that used G-funk were: Eazy-E,  Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Tupac Shakur, Nate Dogg, Mac Dre, Spice 1, Geto Boys, Eminem, Havoc & Prodeje, BG Knocc Out, Dresta, Rappin' 4-Tay, 3X Krazy and Warren G. Warren G's first album was called Regulate...G Funk Era, which featured Nate Dogg - who called himself \\"the king of G-funk\\".[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany contemporary West Coast rappers have released albums with strong G-Funk influences in recent years, including Kendrick Lamar with Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, YG with Still Brazy and Schoolboy Q with Blank Face LP.[11] G-Funk also, perhaps surprisingly, has had some influence on the development of modern Christian hip hop and gospel rap. For example, many of the albums of Christian recording artists Gospel Gangstaz, who have also enjoyed relatively mainstream success in the past, have exhibited token G-Funk musical elements.","input":"What rappers unique sound was coined g funk?"},{"output":"In the 1980s","context":"","input":"When did we get the world wide web?"},{"output":"a computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems","context":"In computer terminology, a honeypot is a computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. Generally, a honeypot consists of data (for example, in a network site) that appears to be a legitimate part of the site, but is actually isolated and monitored, and that seems to contain information or a resource of value to attackers, who are then blocked. This is similar to police sting operations, colloquially known as \\"baiting,\\" a suspect.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHoneypots can be classified based on their deployment (use/action) and based on their level of involvement. Based on deployment, honeypots may be classified as\\r\\nProduction honeypots are easy to use, capture only limited information, and are used primarily by corporations. Production honeypots are placed inside the production network with other production servers by an organization to improve their overall state of security. Normally, production honeypots are low-interaction honeypots, which are easier to deploy. They give less information about the attacks or attackers than research honeypots.\\r\\nResearch honeypots are run to gather information about the motives and tactics of the black hat community targeting different networks. These honeypots do not add direct value to a specific organization; instead, they are used to research the threats that organizations face and to learn how to better protect against those threats.[2] Research honeypots are complex to deploy and maintain, capture extensive information, and are used primarily by research, military, or government organizations.[3]\\r\\nBased on design criteria, honeypots can be classified as:\\r\\nPure honeypots are full-fledged production systems. The activities of the attacker are monitored by using a bug tap that has been installed on the honeypot's link to the network. No other software needs to be installed. Even though a pure honeypot is useful, stealthiness of the defense mechanisms can be ensured by a more controlled mechanism.\\r\\nHigh-interaction honeypots imitate the activities of the production systems that host a variety of services and, therefore, an attacker may be allowed a lot of services to waste his time. By employing virtual machines, multiple honeypots can be hosted on a single physical machine. Therefore, even if the honeypot is compromised, it can be restored more quickly. In general, high-interaction honeypots provide more security by being difficult to detect, but they are expensive to maintain. If virtual machines are not available, one physical computer must be maintained for each honeypot, which can be exorbitantly expensive. Example: Honeynet.\\r\\nLow-interaction honeypots simulate only the services frequently requested by attackers. Since they consume relatively few resources, multiple virtual machines can easily be hosted on one physical system, the virtual systems have a short response time, and less code is required, reducing the complexity of the virtual system's security. Example: Honeyd.\\r\\nRecently, a new market segment called deception technology has emerged using basic honeypot technology with the addition of advanced automation for scale. Deception technology addresses the automated deployment of honeypot resources over a large commercial enterprise or government institution.[4]\\r\\nMalware honeypots are used to detect malware by exploiting the known replication and attack vectors of malware. Replication vectors such as USB flash drives can easily be verified for evidence of modifications, either through manual means or utilizing special-purpose honeypots that emulate drives. Malware increasingly is used to search for and steal cryptocurrencies,[5] which provides opportunities for services such as Bitcoin Vigil to create and monitor honeypots by using small amount of money to provide early warning alerts of malware infection.[6]\\r\\nSpammers abuse vulnerable resources such as open mail relays and open proxies. Some system administrators have created honeypot programs that masquerade as these abusable resources to discover spammer activity. There are several capabilities such honeypots provide to these administrators and the existence of such fake abusable systems makes abuse more difficult or risky. Honeypots can be a powerful countermeasure to abuse from those who rely on very high volume abuse (e.g., spammers).\\r\\nThese honeypots can reveal the abuser's IP address and provide bulk spam capture (which enables operators to determine spammers' URLs and response mechanisms). For open relay honeypots, it is possible to determine the e-mail addresses (\\"dropboxes\\") spammers use as targets for their test messages, which are the tool they use to detect open relays. It is then simple to deceive the spammer: transmit any illicit relay e-mail received addressed to that dropbox e-mail address. That tells the spammer the honeypot is a genuine abusable open relay, and they often respond by sending large quantities of relay spam to that honeypot, which stops it.[7] The apparent source may be another abused systemspammers and other abusers may use a chain of abused systems to make detection of the original starting point of the abuse traffic difficult.\\r\\nThis in itself is indicative of the power of honeypots as anti-spam tools. In the early days of anti-spam honeypots, spammers, with little concern for hiding their location, felt safe testing for vulnerabilities and sending spam directly from their own systems. Honeypots made the abuse riskier and more difficult.\\r\\nSpam still flows through open relays, but the volume is much smaller than in 2001 to 2002. While most spam originates in the U.S.,[8] spammers hop through open relays across political boundaries to mask their origin. Honeypot operators may use intercepted relay tests to recognize and thwart attempts to relay spam through their honeypots. \\"Thwart\\" may mean \\"accept the relay spam but decline to deliver it.\\" Honeypot operators may discover other details concerning the spam and the spammer by examining the captured spam messages.\\r\\nOpen relay honeypots include Jackpot, written in Java by Jack Cleaver; smtpot.py, written in Python by Karl A. Krueger;[9] and spamhole (honeypot)|spamhole, written in C.[10] The Bubblegum Proxypot is an open source honeypot (or \\"proxypot\\").[11]\\r\\nAn email address that is used for any other purpose than to receive spam can also be considered a spam honeypot. Compared with the term \\"spamtrap\\", the term \\"honeypot\\" might be more suitable for systems and techniques that are used to detect or counterattacks and probes. With a spamtrap, spam arrives at its destination \\"legitimately\\"exactly as non-spam email would arrive.\\r\\nAn amalgam of these techniques is Project Honey Pot, a distributed, open source project that uses honeypot pages installed on websites around the world. These honeypot pages disseminate uniquely tagged spamtrap email addresses and spammers can then be trackedthe corresponding spam mail is subsequently sent to these spamtrap e-mail addresses.\\r\\nDatabases often get attacked by intruders using SQL injection. As such activities are not recognized by basic firewalls, companies often use database firewalls for protection. Some of the available SQL database firewalls provide/support honeypot architectures so that the intruder runs against a trap database while the web application remains functional.[12]\\r\\nJust as honeypots are weapons against spammers, honeypot detection systems are spammer-employed counter-weapons. As detection systems would likely use unique characteristics of specific honeypots to identify them, a great deal of honeypots in use makes the set of unique characteristics larger and more daunting to those seeking to detect and thereby identify them. This is an unusual circumstance in software: a situation in which \\"versionitis\\" (a large number of versions of the same software, all differing slightly from each other) can be beneficial. There's also an advantage in having some easy-to-detect honeypots deployed. Fred Cohen, the inventor of the Deception Toolkit, even argues that every system running his honeypot should have a deception port that adversaries can use to detect the honeypot.[13] Cohen believes that this might deter adversaries.\\r\\nTwo or more honeypots on a network form a honey net. Typically, a honey net is used for monitoring a larger and/or more diverse network in which one honeypot may not be sufficient. Honey nets and honeypots are usually implemented as parts of larger network intrusion detection systems. A honey farm is a centralized collection of honeypots and analysis tools.[14]\\r\\nThe concept of the honey net first began in 1999 when Lance Spitzner, founder of the Honeynet Project, published the paper \\"To Build a Honeypot\\".[15]\\r\\nThe metaphor of a bear being attracted to and stealing honey is common in many traditions, including Germanic and Slavic. A common Germanic kenning for the bear was \\"honey eater\\". The tradition of bears stealing honey has been passed down through stories and folklore, especially the well known Winnie the Pooh.[16]","input":"What is a honey pot in network security?"},{"output":"the Vice President","context":"The Presiding Officer of the United States Senate is the person who presides over the United States Senate and is charged with maintaining order and decorum, recognizing members to speak, and interpreting the Senate's rules, practices, and precedents. Senate presiding officer is a role, not an actual office. The actual role is usually performed by one of three officials: the Vice President; an elected United States Senator; or, in special cases, the Chief Justice. Outside the constitutionally mandated roles, the actual appointment of a person to do the job of presiding over the Senate as a body is governed by Rule I of the Standing Rules.\\r\\nThe Vice President is assigned the responsibility by the Constitution of presiding over the Senate and designated as its president. The vice president has the authority (ex officio, for they are not an elected member of the Senate) to cast a tie-breaking vote. Early vice presidents took an active role in regularly presiding over proceedings of the body, with the president pro tempore only being called on during the vice president's absence. During the 20th century, the role of the vice president evolved into more of an executive branch position. Now, the vice president is usually seen as an integral part of a president's administration and presides over the Senate only on ceremonial occasions or when a tie-breaking vote may be needed.[1]\\r\\nThe Constitution also provides for appointment of one of the elected senators to serve as President pro tempore. This senator presides when the vice president is absent from the body. The president pro tempore is selected by the body specifically for the role of presiding in the absence of (as the meaning of pro tempore, literally \\"for the time being\\") the actual presiding officer. By tradition, the title of President pro tempore has come to be given more-or-less automatically to the most senior senator of the majority party. In actual practice in the modern Senate, the president pro tempore also does not often serve in the role (though it is their constitutional right to do so). Instead, as governed by Rule I, they frequently designate a junior senator to perform the function.\\r\\nWhen the Senate hears an impeachment trial of the President of the United States, by procedure established in the Constitution, the Chief Justice is designated as the presiding officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution provides for two officers to preside over the Senate. Article One, Section 3, Clause 4 designates the Vice President of the United States as the President of the Senate. In this capacity, the vice president was expected to preside at regular sessions of the Senate, casting votes only to break ties. From John Adams in 1789 to Richard Nixon in the 1950s, presiding over the Senate was the chief function of vice presidents, who had an office in the Capitol, received their staff support and office expenses through the legislative appropriations, and rarely were invited to participate in cabinet meetings or other executive activities. In 1961, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson changed the vice presidency by moving his chief office from the Capitol to the White House, by directing his attention to executive functions, and by attending Senate sessions only at critical times when his vote, or ruling from the chair, might be necessary. Vice presidents since Johnson's time have followed his example.[2]\\r\\nNext, Article One, Section 3, Clause 5 provides that in the absence of the vice president the Senate could choose a president pro tempore to temporarily preside and perform the duties of the chair. Since vice presidents presided routinely in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Senate thought it necessary to choose a president pro tempore only for the limited periods when the vice president might be ill or otherwise absent. As a result, the Senate frequently elected several presidents pro tempore during a single session.[2]\\r\\nOn three occasions during the 19th century, the Senate was without both a president and a president pro tempore:\\r\\nAdditionally, Article One, Section 3, Clause 6 grants to the Senate the sole power to try federal impeachments and spells out the basic procedures for impeachment trials. Among the requirements is the stipulation that the Chief Justice is to preside over presidential impeachment trials. This rule underscores the solemnity of the occasion and aims, in part, to avoid the possible conflict of interest of a Vice President's presiding over the proceeding for the removal of the one official standing between the Vice President and the presidency.[3] The Chief Justice has presided as such only twice:\\r\\nAccording to Article One, Section 5, Clause 2 of the U.S. constitution, the Senate is allowed to establish, for itself, its own rules of operations, including the roles and duties of the presiding officer. Those rules are known as the Standing Rules of the United States Senate, and Rule I deals with the appointment of a person to act as the chair, or presiding officer, for normal Senate proceedings. It recognizes the constitutionally mandated roles of vice president and president pro tempore, but goes further to allow for the appointment of an acting president pro tempore, and further allows for the president pro tempore to also designate any other senator to perform his duties. As a result, during the day-to-day operation of the body, it is rare for the actual presiding role to be handled by the president pro tempore (and rarer still for the vice president to do so). Instead, a designated junior senator is most commonly appointed to do the job.\\r\\nThe presiding officer is usually addressed as \\"Mr. President\\" or \\"Madame President.\\" One exception is during impeachment trials of the president; the Chief Justice was referred to as \\"Mr. Chief Justice\\" both in 1868 and in 1999 while presiding over the Senate.[4]\\r\\nDuring joint sessions of Congress in which the President of the United States is giving the address, practices have varied as to how the president refers to the vice president. Barack Obama and his predecessor George W. Bush addressed the vice president as \\"Vice President Biden\\" (in 2010) and \\"Vice President Cheney\\" (in 2008 and several previous years), or as \\"Mr. Vice President\\" (George W. Bush in 2001). However, earlier presidents referred to the vice president as \\"Mr. President\\" while addressing a joint session of Congress; Dwight D. Eisenhower, for instance, did so in 1960, and George H. W. Bush did so in 1991.\\r\\nThis list includes all Presidents of the Senate (the Vice Presidents of the United States), those Presidents pro tempore of the Senate who presided during intraÿterm vacancies in the vice presidency or when the Vice President was acting as President of the United States, and those Chief Justices who presided during presidential impeachment trials. It does not include Presidents pro tempore who presided over sessions temporarily during an absence of the Senate President, or junior senators designated by the President pro tempore to preside temporarily.","input":"Who are the presiding officers in the senate?"},{"output":"iPad Mini 4","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1st generation:November?2,?2012?(2012-11-02)\\r\\n2:November?12,?2013?(2013-11-12)\\r\\n3:October?22,?2014?(2014-10-22)\\r\\n\\r\\n1st generation, 2 & 3: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n @ 2.4?GHz and 5?GHz\\r\\n4: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac @ 2.4?GHz and 5?GHz\\r\\n1st generation, 2 & 3: Bluetooth 4.0\\r\\n4: Bluetooth 4.2\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iPad Mini family (branded and marketed as iPad mini) is a line of mini tablet computers designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It is a sub-series of the iPad line of tablets, with a reduced screen size of 7.9 inches, in contrast to the standard 9.7 inches. The first generation iPad Mini was announced on October 23, 2012, and was released on November 2, 2012, in nearly all of Apple's markets.[3][4][5][6] It features similar internal specifications to the iPad 2, including its display resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second generation iPad Mini, with a faster processor and a Retina Display, was announced on October 22, 2013 and released on November 12, 2013. The third generation iPad Mini was announced on October 16, 2014 and was released on October 22, 2014; it features the same external hardware as the Mini 2 and the addition of a Touch ID fingerprint sensor compatible with Apple Pay.[7] On September 9, 2015, Apple released the iPad Mini 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 16, 2012, Apple announced plans for a media event on October 23 at the California Theatre in San Jose, California.[8][9] The company did not give the subject of the event, but it was widely expected to be the iPad Mini.[10] At the event, Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced a new version of MacBook family and new generations of the MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, and the iMac, then unveiled the fourth-generation iPad and the iPad Mini.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iPad Mini comes with several pre-installed applications, including Siri, Safari, Mail, Photos, Video, Music, iTunes, App Store, Maps, Notes, Calendar, Game Center, Photo Booth, and Contacts.[12] Like all iOS devices, the iPad can sync content and other data with a Mac or PC using iTunes and to Apple's iCloud online service. Although the tablet is not designed to make telephone calls over a cellular network, users can use a headset or the built-in speaker and microphone and place phone calls over Wi-Fi or cellular using a VoIP application, such as Skype.[13] iPads offer dictation when connected to a Wi-Fi or cellular network.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nApplications from Apple and third-party developers can be downloaded through the App Store, an application distribution market for iOS that is maintained and regulated by Apple. The service allows users to browse and purchase  applications. Optional apps from Apple that can be purchased through the App Store include GarageBand, iMovie, iPhoto, and the iWork apps (Pages, Keynote, and Numbers) are available.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe device has an optional iBooks application, which displays books and other ePub-format content downloaded from the iBookstore.[16] Several major book publishers including Penguin Books, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Macmillan have committed to publishing books for the device.[17] Despite the iPad being a direct competitor to both the Amazon Kindle and Barnes & Noble Nook,[18] both Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble offer e-reader apps for the iPad.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 8, 2015, it was announced at the WWDC that all four generations of the iPad Mini would support iOS 9. However, certain new multitasking features, such as Slide Over and Picture in Picture, will be limited to the second, third generation, and the fourth generation. Split View, another new multitasking feature, is only available on the iPad Mini 4.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current version of iOS, iOS 11, is supported on iPad Mini 2 and up. An upgrade to this version is available as a free download.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first generation iPad Mini shipped with iOS 6.0[22] and the highest supported version is iOS 9.3.5.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are four buttons and one switch on the iPad Mini, including a \\"home\\" button near the display that returns the user to the home screen, and three aluminum buttons on the right side and top: wake/sleep and volume up and volume down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function varies with software updates.[5] The tablet is manufactured either with or without the capability to communicate over a cellular network. All models can connect to a wireless LAN via Wi-Fi. The iPad Mini is available with 16, 32, 64 and 128?GB of internal flash memory, with no expansion option. Apple sells a \\"camera connection kit\\" with an SD card reader, but it can only be used to transfer photos and videos.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first generation iPad Mini features partially the same hardware as the iPad 2. Both screens have resolutions of 1024x768, but the iPad Mini has a smaller screen and thus higher pixel density than iPad 2 (163 PPI vs. 132 PPI).[5] Unlike the iPad 2, it has 5?MP and 1.2?MP cameras and the Lightning connector. The system-on-chip is A5, which is the same one found in the later revision of the iPad 2 (32?nm). The audio processor is the same found in iPhone 5 and iPad 4th generation, which allows the iPad Mini to have Siri and voice dictation unlike the iPad 2. The graphics processor (GPU) of the first generation iPad Mini is the same one found in the iPad 2 (PowerVR SGX543MP2).[23]\\r\\n\\r\\niPads with a data connection can download data through cellphone networks, but can not make voice calls. They can act as a hotspot, sharing the Internet connection over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Smart Cover, introduced with the iPad 2, is a screen protector that magnetically attaches to the face of the iPad. A smaller version is now available for iPad Mini. The cover has three folds, which allow it to convert into a stand, held together by magnets.[24] Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad, and wakes up the unit when the cover is removed. It comes in six colors of polyurethane.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nApple offers other accessories, including a Bluetooth keyboard, several types of earbuds or headphones and many adapters for the Lightning connector.[27] AppleCare and free engraving are also available for the iPad Mini.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most recent model is the iPad Mini 4. The iPad models are listed in a comparison grid.\\r\\n\\r\\nReviews of the first generation iPad Mini have been positive,[34][35][36][37][38][39] with reviewers praising the device's size, design, and availability of applications, while criticizing its use of a proprietary power connector and its lack of expandable storage and Retina Display for the first generation iPad Mini.[35][40][41] The device competes with tablets such as the Amazon Kindle Fire HD, Google Nexus 7, and Barnes & Noble Nook HD.[40][42] Joshua Topolsky of The Verge praised the industrial design of the iPad Mini, however panned its lack of Retina Display and price.[39] The iPad Mini 2 was well received, praising the Retina Display and Apple A7 chip performance, with criticisms on the price increase and the quality of the camera.[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 2018:9.7 iPad Models: A1893 (Wi-Fi), A1954 (4G), MPGT2LLA, MR7G2LL/A, MR7F2LL/A, MRJN2LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 2017: 12.9 iPad Pro (2nd Gen) Models: A1670 (Wi-Fi), A1671 (4G), MQDA2LL/A, MP6G2LL/A, MP6J2LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 2017: 10.5 iPad Pro (2nd Gen) Models: A1701 (Wi-Fi), A1709 (4G), MQDT2CL/A, MQDW2LLA, MQDY2LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 2016: 9.7 iPad Pro (1st Gen) Models: A1673 (Wi-Fi), A1674 or A1675 (4G), MLMQ2CL/A, MLMQ2LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 2016: 9.7 iPad (7th Gen) Models: A1822 (Wi-Fi), A1823 (4G), MPGT2LL/A, MPGW2LL/A, MPGC2LL/A, \\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 2015: 12.9 iPad Pro (1st Gen) Models: A1584 (Wi-Fi), A1652 (4G), MD517LL/A, ML3K2LL/A, ML0T2LL/A, MD517LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 2015: iPad Mini 4 (4th Gen Mini) Models: A1538 (Wi-Fi), A1550 (4G), MK9J2LL/A, MK8C2LL/A, MK9Q2LL/A, MK6K2LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 2015: iPad (4th Gen) Models: A1458 (Wi-Fi), A1459 (4G), A1460 (4G MM), MD511LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 2014: iPad Air 2 Models: A1566 (Wi-Fi), A1667 (4G), MH0W2LL/A, MNV72LL/A, MH182LL/A, MH1J2LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\niPad Mini 3 (3rd Gen Mini) Models: A1599 (Wi-Fi), A1600 (4G), MGNV2LL/A, MH3F2LL/A, MH382LL/A, MGGT2LL/A, MGP42LL/A, MH3M2LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 2013: iPad Air (5th Gen) Models: A1474 (Wi-Fi), A1475 (4G), MD788LL/B, MD789LL/A, MD790LL/A, ME906LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\niPad Mini 2 (2nd Gen Mini) Models: A1489 (Wi-Fi), A1490 (4G), ME279LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 2012: iPad Mini (1st Gen Mini) Models: A1432 (Wi-Fi), A1454 (4G), A1455 (4G MM), MD531LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 2012: iPad (3rd Gen) Models: A1416 (Wi-Fi), A1430 (4G), A1403 (4G VZ), MD328LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 2011: iPad (2nd Gen) Models: A1395 (Wi-Fi), A1396 (3G GSM), A1397 (3G CDMA), MC769LL/A\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 2010: iPad (1st Gen) Models: A1219 (Wi-Fi), A1337 (3G), MB294LL/A","input":"What is the current generation of ipad mini?"},{"output":"June 21, 1851","context":"\\"Ain't I a Woman?\\" is the name given to a speech, delivered extemporaneously, by Sojourner Truth, (1797ÿ1883), born into slavery in New York State. Some time after gaining her freedom in 1827, she became a well known anti-slavery speaker. Her speech was delivered at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio, on May 29, 1851, and did not originally have a title.\\r\\nThe speech was briefly reported in two contemporary newspapers, and a transcript of the speech was published in the Anti-Slavery Bugle on June 21, 1851. It received wider publicity in 1863 during the American Civil War when Frances Dana Barker Gage published a different version, one which became known as Ain't I a Woman? because of its oft-repeated question. This later, better known and more widely available version has been the one referenced by most historians.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase \\"Am I not a man and a brother?\\" had been used by British abolitionists since the late 18th century to decry the inhumanity of slavery.[1] This male motto was first turned female in the 1820s by British abolitionists,[2] then in 1830 the American abolitionist newspaper Genius of Universal Emancipation carried an image of a slave woman asking \\"Am I not a woman and a sister?\\"[1] This image was widely republished in the 1830s, and struck into a copper coin or token, but without the question mark, to give the question a positive answer.[2] In 1833, African American activist Maria W. Stewart used the words of this motto to argue for the rights of women of every race, though white women were oppressed to much less degree than black women. Historian Jean Fagan Yellin argued in 1989 that this motto served as inspiration for Sojourner Truth, who was well aware of the great difference in the level of oppression of white versus black women. Truth was asserting both her gender identity and race by asking the crowd, \\"Am I not a woman?\\"[1][3]\\r\\nThe first reports of the speech were published by the New York Tribune on June 6, 1851, and by The Liberator five days later. Both of these accounts were brief, lacking a full transcription.[4] The first complete transcription was published on June 21 in the Anti-Slavery Bugle by Marius Robinson, an abolitionist and newspaper editor who acted as the convention's recording secretary.[5] The question \\"Ain't I a Woman\\" does not appear in his account.[6]\\r\\nTwelve years later, in May 1863, Frances Dana Barker Gage published a very different transcription. In it, she gave Truth many of the speech characteristics of Southern slaves, and she included new material that Robinson had not reported. Gage's version of the speech was republished in 1875, 1881, and 1889, and became the historic standard. This version is known as \\"Ain't I a Woman?\\" after its oft-repeated refrain.[7] Truth's style of speech was not like Southern slaves;[8] she was born and raised in New York, and spoke only Dutch until she was nine years old.[9][10][11]\\r\\nAdditions that Gage made to Truth's speech include the ideas that she could bear the lash as well as a man, that no one ever offered her the traditional gentlemanly deference due a woman, and that most of her 13 children were sold away from her into slavery. Truth is widely believed to have had five children, with one sold away, and was never known to claim more children.[6] Further inaccuracies in Gage's 1863 account conflict with her own contemporary report: Gage wrote in 1851 that Akron in general and the press in particular were largely friendly to the woman's rights convention, but in 1863 she wrote that the convention leaders were fearful of the \\"mobbish\\" opponents.[6] Other eyewitness reports of Truth's speech told a different story, one where all faces were \\"beaming with joyous gladness\\" at the session where Truth spoke; that not \\"one discordant note\\" interrupted the harmony of the proceedings.[6] In contrast to Gage's later version, Truth was warmly received by the convention-goers, the majority of whom were long-standing abolitionists, friendly to progressive ideas of race and civil rights.[6]\\r\\nMarius Robinson, who attended the convention and worked with Truth, printed the speech as he transcribed it in the June 21, 1851, issue of the Anti-Slavery Bugle.[12]\\r\\nOne of the most unique and interesting speeches of the convention was made by Sojourner Truth, an emancipated slave. It is impossible to transfer it to paper, or convey any adequate idea of the effect it produced upon the audience. Those only can appreciate it who saw her powerful form, her whole-souled, earnest gesture, and listened to her strong and truthful tones. She came forward to the platform and addressing the President said with great simplicity: \\"May I say a few words?\\" Receiving an affirmative answer, she proceeded:[13]\\r\\nI want to say a few words about this matter. I am a woman's rights. [sic] I have as much muscle as any man, and can do as much work as any man. I have plowed and reaped and husked and chopped and mowed, and can any man do more than that? I have heard much about the sexes being equal. I can carry as much as any man, and can eat as much too, if I can get it. I am as strong as any man that is now. As for intellect, all I can say is, if a woman have a pint, and a man a quart ÿ why can't she have her little pint full? You need not be afraid to give us our rights for fear we will take too much, ÿ for we can't take more than our pint'll hold. The poor men seems to be all in confusion, and don't know what to do. Why children, if you have woman's rights, give it to her and you will feel better. You will have your own rights, and they won't be so much trouble. I can't read, but I can hear. I have heard the bible and have learned that Eve caused man to sin. Well, if woman upset the world, do give her a chance to set it right side up again. The Lady has spoken about Jesus, how he never spurned woman from him, and she was right. When Lazarus died, Mary and Martha came to him with faith and love and besought him to raise their brother. And Jesus wept and Lazarus came forth. And how came Jesus into the world? Through God who created him and the woman who bore him. Man, where was your part? But the women are coming up blessed be God and a few of the men are coming up with them. But man is in a tight place, the poor slave is on him, woman is coming on him, he is surely between a hawk and a buzzard.[13]\\r\\nThe speech was recalled 12 years after the fact by Gage, an activist in the woman's rights and abolition movements. Gage, who presided at the meeting, described the event:[14]\\r\\nThe leaders of the movement trembled on seeing a tall, gaunt black woman in a gray dress and white turban, surmounted with an uncouth sunbonnet, march deliberately into the church, walk with the air of a queen up the aisle, and take her seat upon the pulpit steps. A buzz of disapprobation was heard all over the house, and there fell on the listening ear, 'An abolition affair!\\" \\"Woman's rights and niggers!\\" \\"I told you so!\\" \\"Go it, darkey!\\" . . Again and again, timorous and trembling ones came to me and said, with earnestness, \\"Don't let her speak, Mrs. Gage, it will ruin us. Every newspaper in the land will have our cause mixed up with abolition and niggers, and we shall be utterly denounced.\\" My only answer was, \\"We shall see when the time comes.\\"\\r\\nThe second day the work waxed warm. Methodist, Baptist, Episcopal, Presbyterian, and Universalist minister came in to hear and discuss the resolutions presented. One claimed superior rights and privileges for man, on the ground of \\"superior intellect\\"; another, because of the \\"manhood of Christ; if God had desired the equality of woman, He would have given some token of His will through the birth, life, and death of the Saviour.\\" Another gave us a theological view of the \\"sin of our first mother.\\"\\r\\nThere were very few women in those days who dared to \\"speak in meeting\\"; and the august teachers of the people were seemingly getting the better of us, while the boys in the galleries, and the sneerers among the pews, were hugely enjoying the discomfiture as they supposed, of the \\"strong-minded.\\" Some of the tender-skinned friends were on the point of losing dignity, and the atmosphere betokened a storm. When, slowly from her seat in the corner rose Sojourner Truth, who, till now, had scarcely lifted her head. \\"Don't let her speak!\\" gasped half a dozen in my ear. She moved slowly and solemnly to the front, laid her old bonnet at her feet, and turned her great speaking eyes to me. There was a hissing sound of disapprobation above and below. I rose and announced, \\"Sojourner Truth,\\" and begged the audience to keep silence for a few moments.\\r\\nThe tumult subsided at once, and every eye was fixed on this almost Amazon form, which stood nearly six feet high, head erect, and eyes piercing the upper air like one in a dream. At her first word there was a profound hush. She spoke in deep tones, which, though not loud, reached every ear in the house, and away through the throng at the doors and windows.\\r\\nThe following is the speech as Gage recalled it in History of Woman Suffrage which was, according to her, in the original dialect as it was presented by Sojourner Truth:\\r\\n\\"Wall, chilern, whar dar is so much racket dar must be somethin' out o' kilter. I tink dat 'twixt de niggers of de Souf and de womin at de Norf, all talkin' 'bout rights, de white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what's all dis here talkin' 'bout?\\r\\n\\"Dat man ober dar say dat womin needs to be helped into carriages, and lifted ober ditches, and to hab de best place everywhar. Nobody eber helps me into carriages, or ober mud-puddles, or gibs me any best place!\\" And raising herself to her full height, and her voice to a pitch like rolling thunder, she asked. \\"And a'n't I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! (and she bared her right arm to the shoulder, showing her tremendous muscular power). I have ploughed, and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And a'n't I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a manwhen I could get itand bear de lash as well! And a'n't, I a woman? I have borne thirteen chilern, and seen 'em mos' all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me! And a'n't I a woman?\\r\\n\\"Den dey talks 'bout dis ting in de head; what dis dey call it?\\" (\\"Intellect,\\" whispered some one near.) \\"Dat's it, honey. What's dat got to do wid womin's rights or nigger's rights? If my cup won't hold but a pint, and yourn holds a quart, wouldn't ye be mean not to let me have my little half-measure full?\\" And she pointed her significant finger, and sent a keen glance at the minister who had made the argument. The cheering was long and loud.\\r\\n\\"Den dat little man in black dar, he say women can't have as much rights as men, 'cause Christ wan't a woman! Whar did your Christ come from?\\" Rolling thunder couldn't have stilled that crowd, as did those deep, wonderful tones, as she stood there with outstretched arms and eyes of fire. Raising her voice still louder, she repeated, \\"Whar did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothin' to do wid Him.\\" Oh, what a rebuke that was to that little man.\\r\\nTurning again to another objector, she took up the defense of Mother Eve. I can not follow her through it all. It was pointed, and witty, and solemn; eliciting at almost every sentence deafening applause; and she ended by asserting: \\"If de fust woman God ever made was strong enough to turn de world upside down all alone, dese women togedder (and she glanced her eye over the platform) ought to be able to turn it back, and get it right side up again! And now dey is asking to do it, de men better let 'em.\\" Long-continued cheering greeted this. \\"'Bleeged to ye for hearin' on me, and now ole Sojourner han't got nothin' more to say.\\"[15]\\r\\nGage described the result: \\"Amid roars of applause, she returned to her corner, leaving more than one of us with streaming eyes, and hearts beating with gratitude. She had taken us up in her strong arms and carried us safely over the slough of difficulty turning the whole tide in our favor. I have never in my life seen anything like the magical influence that subdued the mobbish spirit of the day, and turned the sneers and jeers of an excited crowd into notes of respect and admiration. Hundreds rushed up to shake hands with her, and congratulate the glorious old mother, and bid her God-speed on her mission of 'testifyin' agin concerning the wickedness of this 'ere people.'\\"[15]\\r\\nThere is no single, undisputed official version of Truth's speech. Robinson and Truth were friends who had worked together concerning both abolition of slavery and women's rights, and his report is strictly his recollection with no added commentary. Since Robinson's version was published in the Anti-Slavery Bugle, the audience is largely concerned with the rights of African Americans rather than women; it is possible Robinson's version is framed for his audience. Although Truth collaborated with Robinson on the transcription of her speech, Truth did not dictate his writing word for word.[16]\\r\\nThe historically accepted standard version of the speech was written by Gage, but there are no reports of Gage working with Truth on the transcription.[16] Gage portrays Truth as using a Southern dialect, which the earliest reports of the speech do not mention. Truth is said to have prided herself on her spoken English.[17] The dialect in Gage's 1863 version is less severe than in her later version of the speech that she published in 1881. The rearticulation in the different published versions of Gage's writings serve as the metonymic transfiguration of Truth.[18] In addition, the crowd Truth addressed that day consisted of mainly white, privileged women. In Gage's recollection, she describes that the crowd did not want Truth to speak because they did not want people to confuse the cause of suffrage with abolition, despite many reports that Truth was welcomed with respect. Although Gage's version provides further context, it is written as a narrative: she adds her own commentary, creating an entire scene of the event, including the audience reactions. Because Gage's version is built primarily on her interpretation and the way she chose to portray it, it cannot be considered a pure representation of the event.[16]","input":"When was ain't i a woman written?"},{"output":"Benedict Arnold","context":"American Revolutionary War Continental Army:\\r\\nBritish Army\\r\\nThis monument was erected under the patronage of the State of Connecticut in the 55th year of the Independence of the U.S.A. in memory of the brave patriots massacred at Fort Griswold near this spot on the 6th of Sept. AD 1781, when the British, under the command of the Traitor Benedict Arnold, burnt the towns of New London and Groton and spread desolation and woe throughout the region.\\r\\nBenedict Arnold (January 14, 1741 [O.S. January 3, 1740][1][2]?ÿ June 14, 1801) was a general during the American Revolutionary War, who fought for the American Continental Army, and later defected to the British Army. While a general on the American side, he obtained command of the fortifications at West Point, New York (which after 1802 would become the site of the U.S. Military Academy), overlooking the cliffs at the Hudson River (upriver from British-occupied New York City), and planned to surrender them to British forces. This plan was exposed in September 1780. He was commissioned into the British Army as a brigadier general.\\r\\nArnold was born in Connecticut and was a merchant operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775. He joined the growing army outside Boston and distinguished himself through acts of intelligence and bravery. His actions included the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775, defensive and delaying tactics at the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776 (allowing American forces time to prepare New York's defenses), the Battle of Ridgefield, Connecticut (after which he was promoted to major general), operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix, and key actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777, in which he suffered leg injuries that halted his combat career for several years.\\r\\nDespite Arnold's successes, he was passed over for promotion by the Continental Congress, while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments.[3] Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other malfeasance, but most often he was acquitted in formal inquiries. Congress investigated his accounts and concluded that he was indebted to Congress (he also had spent much of his own money on the war effort).[vague] Arnold was frustrated and bitter at this, as well as with the alliance with France and the failure of Congress to accept Britain's 1778 proposal to grant full self-governance in the colonies. He decided to change sides, and opened secret negotiations with the British. In July 1780, he was awarded command of West Point. His scheme was to surrender the fort to the British, but it was exposed when American forces captured British Major John Andr carrying papers which revealed the plot. Upon learning of Andr's capture, Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British sloop-of-war Vulture, narrowly avoiding capture by the forces of George Washington, who had been alerted to the plot.\\r\\nArnold received a commission as a brigadier general in the British Army, an annual pension of S360, and a lump sum of over S6,000.[4] He led British forces on raids in Virginia and against New London and Groton, Connecticut before the war effectively ended with the American victory at Yorktown. In the winter of 1782, he moved to London with his second wife Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Shippen Arnold. He was well received by King George III and the Tories, but frowned upon by the Whigs. In 1787, he returned to the merchant business with his sons Richard and Henry in Saint John, New Brunswick. He returned to London to settle permanently in 1791, where he died ten years later.\\r\\nThe name \\"Benedict Arnold\\" quickly became a byword in the United States for treason or betrayal because he betrayed his countrymen by leading the British army in battle against the men whom he once commanded.[5] His earlier legacy is recalled in the ambiguous nature of some of the memorials that have been placed in his honor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBenedict Arnold was born a British subject, the second of six children to Benedict Arnold (1683ÿ1761) and Hannah Waterman King in Norwich, Connecticut Colony on January 14, 1741.[1][6] He was named after his great-grandfather Benedict Arnold, an early governor of the Colony of Rhode Islandas were his father and grandfather, as well as an older brother who died in infancy.[1] Only Benedict and his sister Hannah survived to adulthood; his other siblings succumbed to yellow fever in childhood.[7] His siblings were, in order of birth: Benedict (August 15, 1738?ÿ April 30, 1739), Hannah (December 9, 1742?ÿ August 11, 1803), Mary (June 4, 1745?ÿ September 10, 1753), Absolom (April 4, 1747?ÿ July 22, 1750), and Elizabeth (November 19, 1749?ÿ September 29, 1755). Arnold was a descendant of John Lothropp through his maternal grandmother, an ancestor of at least six U.S. presidents.[8]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold's father was a successful businessman, and the family moved in the upper levels of Norwich society. When he was ten, Arnold was enrolled in a private school in nearby Canterbury, with the expectation that he would eventually attend Yale. However, the deaths of his siblings two years later may have contributed to a decline in the family fortunes, since his father took up drinking. By the time that he was fourteen, there was no money for private education. His father's alcoholism and ill health kept him from training Arnold in the family mercantile business, but his mother's family connections secured an apprenticeship for him with her cousins Daniel and Joshua Lathrop, who operated a successful apothecary and general merchandise trade in Norwich.[9] His apprenticeship with the Lathrops lasted seven years.[10]\\r\\nArnold was very close to his mother, who died in 1759. His father's alcoholism worsened after her death, and the youth took on the responsibility of supporting his father and younger sister. His father was arrested on several occasions for public drunkenness, was refused communion by his church, and eventually died in 1761.[10]\\r\\nIn 1755, Benedict Arnold was attracted by the sound of a drummer and attempted to enlist in the provincial militia for service against the French, but his mother refused permission.[11] In 1757 when he was sixteen, he did enlist in the Connecticut militia, which marched off toward Albany and Lake George. The French had besieged Fort William Henry in northeastern New York, and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory. Word of the siege's disastrous outcome led the company to turn around; Arnold served for 13 days.[12] A commonly accepted story that Arnold deserted from militia service in 1758[13] is based on uncertain documentary evidence.[14]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold established himself in business in 1762 as a pharmacist and bookseller in New Haven, Connecticut with the help of the Lathrops.[15] He was hardworking and successful, and was able to rapidly expand his business. In 1763, he repaid money borrowed from the Lathrops,[16] repurchased the family homestead that his father had sold when deeply in debt, and re-sold it a year later for a substantial profit. In 1764, he formed a partnership with Adam Babcock, another young New Haven merchant. They bought three trading ships, using the profits from the sale of his homestead, and established a lucrative West Indies trade.\\r\\nDuring this time, Benedict Arnold brought his sister Hannah to New Haven and established her in his apothecary to manage the business in his absence. He traveled extensively in the course of his business throughout New England and from Quebec to the West Indies, often in command of one of his own ships.[17] On one of his voyages, Arnold fought a duel in Honduras with a British sea captain who had called him a \\"damned Yankee, destitute of good manners or those of a gentleman\\".[18][19] The captain was wounded after the first exchange of gunfire, and apologized after Arnold threatened to aim to kill on the second.[20]\\r\\nThe Sugar Act of 1764 and the Stamp Act of 1765 severely curtailed mercantile trade in the colonies.[21] The latter act prompted Arnold to join the chorus of voices in opposition to those taxes, and also led to his entry into the Sons of Liberty, a secret organization that was not afraid to use violence to oppose implementation of those and other unpopular Parliamentary measures.[22] Arnold initially took no part in any public demonstrations but, like many merchants, continued to trade as if the Stamp Act did not exist, in effect becoming a smuggler in defiance of the act. Arnold also faced financial ruin, falling S16,000 in debt, with creditors spreading rumors of his insolvency to the point where he took legal action against them.[23] On the night of January 28, 1767, Arnold and members of his crew, watched by a crowd of Sons of Liberty, roughed up a man suspected of attempting to inform authorities of Arnold's smuggling. Arnold was convicted of a disorderly conduct charge and fined the relatively small amount of 50 shillings; publicity of the case and widespread sympathy for his view probably contributed to the light sentence.[24]\\r\\nOn February 22, 1767, Benedict Arnold married Margaret Mansfield, daughter of Samuel Mansfield, the sheriff of New Haven, an acquaintance that may have been made through the membership of both Mansfield and Arnold in the local Masonic Lodge.[25] Their son Benedict was born the following year,[26] and was followed by brothers Richard in 1769 and Henry in 1772.[25] Margaret died early in the revolution on June 19, 1775, while Arnold was at Fort Ticonderoga following its capture.[27] The household, even while she lived, was dominated by Arnold's sister Hannah. Arnold benefited from his relationship with Mansfield, who became a partner in his business and used his position as sheriff to shield Arnold from creditors.[28]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold was in the West Indies when the Boston Massacre took place on March 5, 1770. He wrote that he was \\"very much shocked\\" and wondered \\"good God, are the Americans all asleep and tamely giving up their liberties, or are they all turned philosophers, that they don't take immediate vengeance on such miscreants?\\"[29]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold began the war as a captain in Connecticut's militia, a position to which he was elected in March 1775. His company marched northeast the following month to assist in the siege of Boston that followed the outbreak of hostilities at Lexington and Concord. Arnold proposed to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety an action to seize Fort Ticonderoga in New York, which he knew was poorly defended. They issued him a colonel's commission on May 3, 1775, and he immediately rode off to the west, arriving at Castleton in the disputed New Hampshire Grants (present-day Vermont) in time to participate with Ethan Allen and his men in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga. He followed up that action with a bold raid on Fort Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River north of Lake Champlain. A Connecticut militia force arrived at Ticonderoga in June; Arnold had a dispute with its commander over control of the fort, and resigned his Massachusetts commission. He was on his way home from Ticonderoga when he learned that his wife had died earlier in June.[30]\\r\\nThe Second Continental Congress authorized an invasion of Quebec, in part on the urging of Arnoldbut he was passed over for command of the expedition. Arnold then went to Cambridge, Massachusetts and suggested to George Washington a second expedition to attack Quebec City via a wilderness route through present-day Maine. Arnold received a colonel's commission in the Continental Army for this expedition. He left Cambridge in September 1775 with 1,100 men. Arnold arrived before Quebec City in November, after a difficult passage in which 300 men turned back and another 200 died en route. He and his men were joined by Richard Montgomery's small army and participated in the December 31 assault on Quebec City in which Montgomery was killed and Arnold's leg was shattered. His chaplain Rev. Samuel Spring carried him to the makeshift hospital at the H?tel Dieu. Arnold was promoted to brigadier general for his role in reaching Quebec, and he maintained an ineffectual siege of the city until he was replaced by Major General David Wooster in April 1776.[31]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold then traveled to Montreal where he served as military commander of the city until forced to retreat by an advancing British army that had arrived at Quebec in May. He presided over the rear of the Continental Army during its retreat from Saint-Jean, where he was reported by James Wilkinson to be the last person to leave before the British arrived. He then directed the construction of a fleet to defend Lake Champlain, which was overmatched and defeated in the October 1776 Battle of Valcour Island. However, his actions at Saint-Jean and Valcour Island played a notable role in delaying the British advance against Ticonderoga until 1777.[32]\\r\\nDuring these actions, Benedict Arnold made a number of friends and a larger number of enemies within the army power structure and in Congress. He had established decent relationships with George Washington, commander of the army, as well as Philip Schuyler and Horatio Gates, both of whom had command of the army's Northern Department during 1775 and 1776.[33] However, an acrimonious dispute with Moses Hazen, commander of the 2nd Canadian Regiment, boiled over into a court martial of Hazen at Ticonderoga during the summer of 1776. Only action by Gates, then Arnold's superior at Ticonderoga, prevented his own arrest on countercharges leveled by Hazen.[34] He also had disagreements with John Brown and James Easton, two lower-level officers with political connections that resulted in ongoing suggestions of improprieties on his part. Brown was particularly vicious, publishing a handbill which claimed of Arnold, \\"Money is this man's God, and to get enough of it he would sacrifice his country\\".[35]\\r\\nGeneral Washington assigned Arnold to the defense of Rhode Island, following the British seizure of Newport in December 1776, where the militia were too poorly equipped to even consider an attack on the British.[36] Arnold took the opportunity to visit his children while near his home in New Haven, and he spent much of the winter socializing in Boston, where he unsuccessfully courted a young belle named Betsy Deblois.[37] In February 1777, he learned that he had been passed over by Congress for promotion to major general. Washington refused his offer to resign, and wrote to members of Congress in an attempt to correct this, noting that \\"two or three other very good officers\\" might be lost if they persisted in making politically motivated promotions.[38]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold was on his way to Philadelphia to discuss his future when he was alerted that a British force was marching toward a supply depot in Danbury, Connecticut. He organized the militia response, along with David Wooster and Connecticut militia General Gold S. Silliman. He led a small contingent of militia attempting to stop or slow the British return to the coast in the Battle of Ridgefield, and was again wounded in his left leg.\\r\\nBenedict Arnold continued on to Philadelphia, where he met with members of Congress about his rank. His action at Ridgefield, coupled with the death of Wooster due to wounds sustained in the action, resulted in Arnold's promotion to major general, although his seniority was not restored over those who had been promoted before him.[39] Amid negotiations over that issue, Arnold wrote out a letter of resignation on July 11, the same day that word arrived in Philadelphia, that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British. Washington refused his resignation and ordered him north to assist with the defense there.[40]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold arrived in Schuyler's camp at Fort Edward, New York on July 24. On August 13, Schuyler dispatched him with a force of 900 to relieve the siege of Fort Stanwix, where he succeeded in the use of a ruse to lift the siege. Arnold had an Indian messenger sent into the camp of British Brigadier General Barry St. Leger with news that the approaching force was much larger and closer than it actually was; this convinced St. Leger's Indian support to abandon him, forcing him to give up the effort.[41]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold then returned to the Hudson, where General Gates had taken over command of the American army, which had by then retreated to a camp south of Stillwater.[42] He then distinguished himself in both Battles of Saratoga, even though General Gates removed him from field command after the first battle, following a series of escalating disagreements and disputes that culminated in a shouting match.[43] During the fighting in the second battle, Arnold operated against Gates' orders and took to the battlefield to lead attacks on the British defenses. He was again severely wounded in the left leg late in the fighting. Arnold himself said that it would have been better had it been in the chest instead of the leg.[44] Burgoyne surrendered ten days after the second battle, on October 17, 1777. In response to Arnold's valor at Saratoga, Congress restored his command seniority.[45] However, Arnold interpreted the manner in which they did so as an act of sympathy for his wounds, and not an apology or recognition that they were righting a wrong.[46]\\r\\nArnold spent several months recovering from his injuries. Rather than allowing his shattered left leg to be amputated, he had it crudely set, leaving it 2 inches (5?cm) shorter than the right. He returned to the army at Valley Forge in May 1778 to the applause of men who had served under him at Saratoga.[47] There he participated in the first recorded Oath of Allegiance along with many other soldiers, as a sign of loyalty to the United States.[48]\\r\\nThe British withdrew from Philadelphia, in June 1778, and Washington appointed Arnold military commander of the city.[49] Even before the Americans reoccupied Philadelphia, Arnold began planning to capitalize financially on the change in power there, engaging in a variety of business deals designed to profit from war-related supply movements and benefiting from the protection of his authority.[50] Such schemes were not exactly uncommon among American officers, but Arnold's schemes were sometimes frustrated by powerful local politicians such as Joseph Reed, who eventually amassed enough evidence to publicly air charges against him. Arnold demanded a court martial to clear the charges, writing to Washington in May 1779, \\"Having become a cripple in the service of my country, I little expected to meet [such] ungrateful returns\\".[51]\\r\\nArnold lived extravagantly in Philadelphia, and was a prominent figure on the social scene. During the summer of 1778, he met Peggy Shippen, the 18-year-old daughter of Judge Edward Shippen, a Loyalist sympathizer who had done business with the British while they occupied the city.[53] Peggy had been courted by British Major John Andr during the British occupation of Philadelphia.[54] Peggy and Arnold married on April 8, 1779.[55] Peggy and her circle of friends had found methods of staying in contact with paramours across the battle lines, despite military bans on communication with the enemy.[56] Some of this communication was effected through the services of Joseph Stansbury, a Philadelphia merchant.[57]\\r\\nAs early as 1778, there were signs that Arnold was unhappy with his situation and pessimistic about the country's future. On November 10, 1778, General Nathanael Greene wrote to General John Cadwalader, \\"I am told General Arnold is become very unpopular among you oweing to his associateing too much with the Tories.\\"[58] A few days later, Greene received a letter from Arnold, where Arnold lamented over the \\"deplorable\\" and \\"horrid\\" situation of the country at that particular moment, citing the depreciating currency, disaffection of the army, and internal fighting in Congress for the country's problems, while predicting \\"impending ruin\\" if things would not soon change.[59]\\r\\nSome time early in May 1779, Arnold met with Joseph Stansbury (whose testimony before a British commission apparently erroneously placed his meeting with Arnold in June). Stansbury said that he then \\"went secretly to New York with a tender of [Arnold's] services to Sir Henry Clinton.\\"[60] Stansbury ignored instructions from Arnold to involve no one else in the plot, and crossed the British lines and went to see Jonathan Odell in New York. Odell was a Loyalist working with William Franklin, the last colonial governor of New Jersey and the son of Benjamin Franklin. On May 9, Franklin introduced Stansbury to Major Andr, who had just been named the British spy chief.[61] This was the beginning of a secret correspondence between Arnold and Andr, sometimes using his wife Peggy as a willing intermediary, that culminated over a year later with Arnold's change of sides.[51]\\r\\nAndr conferred with General Clinton, who gave him broad authority to pursue Arnold's offer. Andr then drafted instructions to Stansbury and Arnold.[62] This initial letter opened a discussion on the types of assistance and intelligence that Arnold might provide, and included instructions for how to communicate in the future. Letters were to be passed through the women's circle that Peggy Arnold was a part of, but only Peggy would be aware that some letters contained instructions that were to be passed on to Andr, written in both code and invisible ink, using Stansbury as the courier.[63]\\r\\nBy July 1779, Benedict Arnold was providing the British with troop locations and strengths, as well as the locations of supply depots, all the while negotiating over compensation. At first, he asked for indemnification of his losses and S10,000, an amount that the Continental Congress had given Charles Lee for his services in the Continental Army.[64] General Clinton was pursuing a campaign to gain control of the Hudson River Valley, and was interested in plans and information on the defenses of West Point and other defenses on the Hudson River. He also began to insist on a face-to-face meeting, and suggested to Arnold that he pursue another high-level command.[65] By October 1779, the negotiations had ground to a halt.[66] Furthermore, Patriot mobs were scouring Philadelphia for Loyalists, and Arnold and the Shippen family were being threatened. Arnold was rebuffed by Congress and by local authorities in requests for security details for himself and his in-laws.[67]\\r\\nThe court martial began meeting on June 1, 1779 to consider the charges against Benedict Arnold, but it was delayed until December 1779 by General Clinton's capture of Stony Point, New York, throwing the army into a flurry of activity to react.[68] Several members on the panel of judges were ill-disposed toward Arnold over actions and disputes earlier in the war, yet Arnold was cleared of all but two minor charges on January 26, 1780.[69] Arnold worked over the next few months to publicize this fact; however, George Washington published a formal rebuke of his behavior in early April, just one week after he had congratulated Arnold on the March 19 birth of his son Edward Shippen Arnold:[70]\\r\\nThe Commander-in-Chief would have been much happier in an occasion of bestowing commendations on an officer who had rendered such distinguished services to his country as Major General Arnold; but in the present case, a sense of duty and a regard to candor oblige him to declare that he considers his conduct [in the convicted actions] as imprudent and improper.[71]\\r\\nShortly after Washington's rebuke, a Congressional inquiry into Arnold's expenditures concluded that he had failed to fully account for his expenditures incurred during the Quebec invasion, and that he owed the Congress some S1,000, largely because he was unable to document them.[72] A significant number of these documents had been lost during the retreat from Quebec. Angry and frustrated, Arnold resigned his military command of Philadelphia in late April.[73]\\r\\nEarly in April, Philip Schuyler had approached Arnold with the possibility of giving him the command at West Point. Discussions had not borne fruit between Schuyler and Washington by early June. Arnold reopened the secret channels with the British, informing them of Schuyler's proposals and including Schuyler's assessment of conditions at West Point. He also provided information on a proposed French-American invasion of Quebec that was to go up the Connecticut River (Arnold did not know that this proposed invasion was a ruse intended to divert British resources). On June 16, Arnold inspected West Point while on his way home to Connecticut to take care of personal business, and he sent a highly detailed report through the secret channel.[74] When he reached Connecticut, Arnold arranged to sell his home there and began transferring assets to London through intermediaries in New York. By early July, he was back in Philadelphia, where he wrote another secret message to Clinton on July 7 which implied that his appointment to West Point was assured and that he might even provide a \\"drawing of the works ... by which you might take [West Point] without loss\\".[75]\\r\\nMajor Andr returned victorious from the Siege of Charleston on June 18, and both he and General Clinton were immediately caught up in this news. Clinton was concerned that Washington's army and the French fleet would join in Rhode Island, and he again fixed on West Point as a strategic point to capture. Andr had spies and informers keeping track of Arnold to verify his movements. Excited by the prospects, Clinton informed his superiors of his intelligence coup, but failed to respond to Arnold's July 7 letter.[76]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold next wrote a series of letters to Clinton, even before he might have expected a response to the July 7 letter. In a July 11 letter, he complained that the British did not appear to trust him, and threatened to break off negotiations unless progress was made. On July 12, he wrote again, making explicit the offer to surrender West Point, although his price rose to S20,000 (in addition to indemnification for his losses), with a S1,000 down payment to be delivered with the response. These letters were delivered by Samuel Wallis, another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British, rather than by Stansbury.[77]\\r\\nOn August 3, 1780, Arnold obtained command of West Point. On August 15, he received a coded letter from Andr with Clinton's final offer: S20,000 and no indemnification for his losses. Neither side knew for some days that the other was in agreement with that offer, due to difficulties in getting the messages across the lines. Arnold's letters continued to detail Washington's troop movements and provide information about French reinforcements that were being organized. On August 25, Peggy finally delivered to him Clinton's agreement to the terms.[78]\\r\\nArnold's command at West Point also gave him authority over the entire American-controlled Hudson River, from Albany down to the British lines outside New York City. While en route to West Point, Arnold renewed an acquaintance with Joshua Hett Smith, who had spied for both sides and who owned a house near the western bank of the Hudson about 15 miles south of West Point.[79]\\r\\nOnce Arnold established himself at West Point, he began systematically weakening its defenses and military strength. Needed repairs were never ordered on the chain across the Hudson. Troops were liberally distributed within Arnold's command area (but only minimally at West Point itself) or furnished to Washington on request. He also peppered Washington with complaints about the lack of supplies, writing, \\"Everything is wanting.\\"[80] At the same time, he tried to drain West Point's supplies so that a siege would be more likely to succeed. His subordinates, some long-time associates, grumbled about Arnold's unnecessary distribution of supplies and eventually concluded that he was selling them on the black market for personal gain.[80]\\r\\nOn August 30, Arnold sent a letter accepting Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to Andr through yet another intermediary: William Heron, a member of the Connecticut Assembly whom he thought he could trust. In an ironic twist, Heron went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold's actions, where he delivered it to the head of the Connecticut militia. General Parsons laid it aside, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of the wife of a prisoner of war.[81] Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.[82]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold and John Andr finally met on September 21 at the Joshua Hett Smith House. On the morning of September 22, the outpost at Verplanck's Point under command of Col. James Livingston fired on HMS Vulture, the ship that was intended to carry Andr back to New York. This action did sufficient damage that she retreated downriver, forcing Andr to return to New York overland. Arnold wrote out passes for Andr so that he would be able to pass through the lines, and also gave him plans for West Point.[83]\\r\\nMajor Andr was captured near Tarrytown on Saturday, September 23 by three Westchester militiamen named John Paulding, Isaac Van Wart, and David Williams.[84] The papers were found exposing the plot to capture West Point and sent to Gen. Washington, and Arnold's intentions came to light after Washington examined them.[85] Meanwhile, Andr convinced the unsuspecting Colonel John Jameson, to whom he was delivered, to send him back to Arnold at West Point. However, Major Benjamin Tallmadge, a member of the Culper Ring established under Washington's orders,[86] insisted that Jameson order the prisoner to be intercepted and brought back. Jameson reluctantly recalled the lieutenant who had been delivering Andr into Arnold's custody, but then sent the same lieutenant as a messenger to notify Arnold of Andr's arrest.[87]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold learned of Andr's capture the following morning, September 24, when he received Jameson's message that Andr was in his custody and that the papers which Andr was carrying had been sent to General Washington. Arnold received Jameson's letter while waiting for Washington, with whom he had planned to have breakfast.[88]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold hastened to the shore and ordered bargemen to row him downriver to where HMS Vulture was anchored, which then took him to New York.[89] From the ship, Arnold wrote a letter to Washington,[90] requesting that Peggy be given safe passage to her family in Philadelphia, a request that Washington granted.[91]\\r\\nWhen presented with evidence of Benedict Arnold's activities, it is reported that Washington remained calm. He did, however, investigate its extent, and suggested that he was willing to exchange Andr for Arnold during negotiations with General Clinton over the fate of Major Andr. Clinton refused this suggestion; after a military tribunal, Andr was hanged at Tappan, New York on October 2. Washington also infiltrated men into New York in an attempt to capture Arnold. This plan very nearly succeeded, but failed when Arnold changed living quarters prior to sailing for Virginia in December.[92]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold justified his actions in an open letter titled To the Inhabitants of America, published in newspapers in October 1780.[93] In the letter to Washington requesting safe passage for Peggy, he wrote, \\"Love to my country actuates my present conduct, however it may appear inconsistent to the world, who very seldom judge right of any man's actions.\\"[90]\\r\\nThe British gave Benedict Arnold a brigadier general's commission, with an annual income of several hundred pounds, but paid him only S6,315 plus an annual pension of S360 because his plot had failed.[4] In December 1780, Arnold led a force of 1,600 troops into Virginia under orders from Clinton, where he captured Richmond by surprise and then went on a rampage through Virginia, destroying supply houses, foundries, and mills.[94] This activity brought out Virginia's militia, led by Colonel Sampson Mathews, and Arnold eventually retreated to Portsmouth to either be evacuated or reinforced.[95]\\r\\nThe pursuing American army included the Marquis de Lafayette, who was under orders from Washington to hang Arnold summarily if he was captured. Reinforcements arrived in late March led by William Phillips (who served under Burgoyne at Saratoga), and Phillips led further raids across Virginia, including a defeat of Baron von Steuben at Petersburg, until his death of fever on May 12, 1781. Arnold commanded the army only until May 20, when Lord Cornwallis arrived with the southern army and took over. One colonel wrote to Clinton of Arnold, \\"there are many officers who must wish some other general in command.\\"[96] Cornwallis ignored advice proffered by Arnold to locate a permanent base away from the coast, advice that might have averted Cornwallis's later surrender at Yorktown.[96]\\r\\nOn his return to New York in June, Benedict Arnold made a variety of proposals for attacks on economic targets to force the Americans to end the war. Clinton was uninterested in most of Arnold's aggressive ideas, but finally authorized Arnold to raid the port of New London, Connecticut. On September 4, not long after the birth of his and Peggy's second son, Arnold's force of over 1,700 men raided and burned New London and captured Fort Griswold, causing damage estimated at $500,000.[97] British casualties were high; nearly one quarter of the force was killed or wounded. Clinton declared that he could ill afford any more such victories.[98]\\r\\nEven before Cornwallis's surrender in October, Benedict Arnold had requested permission from Clinton to go to England to give Lord George Germain his thoughts on the war in person.[99] When word of the surrender reached New York, Arnold renewed the request, which Clinton then granted. On December 8, 1781, Arnold and his family left New York for England.[100]\\r\\nIn London, Benedict Arnold aligned himself with the Tories, advising Germain and King George III to renew the fight against the Americans. In the House of Commons, Edmund Burke expressed the hope that the government would not put Arnold \\"at the head of a part of a British army\\" lest \\"the sentiments of true honour, which every British officer [holds] dearer than life, should be afflicted.\\"[91] To Arnold's detriment, the anti-war Whigs had gained the upper hand in Parliament, and Germain was forced to resign, with the government of Lord North falling not long after.[101]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold then applied to accompany General Carleton, who was going to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief; this request went nowhere.[101] Other attempts all failed to gain positions within the government or the British East India Company over the next few years and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service.[102] His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to that of Major Andr, who was celebrated for his patriotism.\\r\\nOne critic said that Benedict Arnold was a \\"mean mercenary, who, having adopted a cause for the sake of plunder, quits it when convicted of that charge.\\"[101] In turning him down for an East India Company posting, George Johnstone wrote, \\"Although I am satisfied with the purity of your conduct, the generality do not think so. While this is the case, no power in this country could suddenly place you in the situation you aim at under the East India Company.\\"[103]\\r\\nIn 1785, Benedict Arnold and his son Richard moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, where they speculated in land and established a business doing trade with the West Indies. Arnold purchased large tracts of land in the Maugerville area, and acquired city lots in Saint John and Fredericton.[104] Delivery of his first ship the Lord Sheffield was accompanied by accusations from the builder that Arnold had cheated him; Arnold claimed that he had merely deducted the contractually agreed amount when the ship was delivered late.[105] After her first voyage, Arnold returned to London in 1786 to bring his family to Saint John. While there, he disentangled himself from a lawsuit over an unpaid debt that Peggy had been fighting while he was away, paying S900 to settle a S12,000 loan that he had taken while living in Philadelphia.[106] The family moved to Saint John in 1787, where Arnold created an uproar with a series of bad business deals and petty lawsuits.[107] The most serious of these was a slander suit which he won against a former business partner; and following this, townspeople burned him in effigy in front of his house, as Peggy and the children watched.[108] The family left Saint John to return to London in December 1791.[109]\\r\\nIn July 1792, Benedict Arnold fought a bloodless duel with the Earl of Lauderdale after the Earl impugned his honor in the House of Lords.[4] With the outbreak of the French Revolution, Arnold outfitted a privateer, while continuing to do business in the West Indies, even though the hostilities increased the risk. He was imprisoned by French authorities on Guadeloupe amid accusations of spying for the British, and narrowly eluded hanging by escaping to the blockading British fleet after bribing his guards. He helped organize militia forces on British-held islands, receiving praise from the landowners for his efforts on their behalf. He hoped that this work would earn him wider respect and a new command; instead, it earned him and his sons a land-grant of 15,000 acres (6,100?ha) in Upper Canada,[110] near present-day Renfrew, Ontario.[111]\\r\\nIn January 1801, Benedict Arnold's health began to decline.[91] He had suffered from gout since 1775,[112] and the condition attacked his unwounded leg to the point where he was unable to go to sea. The other leg ached constantly, and he walked only with a cane. His physicians diagnosed him as having dropsy, and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition. He died after four days of delirium on June 14, 1801, at the age of 60.[91] Legend has it that, when he was on his deathbed, he said, \\"Let me die in this old uniform in which I fought my battles. May God forgive me for ever having put on another,\\"[113] but this story may be apocryphal.[3] Arnold was buried at St. Mary's Church, Battersea in London, England.[114] As a result of a clerical error in the parish records, his remains were removed to an unmarked mass grave during church renovations a century later.[115] His funeral procession boasted \\"seven mourning coaches and four state carriages\\";[91] the funeral was without military honors.[116]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold left a small estate, reduced in size by his debts, which Peggy undertook to clear.[4][91] Among his bequests were considerable gifts to one John Sage, perhaps an illegitimate son or grandson.[117]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold's contributions to American independence are largely underrepresented in popular culture, while his name became synonymous with traitor, in the 19th century. The demonization of Arnold began immediately after his betrayal became public. Biblical themes were often invoked; Benjamin Franklin wrote that \\"Judas sold only one man, Arnold three millions\\", and Alexander Scammell described Arnold's actions as \\"black as hell\\".[118]\\r\\nIn his home town of Norwich someone scrawled the word \\"Traitor\\" next to his record of birth at City Hall. Additionally, the gravestones of all but his mother were destroyed.[119]\\r\\nEarly biographers attempted to describe Arnold's entire life in terms of treacherous or morally questionable behavior. The first major biography of Arnold was The Life and Treason of Benedict Arnold, published in 1832 by historian Jared Sparks; it was particularly harsh in showing how Arnold's treacherous character was allegedly formed out of childhood experiences.[120] George Canning Hill authored a series of moralistic biographies in the mid-19th century, and began his 1865 biography of Arnold: \\"Benedict, the Traitor, was born...\\".[121]\\r\\nSocial historian Brian Carso notes that, as the 19th century progressed, the story of Arnold's betrayal was portrayed with near-mythical proportions as a part of the national creation story. It was invoked again as sectional conflicts increased in the years before the American Civil War. Washington Irving used it as part of an argument against dismemberment of the union in his 1857 Life of George Washington, pointing out that the unity of New England and the southern states which led to independence was made possible in part by holding West Point.[122] Jefferson Davis and other southern secessionist leaders were unfavorably compared to Arnold, implicitly and explicitly likening the idea of secession to treason. Harper's Weekly published an article in 1861 describing Confederate leaders as \\"a few men directing this colossal treason, by whose side Benedict Arnold shines white as a saint.\\"[123]\\r\\nFictional invocations of Benedict Arnold's name also carried strongly negative overtones. A moralistic children's tale entitled \\"The Cruel Boy\\" was widely circulated in the 19th century. It described a boy who stole eggs from birds' nests, pulled wings off insects, and engaged in other sorts of wanton cruelty, who then grew up to become a traitor to his country.[124] The boy is not identified until the end of the story, when his place of birth is given as Norwich, Connecticut, and his name is given as Benedict Arnold.[125] However, not all depictions of Arnold were so negative. Some theatrical treatments of the 19th century explored his duplicity, seeking to understand rather than demonize it.[126]\\r\\nThe connection between Benedict Arnold and treason continued, into the 20th and 21st centuries. He is a member of the Jury of the Damned in the novel The Devil and Daniel Webster. On an episode of The Brady Bunch, \\"Everyone Can't Be George Washington\\", Peter is assigned the role of Arnold in the school play, and is ostracized.[127] On one of The Simpsons' Halloween specials, \\"Treehouse of Horror IV\\", Arnold is included in a \\"jury of the damned\\" ÿ along with other figures like John Wilkes Booth and Richard Nixon ÿ deliberating the ownership of Homer Simpson's soul. Benedict's ghost, along with the ghosts of John Andre and William Demont, are the villains of the episode \\"The Spirits of '76\\" in the 1976 cartoon The Scooby-Doo Show. He also appeared in an episode of Fairly Oddparents, in which he briefly poses as George Washington in an effort to convince the Founding Fathers to sign the \\"Declaration of Surrenderance\\" to Great Britain.\\r\\nFormer WWE announcer Gorilla Monsoon would call a wrestler a \\"Benedict Arnold\\" if they turned heel on their tag team partner or the person with whom they were portrayed onscreen as being friends.\\r\\nDan Gilbert, owner of the National Basketball Association's Cleveland Cavaliers, subtly invoked Arnold in 2010, upset over LeBron James's announcement of leaving the team. Gilbert's company lowered the price of posters bearing James's likeness to $17.41, referring to the year of Arnold's birth.[128][129]\\r\\nNovels related to the American Revolutionary war sometimes feature Benedict Arnold as a character. Kenneth Roberts' Arundel series treats him more positively, covering his military campaigns.\\r\\nCanadian historians have treated Benedict Arnold as a relatively minor figure. His difficult time in New Brunswick led historians to summarize it as full of \\"controversy, resentment, and legal entanglements\\" and to conclude that he was disliked by both Americans and Loyalists.[130] Historian Barry Wilson points out that Arnold's descendants ended up establishing deep roots in the country, becoming leading settlers in Upper Canada and later in lands further west, where they established settlements in Saskatchewan.[131] His descendants who adopted the Arnold surname are spread across Canada, most of all those of John Sage.[132] His long woollen British scarlet military jacket with a buff lining continues to be owned by descendants; as of 2001, it was held in Saskatchewan. It has reportedly been passed in each generation to the eldest male of the family.[133]\\r\\nDuring his marriage to Margaret Mansfield, Benedict Arnold had three sons, all of whom later served in the British Army:[134][135]\\r\\nand with Peggy Shippen, he raised a family also active in the British Army:\\r\\nThere is a memorial to Benedict Arnold on the Saratoga battlefield, now preserved within Saratoga National Historical Park, that does not mention his name, donated by Civil War General John Watts DePeyster. The inscription on the Boot Monument reads: \\"In memory of the most brilliant soldier of the Continental army, who was desperately wounded on this spot, winning for his countrymen the decisive battle of the American Revolution, and for himself the rank of Major General.\\"[136] The victory monument at Saratoga has four niches, three of which are occupied by statues of Generals Gates, Schuyler, and Morgan. The fourth niche is empty.[137]\\r\\nThere are plaques on the grounds of the United States Military Academy at West Point commemorating all of the generals who served in the Revolution. One plaque bears only a rank and a date but no name: \\"major general...born 1740\\".[2][120]\\r\\nA historical marker in Danvers, Massachusetts commemorates Benedict Arnold's 1775 expedition to Quebec.[138] There are also historical markers bearing his name at Wyman Lake Rest Area on US-201 north of Moscow, Maine, on the western bank of Lake Champlain, New York, and two in Skowhegan, Maine.[139]\\r\\nThe house where Benedict Arnold lived at 62 Gloucester Place in central London bears a plaque describing Arnold as an \\"American Patriot\\".[140] He was buried at St Mary's Church, Battersea, England which has a commemorative stained glass window added between 1976 and 1982.[141] The faculty club at the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton has a Benedict Arnold Room in which framed original letters written by Arnold hang on the walls.","input":"Who was the traitor during the revolutionary war?"},{"output":"a cross between the Cornish Game and White Plymouth Rock chicken","context":"In the United States, a Cornish game hen, also sometimes called a Cornish hen, poussin, Rock Cornish hen, or simply Rock Cornish, is a hybrid chicken sold whole. Despite the name, it is not a game bird.  Rather, it is a broiler chicken, the most common strain of commercially raised meat chickens.  Though the bird is called a \\"hen\\", it can be either male or female.  A Cornish hen typically commands a higher price per pound than typically sold chickens, despite a shorter growing span of 28 to 30 days, as opposed to 42 or more for regular chicken.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rock Cornish game hen or Rock Cornish hen is a cross between the Cornish Game and White Plymouth Rock chicken breeds.[1] This breed develops a large breast over a short period of time compared to game hens.[1] Rock Cornish game hens weigh about 2.5 pounds (1.1 kilograms) after four to six weeks, at which time they are slaughtered.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Department of Agriculture describes the Rock Cornish game hen or Cornish game hen as \\"a young immature chicken (less than five weeks of age), weighing not more than two pounds ready-to-cook weight, which was prepared from a Cornish chicken or the progeny of a Cornish chicken crossed with another breed of chicken.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost credit Alphonsine \\"Therese\\" and Jacques Makowsky of Connecticut for developing the small bird in the mid-1950s.

It spanned centuries, and consisted of efforts by numerous people and expeditions from various foreign countries to map the continent. The European colonization of the Americas followed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Sagas of Icelanders, Norse sailors (often called Vikings) from Iceland first settled Greenland in the 980s. Erik the Red explored and settled southwestern Greenland, which he named to entice potential Icelandic settlers, eventually establishing the Eastern and Western Settlements, which were abandoned around 1350.\\r\\nL'Anse aux Meadows, an archaeological site on the northernmost tip of Newfoundland, and a second site in southwestern Newfoundland, are the only known sites of a Norse village in North America outside of Greenland. These sites are notable for their possible connections with the attempted colony of Vinland established by Leif Erikson in 1003.\\r\\nThe Viking voyages did not become common knowledge in the Old World, and Europeans remained ignorant of the existence of the Americas as a whole, until the first decades following the year 1492. Many expeditions were launched from European nations in search of a Northwest Passage to East Asia (or \\"the Indies\\" as the region was called) in order to establish a shorter trade route to China than the Silk Road, a trade route which had become desperately needed and yet exacerbated by the Fall of Constantinople. Also, the Castilian crown needed an alternative to the Portuguese controlled eastern maritime trade route around Africa to India and East Asia.\\r\\nOn August 3, 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail from the Port of Palos de la Frontera in the Province of Huelva, from the newly los Reyes Cat܇licos coordinated Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, in present-day Spain, financed by Queen Isabella I of Castille. Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage of his discovery of the Bahamas, Cuba, and Hispaniola spread the news across Europe quickly. Columbus rediscovered and explored much of the Lesser Antilles in his second voyage then discovered both Trinidad and Tobago on his third voyage whilst skirting the northern South American coast. His fourth voyage was spent scanning the Central American coast. The Voyages of Christopher Columbus opened the New World.\\r\\nItalian navigator and explorer Giovanni Caboto (known in English as John Cabot) is credited with the discovery of continental North America on June 24, 1497, under the commission of Henry VII of England. Though the exact location of his discovery remains disputed, the Canadian and United Kingdom governments' official position is that he landed on the island of Newfoundland. The English presence through Giovanni Caboto was signaled in Juan de la Cosa's map of 1500.\\r\\nIn 1499 Jo?o Fernandes Lavrador was licensed by the King of Manuel I of Portugal and together with Pro de Barcelos they reached Greenland and sighted Labrador for the first time since Leif Erikson, which was granted and named after Lavrador. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.[1] Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 the brothers Gaspar and Miguel Corte Real explored and named the coasts of Greenland, Labrador and also Newfoundland, naming \\"Terra Verde\\" the explored North American coasts.[2] Both explorations were signaled in 1502 Cantino planisphere.\\r\\nIt was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia, but rather found what was to Europeans a New World, which in 1507 was named \\"America\\", probably after Amerigo Vespucci, on the Waldseemller map.\\r\\nIn 1500, Pedro lvares Cabral was sent by Portugal to explore South America. He is considered to be the discoverer of Brazil.\\r\\nAragon King Ferdinand II sent Juan Ponce de Le܇n from the fledgling colony on Hispaniola to verify rumors of undiscovered land to the northwest. On April 2, 1513, Ponce de Le܇n disembarked on the northeast coast of what he named Florida for the crown. The exact location is disputed, but historians have offered the possibilities of St. Augustine, Ponce de Le܇n Inlet, and Melbourne Beach. He encountered the powerful Gulf Stream and found a passage through the Florida Keys to land on the southwestern Gulf Coast of Florida on the Gulf of Mexico. Again, the exact location is disputed.[3] While it is true that Columbus visited Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in 1493, Ponce de Leon was the first known European to reach the present-day United States (mainland).[4]\\r\\nOn September 25, 1513, Spanish conquistador Vasco N~?ez de Balboa was the first European to see the Pacific Ocean once he crossed the Isthmus of Panama. He claimed all the territory touching it for the Crown, later to affect colonization of Las Californias.\\r\\nAround 1519-1521, Portuguese explorer Jo?o lvares Fagundes explored the coasts of Newfoundland, Labrador and Nova Scotia, with a mission to create colonies.\\r\\nIn 1524, Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed for King Francis I of France and is known as the first European since the Norse to explore the Atlantic coast of North America. Arriving near the Cape Fear River delta, he explored the coastlines of present-day states of South Carolina and North Carolina, entering the Pamlico Sound, and bypassing entrances to the Chesapeake Bay. Believing the New York Harbor to be a lake, he sailed past Long Island, exploring Narragansett Bay and Newfoundland.\\r\\nIn 1524-1525, Portuguese explorer Estev?o Gomes, on behalf of Charles I of Spain, explored present-day Nova Scotia sailing South along the Maine coast. Gomes entered New York Harbor and saw the Hudson River(which he named the \\"San Antonio River\\"). Because of his expedition, the 1529 Diogo Ribeiro world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly.\\r\\nIn 1534, Jacques Cartier planted a cross in the Gasp Peninsula, on the Gulf Gulf of Saint Lawrence and claimed the land in the name of Francis I. In 1535 Cartier explored the St. Lawrence river and also claimed the region for France.\\r\\nAfter two failed attempts to reach East Asia by circumnavigating Siberia, Henry Hudson sailed west in 1609 under the Dutch East India Company. He, too, passed Cape Cod, Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware Bay, instead sailing up the Hudson River on September 11, 1609 in search of a fabled connection to the Pacific via what was actually the Great Lakes. In Hudson's fourth and final voyage, he discovered, mapped, and explored the Hudson Strait, Hudson Bay and James Bay.\\r\\nOther major sea-based explorers were Captain James Cook, George Vancouver, and Charles Wilkes.\\r\\nThere were numerous Spanish explorers and conquistadors who explored the Southwest of North America (including present-day west and central United States) and cross the continent (east to west) in its southern regions, mainly from the second quarter to the middle of the 16th century, such as lvar N~?ez Cabeza de Vaca and Francisco Vsquez de Coronado, but also the North American Southeast and south-central regions, s Soto]].\\r\\nIn 1608 Samuel de Champlain founded what is now Quebec City, which would become the first permanent settlement and the capital of New France. He took personal administration over the city and its affairs, and sent out expeditions to explore the interior. Champlain himself discovered Lake Champlain in 1609. By 1615, he had travelled by canoe up the Ottawa River through Lake Nipissing and Georgian Bay to the centre of Huron country near Lake Simcoe. During these voyages, Champlain aided the Wendat (aka 'Hurons') in their battles against the Iroquois Confederacy. As a result, the Iroquois would become enemies of the French and be involved in multiple conflicts.\\r\\nFrom 1679 to 1682 Ren-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle explored the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, and the entire course of Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.\\r\\nFrom 1697 to 1702 Eusebio Kino explored the Sonoran Desert and on his journey to the Colorado River Delta discovered an overland route to Baja California that was then commonly believed to be an island. In 1683 Kino lead the first European overland crossing of Baja California.\\r\\nEuropean exploration of western Canada was largely motivated by the fur trade and the search for the elusive Northwest Passage. Hudson's Bay Company explorer Henry Kelsey has the distinction of being the first European to see the northern Great Plains in 1690.\\r\\nAnthony Henday was the first to have seen the Rocky Mountains, in 1754, but curiously did not mention it in his journals. From his westernmost geographic position (roughly near the town of Olds, Alberta, halfway between Calgary and Red Deer, Alberta) the Rockies should have been quite conspicuous, but he was likely trying to disguise the disappointing fact that an unknown range of seemingly impassible mountains now stood between the HBC and the Pacific. Samuel Hearne found the Coppermine River in 1769-71 in his failed search for copper ore deposits. Burned by these shortfalls, the HBC largely quit exploration.\\r\\nThe North West Company, on the other hand, used a business model that required constant expansion into untapped areas. Under the auspices of the NWC, Alexander Mackenzie discovered the Mackenzie River in 1789 and was the first European to reach the North-American Pacific overland, via the Bella Coola River, in 1793. Simon Fraser reached the Pacific in 1808 via the Fraser River.\\r\\nDavid Thompson, widely regarded as the greatest land geographer that ever lived, traveled over 90,000?km during his lifetime. In 1797, Thompson was sent south by his employers to survey part of the Canada-U.S. boundary along the water routes from Lake Superior to Lake of the Woods to satisfy unresolved questions of territory arising from the Jay Treaty between Great Britain and the United States. By 1798 Thompson had completed a survey of 6,750?km (4,190?mi) from Grand Portage, through Lake Winnipeg, to the headwaters of the Assiniboine and Mississippi Rivers, as well as two sides of Lake Superior.[5] In 1798, the company sent him to Red Deer Lake (in present-day Alberta) to establish a trading post. The English translation of Lac La Biche-Red Deer Lake-first appeared on the Mackenzie map of 1793.[6] Thompson spent the next few seasons trading based in Fort George (now in Alberta), and during this time led several expeditions into the Rocky Mountains. In 1811/1812 he followed the Columbia River to the Pacific, and in 1814 used his notes and measurements to draft the first European-style map of western Canada, covering 3.9 million square kilometres.\\r\\nLewis and Clark were the first Americans to venture into the newly acquired territory of the Louisiana Purchase, at the order of President Thomas Jefferson. They discovered many new geographical features, Indian tribes, and animal and plant species. John Colter was a member of the expedition who subsequently became a guide for others in the 'Old West,' and did some explorations of his own.\\r\\nJohn C. Frmont led many important explorations in the Great Plains, Great Basin, Oregon territory, and Mexican Alta California.\\r\\nJoseph Reddeford Walker was one of the most prominent of the explorers, and charted many new paths through the West, which often were then utilized by emigrants crossing to settle in Western towns and communities. In 1833, his exploring party discovered a route along the Humboldt River across present-day Nevada, ascending the Sierra Nevada following the Carson River and descending via Stanislaus River drainages to Monterey. His return route across the southern Sierra was via Walker Pass, named after Walker by John Charles Fremont. The approach of the Sierra via the Carson River route later became known as the California Trail, the primary route for the emigrants to the gold fields during the California gold rush.\\r\\nAs the American population of the West increased, the US government launched ongoing official explorations mainly through the US Army Corps of Topographical Engineers. One of the main officers and explorers in this unit was George Wheeler. In 1872, the US Congress authorized an ambitious plan to map the portion of the United States west of the 100th meridian at a scale of 8?miles to the inch. This plan necessitated what became known as the Wheeler Survey, along with the Clarence King and John Wesley Powell Surveys, and expeditions by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. In 1879, all such efforts were reorganized as the United States Geological Survey.\\r\\nUniversalis Cosmographia, the Waldseemller map dated 1507, depicts the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean separating Asia from the Americas.\\r\\nThe Vinland map surfaced in 1965 and is claimed, though widely discredited, to be a 15th-century map depicting the Norse colony of Vinland.","input":"Who was the first european to reach america?"},{"output":"2,008 sailors","context":"Coordinates: 2122N 15757W? / ?21.367N 157.950W? / 21.367; -157.950\\r\\nMajor Japanese tactical victory; precipitated the entrance of the United States into World War II\\r\\nSoutheast Asia\\r\\nSouthwest Pacific\\r\\nNorth America\\r\\nJapan\\r\\nManchuria\\r\\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor,[9] led to the United States' entry into World War II. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI,[10][11] and as Operation Z during its planning.[12]\\r\\nJapan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions they planned in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the next seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong.[13]\\r\\nThe attack commenced at 7:48?a.m. Hawaiian Time (18:18 UTC).[14] The base was attacked by 353[15] Imperial Japanese aircraft (including fighters, level and dive bombers, and torpedo bombers) in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers.[15] All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four sunk. All but the USS?Arizona were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship,[nb 4] and one minelayer. 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded.[17] Important base installations such as the power station, dry dock, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section), were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 64 servicemen killed. One Japanese sailor, Kazuo Sakamaki, was captured.\\r\\nThe surprise attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan,[18][19] and several days later, on December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. The U.S. responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940,[20] disappeared.[19]\\r\\nThere were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan, but the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, \\"a date which will live in infamy\\". Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning, the attack on Pearl Harbor was later judged in the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime.[21][22]\\r\\nWar between Japan and the United States had been a possibility that each nation had been aware of (and developed contingency plans for) since the 1920s, though tensions did not begin to grow seriously until Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria. Over the next decade, Japan continued to expand into China, leading to all-out war between those countries in 1937. Japan spent considerable effort trying to isolate China and achieve sufficient resource independence to attain victory on the mainland; the \\"Southern Operation\\" was designed to assist these efforts.[23]\\r\\nFrom December 1937, events such as the Japanese attack on USS Panay, the Allison incident, and the Nanking Massacre (the International Military Tribunal of the Far East concluded that more than 200,000 Chinese non-combatants were killed in indiscriminate massacres, though other estimates have ranged from 40,000 to more than 300,000) swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan. Fearing Japanese expansion,[24] the United States, the United Kingdom, and France provided loan assistance for war supply contracts to China.\\r\\nIn 1940, Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort to control supplies reaching China. The United States halted shipments of airplanes, parts, machine tools, and aviation gasoline to Japan, which was perceived by Japan as an unfriendly act.[nb 5] The U.S. did not stop oil exports to Japan at that time in part because prevailing sentiment in Washington was that such an action would be an extreme step that Japan would likely consider a provocation, given Japanese dependence on U.S. oil.[26][27]\\r\\nEarly in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved the Pacific Fleet to Hawaii from its previous base in San Diego and ordered a military buildup in the Philippines in the hope of discouraging Japanese aggression in the Far East. Because the Japanese high command was (mistakenly) certain that any attack on the UK's Southeast Asian colonies, including Singapore,[28] would bring the U.S. into war, a devastating preventive strike appeared to be the only way to avoid U.S. naval interference.[29] An invasion of the Philippines was also considered necessary by Japanese war planners. The U.S. War Plan Orange had envisioned defending the Philippines with a 40,000-man elite force. This was opposed by Douglas MacArthur, who felt that he would need a force ten times that size, and was never implemented.[30] By 1941, U.S. planners anticipated abandonment of the Philippines at the outbreak of war and orders to that effect were given in late 1941 to Admiral Thomas Hart, commander of the Asiatic Fleet.[31]\\r\\nThe U.S. ceased oil exports to Japan in July 1941, following Japanese expansion into French Indochina after the Fall of France, in part because of new American restrictions on domestic oil consumption.[32] This in turn caused the Japanese to proceed with plans to take the Dutch East Indies, an oil-rich territory.[nb 6] On August 17, Roosevelt warned Japan that the U.S. was prepared to take steps against Japan if it attacked \\"neighboring countries\\".[34] The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of Southeast Asia.\\r\\nJapan and the U.S. engaged in negotiations during the course of 1941 in an effort to improve relations. During these negotiations, Japan offered to withdraw from most of China and Indochina when peace was made with the Nationalist government, adopt an independent interpretation of the Tripartite Pact, and not to discriminate in trade provided all other countries reciprocated. Washington rejected these proposals. Japanese Prime Minister Konoye then offered to meet with Roosevelt, but Roosevelt insisted on coming to an agreement before any meeting.[35] The U.S. ambassador to Japan repeatedly urged Roosevelt to accept the meeting, warning that it was the only way to preserve the conciliatory Konoye government and peace in the Pacific.[36] His recommendation was not acted upon. The Konoye government collapsed the following month when the Japanese military refused to agree to the withdrawal of all troops from China.[37]\\r\\nJapan's final proposal, on November 20, offered to withdraw their forces from southern Indochina and not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia provided that the U.S., the UK, and the Netherlands ceased aiding China and lifted their sanctions against Japan.[37] The American counter-proposal of November 26 (November 27 in Japan) (the Hull note) required Japan to evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with Pacific powers. However the day before the Hull Note was delivered, on November 26 in Japan, the main Japanese attack fleet left port for Pearl Harbor.\\r\\nPreliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the \\"Southern Resource Area\\" (the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally) had begun very early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, then commanding Japan's Combined Fleet.[38] He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff only after much contention with Naval Headquarters, including a threat to resign his command.[39] Full-scale planning was underway by early spring 1941, primarily by Rear Admiral Rynosuke Kusaka, with assistance from Captain Minoru Genda and Yamamoto's Deputy Chief of Staff, Captain Kameto Kuroshima.[40] The planners studied the 1940 British air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto intensively.[nb 7][nb 8]\\r\\nOver the next several months, pilots were trained, equipment was adapted, and intelligence was collected. Despite these preparations, Emperor Hirohito did not approve the attack plan until November 5, after the third of four Imperial Conferences called to consider the matter.[43] Final authorization was not given by the emperor until December 1, after a majority of Japanese leaders advised him the \\"Hull Note\\" would \\"destroy the fruits of the China incident, endanger Manchukuo and undermine Japanese control of Korea.\\"[44]\\r\\nBy late 1941, many observers believed that hostilities between the U.S. and Japan were imminent. A Gallup poll just before the attack on Pearl Harbor found that 52% of Americans expected war with Japan, 27% did not, and 21% had no opinion.[45] While U.S. Pacific bases and facilities had been placed on alert on many occasions, U.S. officials doubted Pearl Harbor would be the first target; instead, they expected the Philippines would be attacked first. This presumption was due to the threat that the air bases throughout the country and the naval base at Manila posed to sea lanes, as well as to the shipment of supplies to Japan from territory to the south.[46] They also incorrectly believed that Japan was not capable of mounting more than one major naval operation at a time.[47]\\r\\nThe Japanese attack had several major aims. First, it intended to destroy important American fleet units, thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya and to enable Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference. Second, it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 Vinson-Walsh Act erased any chance of victory.[48][49] Third, to deliver a blow to America's ability to mobilize its forces in the Pacific, battleships were chosen as the main targets, since they were the prestige ships of any navy at the time.[48] Finally, it was hoped that the attack would undermine American morale such that the U.S. government would drop its demands contrary to Japanese interests, and would seek a compromise peace with Japan.[50][51]\\r\\nStriking the Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor carried two distinct disadvantages: the targeted ships would be in very shallow water, so it would be relatively easy to salvage and possibly repair them; and most of the crews would survive the attack, since many would be on shore leave or would be rescued from the harbor. A further important disadvantagethis of timing, and known to the Japanesewas the absence from Pearl Harbor of all three of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's aircraft carriers (Enterprise, Lexington, and Saratoga). IJN top command was so imbued with Admiral Mahan's \\"Decisive battle\\" doctrineespecially that of destroying the maximum number of battleshipsthat, despite these concerns, Yamamoto decided to press ahead.[52][page?needed]\\r\\nJapanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short, victorious war also meant other targets in the harbor, especially the navy yard, oil tank farms, and submarine base, were ignored, sinceby their thinkingthe war would be over before the influence of these facilities would be felt.[53]\\r\\nOn November 26, 1941, a Japanese task force (the Striking Force) of six aircraft carriersAkagi, Kaga, Sry, Hiry, Shkaku, and Zuikakudeparted northern Japan en route to a position northwest of Hawaii, intending to launch its 408 aircraft to attack Pearl Harbor: 360 for the two attack waves and 48 on defensive combat air patrol (CAP), including nine fighters from the first wave.\\r\\nThe first wave was to be the primary attack, while the second wave was to attack carriers as its first objective and cruisers as its second, with battleships as the third target.[54] The first wave carried most of the weapons to attack capital ships, mainly specially adapted Type 91 aerial torpedoes which were designed with an anti-roll mechanism and a rudder extension that let them operate in shallow water.[55] The aircrews were ordered to select the highest value targets (battleships and aircraft carriers) or, if these were not present, any other high value ships (cruisers and destroyers). First wave dive bombers were to attack ground targets. Fighters were ordered to strafe and destroy as many parked aircraft as possible to ensure they did not get into the air to intercept the bombers, especially in the first wave. When the fighters' fuel got low they were to refuel at the aircraft carriers and return to combat. Fighters were to serve CAP duties where needed, especially over U.S. airfields.[citation needed]\\r\\nBefore the attack commenced, two reconnaissance aircraft launched from cruisers Chikuma and Tone were sent to scout over Oahu and Maui and report on U.S. fleet composition and location. Reconnaissance aircraft flights risked alerting the U.S.,[56] and were not necessary. U.S. fleet composition and preparedness information in Pearl Harbor was already known due to the reports of the Japanese spy Takeo Yoshikawa. A report of the absence of the U.S. fleet in Lahaina anchorage off Maui was received from the fleet submarine I-72.[57] Another four scout planes patrolled the area between the Japanese carrier force (the Kid Butai) and Niihau, to detect any counterattack.[58]\\r\\nFleet submarines I-16, I-18, I-20, I-22, and I-24 each embarked a Type A midget submarine for transport to the waters off Oahu.[59] The five I-boats left Kure Naval District on November 25, 1941.[60] On December 6, they came to within 10?nmi (19?km; 12?mi) of the mouth of Pearl Harbor[61] and launched their midget subs at about 01:00[clarification needed] on December 7.[62] At 03:42[63] Hawaiian Time, the minesweeper Condor spotted a midget submarine periscope southwest of the Pearl Harbor entrance buoy and alerted the destroyer Ward.[64] The midget may have entered Pearl Harbor. However, Ward sank another midget submarine at 06:37[64][nb 9] in the first American shots in the Pacific Theater. A midget submarine on the north side of Ford Island missed the seaplane tender Curtiss with her first torpedo and missed the attacking destroyer Monaghan with her other one before being sunk by Monaghan at 08:43.[64]\\r\\nA third midget submarine, Ha-19, grounded twice, once outside the harbor entrance and again on the east side of Oahu, where it was captured on December 8.[66] Ensign Kazuo Sakamaki swam ashore and was captured by Hawaii National Guard Corporal David Akui, becoming the first Japanese prisoner of war.[nb 10] A fourth had been damaged by a depth charge attack and was abandoned by its crew before it could fire its torpedoes.[67] Japanese forces received a radio message from a midget submarine at 00:41 on December 8 claiming damage to one or more large warships inside Pearl Harbor.[68]\\r\\nIn 1992, 2000, and 2001, Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory's submersibles found the wreck of the fifth midget submarine lying in three parts outside Pearl Harbor. The wreck was in the debris field where much surplus U.S. equipment was dumped after the war, including vehicles and landing craft. Both of its torpedoes were missing. This correlates with reports of two torpedoes fired at the light cruiser St. Louis at 10:04 at the entrance of Pearl Harbor, and a possible torpedo fired at destroyer Helm at 08:21.[69]\\r\\nThe attack took place before any formal declaration of war was made by Japan, but this was not Admiral Yamamoto's intention. He originally stipulated that the attack should not commence until thirty minutes after Japan had informed the United States that peace negotiations were at an end.[citation needed] However, the attack began before the notice could be delivered. Tokyo transmitted the 5000-word notification (commonly called the \\"14-Part Message\\") in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington. Transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it on schedule; in the event, it was not presented until more than an hour after the attack began. (In fact, U.S. code breakers had already deciphered and translated most of the message hours before he was scheduled to deliver it.)[70] The final part is sometimes described as a declaration of war. While it was viewed by a number of senior U.S government and military officials as a very strong indicator negotiations were likely to be terminated[71] and that war might break out at any moment,[72] it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations. A declaration of war was printed on the front page of Japan's newspapers in the evening edition of December 8,[73] but not delivered to the U.S. government until the day after the attack.\\r\\nFor decades, conventional wisdom held that Japan attacked without first formally breaking diplomatic relations only because of accidents and bumbling that delayed the delivery of a document hinting at war to Washington. In 1999, however, Takeo Iguchi, a professor of law and international relations at International Christian University in Tokyo, discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how, and indeed whether, to notify Washington of Japan's intention to break off negotiations and start a war, including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying, \\"[O]ur deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success.\\" Of this, Iguchi said, \\"The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war, or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations?... and they clearly prevailed.\\"[74][75]\\r\\nIn any event, even if the Japanese had decoded and delivered the 14-Part Message before the beginning of the attack, it would not have constituted either a formal break of diplomatic relations or a declaration of war. The final two paragraphs of the message read:\\r\\nThus the earnest hope of the Japanese Government to adjust Japanese-American relations and to preserve and promote the peace of the Pacific through cooperation with the American Government has finally been lost.\\r\\nThe first attack wave of 183 planes was launched north of Oahu, led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida.[77] Six planes failed to launch due to technical difficulties.[58] It included:[nb 11]\\r\\nAs the first wave approached Oahu, it was detected by the U.S. Army SCR-270 radar at Opana Point near the island's northern tip. This post had been in training mode for months, but was not yet operational.[80] The operators, Privates George Elliot Jr. and Joseph Lockard, reported a target.[81] But Lieutenant Kermit A. Tyler, a newly assigned officer at the thinly manned Intercept Center, presumed it was the scheduled arrival of six B-17 bombers from California. The Japanese planes were approaching from a direction very close (only a few degrees difference) to the bombers,[82] and while the operators had never seen a formation as large on radar, they neglected to tell Tyler of its size.[83] Tyler, for security reasons, could not tell the operators of the six B-17s that were due (even though it was widely known).[83]\\r\\nAs the first wave planes approached Oahu, they encountered and shot down several U.S. aircraft. At least one of these radioed a somewhat incoherent warning. Other warnings from ships off the harbor entrance were still being processed or awaiting confirmation when the attacking planes began bombing and strafing. Nevertheless, it is not clear any warnings would have had much effect even if they had been interpreted correctly and much more promptly. The results the Japanese achieved in the Philippines were essentially the same as at Pearl Harbor, though MacArthur had almost nine hours warning that the Japanese had already attacked Pearl Harbor.\\r\\nThe air portion of the attack began at 7:48?a.m. Hawaiian Time[14] (3:18?a.m. December 8 Japanese Standard Time, as kept by ships of the Kido Butai),[84][nb 12] with the attack on Kaneohe. A total of 353[15] Japanese planes in two waves reached Oahu. Slow, vulnerable torpedo bombers led the first wave, exploiting the first moments of surprise to attack the most important ships present (the battleships), while dive bombers attacked U.S. air bases across Oahu, starting with Hickam Field, the largest, and Wheeler Field, the main U.S. Army Air Forces fighter base. The 171 planes in the second wave attacked the Army Air Forces' Bellows Field near Kaneohe on the windward side of the island, and Ford Island. The only aerial opposition came from a handful of P-36 Hawks, P-40 Warhawks, and some SBD Dauntless dive bombers from the carrier Enterprise.[nb 13]\\r\\nIn the first wave attack, about eight of the forty-nine 800?kg (1760?lb) armor-piercing bombs dropped hit their intended battleship targets. At least two of those bombs broke up on impact, another detonated before penetrating an unarmored deck, and one was a dud. Thirteen of the forty torpedoes hit battleships, and four torpedoes hit other ships.[85] Men aboard U.S. ships awoke to the sounds of alarms, bombs exploding, and gunfire, prompting bleary-eyed men to dress as they ran to General Quarters stations. (The famous message, \\"Air raid Pearl Harbor. This is not drill.\\",[nb 14] was sent from the headquarters of Patrol Wing Two, the first senior Hawaiian command to respond.) The defenders were very unprepared. Ammunition lockers were locked, aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip in the open to prevent sabotage,[86] guns unmanned (none of the Navy's 5\\"/38s, only a quarter of its machine guns, and only four of 31 Army batteries got in action).[86] Despite this low alert status, many American military personnel responded effectively during the attack.[nb 15] Ensign Joe Taussig Jr., aboard Nevada, commanded the ship's antiaircraft guns and was severely wounded, but continued to be on post. Lt. Commander F. J. Thomas commanded Nevada in the captain's absence and got her under way until the ship was grounded at 9:10?a.m.[87] One of the destroyers, Aylwin, got underway with only four officers aboard, all ensigns, none with more than a year's sea duty; she operated at sea for 36 hours before her commanding officer managed to get back aboard.[88] Captain Mervyn Bennion, commanding West Virginia, led his men until he was cut down by fragments from a bomb which hit Tennessee, moored alongside.\\r\\nThe second planned wave consisted of 171 planes: 54 B5Ns, 81 D3As, and 36 A6Ms, commanded by Lieutenant-Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki.[78] Four planes failed to launch because of technical difficulties.[58] This wave and its targets comprised:[78]\\r\\nThe second wave was divided into three groups. One was tasked to attack Kne?ohe, the rest Pearl Harbor proper. The separate sections arrived at the attack point almost simultaneously from several directions.\\r\\nNinety minutes after it began, the attack was over. 2,008 sailors were killed and 710 others wounded; 218 soldiers and airmen (who were part of the Army until the independent U.S. Air Force was formed in 1947) were killed and 364 wounded; 109 marines were killed and 69 wounded; and 68 civilians were killed and 35 wounded. In total, 2,403 Americans died and 1,178 were wounded.[89] Eighteen ships were sunk or run aground, including five battleships.[4][5] All of the Americans killed or wounded during the attack were non-combatants, given the fact there was no state of war when the attack occurred.[21][22][90]\\r\\nOf the American fatalities, nearly half were due to the explosion of Arizona's forward magazine after it was hit by a modified 16-inch (410?mm) shell.[nb 16]\\r\\nAlready damaged by a torpedo and on fire amidships, Nevada attempted to exit the harbor. She was targeted by many Japanese bombers as she got under way and sustained more hits from 250?lb (113?kg) bombs, which started further fires. She was deliberately beached to avoid blocking the harbor entrance.\\r\\nCalifornia was hit by two bombs and two torpedoes. The crew might have kept her afloat, but were ordered to abandon ship just as they were raising power for the pumps. Burning oil from Arizona and West Virginia drifted down on her, and probably made the situation look worse than it was. The disarmed target ship Utah was holed twice by torpedoes. West Virginia was hit by seven torpedoes, the seventh tearing away her rudder. Oklahoma was hit by four torpedoes, the last two above her belt armor, which caused her to capsize. Maryland was hit by two of the converted 16\\" shells, but neither caused serious damage.\\r\\nAlthough the Japanese concentrated on battleships (the largest vessels present), they did not ignore other targets. The light cruiser Helena was torpedoed, and the concussion from the blast capsized the neighboring minelayer Oglala. Two destroyers in dry dock, Cassin and Downes were destroyed when bombs penetrated their fuel bunkers. The leaking fuel caught fire; flooding the dry dock in an effort to fight fire made the burning oil rise, and both were burned out. Cassin slipped from her keel blocks and rolled against Downes. The light cruiser Raleigh was holed by a torpedo. The light cruiser Honolulu was damaged, but remained in service. The repair vessel Vestal, moored alongside Arizona, was heavily damaged and beached. The seaplane tender Curtiss was also damaged. The destroyer Shaw was badly damaged when two bombs penetrated her forward magazine.[91]\\r\\nOf the 402[15] American aircraft in Hawaii, 188 were destroyed and 159 damaged,[15] 155 of them on the ground. Almost none were actually ready to take off to defend the base. Eight Army Air Forces pilots managed to get airborne during the attack[92] and six were credited with downing at least one Japanese aircraft during the attack: 1st Lt. Lewis M. Sanders, 2nd Lt. Philip M. Rasmussen, 2nd Lt. Kenneth M. Taylor, 2nd Lt. George S. Welch, 2nd Lt. Harry W. Brown, and 2nd Lt. Gordon H. Sterling Jr. Sterling was shot down by Lt. Fujita over Kaneohe Bay and is listed as Body Not Recovered (not Missing In Action). Lt. John L. Dains was killed by friendly fire returning from a victory over Kaawa.[93][94] Of 33 PBYs in Hawaii, 24 were destroyed, and six others damaged beyond repair. (The three on patrol returned undamaged.) Friendly fire brought down some U.S. planes on top of that, including five from an inbound flight from Enterprise. Japanese attacks on barracks killed additional personnel.\\r\\nAt the time of the attack, nine civilian aircraft were flying in the vicinity of Pearl Harbor. Of these, three were shot down.[89]\\r\\nFifty-five Japanese airmen and nine submariners were killed in the attack, and one was captured. Of Japan's 414[78] available planes, 29 were lost during the battle (nine in the first attack wave, 20 in the second),[95][nb 17] with another 74 damaged by antiaircraft fire from the ground.\\r\\nSeveral Japanese junior officers including Fuchida and Genda urged Nagumo to carry out a third strike in order to destroy as much of Pearl Harbor's fuel and torpedo[nb 18] storage, maintenance, and dry dock facilities as possible.[96] Genda, who had unsuccessfully advocated for invading Hawaii after the air attack, believed that without an invasion three strikes were necessary to disable the base as much as possible.[97] The captains of the other five carriers in the task force reported they were willing and ready to carry out a third strike.[98] Military historians have suggested the destruction of these shore facilities would have hampered the U.S. Pacific Fleet far more seriously than the loss of its battleships.[99] If they had been wiped out, \\"serious [American] operations in the Pacific would have been postponed for more than a year\\";[100] according to Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, later Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, \\"it would have prolonged the war another two years.\\"[101] Nagumo, however, decided to withdraw for several reasons:\\r\\nAt a conference aboard Yamato the following morning, Yamamoto initially supported Nagumo.[106] In retrospect, sparing the vital dockyards, maintenance shops, and oil depots meant the U.S. could respond relatively quickly to Japanese activities in the Pacific. Yamamoto later regretted Nagumo's decision to withdraw and categorically stated it had been a great mistake not to order a third strike.[108]\\r\\nSeventeen ships were damaged or lost in the attack, of which fourteen were repaired and returned to service.[109]\\r\\nAfter a systematic search for survivors, formal salvage operations began. Captain Homer N. Wallin, Material Officer for Commander, Battle Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, was immediately ordered to lead salvage operations. \\"Within a short time I was relieved of all other duties and ordered to full time work as Fleet Salvage Officer.\\"[111][nb 19]\\r\\nAround Pearl Harbor, divers from the Navy (shore and tenders), the Naval Shipyard, and civilian contractors (Pacific Bridge and others) began work on the ships that could be refloated. They patched holes, cleared debris, and pumped water out of ships. Navy divers worked inside the damaged ships. Within six months, five battleships and two cruisers were patched or refloated so they could be sent to shipyards in Pearl Harbor and on the mainland for extensive repair.\\r\\nIntensive salvage operations continued for another year, a total of some 20,000 man-hours under water.[113] Oklahoma, while successfully raised, was never repaired, and capsized while under tow to the mainland in 1947. Arizona and the target ship Utah were too heavily damaged for salvage, though much of their armament and equipment was removed and put to use aboard other vessels. Today, the two hulks remain where they were sunk,[114] with Arizona becoming a war memorial.\\r\\nIn the wake of the attack, 15 Medals of Honor, 51 Navy Crosses, 53 Silver Stars, four Navy and Marine Corps Medals, one Distinguished Flying Cross, four Distinguished Service Crosses, one Distinguished Service Medal, and three Bronze Star Medals were awarded to the American servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat at Pearl Harbor.[115] Additionally, a special military award, the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal, was later authorized for all military veterans of the attack.\\r\\nThe day after the attack, Roosevelt delivered his famous Infamy Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, calling for a formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan. Congress obliged his request less than an hour later. On December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, even though the Tripartite Pact did not require it.[nb 20] Congress issued a declaration of war against Germany and Italy later that same day. The UK actually declared war on Japan nine hours before the U.S. did, partially due to Japanese attacks on Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong, and partially due to Winston Churchill's promise to declare war \\"within the hour\\" of a Japanese attack on the United States.[116]\\r\\nThe attack was an initial shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater. Further losses compounded the alarming setback. Japan attacked the Philippines hours later (because of the time difference, it was December 8 in the Philippines). Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battleships Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk off the coast of Malaya, causing British Prime Minister Winston Churchill later to recollect \\"In all the war I never received a more direct shock. As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me. There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California. Over this vast expanse of waters Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked\\".[117]\\r\\nThroughout the war, Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda.[118]\\r\\nOne further consequence of the attack on Pearl Harbor and its aftermath (notably the Niihau incident) was that Japanese American residents and citizens were relocated to nearby Japanese-American internment camps. Within hours of the attack, hundreds of Japanese American leaders were rounded up and brought to high-security camps such as Sand Island at the mouth of Honolulu harbor and Kilauea Military Camp on the island of Hawaii.[119][120] Eventually, more than 110,000 Japanese Americans, nearly all who lived on the West Coast, were forced into interior camps, but in Hawaii, where the 150,000-plus Japanese Americans composed over one-third of the population, only 1,200 to 1,800 were interned.[121][122][123]\\r\\nThe attack also had international consequences. The Canadian province of British Columbia, bordering the Pacific Ocean, had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants and their Japanese Canadian descendants. Pre-war tensions were exacerbated by the Pearl Harbor attack, leading to a reaction from the Government of Canada. On February 24, 1942, Order-in-Council P.C. no. 1486 was passed under the War Measures Act allowing for the forced removal of any and all Canadians of Japanese descent from British Columbia, as well as the prohibiting from them returning to the province. On 4 March, regulations under the Act were adopted to evacuate Japanese-Canadians.[124] As a result, 12,000 were interned in interior camps, 2,000 were sent to road camps and another 2,000 were forced to work in the prairies at sugar beet farms.[125]\\r\\nThe Japanese planners had determined that some means was required for rescuing fliers whose aircraft were too badly damaged to return to the carriers. The island of Niihau, only 30 minutes flying time from Pearl Harbor, was designated as the rescue point.\\r\\nThe Zero flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of Hiryu was damaged in the attack on Wheeler, so he flew to the rescue point on Niihau. The aircraft was further damaged on landing. Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiians, who, aware of the tension between the United States and Japan, took the pilot's maps and other documents. The island's residents had no telephones or radio and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese-American residents in an attempt to recover the documents. During the ensuing struggles, Nishikaichi was killed and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded; one collaborator committed suicide, and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison.\\r\\nThe ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to the assistance of Nishikaichi was a source of concern for many, and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted.[126]\\r\\nAdmiral Hara Tadaichi summed up the Japanese result by saying, \\"We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war.\\"[127] To a similar effect, see Isoroku Yamamoto's alleged \\"sleeping giant\\" quote.\\r\\nWhile the attack accomplished its intended objective, it turned out to be largely unnecessary. Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, who conceived the original plan, the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon 'charging' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war (in keeping with the evolution of Plan Orange).[29] The U.S. instead adopted \\"Plan Dog\\" in 1940, which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia, while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.[128]\\r\\nFortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were untouched by the Japanese attack; otherwise the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarinesthe very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles (their only major action being the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944). A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a \\"decisive battle\\" that never happened.[129]\\r\\nThe Japanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short, victorious war meant that they neglected Pearl Harbor's navy repair yards, oil tank farms, submarine base, and old headquarters building.[53] All of these targets were omitted from Genda's list, yet they proved more important than any battleship to the American war efforts in the Pacific. The survival of the repair shops and fuel depots allowed Pearl Harbor to maintain logistical support to the U.S. Navy's operations,[130][131] such as the Battles of Coral Sea and Midway. It was submarines that immobilized the Imperial Japanese Navy's heavy ships and brought Japan's economy to a virtual standstill by crippling the transportation of oil and raw materials: by the end of 1942, import of raw materials was cut to half of what it had been, \\"to a disastrous ten million tons\\", while oil import \\"was almost completely stopped\\".[nb 21] Lastly, the basement of the Old Administration Building was the home of the cryptanalytic unit which contributed significantly to the Midway ambush and the Submarine Force's success.[132]\\r\\nEver since the Japanese attack, there has been debate as to how and why the United States had been caught unaware, and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans and related topics. Military officers including Gen. Billy Mitchell had pointed out the vulnerability of Pearl to air attack. At least two Naval War games, one in 1932 and another in 1936, proved that Pearl was vulnerable to such an attack. Admiral James Richardson was removed from command shortly after protesting President Roosevelt's decision to move the bulk of the Pacific fleet to Pearl Harbor.[133] [134]The decisions of military and political leadership to ignore these warnings has contributed to conspiracy theories. Several writers, including journalist Robert Stinnett and former United States rear admiral Robert Alfred Theobald, have argued that various parties high in the U.S. and British governments knew of the attack in advance and may even have let it happen or encouraged it in order to force the U.S. into war via the so-called \\"back door\\". However, this conspiracy theory is rejected by mainstream historians.[135][136][137][138][nb 22]\\r\\nInformational notes\\r\\nCitations\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\nFurther reading\\r\\nAccounts\\r\\nMedia\\r\\nHistorical documents","input":"How many us sailors died at pearl harbor?"},{"output":"more than 2,200","context":"Chick-fil-A (/t??kf??le?/ chik-fil-AY, a play on the American English pronunciation of \\"fillet\\") is an American fast food restaurant chain headquartered in the city of College Park, Georgia, specializing in chicken sandwiches.[3][4] Founded in May 1946, it operates more than 2,200 restaurants, primarily in the United States. The restaurant serves breakfast before transitioning to its lunch and dinner menu. Chick-fil-A also offers customers catered selections from its menu for special events.[5]\\r\\nMany of the company's values are influenced by the religious beliefs of its late founder, S. Truett Cathy, a devout Southern Baptist. Most notably, all Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed for business on Sundays,[6] as well as on Thanksgiving and Christmas.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chain's origin can be traced to the Dwarf Grill (now the Dwarf House), a restaurant opened by S. Truett Cathy, the chain's former chairman and CEO, in 1946. The restaurant is located in Hapeville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta,[3] and is near the location of the now-demolished Ford Motor Company Atlanta Assembly Plant, for many years a source of many of the restaurant's patrons.\\r\\nIn 1961, after 15 years in the fast food business, Cathy found a pressure-fryer that could cook the chicken sandwich in the same amount of time it took to cook a fast-food hamburger.[8] Following this discovery, he registered the name Chick-fil-A, Inc. The company's trademarked slogan, \\"We Didn't Invent the Chicken, Just the Chicken Sandwich,\\"[9] refers to their flagship menu item, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich.\\r\\nThe first Chick-fil-A opened in 1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall, in a suburb of Atlanta.[3] During the 1970s and early 1980s, the chain expanded by opening new franchises in suburban malls' food courts.[10] The first freestanding franchise was opened April 16, 1986, on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta, Georgia,[11] and the company began to focus more on this type of franchise than on the food court type. Although it has expanded outward from its original geographic base, most new restaurants are located in Southern suburban areas.[3] In October 2015, the company opened a three-story 5,000-square-foot restaurant in Manhattan that became the largest free-standing Chick-fil-A in the country at that time.[12][13] As of 2016, the chain has approximately 1,950 locations.[3] It also has 31 drive-through-only locations.[3] Chick-fil-A also can be found at universities, hospitals, and airports through licensing agreements.[3]\\r\\nSince 1997, the Atlanta-based company has been the title sponsor of the Peach Bowl, an annual college football bowl game played in Atlanta on New Year's Eve. Chick-fil-A also is a key sponsor of the SEC and the ACC of college athletics.[14][15]\\r\\nThe company expanded for the first time outside of the United States by opening an outlet at the Calgary International Airport in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in May 2014.[16][17] This restaurant is located near the departure area for flights bound for the United States.[16] However, as with its American locations, it is closed Sundays and Christmas Day (it is, however, open on what would be Thanksgiving Day in America; as Thanksgiving Day is celebrated the month prior in Canada).\\r\\nChick-fil-A retains ownership of each restaurant. Chick-fil-A selects the restaurant location and builds it.[1] Chick-fil-A franchisees need only a $10,000 initial investment to become an operator.[18] Each operator is handpicked and goes through a rigorous training program; the interviews plus training can take months and is not an easy process. Chick-fil-A states on their site:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"This is not the right opportunity for you if you:\\r\\n- Are seeking a passive investment in a business.\\r\\n- Want to sell property to Chick-fil-A, Inc.\\r\\n- Are requesting that Chick-fil-A, Inc. build at a specified location.\\r\\n- Are seeking multi-unit franchise opportunities.\\"\\r\\n[19]\\r\\nSince 2010, Chick-fil-A has led the fast food industry in average sales per restaurant, despite being open only six days a week,[20] earning an average $4.8 million per restaurant in 2016 (Whataburger was second with $2.7 million per restaurant).[21]\\r\\n\\"Eat Mor Chikin\\" is the chain's most prominent advertising slogan, created by The Richards Group in 1995.[6] The slogan is often seen in advertisements, featuring Holstein dairy cows[22] that are often seen wearing (or holding) signs that (usually) read: \\"Eat Mor Chikin\\" in all capital letters. The ad campaign was temporarily halted during a mad cow disease scare on January 1, 2004, so as not to make the chain seem insensitive or appear to be taking advantage of the scare to increase its sales. Two months later, the cows were put up again. The cows replaced the chain's old mascot, Doodles, an anthropomorphized chicken who still appears as the C on the logo.[23]\\r\\nChick-fil-A vigorously protects its intellectual property, sending cease and desist letters to those they think have infringed on their trademarks.[24] The corporation has successfully protested at least 30 instances of the use of an \\"eat more\\" phrase, saying that the use would cause confusion of the public, dilute the distinctiveness of their intellectual property, and diminish its value.[25]\\r\\nA 2011 letter to Vermont artist Bo Muller-Moore who screen prints T-shirts reading: \\"Eat More Kale\\" demanded that he cease printing the shirts and turn over his website.[26] The incident drew criticism from Vermont governor Peter Shumlin, and created backlash against what he termed Chick-fil-A's \\"corporate bullying.\\"[27] On December 11, 2014, Bo Muller-Moore announced that the U.S. Patent Office granted his application to trademark his \\"Eat More Kale\\" phrase. A formal announcement of his victory took place on December 12, 2014, with Shumlin and other supporters on the Statehouse steps. His public fight drew regional and national attention, the support of Shumlin, and a team of pro-bono law students from the University of New Hampshire legal clinic.[28]\\r\\nAfter 22 years with The Richards Group, Chick-fil-A switched to McCann New York in 2016. Along with the cows, ads included famous people in history in a campaign called \\"Chicken for Breakfast. It's not as crazy as you think.\\"[29]\\r\\nTruett Cathy opened his first restaurant, The Dwarf Grill?ÿ later renamed the Dwarf House?ÿ in Hapeville, Georgia, in 1946, and developed the pressure-cooked chicken breast sandwich there.[3] At the original Chick-fil-A Dwarf Grill, in addition to the full-size entrances, there is also an extra small-sized front door.[32] The original Dwarf House in Hapeville, Georgia is open 24 hours a day, six days a week, except on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The store closes at 10:00?p.m. on Saturday nights, and the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas and reopens at 6?a.m. on Monday mornings and day after Thanksgiving and Christmas. It has a larger dine-in menu than the other Dwarf House locations as well as an animated seven dwarfs display in the back of the restaurant.[32] It was across the street from the former Ford Motor Company factory called Atlanta Assembly.\\r\\nTruett's original, full-service restaurants offer a substantial menu and provide customers a choice of table service, walk-up counter service or a drive-thru window. As of 2012[update], 13 Chick-fil-A Dwarf House restaurants were operating in the metro Atlanta area.[3]\\r\\nIn 1996, the first Truett's Grill was opened in Morrow, Georgia. The second location opened in 2003 in McDonough, Georgia, and a third location opened in 2006 in Griffin, Georgia.[33] Similar to the Chick-fil-A Dwarf Houses, these independently owned restaurants offer traditional, sit-down dining and expanded menu selections in a diner-themed dinner.[34][35][36] In 2017, Chick-fil-A demolished several Dwarf House locations to replace them with Truett's Grill locations.[37][38]\\r\\nS. Truett Cathy was a devout Southern Baptist; his religious beliefs had a major impact on the company.[39] The company's official statement of corporate purpose says that the business exists \\"To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.\\"[40]\\r\\nCathy's beliefs are also responsible for the chain's most well-known and distinctive feature: all Chick-fil-A locations (both corporate owned and franchised) are closed on Sundays,[41] as well as on Thanksgiving and Christmas.[42] Cathy states as the final step in his Five-Step recipe for Business Success \\"I was not so committed to financial success that I was willing to abandon my principles and priorities. One of the most visible examples of this is our decision to close on Sunday. Our decision to close on Sunday was our way of honoring God and of directing our attention to things that mattered more than our business.\\"[43]\\r\\nIn an interview with ABC News's Nightline, Truett's son Dan T. Cathy told reporter Vicki Mabrey that the company is also closed on Sundays because \\"by the time Sunday came, he was just worn out. And Sunday was not a big trading day, anyway, at the time. So he was closed that first Sunday and we've been closed ever since. He figured if he didn't like working on Sundays, that other people didn't either.\\" The younger Cathy also quoted his father as saying, \\"I don't want to ask people to do that what I am not willing to do myself.\\"[44]\\r\\nTheir website states, \\"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our Restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect ÿregardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\\"[45]\\r\\nChick-fil-A's reputation on being closed on Sundays extends to non-traditional locations. On December 17, 2017 Chick-fil-A broke their tradition and opened on a Sunday to prepare meals for passengers left stranded, during the power outage at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.[46] In addition to countless shopping malls and airports, a Chick-fil-A location at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta will be closed on Sundays despite its main tenant, the Atlanta Falcons, playing most of their home games on Sundays. The location will be open when the Falcons have a Monday night, Thursday night or Saturday home game, as well as non-Sunday home games of Atlanta United FC and other events at the stadium. On Sundays, the digital signs will be flipped and concessionaire Levy Restaurants will sell nonbranded food and drinks at the location.[47]\\r\\nIn January 2011, the media reported that Chick-fil-A was co-sponsoring a marriage conference with the Pennsylvania Family Institute (PFI), an organization that has opposed same-sex marriage legislation.[48][49][50][51][52] Chick-fil-A clarified that \\"one of our independent Restaurant Operators in Pennsylvania was asked to provide sandwiches to two Art of Marriage video seminars\\".[53] The WinShape Foundation, a charitable organization founded by Truett and his wife, also stated that it would not allow same-sex couples to participate in its marriage retreats.[54]\\r\\nChick-fil-A has donated over $5?million, via WinShape, to groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Of this, more than $3?million was donated primarily to Christian organizations whose agendas included positions that oppose same-sex marriage,[55] with the money donated between 2003 and 2009.[56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63] A total of $1.9?million was donated in 2010 to groups such as the Marriage & Family Foundation, Exodus International, and the Family Research Council (FRC).[64] That year, the FRC, which received $1,000[56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63] was listed as an anti-gay[65] hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[66][67][68] WinShape has also contributed to Christian groups including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Exodus International, the latter of which is noted for supporting ex-gay conversion therapy.[64] In response, students at several colleges and universities worked to ban or remove the company's restaurants from their campuses. On January 28, 2013, Shane L. Windmeyer, the leader of Campus Pride, suspended their campaign.[69][70][71]\\r\\nIn June and July 2012, Chick-fil-A's chief operating officer Dan T. Cathy made several public statements about same-sex marriage, saying that those who \\"have the audacity to define what marriage is about\\" were \\"inviting God's judgment on our nation\\".[72][73][74][75][76] Several prominent politicians expressed disapproval.[77] Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Chicago Alderman Proco \\"Joe\\" Moreno said they hoped to block franchise expansion into their areas.[78][79][80] The proposed bans drew criticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union.[81][82][83] The Jim Henson Company, which had a Pajanimals kids' meal toy licensing arrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship, and donate the payment to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.[84][85][86] Chick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys, claiming that unrelated safety concerns that had arisen prior to the controversy.[87] Chick-fil-A released a statement on July 31, 2012, saying, \\"We are a restaurant company focused on food, service, and hospitality; our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.\\"[88]\\r\\nIn response to the controversy, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee initiated a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a boycott of Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists.[89][90][91] More than 600,000 people RSVPed on Facebook for Huckabee's appreciation event.[90] On August 1, Chick-fil-A restaurants experienced a large show of public support across the nation with the company reporting record-breaking sales.[89][90][91] A consulting firm estimated that the average Chick-fil-A restaurant had 29.9 percent more sales and 367 more customers than it did on a typical Wednesday.[18]\\r\\nIn September 2012, The Civil Rights Agenda (TCRA) announced that Chick-fil-A had \\"ceased donating to organizations that promote discrimination, specifically against LGBT civil rights.\\" Chick-fil-A officials did state in an internal document that they \\"will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation.\\"[92] In a letter from Chick-fil-A's Senior Director of Real Estate, the company states, \\"The WinShape Foundation is now taking a much closer look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process will remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with political agendas.\\"[93][94]\\r\\nAccording to Chicago Alderman Proco \\"Joe\\" Moreno, Chick-fil-A has a statement of respect for all people regardless of sexual orientation in an internal document called Chick-fil-A: Who We Are. A document released by Chick-fil-A on September 20, 2012, does not mention any organizations opposed to same-sex marriage as being part of Chick-fil-A's donation base. WinShape Marriage will continue to be supported financially, with a stated focus on couple retreats to strengthen marriages.[95]\\r\\nAccording to Focus on the Family's website, CitizenLink.com, \\"Chick-fil-A and its charitable-giving arm, the WinShape Foundation, did not agree to stop making donations to groups that support the Biblical definition of marriage in exchange for being allowed to open a franchise in Chicago.\\"[96] Mike Huckabee stated that he \\"talked earlier today personally with Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick Fil-A about the new reports that Chick Fil-A had capitulated to demands of the supporters of same sex marriage. This is not true. The company continues to focus on the fair treatment of all of its customers and employees, but to end confusion gave me this statement.\\" The statement provided by Chick-fil-A was posted on Huckabee's website.[97][98]\\r\\nThough Chick-fil-A has always used trans-fat free processes in its chicken sandwiches, anticipating the dietary concerns of consumers, in 2008, it became the first fast-food restaurant to become completely trans-fat free.[99]\\r\\nIn 2011, food blogger and activist Vani Hari wrote a post titled \\"Chick-fil-A or Chemical Fil-A?\\" on her website, FoodBabe.com. She noted that Chick-fil-A sandwiches contained nearly 100 ingredients, including peanut oil with TBHQ.[100] In October 2012, Chick-fil-A invited Hari to meet with company executives at its Atlanta, GA headquarters.[101] In December 2013, Chick-fil-A notified Hari that it had eliminated the dye Yellow No. 5 and had reduced the sodium content in its chicken soup. The company also said that it is testing a peanut oil that does not contain TBHQ and that it would start testing sauces and dressings made without high-fructose corn syrup in 2014.[101]\\r\\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration, antibiotics used in livestock, many of which are also used to treat humans, have contributed to the rise of dangerous bacteria. In December 2012, the FDA announced plans to phase out certain antibiotics in the food production industry.[102]\\r\\nIn February 2014, Chick-fil-A announced plans to serve chicken raised without antibiotics in its restaurants nationwide within five years. Chick-fil-A is the first quick service restaurant to set forth a plan and commit to serving only poultry raised without antibiotics.[103]","input":"How many chick-fil-a's are there in the world?"},{"output":"allowed for works to be copyrighted for a period of 28 years from the date of publication","context":"The Copyright Act of 1909 was a landmark statute in United States statutory copyright law.  It became Pub.L. 60ÿ349 on March 4, 1909 by the 60th United States Congress, and it went into effect on July 1, 1909.[1] The Act was repealed and superseded by the Copyright Act of 1976, but it remains effective for copyrighted works created before the Copyright Act of 1976 went into effect in January 1, 1978. It allowed for works to be copyrighted for a period of 28 years from the date of publication. It extended the term from 28 years with a renewal of 14 years (effective as of the Copyright Act of 1831) to 28 years with a renewal of 28 years, for a maximum of 56 years. \\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the 1909 Act, the last major revision to United States copyright law was the 1790 Act.  Methods of reproducing and duplicating works subject to copyright had significantly increased since the 1790 Act.  President Theodore Roosevelt expressed the need for a complete revision of copyright law as opposed to amendments, saying in a message to Congress in December 1905, \\"Our copyright laws urgently need revision. They are imperfect in definition, confused and inconsistent in expression; they omit provision for many articles which, under modern reproductive processes, are entitled to protection; they impose hardships upon the copyright proprietor which are not essential to the fair protection of the public; they are difficult for the courts to interpret and impossible for the Copyright Office to administer with satisfaction to the public.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the 1909 Act, federal statutory copyright protection attached to original works only when those works were 1) published and 2) had a notice of copyright affixed. Thus, state copyright law governed protection for unpublished works, but published works, whether containing a notice of copyright or not, were governed exclusively by federal law. If no notice of copyright was affixed to a work and the work was \\"published\\" in a legal sense, the 1909 Act provided no copyright protection and the work became part of the public domain.  In the report submitted by the House Committee on Patents, they designed the copyright law \\"not primarily for the benefit of the author, but primarily for the benefit of the public.\\"[3] The 1976 Act changed this result, providing that copyright protection attaches to works that are original and fixed in a tangible medium of expression, regardless of publication or affixation of notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also created (codified in Section 1(e))[4] the first compulsory mechanical license to allow anyone to make a mechanical reproduction (known today as a phonorecord) of a musical composition without the consent of the copyright owner provided that the person adhered to the provisions of the license. (Congress intended it to govern piano rolls.) In later practice, compulsory license made it possible to record and distribute a cover version of a hit song ÿ  once a recording had been released, and the copyright owner was served with a notice of intention to use ÿ that directly competed with the original.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1908, the Supreme Court ruled that manufacturers of pianola music rolls were not required to pay royalties to composers, based on the holding that these music rolls were not copies of musical compositions within the meaning of copyright law because it was not \\"a written or printed record in intelligible notation.\\"[5] This decision on sheet music was superseded by the Act.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1952, the Supreme Court held that the Act gave trial judges significant freedom in imposing legal remedies to discourage copyright infringement.  Under this ruling, judges could penalize copyright infringers with repaying profits or paying compensation for damages.  If damages could not be determined, judges could levy statutory damages instead.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 22, 1917, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Holmes upheld the right for copyright owners to compensation for a public performance of a musical composition, even if there was no direct charge for admission.  This ruling forced Shanley's Restaurant in New York to pay a fee to songwriter Victor Herbert who performed one of his songs during dinner.  This decision helped the ASCAP adopt the royalty-payment mechanism known as a \\"blanket license,\\" which is still used today. Under a blanket license, signatory businesses such as restaurants have the right to play any composition of an ASCAP artist for an annual fee.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis amendment resulted in motion pictures being specifically added to the category of protected works. Prior to this amendment, United States copyright law did not protect nor register motion picture films.  Instead, most motion picture filmmakers would register their work as a collection of still photographs.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis amendment amended section 12 of the Copyright Act of 1909, allowing foreign authors whose work had been published in a foreign country to submit only one copy of the best edition of their work, rather than the customary two. This helped ease the deposit requirements of foreign authors.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis amended section 8 of the Copyright Act of 1909 with the intention to preserve the right of authors during periods of emergency, and specifically for World War II.  The purpose of this amendment was to prevent authors, copyright owners, or proprietors from losing the opportunity to acquire or preserve copyright protection for their works because of the disruption of communication or suspension of facilities where they could acquire copyright licenses because of the war.[10]","input":"What did the copyright act of 1909 mandate?"},{"output":"Clinical neuroscience","context":"Clinical neuroscience is a branch of neuroscience that focuses on the scientific study of fundamental mechanisms that underlie diseases and disorders of the brain and central nervous system.[1] It seeks to develop new ways of diagnosing such disorders and ultimately of developing novel treatments.\\r\\nA clinical neuroscientist is a scientist who has specialized knowledge in the field.

As the tophouse was being hoisted into place, on October 30, 1967 some of the cables used to hoist it snapped, leaving it resting on and precariously tilted on the Towers shaft. Eventually, oil field pipes were used in lieu of cables to complete the job.\\r\\nIn 2004, Landry's Restaurants, Inc. won the bid for a 15-year lease to manage and operate the property for its owner, the City of San Antonio. Landry's undertook an extensive $8 million renovation of the existing restaurant and lounge and observation deck and added a 4-D film \\"ride\\" called \\"Skies Over Texas,\\" that gives the history of Texas in a film format. Additionally, Landry's spent another $4 million to add approximately 200% more space for ground level attractions such as a gift shop and cafe.

The holiday was held on May 30 from 1868 to 1970.[2] It marks the unofficial start of the summer vacation season,[3] while Labor Day marks its end.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people visit cemeteries and memorials, particularly to honor those who have died in military service. Many volunteers place an American flag on each grave in national cemeteries.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo other days celebrate those who serve or have served in the U.S. military: Veterans Day, which celebrates the service of all U.S. military veterans.[4]; and Armed Forces Day, a minor U.S. remembrance celebrated earlier in May, specifically honoring those currently serving in the U.S. military.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe practice of decorating soldiers' graves with flowers is an ancient custom.[5] Soldiers' graves were decorated in the U.S. before[6] and during the American Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome believe that an annual cemetery decoration practice began before the American Civil War and thus may reflect the real origin of the \\"memorial day\\" idea.[7] Annual Decoration Days for particular cemeteries are still held on a Sunday in late spring or early summer in some rural areas of the American South, notably in the mountain areas. In cases involving a family graveyard where remote ancestors as well as those who were deceased more recently are buried, this may take on the character of an extended family reunion to which some people travel hundreds of miles. People gather, put flowers on graves and renew contacts with relatives and others. There often is a religious service and a picnic-like \\"dinner on the grounds,\\" the traditional term for a potluck meal at a church.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 3, 1861, Warrenton, Virginia was the location of the first Civil War soldier's grave ever to be decorated, according to a Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper article in 1906.[8] In 1862, women in Savannah, Georgia decorated Confederate soldiers' graves according to the Savannah Republican.[9] The 1863 cemetery dedication at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, was a ceremony of commemoration at the graves of dead soldiers. On July 4, 1864, ladies decorated soldiers' graves according to local historians in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania.[10] and Boalsburg promotes itself as the birthplace of Memorial Day.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1865, following President Abraham Lincoln's assassination, commemorations were ubiquitous. The more than 600,000 soldiers of both sides who died in the Civil War meant that burial and memorialization took on new cultural significance. Under the leadership of women during the war, an increasingly formal practice of decorating graves had taken shape. In 1865, the federal government began creating national military cemeteries for the Union war dead.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 1, 1865, in Charleston, South Carolina, recently freed African-Americans held a parade of 10,000 people to honor 257 dead Union Soldiers, whose remains they had reburied from a mass grave in a Confederate prison camp.[13] Historian David W. Blight cites contemporary news reports of this incident in the Charleston Daily Courier and the New-York Tribune. Although Blight claimed that \\"African Americans invented Memorial Day in Charleston, South Carolina\\",[14] in 2012, Blight stated that he \\"has no evidence\\" that the event in Charleston inspired the establishment of Memorial Day across the country.[15] Accordingly, investigators for Time Magazine, LiveScience, RealClearLife and Snopes have called this conclusion into question.[16][17][18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1868, copying a southern annual observance,[20] General John A. Logan of the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union veterans founded in Decatur, Illinois, established Decoration Day as a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the Union war dead with flowers.[21] By the 20th century, various Union and Confederate memorial traditions, celebrated on different days, merged, and Memorial Day eventually extended to honor all Americans who died while in the military service.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 26, 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson designated an \\"official\\" birthplace of the holiday by signing the presidential proclamation naming Waterloo, New York, as the holder of the title. This action followed House Concurrent Resolution 587, in which the 89th Congress had officially recognized that the patriotic tradition of observing Memorial Day had begun one hundred years prior in Waterloo, New York.[22] The village credits druggist Henry C. Welles and county clerk John B. Murray as the founders of the holiday. Scholars have determined that the Waterloo account is a myth.[23] Snopes and Live Science also discredit the Waterloo account.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 5, 1868, General John A. Logan issued a proclamation calling for \\"Decoration Day\\" to be observed annually and nationwide; he was commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of and for Union Civil War veterans.[7] With his proclamation, Logan adopted the Memorial Day practice that had begun in the Southern states three years earlier.[26][27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first northern Memorial Day was observed on May 30, 1868. One author claims that the date was chosen because it was not the anniversary of any particular battle.[29] According to a White House address in 2010, the date was chosen as the optimal date for flowers to be in bloom in the North.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northern states quickly adopted the holiday. In 1868, memorial events were held in 183 cemeteries in 27 states, and 336 in 1869.[31] In 1871, Michigan made \\"Decoration Day\\" an official state holiday and by 1890, every northern state had followed suit. There was no standard program for the ceremonies, but they were typically sponsored by the Women's Relief Corps, the women's auxiliary of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), which had 100,000 members. By 1870, the remains of nearly 300,000 Union dead had been reinterred in 73 national cemeteries, located near major battlefields and thus mainly in the South. The most famous are Gettysburg National Cemetery in Pennsylvania and Arlington National Cemetery, near Washington, D.C.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nMemorial Day speeches became an occasion for veterans, politicians, and ministers to commemorate the Civil War and, at first, to rehash the \\"atrocities\\" of the enemy. They mixed religion and celebratory nationalism for the people to make sense of their history in terms of sacrifice for a better nation. People of all religious beliefs joined together and the point was often made that the German and Irish soldiers had become true Americans in the \\"baptism of blood\\" on the battlefield.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1868 Doylestown, Pennsylvania, has held annual Memorial Day parades which it claims to be the nation's oldest continuously running.  However, the Memorial Day parade in Rochester, Wisconsin, predates Doylestown's by one year.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1880s, ceremonies were becoming quite similar as the GAR provided handbooks that presented specific procedures, poems, and Bible verses for local post commanders to utilize in planning the local event. Historian Stuart McConnell reports: \\r\\n\\r\\non the day itself, the post assembled and marched to the local cemetery to decorate the graves of the fallen, an enterprise meticulously organized months in advance to assure that none were missed. Finally came a simple and subdued graveyard service involving prayers, short patriotic speeches, and music...and at the end perhaps a rifle salute.[36]\\r\\nThe U.S. National Park Service[37] and numerous scholars attribute the beginning of a Memorial Day practice in the South to the ladies of Columbus, Georgia.[38][39][40][41][42][43][44] On April 25, 1866, women in Columbus, Mississippi laid flowers on the graves of both the Union and Confederate dead in the city's Friendship Cemetery, claiming to be the first \\"Decoration Day.\\"[45][46] The early southern Memorial Day celebrations were simple, somber occasions for veterans and their families to honor the dead and tend to local cemeteries.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorians acknowledge the Ladies Memorial Association played a key role in these rituals of preservation of Confederate \\"memory.\\"[48] Various dates ranging from April 25 to mid-June were adopted in different Southern states. Across the South, associations were founded, many by women, to establish and care for permanent cemeteries for the Confederate dead, organize commemorative ceremonies, and sponsor appropriate monuments as a permanent way of remembering the Confederate dead. The most important of these was the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which grew from 17,000 members in 1900 to nearly 100,000 women by World War I. They were \\"strikingly successful at raising money to build Confederate monuments, lobbying legislatures and Congress for the reburial of Confederate dead, and working to shape the content of history textbooks.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1868, some southerners appended the label \\"Confederate\\" to what they originally called \\"Memorial Day\\" after northerners co-opted the holiday.[50] The tradition of observances were linked to the South, they served as the prototype for the national day of memory embraced by the nation in 1868.[37][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1890, there was a shift from the emphasis on honoring specific soldiers to a public commemoration of the Confederate south.[47] Changes in the ceremony's hymns and speeches reflect an evolution of the ritual into a symbol of cultural renewal and conservatism in the South. By 1913, David Blight argues, the theme of American nationalism shared equal time with the Confederate.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 1868, the ceremonies and Memorial Day address at Gettysburg National Park became nationally known. In July 1913, veterans of the United States and Confederate armies gathered in Gettysburg to commemorate the fifty-year anniversary of the Civil War's bloodiest and most famous battle.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the cemetery dedication at Gettysburg occurred on November 19, that day (or the closest weekend) has been designated as their own local memorial day that is referred to as Remembrance Day.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndiana from the 1860s to the 1920s saw numerous debates on how to expand the celebration. It was a favorite lobbying activity of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR).  An 1884 GAR handbook explained that Memorial Day was \\"the day of all days in the G.A.R. Calendar\\" in terms of mobilizing public support for pensions. It advised family members to \\"exercise great care\\" in keeping the veterans sober.[55]. As the years went by, the GAR complained more and more about the younger generation. In 1913, one Hoosier veteran complained that younger people born since the war had a \\"tendency ... to forget the purpose of Memorial Day and make it a day for games, races and revelry, instead of a day of memory and tears.\\"[56] Indeed, in 1911 the scheduling of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway car race was vehemently opposed by the increasingly elderly GAR. The state legislature in  1923 rejected the race on that special day. But the new American Legion and local officials wanted the big race to continue, so Governor Warren McCray vetoed the bill and the race went on.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the national capital in 1913 the four-day \\"Blue-Gray Reunion\\" featured parades, re-enactments, and speeches from a host of dignitaries, including President Woodrow Wilson, the first Southerner elected to the White House since the War.  James Heflin of Alabama gave the main address. Heflin was a noted orator; his choice as Memorial Day speaker was criticized, as he was opposed for his support of segregation; however, his speech was moderate in tone and stressed national unity and goodwill, gaining him praise from newspapers.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the longest-standing traditions is the running of the Indianapolis 500, an auto race which has been held in conjunction with Memorial Day since 1911.[59] Originally it was held on Memorial Day itself, and since 1974 it runs on the Sunday preceding the Memorial Day holiday. Since 1961 NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600 has been held during Memorial Day weekend, and has also been held on the previous Sunday since 1974.[citation needed] Since 1976 The Memorial Tournament golf event has been held on or close to the Memorial Day weekend.[citation needed] The Final of the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship has been held on Memorial Day since 1986.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe preferred name for the holiday gradually changed from \\"Decoration Day\\" to \\"Memorial Day,\\" which was first used in 1882.[61] Memorial Day did not become the more common name until after World War II, and was not declared the official name by Federal law until 1967.[62] On June 28, 1968, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which moved four holidays, including Memorial Day, from their traditional dates to a specified Monday in order to create a convenient three-day weekend.[63] The change moved Memorial Day from its traditional May 30 date to the last Monday in May. The law took effect at the federal level in 1971.[63] After some initial confusion and unwillingness to comply, all 50 states adopted Congress' change of date within a few years.\\r\\n\\r\\nMemorial Day endures as a holiday which most businesses observe because it marks the unofficial beginning of summer. The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW) advocated returning to the original date, although the significance of the date is tenuous. The VFW stated in 2002:\\r\\n\\r\\nChanging the date merely to create three-day weekends has undermined the very meaning of the day. No doubt, this has contributed a lot to the general public's nonchalant observance of Memorial Day.[64]\\r\\nIn 2000, Congress passed the National Moment of Remembrance Act, asking people to stop and remember at 3:00 PM.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Memorial Day, the flag of the United States is raised briskly to the top of the staff and then solemnly lowered to the half-staff position, where it remains only until noon.[66] It is then raised to full-staff for the remainder of the day.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Memorial Day Concert takes place on the west lawn of the United States Capitol.[68] The concert is broadcast on PBS and NPR. Music is performed, and respect is paid to the men and women who gave their lives for their country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the United States, the central event is attending one of the thousands of parades held on Memorial Day in large and small cities. Most of these feature marching bands and an overall military theme with the Active Duty, Reserve, National Guard and Veteran service members participating along with military vehicles from various wars.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1915, following the Second Battle of Ypres, Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae, a physician with the Canadian Expeditionary Force, wrote the poem, \\"In Flanders Fields\\". Its opening lines refer to the fields of poppies that grew among the soldiers' graves in Flanders.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1918, inspired by the poem, YWCA worker Moina Michael attended a YWCA Overseas War Secretaries' conference wearing a silk poppy pinned to her coat and distributed over two dozen more to others present. In 1920, the National American Legion adopted it as their official symbol of remembrance.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nScholars,[70][71][72][73] following the lead of sociologist Robert Bellah, often make the argument that the United States has a secular \\"civil religion\\" ÿ one with no association with any religious denomination or viewpoint ÿ that has incorporated Memorial Day as a sacred event. With the Civil War, a new theme of death, sacrifice and rebirth enters the civil religion. Memorial Day gave ritual expression to these themes, integrating the local community into a sense of nationalism. The American civil religion, in contrast to that of France, was never anticlerical or militantly secular; in contrast to Britain, it was not tied to a specific denomination, such as the Church of England. The Americans borrowed from different religious traditions so that the average American saw no conflict between the two, and deep levels of personal motivation were aligned with attaining national goals.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nMemorial Day has been called a \\"modern cult of the dead\\". It incorporates Christian themes of sacrifice while uniting citizens of various faiths.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoems commemorating Memorial Day include:\\r\\n\\r\\n(federal) = federal holidays, (state) = state holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (week) = weeklong holidays, (month) = monthlong holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\\r\\nBold indicates major holidays commonly celebrated in the United States, which often represent the major celebrations of the month.","input":"The u.s. holiday that eventually became memorial day was first known as what?"},{"output":"the last Wednesday of August in 1945","context":"La Tomatina (Spanish pronunciation:?[la toma?tina]) is a festival that is held in the Valencian town of Bu?ol, a town located in the East of Spain 30 kilometres (19?mi) from the Mediterranean, in which participants throw tomatoes and get involved in this tomato fight purely for entertainment purposes. Since 1945 it has been held on the last Wednesday of August, during the week of festivities of Bu?ol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt all started the last Wednesday of August in 1945 when some young people spent the time in the town square to attend the Giants and Big-Heads figures parade. The young boys decided to have a place among the retinue of a parade with musician, Giants and Big-Heads figures. The energy of these young people made that one participant fell off. The participant flew into a fit of rage, started to hit everything in his path. There was a market stall of vegetable that fell victim of the furious crowd: people started to pelt each other with tomatoes until the local forces ended that vegetable battle. The following year, the young people picked a quarrel by their own decision and brought the tomatoes from home. Although the police broke up the early tradition in the following years, the young boys had made history without being conscious about it. La Tomatina was banned in the early 50s, which was not a problem for the participants who were even arrested. But the people spoke and the festivity was again allowed with more participants and more frenetic feelings. The festivity was again cancelled till 1957 when, as a sign of protest, the tomato burial was held. It was a demonstration in which the residents carried a coffin with a huge tomato inside. The parade was accompanied by a music band which played funeral marches and it was totally successful. La Tomatina Festival was finally allowed and became an official festivity. As a result of the report of Javier Basilio, broadcast in the Spanish television program called Informe Semanal, the festivity started to be known in the rest of Spain. Since then, the number of participants increased year after year as well as the excitement about La Tomatina Festival. In 2002, La Tomatina of Bu?ol was declared Festivity of International Tourist Interest by the Secretary Department of Tourism due to its success.[1]\\r\\nUsually the fight lasts for an hour, after which the town square is liberally covered with tomato debris.[2] Fire trucks then hose down the streets and participants often use hoses that locals provide to remove the tomatoes from their bodies. Some participants go to the los pe?ones pool to wash. The acidity of the tomatoes leads to the washed surfaces in the town becoming very clean.[3][4]\\r\\nSince 2013 participation in the event has been restricted to the holders of paid tickets.

The hop plant is a vigorous, climbing, herbaceous perennial, usually trained to grow up strings in a field called a hopfield, hop garden (nomenclature in the South of England), or hop yard (in the West Country and U.S.) when grown commercially. Many different varieties of hops are grown by farmers around the world, with different types being used for particular styles of beer.\\r\\nThe first documented use of hops in beer is from the 9th century[citation needed], though Hildegard of Bingen, 300 years later, is often cited as the earliest documented source.[3] Before this period, brewers used gruit, composed of a wide variety of bitter herbs and flowers, including dandelion, burdock root, marigold, horehound (the old German name for horehound, Berghopfen, means \\"mountain hops\\"), ground ivy, and heather.[4] Early documents include mention of a hop garden in the will of Charlemagne's father, Pepin III.[5]\\r\\nIn addition to adding flavor to beer, hops are also used in brewing for their antibacterial effect over less desirable microorganisms and for many purported benefits, including balancing the sweetness of the malt with bitterness, contributing a variety of desirable flavors and aromas.[2] Historically, traditional herb combinations for beers were believed to have been abandoned when beers made with hops were noticed to be less prone to spoilage.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first documented hop cultivation was in 736, in the Hallertau region of present-day Germany[citation needed], although the first mention of the use of hops in brewing in that country was 1079.[7] However, in a will of Pepin the Short, the father of Charlemagne, hop gardens were left to the Cloister of Saint-Denis in 768. Not until the 13th century did hops begin to start threatening the use of gruit for flavoring. Gruit was used when taxes were levied by the nobility on hops. Whichever was taxed made the brewer then quickly switch to the other. In Britain, hopped beer was first imported from Holland around 1400, yet hops were condemned as late as 1519 as a \\"wicked and pernicious weed\\".[8] In 1471, Norwich, England, banned use of the plant in the brewing of ale (\\"beer\\" was the name for fermented malt liquors bittered with hops; only in recent times are the words often used as synonyms).\\r\\nIn Germany, using hops was also a religious and political choice in the early 16th century. There was no tax on hops to be paid on the Catholic church, unlike on gruit, for which the Protestant preferred hopped beer.[9]\\r\\nHops used in England were imported from France, Holland and Germany with import duty paid for those; it was not until 1524 that hops were first grown in the southeast of England (Kent) when they were introduced as an agricultural crop by Dutch farmers. Therefore, in the hop industry there are many words which originally were Dutch words (see oast house). Hops were then grown as far north as Aberdeen, near breweries for infrastructure convenience.\\r\\nAccording to Thomas Tusser's 1557 Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry:\\r\\n\\"The hop for his profit I thus do exalt,\\r\\nIt strengtheneth drink and it flavoureth malt;\\r\\nAnd being well-brewed long kept it will last,\\r\\nAnd drawing abide, if ye draw not too fast.\\"[10]\\r\\nIn England there were many complaints over the quality of imported hops, the sacks of which were often contaminated by stalks, sand or straw to increase their weight. As a result, in 1603, King James I approved an Act of Parliament banning the practice by which \\"the Subjects of this Realm have been of late years abused &c. to the Value of S20,000 yearly, besides the Danger of their Healths\\".[11]\\r\\nHop cultivation was begun in the present-day United States in 1629 by English and Dutch farmers.[12] Before national alcohol prohibition, cultivation was mainly centered around New York, California, Oregon, and Washington. Problems with powdery mildew and downy mildew devastated New York's production by the 1920s, and California only produces hops on a small scale.[13]\\r\\nHop bars were used before modern machinery was invented to make the holes for the hop poles.[14]\\r\\nHops production is concentrated in moist temperate climates, with much of the world's production occurring near the 48th parallel north. Hop plants prefer the same soils as potatoes and the leading potato-growing states in the United States are also major hops-producing areas;[15] however, not all potato-growing areas can produce good hops naturally: soils in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, for example, lack the boron that hops prefer.[15] Historically, hops were not grown in Ireland, but were imported from England. In 1752 more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone.[16]\\r\\nImportant production centers today are the Hallertau in Germany (more hop-growing area than any other country as of 2006),[17] the Yakima (Washington) and Willamette (Oregon) valleys, and western Canyon County, Idaho (including the communities of Parma, Wilder, Greenleaf, and Notus).[18] The principal production centers in the UK are in Kent which produces Kent Goldings hops, Herefordshire and Worcestershire.[19][20] Essentially all of the harvested hops are used in beer making.\\r\\nAlthough hops are grown in most of the continental United States and Canada,[22] cultivation of hops for commercial production requires a particular environment. As hops are a climbing plant, they are trained to grow up trellises made from strings or wires that support the plants and allow them significantly greater growth with the same sunlight profile. In this way, energy that would have been required to build structural cells is also freed for crop growth.[23][citation needed]\\r\\nMale and female flowers of the hop plant usually develop on separate plants (that is, the plant is dioecious), although fertile monoecious individuals appear occasionally. Because viable seeds are undesirable for brewing beer, only female plants are grown in hop fields, thus preventing pollination. Female plants are propagated vegetatively, and male plants are culled if plants are grown from seeds.[24]\\r\\nHop plants are planted in rows about 2 to 2.5 metres (7 to 8?ft) apart. Each spring, the roots send forth new bines that are started up strings from the ground to an overhead trellis. The cones grow high on the bine, and in the past, these cones were picked by hand. Harvesting of hops became much more efficient with the invention of the mechanical hops separator, patented by Emil Clemens Horst in 1909.\\r\\nHarvest comes near the end of summer when the bines are pulled down and the flowers are taken to a hop house or oast house for drying. Hop houses are two-story buildings, of which the upper story has a slatted floor covered with burlap. Here the flowers are poured out and raked even. A heating unit on the lower floor is used to dry the hops. When dry, the hops are moved to a press, a sturdy box with a plunger. Two long pieces of burlap are laid into the hop press at right angles, the hops are poured in and compressed into bales.\\r\\nHop cones contain different oils, such as lupulin, a yellowish, waxy substance, an oleoresin, that imparts flavor and aroma to beer.[25] Lupulin contains lupulone and humulone, which possess antibiotic properties, suppressing bacterial growth favoring brewer's yeast to grow. After lupulin has been extracted in the brewing process the papery cones are discarded.\\r\\nThe need for massed labor at harvest time meant hop-growing had a big social impact. Around the world, the labor-intensive harvesting work involved large numbers of migrant workers who would travel for the annual hop harvest. Whole families would partake and live in hoppers' huts, with even the smallest children helping in the fields.[26][27] The final chapters of W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage and a large part of George Orwell's A Clergyman's Daughter contain a vivid description of London families participating in this annual hops harvest. In England, many of those picking hops in Kent were from eastern areas of London. This provided a break from urban conditions that was spent in the countryside. People also came from Birmingham and other Midlands cities to pick hops in the Malvern area of Worcestershire. Some photographs have been preserved.[28]\\r\\nParticularly in Kent, because of a shortage of small-denomination coin of the realm, many growers issued their own currency to those doing the labor. In some cases, the coins issued were adorned with fanciful hops images, making them quite beautiful.[29]\\r\\nIn the US, Prohibition had a major impact on hops productions, but remnants of this significant industry in West and Northwest US are still noticeable in the form of old hop kilns that survive throughout Sonoma County, among others. Florian Dauenhauer, of Santa Rosa in Sonoma County, became a manufacturer of hop-harvesting machines in 1940, in part because of the hop industry's importance to the county. This mechanization helped destroy the local industry by enabling large-scale mechanized production, which moved to larger farms in other areas.[30] Dauenhauer Manufacturing remains a current producer of hop harvesting machines.\\r\\nIn addition to water, cellulose, and various proteins, the chemical composition of hops consists of compounds important for imparting character to beer.[2][31]\\r\\nProbably the most important chemical compound within hops are the alpha acids or humulones. During wort boiling, the humulones are thermally isomerized into iso-alpha acids or isohumulones, which are responsible for the bitter taste of beer.[32]\\r\\nHops contain beta acids or lupulones sensitive to oxidative decomposition which may be detrimental to the taste of beer. For this reason, beta acids are considered a negative factor in brewing and many brewers usually choose hops with a low beta acid content.[32]\\r\\nThe main components of hops essential oils are terpene hydrocarbons consisting of myrcene, humulene and caryophyllene.[31] Myrcene is responsible for the pungent smell of fresh hops. Humulene and its oxidative reaction products may give beer its prominent hop aroma. Together, myrcene, humulene, and caryophyllene represent 80 to 90% of the total hops essential oil.[31]\\r\\nXanthohumol is the principal flavonoid in hops. The other well-studied prenylflavonoids are 8-prenylnaringenin and isoxanthohumol. Xanthohumol is under basic research for its potential properties, while 8-prenylnaringenin is a potent phytoestrogen.[33][34]\\r\\nHops are usually dried in an oast house before they are used in the brewing process.[35] Undried or \\"wet\\" hops are sometimes (since ca.1990) used.[36][37]\\r\\nThe wort (sugar-rich liquid produced from malt) is boiled with hops before it is cooled down and yeast is added, to start fermentation.\\r\\nThe effect of hops on the finished beer varies by type and use, though there are two main hop types: bittering and aroma.[2] Bittering hops have higher concentrations of alpha acids, and are responsible for the large majority of the bitter flavor of a beer. European (so-called \\"noble\\") hops typically average 5ÿ9% alpha acids by weight (AABW), and the newer American cultivars typically range from 8ÿ19% AABW. Aroma hops usually have a lower concentration of alpha acids (~5%) and are the primary contributors of hop aroma and (nonbitter) flavor. Bittering hops are boiled for a longer period of time, typically 60ÿ90 minutes, to maximize the isomerization of the alpha acids. They often have inferior aromatic properties, as the aromatic compounds evaporate off during the boil.\\r\\nThe degree of bitterness imparted by hops depends on the degree to which alpha acids are isomerized during the boil, and the impact of a given amount of hops is specified in International Bitterness Units. Unboiled hops are only mildly bitter. On the other hand, the nonbitter flavor and aroma of hops come from the essential oils, which evaporate during the boil.\\r\\nAroma hops are typically added to the wort later to prevent the evaporation of the essential oils, to impart \\"hop taste\\" (if during the final 30 minutes of boil) or \\"hop aroma\\" (if during the final 10 minutes, or less, of boil). Aroma hops are often added after the wort has cooled and while the beer ferments, a technique known as \\"dry hopping\\", which contributes to the hop aroma. Farnesene is a major component in some hops.[2] The composition of hop essential oils can differ between varieties and between years in the same variety, having a significant influence on flavor and aroma.[2]\\r\\nToday, a substantial amount of \\"dual-use\\" hops are used, as well. These have high concentrations of alpha acids and good aromatic properties. These can be added to the boil at any time, depending on the desired effect.[38] Hop acids also contribute to and stabilize the foam qualities of beer.[2]\\r\\nFlavors and aromas are described appreciatively using terms which include \\"grassy\\", \\"floral\\", \\"citrus\\", \\"spicy\\", \\"piney\\", \\"lemony\\", \\"grapefruit\\", and \\"earthy\\".[2][39] Many pale lagers have fairly low hop influence, while lagers marketed as Pilsener or brewed in the Czech Republic may have noticeable noble hop aroma. Certain ales (particularly the highly hopped style known as India Pale Ale, or IPA) can have high levels of hop bitterness.\\r\\nBrewers may use software tools to control the bittering levels in the boil and adjust recipes to account for a change in the hop bill or seasonal variations in the crop that may lead to the need to compensate for a difference in alpha acid contribution. Data may be shared with other brewers via BeerXML allowing the reproduction of a recipe allowing for differences in hop availability.\\r\\nThere are many different varieties of hops used in brewing today. Historically, hops varieties were identified by geography (such as Hallertau, Spalt, and Tettnang from Germany), by the farmer who is recognized as first cultivating them (such as Goldings or Fuggles from England), or by their growing habit (e. g., Oregon Cluster).[40][citation needed]\\r\\nAround 1900, a number of institutions began to experiment with breeding specific hop varieties. The breeding program at Wye College in Wye, Kent was started in 1904 and rose to prominence through the work of Prof. E. S. Salmon. Salmon released Brewer's Gold and Brewer's Favorite for commercial cultivation in 1934, and went on to release more than two dozen new cultivars before his death in 1959. Brewer's Gold has become the ancestor of the bulk of new hop releases around the world since its release.[41]\\r\\nWye College continued its breeding program and again received attention in the 1970s, when Dr. Ray A. Neve released Wye Target, Wye Challenger, Wye Northdown, Wye Saxon and Wye Yeoman. More recently, Wye College and its successor institution Wye Hops Ltd., have focused on breeding the first dwarf hop varieties, which are easier to pick by machine and far more economical to grow.[42] Wye College have also been responsible for breeding hop varieties that will grow with only 12 hours of daily light for the South African hop farmers. Wye College was closed in 2009 but the legacy of their hop breeding programs, particularly that of the dwarf varieties, is continuing as already the U.S.A. private and public breeding programs are using their stock material.\\r\\nParticular hop varieties are associated with beer regions and styles, for example pale lagers are usually brewed with European (often German, Polish or Czech) noble hop varieties such as Saaz, Hallertau and Strissel Spalt. British ales use hop varieties such as Fuggles, Goldings and W.G.V. North American beers often use Cascade hops, Columbus hops, Centennial hops, Willamette, Amarillo hops and about forty more varieties as the U.S.A. have lately been the more significant breeders of new hop varieties, including dwarf hop varieties.\\r\\nHops from New Zealand, such as Pacific Gem, Motueka and Nelson Sauvin, are used in a \\"Pacific Pale Ale\\" style of beer with increasing production in 2014.[43][citation needed]\\r\\nThe term \\"noble hops\\" traditionally refers to varieties of hops which are low in bitterness and high in aroma. They are the European cultivars or races Hallertau, Tettnanger, Spalt, and Saaz.[44]\\r\\nTheir low relative bitterness but strong aroma are often distinguishing characteristics of European-style lagers, such as Pilsener, Dunkel, and Oktoberfest/M?rzen. In beer, they are considered aroma hops (as opposed to bittering hops); see Pilsner Urquell as a classic example of the Bohemian Pilsener style, which showcases noble hops.\\r\\nAs with grapes, the location where hops are grown affects the hops' characteristics. Much as Dortmunder beer may within the EU be labelled \\"Dortmunder\\" only if it has been brewed in Dortmund, noble hops may officially be considered \\"noble\\" only if they were grown in the areas for which the hop varieties (races) were named.\\r\\nEnglish noble varieties are Fuggle, East Kent Goldings and Goldings. They are characterized through analysis as having an alpha:beta ratio of 1:1, low alpha-acid levels (2ÿ5%) with a low cohumulone content, low myrcene in the hop oil, high humulene in the oil, a ratio of humulene:caryophyllene above three, and poor storability resulting in them being more prone to oxidation. In reality, this means they have a relatively consistent bittering potential as they age, due to beta-acid oxidation, and a flavour that improves as they age during periods of poor storage.[45]\\r\\nIn addition to beer, hops are also used in herbal teas and in soft drinks. These soft drinks include Julmust (a carbonated beverage similar to soda that is popular in Sweden during December), Malta (a Latin American soft drink) and kvass.\\r\\nHops are also used in herbal medicine in a way similar to valerian, as a treatment for anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia.[46] A pillow filled with hops is a popular folk remedy for sleeplessness, and animal research has shown a sedative effect.[47] The relaxing effect of hops may be due, in part, to the specific degradation product from alpha acids, 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, as demonstrated from nighttime consumption of non-alcoholic beer.[47][48] 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol is structurally similar to tert-amyl alcohol which was historically used as an anesthetic. Hops tend to be unstable when exposed to light or air and lose their potency after a few months' storage.\\r\\nHops are of interest for hormone replacement therapy and are under basic research for potential relief of menstruation-related problems.[49]\\r\\nIn preliminary veterinary research, hops compounds are under study for potential activity against pasture-associated laminitis in horses.[50]\\r\\nHops can also be eaten, the young shoots of the bine are edible and can be cooked similar to asparagus.[51][52]\\r\\nDermatitis sometimes results from harvesting hops. Although few cases require medical treatment, an estimated 3% of the workers suffer some type of skin lesions on the face, hands, and legs.[53] Hops are toxic to dogs.[54]","input":"When did hops start being used in beer?"},{"output":"Carolina Reaper","context":"The Carolina Reaper, originally named the HP22B,[1] is a cultivar of the Capsicum chinense plant.

The figure is an average for the tested batch; the hottest individual pepper was measured at 2.2 million SHU.[4][5][6]\\r\\nThe original crossbreed was between a Bhut jolokia (a former world record holder) and a red habanero, and is named 'Reaper' due to the shape of its tail.[7][8]\\r\\nFor growing, the pepper has been described as \\"a good all-rounder to try at home\\" by UK ethnobotanist James Wong, who said that they require temperatures of at least 18ÿ20?C (64ÿ68?F) and suggested growing in 30ÿ40?cm (12ÿ16?in) pots to restrict growth and produce fruit sooner.[9] It has been described as having a fruity taste, with the initial bite being sweet and then immediately turning to \\"molten lava\\".[7][10] When fully ripe, two peppers occupy the palm of the hand.[10]\\r\\nIn May 2017, Mike Smith of St Asaph working with Nottingham Trent University claimed to have surpassed the Carolina Reaper with his Dragon's Breath pepper, reported to be 2.4?million SHUs, and applied to Guinness World Records for confirmation.[11] As of September 2017, the hottest chili pepper known was Pepper X, having a reported Scoville scale of 3.18 million units.[12]\\r\\nIn April 2018, a case report of \\"thunderclap headaches\\" in a 34 year old man ÿ who was hospitalized a few days after consuming one Carolina Reaper pepper of unspecified size in a contest ÿ included a presumptive diagnosis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS).[13][14] With no reason to believe pepper compounds had a role in the mechanism of RCVS, other clinical interpretations, such as a stress response from eating such a hot pepper, may explain the headaches.[15]\\r\\n30-day-old Carolina Reaper plant\\r\\nMature plant\\r\\nMature plant","input":"What is the hottest pepper in the usa?"},{"output":"water ice and rocky material","context":"","input":"What is saturn's moon titan made of?"},{"output":"William James, an American philosopher and psychologist who trained to be a physician before going into psychology","context":"The Principles of Psychology is an 1890 book about psychology by William James, an American philosopher and psychologist who trained to be a physician before going into psychology. There are four methods from James' book: stream of consciousness (James' most famous psychological metaphor); emotion (later known as the JamesÿLange theory); habit (human habits are constantly formed to achieve certain results); and will (through James' personal experiences in life).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe openings of The Principles of Psychology presented what was known at the time of writing about the localization of functions in the brain: how each sense seemed to have a neural center to which it reported and how varied bodily motions have their sources in other centers.\\r\\nThe particular hypotheses and observations on which James relied are now very dated, but the broadest conclusion to which his material leads is still valid, which was that the functions of the \\"lower centers\\" (beneath the cerebrum) become increasingly specialized as one moves from reptiles, through ever more intelligent mammals, to inhumans while the functions of the cerebrum itself become increasingly flexible and less localized as one moves along the same continuum.\\r\\nJames also discussed experiments on illusions (optical, auditory, etc.) and offered a physiological explanation for many of them, including that \\"the brain reacts by paths which previous experiences have worn, and makes us usually perceive the probable thing, i.e. the thing by which on previous occasions the reaction was most frequently aroused.\\" Illusions are thus a special case of the phenomenon of habit.\\r\\nIn the use of the comparative method, James wrote, \\"instincts of animals are ransacked to throw light on our own....\\"[1] By this light, James dismisses the platitude that \\"man differs from lower creatures by the almost total absence of instincts\\".[2] There is no such absence, so the difference must be found elsewhere.\\r\\nJames believed that humans wielded far more impulses than other creatures. Impulses which, when observed out of their greater context, may have appeared just as automatic as the most basic of animal instincts. However, as man experienced the results of his impulses, and these experiences evoked memories and expectations, those very same impulses became gradually refined.[3]\\r\\nBy this reasoning, William James arrived at the conclusion that in any animal with the capacity for memory, association, and expectation, behavior is ultimately expressed as a synthesis of instinct and experience, rather than just blind instinct alone.[4]\\r\\nThe Principles of Psychology covered a large number of topics, but some topics stand out as being more useful and applicable than others, particularly the sections on stream of consciousness, emotion, habit, and will.\\r\\nStream of consciousness is arguably James' most famous psychological metaphor.[5] He argued that human thought can be characterized as a flowing stream, which was an innovative concept at the time due to the prior argument being that human thought was more so like a distinct chain. He also believed that humans can never experience exactly the same thought or idea more than once. In addition to this, he viewed consciousness as completely continuous.\\r\\nJames introduced a new theory of emotion (later known as the JamesÿLange theory), which argued that an emotion is instead the consequence rather than the cause of the bodily experiences associated with its expression.[5] In other words, a stimulus causes a physical response and an emotion follows the response. This theory has received criticism throughout the years since its introduction, but regardless, it still has its merits.\\r\\nHuman habits are constantly formed to achieve certain results because of one's strong feelings of wanting or wishing for something. James emphasized the importance and power of human habit and proceeded to draw a conclusion. James noted that the laws of habit formation are unbiased, habits are capable of causing either good or bad actions. And once either a good or bad habit has begun to be established, it is very difficult to change.[5]\\r\\nWill is the final chapter of The Principles of Psychology, which was through James' own personal experiences in life. There was one question that troubled James during his crisis, which was whether or not free will existed.[5] \\"The most essential achievement of the will,... when it is most 'voluntary', is to attend to a difficult object and hold it fast before the mind...\\" Effort of attention is thus the essential phenomenon of will.\\"[5]\\r\\nThe Principles of Psychology was a vastly influential textbook which summarized the field of psychology through the time of its publication. Psychology was beginning to gain popularity and acclaim in the United States at this time, and the compilation of this textbook only further solidified psychology's credibility as a science. Philosopher Helmut R. Wagner writes that most of the book's contents are now outdated, but that it still contains insights of interest.[6]","input":"Who wrote the early textbook principles of psychology?"},{"output":"20 January 1788","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1788 and 1868, about 162,000 convicts were transported by the British government to various penal colonies in Australia.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British government began transporting convicts overseas to American colonies in the early 17th century. When transportation ended with the start of the American Revolution, an alternative site was needed to relieve further overcrowding of British prisons and hulks. Earlier in 1770, James Cook charted and claimed possession of the east coast of Australia for Britain. Seeking to pre-empt the French colonial empire from expanding into the region, Britain chose Australia as the site of a penal colony, and in 1787, the First Fleet of eleven convict ships set sail for Botany Bay, arriving on 20 January 1788 to found Sydney, New South Wales, the first European settlement on the continent. Other penal colonies were later established in Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) in 1803 and Queensland in 1824, while Western Australia, founded in 1829 as a free colony, received convicts from 1850. Victoria and South Australia remained free colonies. Penal transportation to Australia peaked in the 1830s and dropped off significantly the following decade. The last convict ship arrived in Western Australia on 10 January 1868.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany convicts were transported for petty crimes. More serious crimes, such as rape and murder, were punishable by death, and therefore not transportable offences. Once emancipated, most ex-convicts stayed in Australia and joined the free settlers, with some rising to prominent positions in Australian society. However, convictism carried a social stigma, and for some later Australians, convict origins would be a source of shame. Attitudes became more accepting in the 20th century and it is now considered by many Australians to be a cause for celebration to have a convict in one's lineage. Around 20% of modern Australians are descended from transported convicts.[2] The convict era has inspired famous novels, films, and other cultural works, and the extent to which it has shaped Australia's national character has been studied by many writers and historians.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Robert Hughes in The Fatal Shore, the population of England and Wales, which had remained steady at 6 million from 1700 to 1740, began rising considerably after 1740. By the time of the American Revolution, London was overcrowded, filled with the unemployed, and flooded with cheap gin.[4] Poverty, social injustice, child labor, harsh and dirty living conditions and long working hours were prevalent in 19th-century Britain. Dickens' novels perhaps best illustrate this; even some government officials were horrified by what they saw. Only in 1833 and 1844 were the first general laws against child labour (the Factory Acts) passed in the United Kingdom.[5] Crime had become a major problem and in 1784 a French observer noted that \\"from sunset to dawn the environs of London became the patrimony of brigands for twenty miles around.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach parish had a watchman, but British cities did not have police forces in the modern sense. Jeremy Bentham avidly promoted the idea of a circular prison, but the penitentiary was seen by many government officials as a peculiar American concept. Virtually all malefactors were caught by informers or denounced to the local court by their victims.[citation needed] Pursuant to the so-called \\"Bloody Code\\", by the 1770s there were 222 crimes in Britain which carried the death penalty,[7] almost all of which were crimes against property. These included such offences as the stealing of goods worth over 5 shillings, the cutting down of a tree, the theft of an animal, even the theft of a rabbit from a warren.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Industrial Revolution led to an increase in petty crime due to the economic displacement of much of the population, building pressure on the government to find an alternative to confinement in overcrowded gaols. The situation was so dire that hulks left over from the Seven Years' War were used as makeshift floating prisons.[8] Eight of every 10 prisoners were in jail for theft. The Bloody Code was gradually rescinded in the 1800s because judges and juries considered its punishments too harsh. Since lawmakers still wanted punishments to deter potential criminals, they increasingly applied transportation as a more humane alternative to execution.[9] Transportation had been employed as a punishment for both major and petty crimes since the seventeenth century. Around 60,000 convicts were transported to the British colonies in North America in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Transportation to the Americas ceased following Britain's defeat in the American Revolutionary War.  The number of convicts transported to North America is not verified although it has been estimated to be 50,000 by John Dunmore Lang and 120,000 by Thomas Keneally. The British American colony of Maryland received a larger felon quota than any other province.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternatives to the American colonies were investigated and the newly discovered and mapped East Coast of New Holland was proposed. The details provided by James Cook during his expedition to the South Pacific in 1770 made it the most suitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 August 1786 the decision was made to send a colonisation party of convicts, military, and civilian personnel to Botany Bay under the command of Admiral Arthur Phillip who was to be the Governor of the new colony. There were 775 convicts on board six transport ships. They were accompanied by officials, members of the crew, marines, the families thereof and their own children who together totaled 645. In all, eleven ships were sent in what became known as the First Fleet. Other than the convict transports, there were two naval escorts and three storeships. The fleet assembled in Portsmouth and set sail on 13 May 1787.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fleet arrived at Botany Bay on 20 January 1788. It soon became clear that it would not be suitable for the establishment of a colony due to \\"the openness of this bay, and the dampness of the soil, by which the people would probably be rendered unhealthy\\" and Philip decided to examine Port Jackson, a bay mentioned by Captain Cook, about three leagues to the north. On 22 January a small expedition led by Phillips sailed to Port Jackson, arriving in the early afternoon:[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nHere all regret arising from the former disappointments was at once obliterated; and Governor Phillip had the satisfaction to find one of the finest harbours in the world, in which a thousand sail of the line might ride in perfect security. The different coves of this harbour were examined with all possible expedition, and the preference was given to one which had the finest spring of water, and in which ships can anchor so close to the shore, that at a very small expence quays may be constructed at which the largest vessels may unload. This cove is about half a mile in length, and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance. In honour of Lord Sydney, the Governor distinguished it by the name of Sydney Cove.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere they established the first permanent European colony on the Australian continent, New South Wales, on 26 January. The area has since developed into the city of Sydney.  This date is still celebrated as Australia Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was initially a high mortality rate amongst the members of the first fleet due mainly to shortages of food. The ships carried only enough food to provide for the settlers until they could establish agriculture in the region. Unfortunately, there were an insufficient number of skilled farmers and domesticated livestock to do this, and the colony waited for the arrival of the Second Fleet. The second fleet was an unprecedented disaster that provided little in the way of help and upon its delivery in June 1790 of still more sick and dying convicts, which actually worsened the situation in Port Jackson.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant-General Sir Richard Bourke was the ninth Governor of the Colony of New South Wales between 1831 and 1837.  Appalled by the excessive punishments doled out to convicts, Bourke passed 'The Magistrates Act', which limited the sentence a magistrate could pass to fifty lashes (previously there was no such limit). Bourke's administration was controversial, and furious magistrates and employers petitioned the crown against this interference with their legal rights, fearing that a reduction in punishments would cease to provide enough deterrence to the convicts.\\r\\n\\r\\nBourke, however, was not dissuaded from his reforms and continued to create controversy within the colony by combating the inhumane treatment handed out to convicts, including limiting the number of convicts each employer was allowed to seventy, as well as granting rights to freed convicts, such as allowing the acquisition of property and service on juries. It has been argued that the suspension of convict transportation to New South Wales in 1840[12] can be attributed to the actions of Bourke and other men like Australian-born lawyer William Charles Wentworth. It took another 10 years, but transportation to the colony of New South Wales was finally officially abolished on 1 October 1850.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a convict was well behaved, the convict could be given a ticket of leave, granting some freedom. At the end of the convict's sentence, seven years in most cases, the convict was issued with a Certificate of Freedom. He was then free to become a settler or to return to England. Convicts who misbehaved, however, were often sent to a place of secondary punishment like Port Arthur, Tasmania or Norfolk Island, where they would suffer additional punishment and solitary confinement.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a month of the arrival of the First Fleet at Sydney Cove, a group of convicts and free settlers were sent to take control of Norfolk Island, a small island 1,412 kilometres (877?mi) east of the coast of New South Wales. More convicts were sent, and many of them proved to be unruly; early 1789 saw a failed attempt to overthrow Lieutenant Philip Gidley King, the island's commandant. This was followed by the wreck of HMS?Sirius on one of the island's reefs while attempting to land stores.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1803, a British expedition was sent from Sydney to Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land) to establish a new penal colony there. The small party, led by Lt. John Bowen, established a settlement at Risdon Cove, on the eastern side of the Derwent River. Originally sent to Port Philip, but abandoned within weeks, another expedition led by Lieutenant-Colonel David Collins arrived soon after.  Collins considered the Risdon Cove site inadequate, and in 1804 he established an alternative settlement on the western side of the river at Sullivan's Cove, Tasmania. This later became known as Hobart, and the original settlement at Risdon Cove was deserted.  Collins became the first Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the convict station on Norfolk Island was abandoned in 1807-1808, the remaining convicts and free settlers were transported to Hobart and allocated land for re-settlement.  However, as the existing small population was already experiencing difficulties producing enough food, the sudden doubling of the population was almost catastrophic.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 1816, more free settlers began arriving from Great Britain. On 3 December 1825 Tasmania was declared a colony separate from New South Wales, with a separate administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Macquarie Harbour penal colony on the West Coast of Tasmania was established in 1820 to exploit the valuable timber Huon Pine growing there for furniture making and shipbuilding. Macquarie Harbour had the added advantage of being almost impossible to escape from, most attempts ending with the convicts either drowning, dying of starvation in the bush, or (on at least two occasions) turning cannibal.  Convicts sent to this settlement had usually re-offended during their sentence of transportation, and were treated very harshly, labouring in cold and wet weather, and subjected to severe corporal punishment for minor infractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1830, the Port Arthur penal settlement was established to replace Macquarie Harbour, as it was easier to maintain regular communications by sea. Although known in popular history as a particularly harsh prison, in reality its management was far more humane than Macquarie Harbour or the outlying stations of New South Wales. Experimentation with the so-called model prison system took place in Port Arthur.  Solitary confinement was the preferred method of punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany changes were made to the manner in which convicts were handled in the general population, largely responsive to British public opinion on the harshness of their treatment.  Until the late 1830s most convicts were either retained by Government for public works or assigned to private individuals as a form of indentured labour.  From the early 1840s the Probation System was employed, where convicts spent an initial period, usually two years, in public works gangs on stations outside of the main settlements, then were freed to work for wages within a set district.\\r\\n\\r\\nTransportation to Tasmania ended in 1853 (see section below on Cessation of Transportation).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1803 two ships arrived in Port Phillip, which Lt. John Murray in the Lady Nelson had discovered and named the previous year. The Calcutta under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Collins transported 300 convicts, accompanied by the supply ship Ocean.  Collins had previously been Judge Advocate with the First Fleet in 1788.  He chose Sullivan Bay near the present-day Sorrento, Victoria for the first settlement - some 90?km south of present-day Melbourne. About two months later the settlement was abandoned due to poor soil and water shortages and Collins moved the convicts to Hobart. Several convicts had escaped into the bush and were left behind to unknown fates with the local aboriginal people. One such convict, the subsequently celebrated William Buckley, lived in the western side of Port Phillip for the next 32 years before approaching the new settlers and assisting as an interpreter for the indigenous peoples.\\r\\n\\r\\nA second settlement was established at Westernport Bay, on the site of present-day Corinella, in November 1826. It comprised an initial 20 soldiers and 22 convicts, with another 12 convicts arriving subsequently. This settlement was abandoned in February 1828, and all convicts returned to Sydney.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Port Phillip District was officially sanctioned in 1837 following the landing of the Henty brothers in Portland Bay in 1834, and John Batman settled on the site of Melbourne.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1844 and 1849 about 1,750 convicts arrived there from England. They were referred to either as \\"Exiles\\" or the \\"Pentonvillians\\" because most of them came from Pentonville Probationary Prison. Unlike earlier convicts who were required to work for the government or on hire from penal depots, the Exiles were free to work for pay, but could not leave the district to which they were assigned.  The Port Phillip District was still part of New South Wales at this stage. Victoria separated from New South Wales and became an independent colony in 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1823 John Oxley sailed north from Sydney to inspect Port Curtis and Moreton Bay as possible sites for a penal colony. At Moreton Bay he found the Brisbane River, which Cook had guessed would exist, and explored the lower part of it. In September 1824, he returned with soldiers and established a temporary settlement at Redcliffe. On 2 December 1824, the settlement was transferred to where the Central Business District (CBD) of Brisbane now stands. The settlement was at first called Edenglassie. In 1839 transportation of convicts to Moreton Bay ceased and the Brisbane penal settlement was closed. In 1842 free settlement was permitted and people began to colonize the area voluntarily. On 6 June 1859 Queensland became a colony separate from New South Wales.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough a convict-supported settlement was established in Western Australia from 1826 to 1831, direct transportation of convicts did not begin until 1850. It continued until 1868. During that period, 9,668 convicts were transported on 43 convict ships. The first convicts to arrive were transported to New South Wales, and sent by that colony to King George Sound (Albany) in 1826 to help establish a settlement there. At that time the western third of Australia was unclaimed land known as New Holland. Fears that France would lay claim to the land prompted the Governor of New South Wales, Ralph Darling, to send Major Edmund Lockyer, with troops and 23 convicts, to establish a settlement at King George Sound. Lockyer's party arrived on Christmas Day, 1826. A convict presence was maintained at the settlement for over four years. On 7 March 1831 control of the settlement was transferred to the Swan River Colony, and the troops and convicts were withdrawn.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1848, Charles Fitzgerald, Governor of Western Australia, petitioned Britain to send convicts to his state because of labor shortages. Britain rejected sending fixed term convicts, but offered to send first offenders in the final years of their terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost convicts in Western Australia spent very little time in prison. Those who were stationed at Fremantle were housed in the Convict Establishment, the colony's convict prison, and misbehaviour was punished by stints there. The majority, however, were stationed in other parts of the colony. Although there was no convict assignment in Western Australia, there was a great demand for public infrastructure throughout the colony, so that many convicts were stationed in remote areas. Initially, most offenders were set to work creating infrastructure for the convict system, including the construction of the Convict Establishment itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1852 a Convict Depot was built at Albany, but closed 3 years later. When shipping increased the Depot was re-opened. Most of the convicts had their Ticket-of-Leave and were hired to work by the free settlers. Convicts also manned the pilot boat, rebuilt York Street and Stirling Terrace; and the track from Albany to Perth was made into a good road. An Albany newspaper noted their commendable behaviour and wrote, \\"There were instances in which our free settlers might take an example\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nWestern Australia's convict era came to an end with the cessation of penal transportation by Britain. In May 1865, the colony was advised of the change in British policy, and told that Britain would send one convict ship in each of the years 1865, 1866 and 1867, after which transportation would cease. In accordance with this, the last convict ship to Western Australia, the Hougoumont, left Britain in 1867 and arrived in Western Australia on 10 January 1868.\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 20% of the transportees were women. For protection, most quickly attached themselves to male officers or convicts. Although they were routinely referred to as courtesans, relatively few had been prostitutes in England as prostitution, like murder, was not a transportable offence.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical prisoners made up a small proportion of convicts. They arrived in waves corresponding to political unrest in Britain and Ireland. They included the  First Scottish Martyrs in 1794; British Naval Mutineers (from the Nore Mutiny) in 1797 and 1801; Irish rebels in 1798, 1803, 1848 and 1868; Scots Rebels (1820); Yorkshire Rebels (1820 and 1822); leaders of the Merthyr Tydfil rising of 1831; the Tolpuddle Martyrs (1834); Swing Rioters and Luddites (1828ÿ1833); American and French-Canadian prisoners from the Upper Canada rebellion and Lower Canada Rebellion (1839), and Chartists (1842).[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith increasing numbers of free settlers entering New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) by the mid-1830s, opposition to the transportation of felons into the colonies grew.  The most influential spokesmen were newspaper proprietors who were also members of the Independent Congregation Church such as John Fairfax in Sydney and the Reverend John West in Launceston, who argued against convicts both as competition to honest free labourers and as the source of crime and vice within the colony.  Bishop Bernard Ullathorne, a Catholic prelate who had been in Australia since 1832 returned for a visit to England in 1835.  While there he was called upon by the government to give evidence before a Parliamentary Commission on the evils of transportation, and at their request wrote and submitted a tract on the subject.\\r\\nHis views in conjunction with others in the end prevailed. The anti-transportation movement was seldom concerned with the inhumanity of the system, but rather the hated stain it was believed to inflict on the free (non-emancipist) middle classes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTransportation to New South Wales ended in 1840, by which time some 150,000 convicts had been sent to the colonies.  The sending of convicts to Brisbane in its Moreton Bay district had ceased the previous year, and administration of Norfolk Island was later transferred to Van Diemen's Land.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe continuation of transportation to Van Diemen's Land saw the rise of a well-coordinated anti-transportation movement, especially following a severe economic depression in the early 1840s.  Transportation was temporarily suspended in 1846 but soon revived with overcrowding of British gaols and clamour for the availability of transportation as a deterrent.  By the late 1840s most convicts being sent to Van Diemen's Land (plus those to Victoria) were designated as \\"exiles\\" and were free to work for pay while under sentence.  In 1850 the Australasian Anti-Transportation League was formed to lobby for the permanent cessation of transportation, its aims being furthered by the commencement of the Australian gold rushes the following year.  The last convict ship to be sent from England, the St. Vincent, arrived in 1853, and on 10 August Jubilee festivals in Hobart and Launceston celebrated 50 years of European settlement with the official end of transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTransportation continued in small numbers to Western Australia.  The last convict ship, the Hougoumont, left Britain in 1867 and arrived in Western Australia on 10 January 1868. In all, about 164,000 convicts were transported to the Australian colonies between 1788 and 1868 on board 806 ships. Convicts were made up of English and Welsh (70%), Irish (24%), Scottish (5%) and the remaining 1% from the British outposts in India and Canada, Maoris from New Zealand, Chinese from Hong Kong and slaves from the Caribbean.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly South Australia and the Northern Territory had never accepted convicts directly from England but they still accepted ex-convicts from the other states. Many convicts were allowed to travel as far as New Zealand to make a new life after being given limited freedom, even if they were not allowed to return home to England. At this time the Australian population was approximately 1 million and the colonies could now sustain themselves without the need for convict labour.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, UNESCO inscribed 11 Australian Convict Sites on its World Heritage List. The listing recognises the sites as \\"the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nConvict George Barrington is (perhaps apocryphally) recorded as having written the prologue for the first theatrical play performed by convicts in Australia, one year after the First Fleet's arrival. It is known as \\"Our Country's Good\\", based on the now-famous closing stanza:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poems of Frank the Poet are among the few surviving literary works done by a convict while still incarcerated. His best-known work is \\"A Convict's Tour of Hell\\". A version of the convict ballad \\"Moreton Bay\\", detailing the brutal punishments meted out by commandment Patrick Logan and his death at the hands of Aborigines, is also attributed to Frank. Other convict ballads include \\"Jim Jones at Botany Bay\\". The ballad \\"Botany Bay\\", which describes the sadness felt by convicts forced to leave their loved ones in England, was written at least 40 years after the end of transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the most famous convict in all of fiction is Abel Magwitch, a main character of Charles Dickens' 1861 novel Great Expectations. The most famous convict novel is Marcus Clarke's For the Term of His Natural Life (1874), followed by John Boyle O'Reilly's Moondyne (1879). The Broad Arrow by Caroline Woolmer Leakey was one of the first novels to depict the convict experience, and one of the only to feature a female convict as its protagonist (Marcus Clarke drew on Leakey's book in writing For the Term of His Natural Life).[20] Thomas Keneally explores the convict era in his novels Bring Larks and Heroes (1967) and The Playmaker (1987). Convicts feature heavily in Patrick White's take on the Eliza Fraser story, the 1976 novel A Fringe of Leaves. Convictism is canvassed in Bryce Courtenay's \\"Australian trilogy\\": The Potato Factory (1995), Tommo & Hawk (1997) and Solomon's Song (1999). The title character of Peter Carey's 1997 novel Jack Maggs is a reworking of Dickens' Magwitch character. Many modern works of Tasmanian Gothic focus on the state's convict past, including Gould's Book of Fish (2001) by Richard Flanagan, a fictionalised account of convict artist William Buelow Gould's imprisonment at Macquarie Harbour. Kate Grenville based the novel The Secret River (2005) on the life of her convict ancestor Solomon Wiseman.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with bushrangers and other stock characters of colonial life, convicts were a popular subject during Australia's silent film era. The first convict film was a 1908 adaptiation of Marcus Clarke's For the Term of His Natural Life, shot on location at Port Arthur with an unheard-of budget of S7000.[21] This was followed by two more films inspired by Clarke's novel: The Life of Rufus Dawes (1911), which draws on Alfred Dampier's stage production of His Natural Life, and the landmark For the Term of His Natural Life (1927), one of the most expensive silent films ever made.[21] W. J. Lincoln directed many convict melodramas including It Is Never Too Late to Mend (1911), an adaptation of Charles Reade's 1856 novel about cruelties of the convict system; Moodyne (1913), based on John Boyle O'Reilly's novel; and Transported (1913). Other early titles include Sentenced for Life, The Mark of the Lash, One Hundred Years Ago, The Lady Outlaw and The Assigned Servant, all released in 1911. Few convict films were made after 1930; even the Australian New Wave of the 1970s, with its emphasis on Australia's colonial past, largely avoided the convict era in favour of nostalgic period pieces set in the bush around the time of Federation. One exception is Journey Among Women (1977), a feminist imagining of what life was like for convict women.[21] Alexander Pearce, the infamous Tasmanian convict and cannibal, is the inspiration for The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce (2008), Dying Breed (2008) and Van Diemen's Land (2009).","input":"When did the first fleet arrive in aus?"},{"output":"northern Europe","context":"A motte-and-bailey castle is a fortification with a wooden or stone keep situated on a raised earthwork called a motte, accompanied by an enclosed courtyard, or bailey, surrounded by a protective ditch and palisade. Relatively easy to build with unskilled, often forced, labour, but still militarily formidable, these castles were built across northern Europe from the 10th century onwards, spreading from Normandy and Anjou in France, into the Holy Roman Empire in the 11th century. The Normans introduced the design into England and Wales following their invasion in 1066. Motte-and-bailey castles were adopted in Scotland, Ireland, the Low Countries and Denmark in the 12th and 13th centuries. By the end of the 13th century, the design was largely superseded by alternative forms of fortification, but the earthworks remain a prominent feature in many countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA motte-and-bailey castle was made up of two structures, a motte, a type of moundÿoften artificialÿtopped with a wooden or stone structure known as a keep; and at least one bailey, a fortified enclosure built next to the motte. The term \\"motte and bailey\\" is a relatively modern one, and is not medieval in origin.[2] The word \\"motte\\" is the French version of the Latin mota, and in France the word motte was initially an early word for a turf; it then became used to refer to a turf bank, and by the 12th century was used to refer to the castle design itself.[3] The word \\"bailey\\" comes from the Norman-French baille, or basse-cour, referring to a low yard.[4] In medieval sources, the Latin term castellum was used to describe the bailey complex within these castles.[5]\\r\\nOne contemporary account of these structures comes from Jean de Colmieu around 1130, describing the Calais region in northern France. De Colmieu described how the nobles would build \\"a mound of earth as high as they can and dig a ditch about it as wide and deep as possible. The space on top of the mound is enclosed by a palisade of very strong hewn logs, strengthened at intervals by as many towers as their means can provide. Inside the enclosure is a citadel, or keep, which commands the whole circuit of the defences. The entrance to the fortress is by means of a bridge, which, rising from the outer side of the moat and supported on posts as it ascends, reaches to the top of the mound.\\"[6] At Durham Castle, contemporaries described how the motte-and-bailey superstructure arose from the \\"tumulus of rising earth\\" with a keep rising \\"into thin air, strong within and without\\" with a \\"stalwart house...glittering with beauty in every part\\".[7]\\r\\nMottes were made out of earth and flattened on top, and it can be very hard to determine whether a mound is artificial or natural without excavation.[8] Some were also built over older artificial structures, such as Bronze Age barrows.[9] The size of mottes varied considerably, with these mounds being 3 metres to 30 metres in height (10 feet to 100 feet), and from 30 to 90 metres (98 to 295?ft) in diameter.[10] This minimum height of 3 metres (9.8 feet) for mottes is usually intended to exclude smaller mounds which often had non-military purposes.[11] In England and Wales, only 7% of mottes were taller than 10 metres (33 feet) high; 24% were between 10 and 5 metres (33 and 16?ft), and 69% were less than 5 metres (16 feet) tall.[12] A motte was protected by a ditch around it, which would typically have also been a source of the earth and soil for constructing the mound itself.[13]\\r\\nA keep and a protective wall would usually be built on top of the motte. Some walls would be large enough to have a wall-walk around them, and the outer walls of the motte and the wall-walk could be strengthened by filling in the gap between the wooden walls with earth and stones, allowing it to carry more weight; this was called a garillum.[14] Smaller mottes could only support simple towers with room for a few soldiers, whilst larger mottes could be equipped with a much grander building.[15] Many wooden keeps were designed with a bretasche, a square building that overhung from the upper floors of the building, enabling better defences and a more sturdy structural design.[16] The early 12th-century chronicler Lambert of Ardres described the wooden keep on top of the motte at the castle of Ardres, where the \\"first storey was on the surface of the ground, where were cellars and granaries, and great boxes, tuns, casks, and other domestic utensils. In the storey above were the dwelling and common living-rooms of the residents in which were the larders, the rooms of the bakers and butlers, and the great chamber in which the lord and his wife slept...In the upper storey of the house were garret rooms...In this storey also the watchmen and the servants appointed to keep the house took their sleep\\".[17] Wooden structures on mottes could be protected by skins and hides to prevent them being easily set alight during a siege.[15]\\r\\nThe bailey was an enclosed courtyard overlooked by the motte and surrounded by a wooden fence called a palisade and another ditch.[18] The bailey was often kidney-shaped to fit against a circular motte, but could be made in other shapes according to the terrain.[18] The bailey would contain a wide number of buildings, including a hall, kitchens, a chapel, barracks, stores, stables, forges or workshops, and was the centre of the castle's economic activity.[19] The bailey was linked to the motte either by a flying bridge stretching between the two, or, more popularly in England, by steps cut into the motte.[20] Typically the ditch of the motte and the bailey joined, forming a figure of eight around the castle.[21] Wherever possible, nearby streams and rivers would be dammed or diverted, creating water-filled moats, artificial lakes and other forms of water defences.[22]\\r\\nIn practice, there was a wide number of variations to this common design.[23] A castle could have more than one bailey: at Warkworth Castle an inner and an outer bailey was constructed, or alternatively, several baileys could flank the motte, as at Windsor Castle.[24] Some baileys had two mottes, such as those at Lincoln.[24] Some mottes could be square instead of round, such as at Cabal Trump.[24] Instead of single ditches, occasionally double-ditch defences were built, as seen at Berkhamsted.[24] Local geography and the intent of the builder produced many unique designs.[25]\\r\\nVarious methods were used to build mottes. Where a natural hill could be used, scarping could produce a motte without the need to create an artificial mound, but more commonly much of the motte would have to be constructed by hand.[20] Four methods existed for building a mound and a tower: the mound could either be built first, and a tower placed on top of it; the tower could alternatively be built on the original ground surface and then buried within the mound; the tower could potentially be built on the original ground surface and then partially buried within the mound, the buried part forming a cellar beneath; or the tower could be built first, and the mound added later.[26]\\r\\nRegardless of the sequencing, artificial mottes had to be built by piling up earth; this work was undertaken by hand, using wooden shovels and hand-barrows, possibly with picks as well in the later periods.[27] Larger mottes took disproportionately more effort to build than their smaller equivalents, because of the volumes of earth involved.[27] The largest mottes in England, such as Thetford, are estimated to have required up to 24,000 man-days of work; smaller ones required perhaps as little as 1,000.[28] Contemporary accounts talk of some mottes being built in a matter of days, although these low figures have led to suggestions by historians that either these figures were an underestimate, or that they refer to the construction of a smaller design than that later seen on the sites concerned.[29] Taking into account estimates of the likely available manpower during the period, historians estimate that the larger mottes might have taken between four and nine months to build.[30] This contrasted favourably with stone keeps of the period, which typically took up to ten years to build.[31] Very little skilled labour was required to build motte and bailey castles, which made them very attractive propositions if forced peasant labour was available, as was the case after the Norman invasion of England.[20] Where the local workforce had to be paid ÿ such as at Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 using imported labourers ÿ the costs would rise quickly, in this case reaching S20.[32]\\r\\nThe type of soil would make a difference to the design of the motte, as clay soils could support a steeper motte, whilst sandier soils meant that a motte would need a more gentle incline.[15] Where available, layers of different sorts of earth, such as clay, gravel and chalk, would be used alternatively to build in strength to the design.[33] Layers of turf could also be added to stabilise the motte as it was built up, or a core of stones placed as the heart of the structure to provide strength.[34] Similar issues applied to the defensive ditches, where designers found that the wider the ditch was dug, the deeper and steeper the sides of the scarp could be, making it more defensive.[15] Although militarily a motte was, as Norman Pounds describes it, \\"almost indestructible\\", they required frequent maintenance.[35] Soil wash was a problem, particularly with steeper mounds, and mottes could be clad with wood or stone slabs to protect them.[20] Over time, some mottes suffered from subsidence or damage from flooding, requiring repairs and stabilisation work.[36]\\r\\nAlthough motte-and-bailey castles are the best known castle design, they were not always the most numerous in any given area.[37] A popular alternative was the ringwork castle, involving a palisade being built on top of a raised earth rampart, protected by a ditch. The choice of motte and bailey or ringwork was partially driven by terrain, as mottes were typically built on low ground, and on deeper clay and alluvial soils.[38] Another factor may have been speed, as ringworks were faster to build than mottes.[39] Some ringwork castles were later converted into motte-and-bailey designs, by filling in the centre of the ringwork to produce a flat-topped motte.[40] The reasons for why this decision was taken are unclear; motte-and-bailey castles may have been felt to be more prestigious, or easier to defend; another theory is that like the terpen in Netherlands, or Vorburg and Hauptburg in Lower Rhineland, raising the height of the castle was done to create a drier site.[40]\\r\\nThe motte-and-bailey castle is a particularly northern European phenomenon, most numerous in Normandy and Britain, but also seen in Denmark, Germany, Southern Italy and occasionally beyond.[41] European castles first emerged in the 9th and 10th centuries, after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes and local territories became threatened by the Magyars and the Norse.[42] Against this background, various explanations have been put forward to explain the origins and spread of the motte-and-bailey design across northern Europe; there is often a tension among the academic community between explanations that stress military and social reasons for the rise of this design.[43] One suggestion is that these castles were built particularly in order to protect against external attack?ÿ the Angevins, it is argued, began to build them to protect against the Viking raids, and the design spread to deal with the attacks along the Slav and Hungarian frontiers.[44] Another argument is that, given the links between this style of castle and the Normans, who were of Viking descent, it was in fact originally a Viking design, transported to Normandy and Angers.[45] The motte-and-bailey castle was certainly effective against assault, although as historian Andr Debord suggests, the historical and archaeological record of the military operation of motte-and-bailey castles remains relatively limited.[46]\\r\\nAn alternative approach focuses on the links between this form of castle and what can be termed a feudal mode of society. The spread of motte-and-bailey castles was usually closely tied to the creation of local fiefdoms and feudal landowners, and areas without this method of governance rarely built these castles.[47] Yet another theory suggests that the design emerged as a result of the pressures of space on ringworks, and that the earliest motte-and-baileys were converted ringworks.[48][nb 1] Finally, there may be a link between the local geography and the building of motte-and-bailey castles, which are usually built on low-lying areas, in many cases subject to regular flooding.[49] Regardless of the reasons behind the initial popularity of the motte-and-bailey design, however, there is widespread agreement that the castles were first widely adopted in Normandy and Angevin territory in the 10th and 11th centuries.[50]\\r\\nThe earliest purely documentary evidence for motte-and-bailey castles in Normandy and Angers comes from between 1020 and 1040, but a combination of documentary and archaeological evidence pushes the date for the first motte and bailey castle, at Vincy, back to 979.[3] The castles were built by the more powerful lords of Anjou in the late 10th and 11th centuries, in particular Fulk III and his son, Geoffrey II, who built a great number of them between 987 and 1060.[51] Many of these earliest castles would have appeared quite crude and rustic by later standards, belying the power and prestige of their builders.[52] William the Conqueror, as the Duke of Normandy, is believed to have adopted the motte-and-bailey design from neighbouring Anjou.[53] Duke William went on to prohibit the building of castles without his consent through the Consuetudines et Justicie, with his legal definition of castles centring on the classic motte-and-bailey features of ditching, banking and palisading.[54]\\r\\nBy the 11th century, castles were built throughout the Holy Roman Empire, which then spanned central Europe. They now typically took the form of an enclosure on a hilltop, or, on lower ground, a tall, free-standing tower (German Bergfried.)[55] The largest castles, known in German as Hohenburgen, had well-defined inner and outer courts, but no mottes.[56] The motte-and-bailey design began to spread into Alsace and the northern Alps from France during the first half of the 11th century, spreading further into Bohemia and Austria in the subsequent years.[57] This form of castle was closely associated with the colonisation of newly cultivated areas within the Empire, as new lords were granted lands by the emperor and built castles close to the local gr܇d, or town.[58] Motte-and-bailey castle building substantially enhanced the prestige of local nobles, and it has been suggested that their early adoption was because they were a cheaper way of imitating the still more prestigious hohenburgen, but this is usually regarded as unlikely.[59] In many cases, bergfrieds were converted into motte and bailey designs by burying existing castle towers within the mounds.[59]\\r\\nIn England, William invaded from Normandy in 1066, resulting in three phases of castle building in England, around 80% of which were in the motte-and-bailey pattern.[60] The first of these was the establishment by the new king of royal castles in key strategic locations, including many towns.[61] These urban castles could make use of the existing town's walls and fortification, but typically required the demolition of local houses to make space for them.[62] This could cause extensive damage: records suggest that in Lincoln 166 houses were destroyed, with 113 in Norwich and 27 in Cambridge.[63] The second and third waves of castle building in the late-11th century were led by the major magnates and then the more junior knights on their new estates.[64] Some regional patterns in castle building can be seen ÿ relatively few castles were built in East Anglia compared to the west of England or the Marches, for example; this was probably due to the relatively settled and prosperous nature of the east of England and reflected a shortage of unfree labour for constructing mottes.[65] In Wales, the first wave of the Norman castles were again predominantly made of wood in a mixture of motte-and-bailey and ringwork designs.[66] The Norman invaders spread up the valleys, using this form of castle to occupy their new territories.[67] After the Norman conquest of England and Wales, the building of motte-and-bailey castles in Normandy accelerated as well, resulting in a broad swath of these castles across the Norman territories, around 741 motte-and-bailey castles in England and Wales alone.[68]\\r\\nHaving become well established in Normandy, Germany and Britain, motte-and-bailey castles began to be adopted elsewhere, mainly in northern Europe, during the 12th and 13th centuries. Conflict through the Low Countries encouraged castle building in a number of regions from the late 12th century to the 14th century.[69] In Flanders, the first motte and bailey castles began relatively early at the end of the 11th century.[70] The rural motte-and-bailey castles followed the traditional design, but the urban castles often lacked the traditional baileys, using parts of the town to fulfil this role instead.[71] Motte-and-bailey castles in Flanders were particularly numerous in the south along the Lower Rhine, a fiercely contested border.[72] Further along the coast in Friesland, the relatively decentralised, egalitarian society initially discouraged the building of motte and bailey castles, although terpen, raised \\"dwelling mounds\\" which lacked towers and were usually lower in height than a typical motte, were created instead.[73] By the end of the medieval period, however, the terpen gave way to hege wieren, non-residential defensive towers, often on motte-like mounds, owned by the increasingly powerful nobles and landowners.[73] On Zeeland the local lords had a high degree of independence during the 12th and 13th centuries, owing to the wider conflict for power between neighbouring Flanders and Friesland.[74] The Zeeland lords had also built terpen mounds, but these gave way to larger werven constructionsÿeffectively mottesÿwhich were later termed bergen.[75] Sometimes both terpen and werven are called vliedburg, or \\"refuge castles\\".[76] During the 12th and 13th centuries a number of terpen mounds were turned into werven mottes, and some new werven mottes were built from scratch.[77] Around 323 known or probable motte and bailey castles of this design are believed to have built within the borders of the modern Netherlands.[11]\\r\\nIn neighbouring Denmark, motte-and-bailey castles appeared somewhat later in the 12th and 13th centuries and in more limited numbers than elsewhere, due to the less feudal society.[78] Except for a handful of mote and bailey castles in Norway, built in the first half of the 11th century and including the royal residence in Oslo, the design did not play a role further north in Scandinavia.[79]\\r\\nThe Norman expansion into Wales slowed in the 12th century but remained an ongoing threat to the remaining native rulers. In response, the Welsh princes and lords began to build their own castles, frequently motte-and-bailey designs, usually in wood.[80] There are indications that this may have begun from 1111 onwards under Prince Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, with the first documentary evidence of a native Welsh castle being at Cymmer in 1116.[81] These timber castles, including Tomen y Rhodywdd, Tomen y Faerdre, Gaer Penrh?s, were of equivalent quality to the equivalent Norman fortifications in the area, and it can prove difficult to distinguish the builders of some sites from the archaeological evidence alone.[82]\\r\\nMotte-and-bailey castles in Scotland emerged as a consequence of the centralising of royal authority in the 12th century.[83] David I encouraged Norman and French nobles to settle in Scotland, introducing a feudal mode of landholding and the use of castles as a way of controlling the contested lowlands.[84] The quasi-independent polity of Galloway, which had resisted the rule of David and his predecessors, was a particular focus for this colonisation.[85] The size of these Scottish castles, primarily wooden motte and bailey constructions, varied considerably, from larger designs such as the Bass of Inverurie to smaller castles like Balmaclellan.[86]\\r\\nMotte-and-bailey castles were introduced to Ireland following the Norman invasion of Ireland that began between 1166 and 1171 under first Richard de Clare and then Henry II of England, with the occupation of southern and eastern Ireland by a number of Anglo-Norman barons.[87] The rapid Norman success depended on key economic and military advantages; their cavalry enabled Norman successes in battles, and castles enabled them to control the newly conquered territories.[88] The new lords rapidly built castles to protect their possessions; most of these were motte-and-bailey constructions, many of them strongly defended.[89] Unlike Wales, the indigenous Irish lords do not appear to have constructed their own castles in any significant number during the period.[90][nb 2] Between 350 and 450 motte-and-bailey castles are believed to remain today, although the identification of these earthwork remains can be contentious.[92]\\r\\nA small number of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of northern Europe. In the late-12th century, the Normans invaded southern Italy and Sicily; although they had the technology to build more modern designs, in many cases wooden motte-and-bailey castles were built instead for reasons of speed.[93] The Italians came to refer to a range of different castle types as motta, however, and there may not have been as many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in southern Italy as was once thought on the basis of the documentary evidence alone.[94] In addition, there is evidence of the Norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in Egypt in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade.[95]\\r\\nMotte-and-bailey castles became a less popular design in the mid-medieval period. In France, they were not built after the start of the 12th century, and mottes ceased to be built in most of England after around 1170, although they continued to be erected in Wales and along the Marches.[96] Many motte-and-bailey castles were occupied relatively briefly; in England many had been abandoned or allowed to lapse into disrepair by the 12th century.[97] In the Low Countries and Germany, a similar transition occurred in the 13th and 14th centuries.\\r\\nOne factor was the introduction of stone into castle building. The earliest stone castles had emerged in the 10th century, with stone keeps being built on mottes along the Catalonia frontier and several, including Chateau de Langeais, in Angers.[98] Although wood was a more powerful defensive material than was once thought, stone became increasingly popular for military and symbolic reasons.[99] Some existing motte-and-bailey castles were converted to stone, with the keep and the gatehouse usually the first parts to be upgraded.[100] Shell keeps were built on many mottes, circular stone shells running around the top of the motte, sometime protected by a further chemise, or low protective wall, around the base. By the 14th century, a number of motte and bailey castles had been converted into powerful stone fortresses.[101]\\r\\nNewer castle designs placed less emphasis on mottes. Square Norman keeps built in stone became popular following the first such construction in Langeais in 994. Several were built in England and Wales after the conquest; by 1216 there were around 100 in the country.[102] These massive keeps could be either erected on top of settled, well established mottes, or could have mottes built around them ÿ so-called \\"buried\\" keeps.[103] The ability of mottes, especially newly built mottes, to support the heavier stone structures, was limited, and many needed to be built on fresh ground.[104] Concentric castles, relying on several lines of baileys and defensive walls, made increasingly little use of keeps or mottes at all.[105]\\r\\nAcross Europe, motte-and-bailey construction came to an end. At the end of the 12th century the Welsh rulers began to build castles in stone, primarily in the principality of North Wales and usually along the higher peaks where mottes were unnecessary.[81] In Flanders, decline came in the 13th century as feudal society changed.[70] In the Netherlands, cheap brick started to be used in castles from the 13th century onwards in place of earthworks, and many mottes were levelled, to help develop the surrounding, low-lying fields; these \\"levelled mottes\\" are a particularly Dutch phenomenon.[106] In Denmark, motte and baileys gave way in the 14th century to a castrum-curia model, where the castle was built with a fortified bailey and a fortified mound, somewhat smaller than the typical motte.[107] By the 12th century, the castles in Western Germany began to thin in number, due to changes in land ownership, and various mottes were abandoned.[108] In Germany and Denmark, motte-and-bailey castles also provided the model for the later wasserburg, or \\"water castle\\", a stronghold and bailey construction surrounded by water, and widely built in the late medieval period.[109]\\r\\nIn England, motte-and-bailey earthworks were put to various uses over later years; in some cases, mottes were turned into garden features in the 18th century, or reused as military defences during the Second World War.[110] Today, almost no mottes of motte-and-bailey castles remain in regular use in Europe, with one of the few exceptions being that at Windsor Castle, converted for the storage of royal documents.[111] The landscape of northern Europe remains scattered with their earthworks, and many form popular tourist attractions as part of the European heritage industry.","input":"Where was the first motte and bailey castle built?"},{"output":"Ramoji Rao","context":"The Ramoji Film City in India is located in Hyderabad.

Because JCPenney credit cards were accepted at Eckerd locations, CVS continues to accept them as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 23, 2006, CVS announced that it had agreed to acquire the freestanding drug store operations of supermarket chain Albertsons.[16] The deal included the acquisition of 700 drug stores trading under the Osco Drug and Sav-On Drugs banners, mostly in the midwestern and southwestern United States (with a concentration of stores in southern California and the Chicago area), and was formally completed on June 2, 2006.[17] Transition of Sav-On and Osco stores to the CVS brand was completed by December 2006. CVS now dominates the southern California market. Also included were Albertsons Health'n'Home (now CVS Home Health) durable medical equipment stores. Approximately 28 CVS Home Health locations are present in Arizona, California, and the Kansas City area, representing CVS's first venture into the specialized DME market.CVS had previously operated stores in southern California but completely withdrew from the market in 1993. CVS sold virtually all of the locations to Sav-On's then owner American Stores, who operated them under the name American Drug Stores. Many of the stores CVS gained in January 2006 had been the stores it owned prior to 1993. Before their re-acquisition, these stores were operated under the name Sav-On Express (the Express name was used to help customers identify these stores that did not carry all the lines of merchandise as compared to the larger, traditional Sav-On Drugs locations). CVS now operates over 6,200 stores in 43 states and the District of Columbia.[18] In some locations, CVS now has two stores less than two blocks apart.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 13, 2006, CVS announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Minneapolis-based MinuteClinic, the pioneer and largest provider of retail-based health clinics in the U.S. MinuteClinic operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Corporation. MinuteClinic health care centers are staffed by board-certified nurse practitioners and physician assistants who are trained to diagnose and treat common family illnesses such as throat, ear, eye, sinus, bladder, and bronchial infections, and provide prescriptions when clinically appropriate. MinuteClinic also offers common vaccinations, such as flu shots, tetanus, and Hepatitis A & B. The clinics are supported by physicians who collaborate with the staff. There are over 550 locations across the United States, most of which are within CVS Pharmacy locations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 1, 2006, CVS announced that it was entering into a purchase agreement with Nashville-based Caremark Rx Inc., a pharmacy benefits manager. The new company is called CVS Caremark Corporation and the corporate headquarters remains in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. The new pharmacy services business, including the combined pharmacy benefits management (PBM), specialty pharmacy, and disease management businesses, is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. The new CVS Caremark Corporation is expected to achieve about $75 billion in yearly revenue for 2007. The merger was formally completed on March 22, 2007.[19] Tom Ryan, CVS's Chairman and CEO, remains president and CEO of the combined company, while Caremark's President and CEO, Mac Crawford, is Chairman of the Board.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 7, 2007, Mac Crawford stepped down as Chairman of the Board for CVS Caremark. He was replaced by President and CEO of CVS Caremark, Tom Ryan.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 12, 2008, CVS/pharmacy announced that it would acquire Longs Drugs for $2.9 billion. Walgreens made a counteroffer but dropped it. The deal closed October 30, 2008.[21][22] Longs Drugs stores outside Hawaii were rebranded to CVS/pharmacy in September 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, CVS Caremark received 59 percent of Rhode Island's tax credits.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 14, 2014, it was announced that CVS Caremark would acquire the Miami-based Navarro Discount Pharmacies when the deal closes, the 33 stores will remain untouched and will stay under the Navarro name.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 3, 2014, CVS Caremark changed its name to CVS Health and announced that it would stop selling tobacco products.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 25, 2014, CVS Health disabled near field communication NFC payments barring customers the ability to use Apple Pay or Google Wallet payment methods.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 21, 2015, it was announced that CVS Health would acquire Omnicare, Inc. the leading provider of pharmacy services to long term care facilities, for $98.00 per share in cash, for a total enterprise value of approximately $12.7 billion, which includes approximately $2.3 billion in debt. The transaction is expected to close near the end of 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 15, 2015, CVS Health announced its agreement to acquire Target Corporation's pharmacy and retail clinic businesses. The deal expanded CVS to new markets in Seattle, Denver, Portland and Salt Lake City. The acquisition includes more than 1,660 pharmacies in 47 states.[27] CVS will operate them through a store-within-a-store format. Targets nearly 80 clinic locations will be rebranded as MinuteClinic, and CVS plans to open up to 20 new clinics in their stores within three years.[28] CVS started rebranding the pharmacies within the Target stores on February 3, 2016.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe domain CVS.com attracted at least 26 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com survey.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nCVS no longer owns the soma.com domain name, which it acquired with the purchase of online drugstore pioneer Soma; that domain now resides with the lingerie brand of the same name owned by clothing retailer Chico's.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2004 all CVS stores were able to receive electronic prescriptions.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, CVS Pharmancy launched a unique version of their CVS Pharmacy stores called CVS Pharmacy y ms specifically aimed at attracting Hispanic shoppers.[32] The first stores were launched in Florida and have since expanded to California and Texas.[33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005 CVS participated in a program to reduce the pollution of Maine's waterways. CVS agreed to accept drugs for disposal so that people would not dispose of them in ways that reach rivers and other bodies of waters.[35][36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 CVS agreed to pay Connecticut $800,000 due to alleged mismanagement of hazardous waste. The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection agency found that CVS had improperly identified, managed, and disposed of hazardous materials.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nCVS was required to pay the United States government $2.25 million in 2009 for violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that CVS did not appropriately dispose of sensitive patient information or provide the necessary training on disposal to their employees.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer CVS executives John R. Kramer and Carlos Ortiz were charged with bribery, conspiracy, and fraud (including mail fraud) by a federal grand jury for allegedly paying State Senator John A. Celona (D-RI) to act as a \\"consultant\\" for the company. Between February 2000 and September 2003, CVS paid Celona $1,000 a month, and he received tickets to golf outings and sporting events and compensation for travel to Florida and California. In August 2005, he pleaded guilty to mail fraud charges, and in January 2007, he was fined a record $130,000 by the Rhode Island Ethics Committee. The investigation was led by the FBI and the Rhode Island State Police, and the case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Gerard B. Sullivan and Dulce Donovan. Kramer and Ortiz were acquitted after a jury trial, in May 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 2005 a rash of prescription mistakes came to light in some of CVS Corporation's Boston-area stores. An investigation confirmed 62 errors or quality problems going back to 2002. In February 2006, the state Board of Pharmacy announced that the non-profit Institute of Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) would monitor all Massachusetts stores for the next two years.[40] Later, a 2007 segment on 20/20 accused CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid among other pharmacies, of making various prescription dispensing errors. This segment aired in March 2007 and was called \\"ABC News '20/20' Undercover Pharmacy Investigation.\\" CVS responded by claiming they have designed and invested millions of dollars in a comprehensive quality assurance program.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nTexas Attorney General Greg Abbott sued CVS in April 2007, for illegally dumping confidential patient information while closing an acquired Eckerd store in Liberty, Texas. CVS is accused of breaking the 2005 Identity Theft Enforcement and Protection Act. There are also other possible violations under Chapter 35 of the Business and Commerce Code.[42] CVS settled by paying $315,000 to the state and agreeing to overhaul its information security system.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn common with other US pharmacies, CVS originally stocked cigarettes for sale to the public. Some campaigners in the United States advocate the removal of tobacco from pharmacies due to the health risks associated with smoking and the apparent contradiction of selling cigarettes alongside smoking cessation products and asthma medication.[44] CVS and other pharmacies which continued to sell tobacco products have been subject to criticism, and attempts have been made to introduce regional bans on the practice, notably by the City and County of San Francisco.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007 CEO Thomas Ryan stated that the company was considering halting the sale of cigarettes within its pharmacies, acknowledging that the issue was problematic for the company, but had not done so, citing internal market research that discovered ceasing cigarette sales will not change consumer behavior (of buying cigarettes).[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2014 CVS announced that it would stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products at its stores, challenging other retailers to follow its lead. The decision meant the company would forfeit $1.5 billion a year in tobacco revenue. In a videotaped message, CEO Larry J. Merlo said ending tobacco sales \\"is the right thing to do\\".[48] On September 3, 2014, CVS officially stopped selling cigarettes in its stores. A Forbes magazine article cited the move to remove tobacco products coincides with CVS's decision to change its corporate name from CVS Caremark to CVS Health. This move reflects its broader health care commitment and desire to change the future health of Americans.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2008, CVS settled a large civil lawsuit for deceptive business practices. The Kaiser Family Foundation reported:[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nCVS Caremark has agreed to a $38.5 million settlement in a multi-state civil deceptive-practices lawsuit against pharmacy benefit manager Caremark filed by 28 attorneys general, the Chicago Tribune reports.[51] The attorneys general, led by Lisa Madigan (D) of Illinois and Douglas Ganslar (D) of Maryland, allege that Caremark \\"engaged in deceptive business practices\\" by informing physicians that patients or health plans could save money if patients were switched to certain brand-name prescription drugs (Miller, Chicago Tribune, 2/14).[51]\\r\\nHowever, the switch often saved patients and health plans only small amounts or increased their costs, while increasing Caremark's profits, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal (D) said (Levick, Hartford Courant, 2/15).[52] Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom Corbett (R) said the PBM kept discounts and rebates that should have been passed on to employers and patients (Levy, AP/San Francisco Chronicle, 2/14).[53] In addition, Caremark did not \\"adequately inform doctors\\" of the full financial effect of the switch and did not disclose that the switch would increase Caremark's profits, the lawsuit alleges (Chicago Tribune, 2/14).[51]\\r\\n...The settlement prohibits Caremark from requesting prescription drug switches in certain cases, such as when the cost to the patient would be higher with the new prescription drug; when the original prescription drug's patent will expire within six months; and when patients were switched from a similar prescription drug within the previous two years (Hartford Courant, 2/15).[52] Patients also have the ability to decline a switch from the prescribed treatment to the prescription offered by the pharmacy under the settlement, Madigan said (Bloomberg News/Philadelphia Inquirer, 2/15).[54]\\r\\nOn October 14, 2010, CVS was ordered to pay $77.6 million in fines and returned profits stemming from a lawsuit alleging improper control in the sale of pseudoephedrine, an ingredient used to make methamphetamine.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011 the DOJ charged that CVS pharmacies in Sanford, Fla., ordered enough painkillers to supply a population eight times its size.[56] Sanford has a population of 53,000 but the supply would support 400,000.[57] According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, in 2010 a single CVS pharmacy in Sanford ordered 1.8 million Oxycodone pills, an average of 137,994 pills a month. Other pharmacy customers in Florida averaged 5,364 oxycodone pills a month. DEA investigators serving a warrant to a CVS pharmacy in Sanford on October 18, 2011, noted that \\"approximately every third car that came through the drive-thru lane had prescriptions for oxycodone or hydrocodone.\\" According to the DEA, a pharmacist at that location stated to investigators that \\"her customers often requested certain brands of oxycodone using street slang,\\" an indicator that the drugs were being diverted and not used for legitimate pain management. In response, CVS in a statement issued Feb 17 in response to opioid trafficking questions from USATODAY said the company is committed to working with the DEA and had taken \\"significant actions to ensure appropriate dispensing of painkillers in Florida.\\"[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 a Korean customer, Hyun Lee, was identified as \\"Ching Chong Lee\\" on her receipt from a CVS in New Jersey. Lee contacted CVS and received an email response saying that the employee would be \\"counseled and trained.\\" According to Lee's attorney, \\"[The employee] should have been terminated immediately. She never got an apology. She never got anything further after she complained.\\" On April 16, 2013, Lee filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against CVS and sought $1 million.[59] She settled for an undisclosed sum.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 CVS introduced a program that rewarded customers up to $50 per year in ExtraCare Bucks in exchange for filling their prescriptions. In order to enroll in the program, customers had to sign a HIPAA waiver acknowledging, \\"my health information may potentially be re-disclosed and thus is no longer protected by the federal Privacy Rule.\\" Stores had to fulfill a quota of a number of customers in the program each week. Walgreens and Rite Aid also offer rewards for filling prescriptions, although they do not require a signed HIPAA waiver.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 1, 2011, the James Randi Educational Foundation awarded CVS Pharmacy the tongue-in-cheek Pigasus Award for selling homeopathic remedies alongside medicines recognized by science.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July of 2018 the Center for Inquiry filed a lawsuit against CVS for consumer fraud over its sale of homeopathic medicines. According to Nicholas Little, CFIs Vice President and General Counsel: Homeopathy is a total sham, and CVS knows it. Yet the company persists in deceiving its customers about the effectiveness of homeopathic products. Homeopathics are shelved right alongside scientifically-proven medicines, under the same signs for cold and flu, pain relief, sleep aids, and so on. If you search for flu treatment on their website, it even suggests homeopathics to you, CVS is making no distinction between those products that have been vetted and tested by science, and those that are nothing but snake oil. The filing in part contends that apart from being a waste of money, choosing homeopathic treatments to the exclusion of evidence-based medicines can result in worsened or prolonged symptoms, and in some cases, even death.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 25, 2014, CVS disabled NFC (near field communication) payments from the newly initiated Apple Pay mobile payment system.[63]  Apple Pay was officially launched on October 21, 2014, and functioned for the first few days after its launch, allowing CVS customers to make purchases securely using their iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.  This followed the pharmacy chain Rite Aid to stop accepting payments via Apple Pay two days prior.  On July 31, 2018, Tim Cook announced during Apple's earnings call that CVS would re-enable Apple Pay on its system later in the year.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 17, 2015, CVS shut down its online photo processing services,[65] blaming a third party vendor, believed to be PNI Digital Media.  According to reporters, CVS was unwilling to confirm or deny questions about whether hackers had stolen customer photographs as well as data.[66]  The site was updated on September 11, 2015, with more details of the attack. By the end of November 2015, the CVS photo website was restored, and customers may order photo services online again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2018, a transgender woman in Arizona attempted to fill prescriptions for hormone therapy at the CVS in Fountain Hills, Arizona.[67] The pharmacist refused to fill the prescriptions, instead subjecting the woman to loud and humiliating questioning in front of other customers and pharmacy staff. The pharmacist also refused to return her prescriptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes","input":"What does c v s pharmacy stand for?"},{"output":"4 October 1957","context":"Space exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of continuously evolving and growing space technology. While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight.\\r\\nWhile the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.[1]\\r\\nSpace exploration has often been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the Cold War. The early era of space exploration was driven by a \\"Space Race\\" between the Soviet Union and the United States. The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet Space Program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Aleksei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971.[2]\\r\\nAfter the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS).\\r\\nWith the substantial completion of the ISS[3] following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the US remain in flux. Constellation, a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020[4] was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009.[5] The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020, transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector, and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO, such as EarthÿMoon L1, the Moon, EarthÿSun L2, near-Earth asteroids, and Phobos or Mars orbit.[6]\\r\\nIn the 2000s, the People's Republic of China initiated a successful manned spaceflight program, while the European Union, Japan, and India have also planned future manned space missions. China, Russia, Japan, and India have advocated manned missions to the Moon during the 21st century, while the European Union has advocated manned missions to both the Moon and Mars during the 20th/21st century.\\r\\nFrom the 1990s onwards, private interests began promoting space tourism and then public space exploration of the Moon (see Google Lunar X Prize).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest known projectiles prior to the rockets of the 1940s were the shells of the Paris Gun, a type of German long-range siege gun, which reached at least 40 kilometers altitude during World War One.[7] Steps towards putting a human-made object into space were taken by German scientists during World War II while testing the V-2 rocket, which became the first human-made object in space on 3 October 1942 with the launching of the A-4. After the war, the U.S. used German scientists and their captured rockets in programs for both military and civilian research. The first scientific exploration from space was the cosmic radiation experiment launched by the U.S. on a V-2 rocket on 10 May 1946.[8] The first images of Earth taken from space followed the same year[9][10] while the first animal experiment saw fruit flies lifted into space in 1947, both also on modified V-2s launched by Americans. Starting in 1947, the Soviets, also with the help of German teams, launched sub-orbital V-2 rockets and their own variant, the R-1, including radiation and animal experiments on some flights. These suborbital experiments only allowed a very short time in space which limited their usefulness.\\r\\nThe first successful orbital launch was of the Soviet unmanned Sputnik 1 (\\"Satellite 1\\") mission on 4 October 1957. The satellite weighed about 83?kg (183?lb), and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about 250?km (160?mi). It had two radio transmitters (20 and 40?MHz), which emitted \\"beeps\\" that could be heard by radios around the globe. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data was encoded in the duration of radio beeps. The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a meteoroid. Sputnik 1 was launched by an R-7 rocket. It burned up upon re-entry on 3 January 1958.\\r\\nThe second one was Sputnik 2. Launched by the USSR on November 3, 1957, it carried the dog Laika, who became the first animal in orbit.\\r\\nThis success led to an escalation of the American space program, which unsuccessfully attempted to launch a Vanguard satellite into orbit two months later. On 31 January 1958, the U.S. successfully orbited Explorer 1 on a Juno rocket.\\r\\nThe first successful human spaceflight was Vostok 1 (\\"East 1\\"), carrying 27-year-old Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961. The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin's flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advanced Soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration: human spaceflight.\\r\\nThe U.S. first launched a person into space within a month of Vostok 1 with Alan Shepard's suborbital flight in Mercury-Redstone 3. Orbital flight was achieved by the United States when John Glenn's Mercury-Atlas 6 orbited Earth on 20 February 1962.\\r\\nValentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space, orbited Earth 48 times aboard Vostok 6 on 16 June 1963.\\r\\nChina first launched a person into space 42 years after the launch of Vostok 1, on 15 October 2003, with the flight of Yang Liwei aboard the Shenzhou 5 (Spaceboat 5) spacecraft.\\r\\nThe first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 in 1959.[11] The first automatic landing on another celestial body was performed by Luna 9[12] in 1966. Luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the Moon.[13]\\r\\nThe first manned landing on another celestial body was performed by Apollo 11 on 20 July 1969.\\r\\nThe first successful interplanetary flyby was the 1962 Mariner 2 flyby of Venus (closest approach 34,773 kilometers). The other planets were first flown by in 1965 for Mars by Mariner 4, 1973 for Jupiter by Pioneer 10, 1974 for Mercury by Mariner 10, 1979 for Saturn by Pioneer 11, 1986 for Uranus by Voyager 2, 1989 for Neptune by Voyager 2. In 2015, the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto were orbited by Dawn and passed by New Horizons, respectively.\\r\\nThe first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of Venera 7 on Venus which returned data to Earth for 23 minutes. In 1975 the Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet. In 1971 the Mars 3 mission achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds. Later much longer duration surface missions were achieved, including over six years of Mars surface operation by Viking 1 from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus by Venera 13 in 1982, the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission.\\r\\nThe dream of stepping into the outer reaches of Earth's atmosphere was driven by the fiction of Peter Francis Geraci[14][15][16] and H.G.Wells,[17] and rocket technology was developed to try to realize this vision. The German V-2 was the first rocket to travel into space, overcoming the problems of thrust and material failure. During the final days of World War II this technology was obtained by both the Americans and Soviets as were its designers. The initial driving force for further development of the technology was a weapons race for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) to be used as long-range carriers for fast nuclear weapon delivery, but in 1961 when the Soviet Union launched the first man into space, the United States declared itself to be in a \\"Space Race\\" with the Soviets.\\r\\nKonstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert Goddard, Hermann Oberth, and Reinhold Tiling laid the groundwork of rocketry in the early years of the 20th century.\\r\\nWernher von Braun was the lead rocket engineer for Nazi Germany's World War II V-2 rocket project. In the last days of the war he led a caravan of workers in the German rocket program to the American lines, where they surrendered and were brought to the USA to work on U.S. rocket development (\\"Operation Paperclip\\"). He acquired American citizenship and led the team that developed and launched Explorer 1, the first American satellite. Von Braun later led the team at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center which developed the Saturn V moon rocket.\\r\\nInitially the race for space was often led by Sergei Korolyov, whose legacy includes both the R7 and Soyuzwhich remain in service to this day. Korolev was the mastermind behind the first satellite, first man (and first woman) in orbit and first spacewalk. Until his death his identity was a closely guarded state secret; not even his mother knew that he was responsible for creating the Soviet space program.\\r\\nKerim Kerimov was one of the founders of the Soviet space program and was one of the lead architects behind the first human spaceflight (Vostok 1) alongside Sergey Korolyov. After Korolyov's death in 1966, Kerimov became the lead scientist of the Soviet space program and was responsible for the launch of the first space stations from 1971 to 1991, including the Salyut and Mir series, and their precursors in 1967, the Cosmos 186 and Cosmos 188.[18][19]\\r\\nAlthough the Sun will probably not be physically explored at all, the study of the Sun has nevertheless been a major focus of space exploration. Being above the atmosphere in particular and Earth's magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earth's surface. The Sun generates most space weather, which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with, and even damage, satellites and space probes. Numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun, beginning with the Apollo Telescope Mount, have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective. Parker Solar Probe, planned for a 2018 launch, will approach the Sun to within 1/8th the orbit of Mercury.\\r\\nMercury remains the least explored of the inner planets. As of May 2013, the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of Mercury. MESSENGER entered orbit around Mercury in March 2011, to further investigate the observations made by Mariner 10 in 1975 (Munsell, 2006b).\\r\\nA third mission to Mercury, scheduled to arrive in 2020, BepiColombo is to include two probes. BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and the European Space Agency. MESSENGER and BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 10's flybys.\\r\\nFlights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or delta-v. Due to the relatively high delta-v to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable.\\r\\nVenus was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and, despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System, has had more landers sent to it (nearly all from the Soviet Union) than any other planet in the Solar System. The first successful Venus flyby was the American Mariner 2 spacecraft, which flew past Venus in 1962. Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies. In 1967 Venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970, Venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data. Starting in 1975 with the Soviet orbiter Venera 9 some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere.\\r\\nSpace exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object in its own right. Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely ground-based point of reference.\\r\\nFor example, the existence of the Van Allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the United States' first artificial satellite, Explorer 1. These belts contain radiation trapped by Earth's magnetic fields, which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000?km impractical. Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a space based perspective. These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth-based phenomena. For instance, the hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earth's atmosphere, and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify.\\r\\nThe Moon was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration. It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by, orbited, and landed upon by spacecraft, and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans.\\r\\nIn 1959 the Soviets obtained the first images of the far side of the Moon, never previously visible to humans. The U.S. exploration of the Moon began with the Ranger 4 impactor in 1962. Starting in 1966 the Soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon's surface; just four months later, Surveyor 1 marked the debut of a successful series of U.S. landers. The Soviet unmanned missions culminated in the Lunokhod program in the early 1970s, which included the first unmanned rovers and also successfully brought lunar soil samples to Earth for study. This marked the first (and to date the only) automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth. Unmanned exploration of the Moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters, and in 2008 the Indian Moon Impact Probe.\\r\\nManned exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with the Apollo 8 mission that successfully orbited the Moon, the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans. In 1969, the Apollo 11 mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world. Manned exploration of the Moon did not continue for long, however. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the most recent human visit there, and the next, Exploration Mission 2, is due to orbit the Moon in 2021. Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously.\\r\\nThe exploration of Mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United States, Europe, Japan and India. Dozens of robotic spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers, have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the red planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth.\\r\\nThe exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak of The Great Galactic Ghoul[21] which subsists on a diet of Mars probes. This phenomenon is also informally known as the \\"Mars Curse\\".[22] In contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of Mars, India has become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt. India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM)[23][24][25] is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of ?450 Crore (US$73 million).[26][27] The first mission to Mars by any Arab country has been taken up by the United Arab Emirates. Called the Emirates Mars Mission, it is scheduled for launch in 2020. The unmanned exploratory probe has been named \\"Hope Probe\\" and will be sent to Mars to study its atmosphere in detail.[28]\\r\\nThe Russian space mission Fobos-Grunt, which launched on 9 November 2011 experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low Earth orbit.[29] It was to begin exploration of the Phobos and Martian circumterrestrial orbit, and study whether the moons of Mars, or at least Phobos, could be a \\"trans-shipment point\\" for spaceships traveling to Mars.[30]\\r\\nThe exploration of Jupiter has consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973. A large majority of the missions have been \\"flybys\\", in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit; such as in Pioneer and Voyager programs. The Galileo and Juno spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planet's orbit. As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface, a landing mission is nearly impossible.\\r\\nReaching Jupiter from Earth requires a delta-v of 9.2?km/s,[31] which is comparable to the 9.7?km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit.[32] Fortunately, gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration.[31]\\r\\nJupiter has 67 known moons, many of which have relatively little known information about them.\\r\\nSaturn has been explored only through unmanned spacecraft launched by NASA, including one mission (CassiniÿHuygens) planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies. These missions consist of flybys in 1979 by Pioneer 11, in 1980 by Voyager 1, in 1982 by Voyager 2 and an orbital mission by the Cassini spacecraft, which lasted from 2004 until 2017.\\r\\nSaturn has at least 62 known moons, although the exact number is debatable since Saturn's rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes. The largest of the moons is Titan, which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of Earth. Titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the Outer Solar System that has been explored with a lander, the Huygens probe deployed by the Cassini spacecraft.\\r\\nThe exploration of Uranus has been entirely through the Voyager 2 spacecraft, with no other visits currently planned. Given its axial tilt of 97.77, with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods, scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus. The closest approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986. Voyager 2 studied the planet's unique atmosphere and magnetosphere. Voyager 2 also examined its ring system and the moons of Uranus including all five of the previously known moons, while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons.\\r\\nImages of Uranus proved to have a very uniform appearance, with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn. Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet. The magnetosphere of Uranus, however, proved to be completely unique and proved to be profoundly affected by the planet's unusual axial tilt. In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself, striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus, including evidence that Miranda had been unusually geologically active.\\r\\nThe exploration of Neptune began with the 25 August 1989 Voyager 2 flyby, the sole visit to the system as of 2014. The possibility of a Neptune Orbiter has been discussed, but no other missions have been given serious thought.\\r\\nAlthough the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus during Voyager 2's visit in 1986 had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena, the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding, visible clouds, auroras, and even a conspicuous anticyclone storm system rivaled in size only by Jupiter's small Spot. Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System, measured as high as 2,100?km/h.[33] Voyager 2 also examined Neptune's ring and moon system. It discovered 900 complete rings and additional partial ring \\"arcs\\" around Neptune. In addition to examining Neptune's three previously known moons, Voyager 2 also discovered five previously unknown moons, one of which, Proteus, proved to be the last largest moon in the system. Data from Voyager 2 supported the view that Neptune's largest moon, Triton, is a captured Kuiper belt object.[34]\\r\\nThe dwarf planet Pluto presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its great distance from Earth (requiring high velocity for reasonable trip times) and small mass (making capture into orbit very difficult at present). Voyager 1 could have visited Pluto, but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturn's moon Titan, resulting in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby. Voyager 2 never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto.[35]\\r\\nPluto continues to be of great interest, despite its reclassification as the lead and nearest member of a new and growing class of distant icy bodies of intermediate size (and also the first member of the important subclass, defined by orbit and known as \\"plutinos\\"). After an intense political battle, a mission to Pluto dubbed New Horizons was granted funding from the United States government in 2003.[36] New Horizons was launched successfully on 19 January 2006. In early 2007 the craft made use of a gravity assist from Jupiter. Its closest approach to Pluto was on 14 July 2015; scientific observations of Pluto began five months prior to closest approach and continued for 16 days after the encounter.\\r\\nUntil the advent of space travel, objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes, their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery. Several asteroids have now been visited by probes, the first of which was Galileo, which flew past two: 951 Gaspra in 1991, followed by 243 Ida in 1993. Both of these lay near enough to Galileo's planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost. The first landing on an asteroid was performed by the NEAR Shoemaker probe in 2000, following an orbital survey of the object. The dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid 4 Vesta, two of the three largest asteroids, were visited by NASA's Dawn spacecraft, launched in 2007.\\r\\nAlthough many comets have been studied from Earth sometimes with centuries-worth of observations, only a few comets have been closely visited. In 1985, the International Cometary Explorer conducted the first comet fly-by (21P/Giacobini-Zinner) before joining the Halley Armada studying the famous comet. The Deep Impact probe smashed into 9P/Tempel to learn more about its structure and composition and the Stardust mission returned samples of another comet's tail. The Philae lander successfully landed on Comet ChuryumovÿGerasimenko in 2014 as part of the broader Rosetta mission.\\r\\nHayabusa was an unmanned spacecraft developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to return a sample of material from the small near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa to Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005. After arriving at Itokawa, Hayabusa studied the asteroid's shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid to collect samples. The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010.\\r\\nDeep space exploration is the branch of astronomy, astronautics and space technology that is involved with the exploration of distant regions of outer space.[37] Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights (deep-space astronautics) and by robotic spacecraft.\\r\\nSome of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies include anti-matter, nuclear power and beamed propulsion.[38] The latter, beamed propulsion, appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available, since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes.[39]\\r\\nIn the 2000s, several plans for space exploration were announced; both government entities and the private sector have space exploration objectives. China has announced plans to have a 60-ton multi-module space station in orbit by 2020.\\r\\nThe NASA Authorization Act of 2010 provided a re-prioritized list of objectives for the American space program, as well as funding for the first priorities. NASA proposes to move forward with the development of the Space Launch System (SLS), which will be designed to carry the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, as well as important cargo, equipment, and science experiments to Earth's orbit and destinations beyond. Additionally, the SLS will serve as a back up for commercial and international partner transportation services to the International Space Station. The SLS rocket will incorporate technological investments from the Space Shuttle program and the Constellation program in order to take advantage of proven hardware and reduce development and operations costs. The first developmental flight is targeted for the end of 2017.[40]\\r\\nThe idea of using high level automated systems for space missions has become a desirable goal to space agencies all around the world. Such systems are believed to yield benefits such as lower cost, less human oversight, and ability to explore deeper in space which is usually restricted by long communications with human controllers.[41]\\r\\nAutonomy is defined by three requirements:[41]\\r\\nAutonomous technologies would be able to perform beyond predetermined actions. They would analyze all possible states and events happening around them and come up with a safe response. In addition, such technologies can reduce launch cost and ground involvement. Performance would increase as well. Autonomy would be able to quickly respond upon encountering an unforeseen event, especially in deep space exploration where communication back to Earth would take too long.[41]\\r\\nNASA began its autonomous science experiment (ASE) on Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) which is NASA's first satellite in the new millennium program Earth-observing series launched on 21 November 2000. The autonomy of ASE is capable of on-board science analysis, replanning, robust execution, and later the addition of model-based diagnostic. Images obtained by the EO-1 are analyzed on-board and downlinked when a change or an interesting event occur. The ASE software has successfully provided over 10,000 science images.[41]\\r\\nAn article in science magazine Nature suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the ultimate destination being Mars.[42] In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: first, \\"a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit\\"; second, \\"extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars\\"; and finally, \\"developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin.\\"[42] Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission crews being able to land on them in times of greater risk to radiation exposure.[43]\\r\\nThe research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies, such as NASA and Roscosmos, is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses. Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits (such as NASA spin-offs), generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program.[44] It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction of resources on other planets and especially asteroids, which contain billions of dollars worth of minerals and metals. Such expeditions could generate a lot of revenue.[45] As well, it has been argued that space exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering.[46]\\r\\nAnother claim is that space exploration is a necessity to mankind and that staying on Earth will lead to extinction. Some of the reasons are lack of natural resources, comets, nuclear war, and worldwide epidemic. Stephen Hawking, renowned British theoretical physicist, said that \\"I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.\\"[47]\\r\\nNASA has produced a series of public service announcement videos supporting the concept of space exploration.[48]\\r\\nOverall, the public remains largely supportive of both manned and unmanned space exploration. According to an Associated Press Poll conducted in July 2003, 71% of U.S. citizens agreed with the statement that the space program is \\"a good investment\\", compared to 21% who did not.[49]\\r\\nArthur C. Clarke (1950) presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration of space in his non-fiction semi-technical monograph Interplanetary Flight.[50] He argued that humanity's choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space, versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation and death.\\r\\nSpaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space.\\r\\nSpaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites.\\r\\nA spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraftboth when unpropelled and when under propulsionis covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.\\r\\nSatellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military (spy) and civilian Earth observation satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites.\\r\\nCurrent examples of the commercial use of space include satellite navigation systems, satellite television and satellite radio. Space tourism is the recent phenomenon of space travel by individuals for the purpose of personal pleasure.\\r\\nAstrobiology is the interdisciplinary study of life in the universe, combining aspects of astronomy, biology and geology.[51] It is focused primarily on the study of the origin, distribution and evolution of life. It is also known as exobiology (from Greek: ?, exo, \\"outside\\").[52][53][54] The term \\"Xenobiology\\" has been used as well, but this is technically incorrect because its terminology means \\"biology of the foreigners\\".[55] Astrobiologists must also consider the possibility of life that is chemically entirely distinct from any life found on Earth.[56] In the Solar System some of the prime locations for current or past astrobiology are on Enceladus, Europa, Mars, and Titan.[57]\\r\\nSpace colonization, also called space settlement and space humanization, would be the permanent autonomous (self-sufficient) human habitation of locations outside Earth, especially of natural satellites or planets such as the Moon or Mars, using significant amounts of in-situ resource utilization.\\r\\nTo date, the longest human occupation of space is the International Space Station which has been in continuous use for 7003618700000000000?16?years, 343?days. Valeri Polyakov's record single spaceflight of almost 438 days aboard the Mir space station has not been surpassed. Long-term stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity, immune system suppression, and radiation exposure.\\r\\nMany past and current concepts for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return to the Moon as a \\"stepping stone\\" to the other planets, especially Mars. At the end of 2006 NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent Moon base with continual presence by 2024.[58]\\r\\nBeyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack of private property, the inability or difficulty in establishing property rights in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation. Since the advent of space technology in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making of national territorial claims in outer space and on celestial bodies has been specifically proscribed by the Outer Space Treaty, which had been, as of 2012[update], ratified by all spacefaring nations.[59]\\r\\nSolar System?L Local Interstellar Cloud?L Local Bubble?L Gould Belt?L Orion Arm?L Milky Way?L Milky Way subgroup?L Local Group?L Virgo Supercluster?L Laniakea Supercluster?L PiscesÿCetus Supercluster Complex?L Observable universe?L Universe\\r\\nEach arrow (L) may be read as \\"within\\" or \\"part of\\".","input":"When was the first thing sent into space?"},{"output":"a political and ideological debate over the legality of slavery in the proposed state of Kansas","context":"Bleeding Kansas, Bloody Kansas or the Border War was a series of violent civil confrontations in the United States between 1854 and 1861 which emerged from a political and ideological debate over the legality of slavery in the proposed state of Kansas. The conflict was characterized by years of electoral fraud, raids, assaults, and retributive murders carried out by pro-slavery \\"Border Ruffians\\" and anti-slavery \\"Free-Staters\\" in Kansas and neighboring Missouri.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the heart of the conflict was the question of whether the Kansas Territory would allow or outlaw slavery, and thus enter the Union as a slave state or a free state. The KansasÿNebraska Act of 1854 called for \\"popular sovereignty\\", requiring that the decision about slavery be made by the territory's settlers (rather than outsiders) and decided by a popular vote. Ongoing sectional tensions surrounding slavery quickly found focus in Kansas, with the pro-slavery element arguing that every settler had the right to bring his own property, including slaves, into the territory; anti-slavery \\"free soil\\" proponents argued not only that slavery was unethical, but that permitting slavery in Kansas would allow rich slaveholders to control the land to the exclusion of non-slaveholders. Missouri, a slave state since 1821, was populated by a large number of settlers with Southern sympathies and pro-slavery attitudes, many of whom tried to influence the decision in Kansas. The conflict was fought politically as well as between civilians, where it eventually degenerated into brutal gang violence and paramilitary guerrilla warfare. The term \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" was popularized by Horace Greeley's New York Tribune.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nBleeding Kansas was demonstrative of the gravity of the era's most pressing social issues, from the matter of slavery to the class conflicts emerging on the American frontier. Its severity made national headlines which suggested to the American people that the sectional disputes were unlikely to reach compromise without bloodshed, and it therefore directly presaged the American Civil War.[2] Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state in January 1861, but partisan violence continued along the KansasÿMissouri border for most of the war. The episode is commemorated with numerous memorials and designated historic sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs abolitionism became increasingly popular in the United States and tensions between its supporters and detractors grew, the U.S. Congress maintained a tenuous balance of political power between Northern and Southern representatives. In May 1854, the KansasÿNebraska Act created from unorganized Indian lands the new territories of Kansas and Nebraska for settlement by U.S. citizens. Though the Missouri Compromise of 1820 had explicitly forbidden the practice of slavery in all U.S. territory north of 3630' latitude and west of the Mississippi River, except the state of Missouri, the 1854 act directly contradicted this agreement by permitting settlers of Kansas and Nebraska to determine their state's slavery status by popular vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately, immigrants supporting both sides of the slavery question arrived in the Kansas Territory to establish residency and gain the right to vote. Among the first settlers of Kansas were citizens of slave states, especially Missouri, many of whom strongly supported Southern ideologies and emigrated specifically to secure the expansion of slavery. Pro-slavery immigrants settled towns including Leavenworth and Atchison. The administration of President Franklin Pierce appointed territorial officials in Kansas aligned with its own pro-slavery views and, heeding rumors that the frontier was being overwhelmed by Northerners, thousands of non-resident slavery proponents soon entered Kansas with the goal of influencing local politics. Pro-slavery factions thereby captured many early territorial elections, often by fraud and intimidation. In November 1854, thousands of armed pro-slavery men known as \\"Border Ruffians\\" or \\"Southern Yankees\\", mostly from Missouri, poured into the Kansas Territory and swayed the vote in the election for a non-voting delegate to Congress in favor of pro-slavery Democratic candidate John Wilkins Whitfield.[3] The following year, a congressional committee investigating the election reported that 1,729 fraudulent votes were cast compared to 1,114 legal votes. In one location, only 20 of the 604 voters were residents of the Kansas Territory; in another, 35 were residents and 226 non-residents.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, Northern abolitionists encouraged their own supporters to move to Kansas in the effort to secure the territory as a free state, flooding Kansas with so-called \\"free-soilers\\" or \\"Free-Staters\\". Many citizens of Northern states arrived with assistance from benevolent societies such as the Boston-based New England Emigrant Aid Company, which was founded shortly before passage of the KansasÿNebraska Act with the specific intention of transporting anti-slavery immigrants to the frontier. To help countermand the voting fraud, around 1,200 New England Yankees emigrated to the Kansas Territory by the summer of 1855.[5] The abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher armed many of them with Sharps rifles, which allegedly became known as \\"Beecher's Bibles\\" for their shipment in wooden crates so labeled. Efforts like these were directly responsible for the establishment of towns which later became strongholds of Republican and abolitionist sentiment, including Lawrence, Topeka and Manhattan.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 30, 1855, Kansas Territory held the election for its first territorial legislature.[3] Crucially, this legislature would decide whether the territory would allow slavery.[6] Just as had happened in the election of November 1854, \\"Border Ruffians\\" from Missouri again streamed into the territory to vote, and pro-slavery delegates were elected to 37 of the 39 seats ÿ Martin F. Conway and Samuel D. Houston from Riley County were the only Free-Staters elected.[6] Due to questions about electoral fraud, Territorial Governor Andrew Reeder invalidated the results in five voting districts, and a special election was held on May 22 to elect replacements.[6] Eight of the eleven delegates elected in the special election were Free-Staters, but this still left the pro-slavery camp with an overwhelming 29ÿ10 advantage.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the disputed votes and rising tension, Congress sent a special committee to the Kansas Territory in 1856.[6] The committee report concluded that if the election of March 30, 1855 had been limited to \\"actual settlers\\" it would have elected a Free-State legislature.[6][7] The report also stated that the legislature actually seated \\"was an illegally constituted body, and had no power to pass valid laws\\".[6][7] Nevertheless, the pro-slavery legislature convened in the newly created territorial capital in Pawnee on July 2, 1855. The legislature immediately invalidated the results from the special election in May and seated the pro-slavery delegates elected in March. After only one week in Pawnee, the legislature moved the territorial capital to the Shawnee Mission on the Missouri border, where it reconvened and began passing laws favorable to slaveholders.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August, anti-slavery residents met to formally reject the pro-slavery laws passed by the so-called \\"bogus\\" legislature. They quickly elected their own Free-State delegates to a separate legislature based in Topeka, which stood in opposition to the pro-slavery government operating in Lecompton, and drafted the first territorial constitution, the Topeka Constitution. In a message to Congress on January 24, 1856, President Franklin Pierce declared the Free-State Topeka government insurrectionist in its stand against pro-slavery territorial officials.[8] The presence of dual governments was symbolic of the strife brewing in the territory and further provoked supporters of both sides of the conflict.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the early confrontation of the Bleeding Kansas era centered on the adoption of a constitution that would govern the state of Kansas. The first of four such documents was the Topeka Constitution, written by anti-slavery forces unified under the Free-State Party in December 1855. This constitution was the basis for the Free-State territorial government that resisted the illegitimate but federally authorized government which had been previously elected by non-resident Missourians.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1857, a second constitutional convention met in Lecompton and by early November had drafted the Lecompton Constitution, a pro-slavery document endorsed by President James Buchanan. The constitution was submitted to Kansans for a vote on a special slavery article, but Free-Staters refused to participate, knowing that the constitution would allow Kansas slaveholders to keep existing slaves even if the article in question was voted against. The Lecompton Constitution, including the slavery article, was approved by a vote of 6,226 to 569 on December 21. Congress instead ordered another election because of voting irregularities uncovered. On August 2, 1858, Kansas voters rejected the document by 11,812 to 1,926.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Lecompton Constitution was pending before Congress, a third document, the Leavenworth Constitution, was written and passed by Free-State delegates. It was more radical than other Free-State proposals in that it would have extended suffrage to \\"every male citizen\\", regardless of race. Participation in this ballot on May 18, 1858, was a fraction of the previous and there was some opposition by Free-State Democrats. The proposed constitution was forwarded to the U.S. Senate on January 6, 1859, where it was met with a tepid reception and left to die in committee.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third and final Free-State proposal was the Wyandotte Constitution, drafted in 1859, which represented the anti-slavery view of the future of Kansas. It was approved in a referendum by a vote of 10,421 to 5,530 on October 4, 1859.[14] With southern states still in control of the Senate, Kansas awaited admission to the Union until January 29, 1861.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1855, outspoken abolitionist John Brown arrived in the Kansas Territory to fight slavery. On November 21, the so-called Wakarusa War began when a Free-Stater named Charles Dow was shot by a pro-slavery settler. The resulting conflict had one fatality, when Free-Stater Thomas Barber was shot and killed near Lawrence on December 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 21, 1856, Missourians invaded Lawrence and burned the Free State Hotel, destroyed two newspaper offices, and ransacked homes and stores.[citation needed] A cannon used during the MexicanÿAmerican War, called the Old Kickapoo or Kickapoo Cannon, was stolen and used on that day by a pro-slavery group of people, including the Kickapoo Rangers of the Kansas Territorial Militia.[15] It was later recovered by an anti-slavery faction and returned to the city of Leavenworth.[15][16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1856, Republican Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts took to the floor to denounce the threat of slavery in Kansas and humiliate its supporters.  He had devoted his enormous energies to the destruction of what Republicans called the Slave Power, that is the efforts of slave owners to take control of the federal government and ensure the survival and expansion of slavery. In the speech (called \\"The Crime against Kansas\\") Sumner ridiculed the honor of elderly South Carolina Senator Andrew Butler, portraying Butler's pro-slavery agenda towards Kansas with the raping of a virgin and characterizing his affection for it in sexual and revolting terms.[18] The next day, Butler's cousin, the South Carolina Congressman Preston Brooks, nearly killed Sumner on the Senate floor with a heavy cane. The action electrified the nation, brought violence to the floor of the Senate, and deepened the North-South split.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe violence continued to increase. John Brown led his sons and other followers to plan the murder of settlers who spoke in favor of slavery. At a proslavery settlement at Pottawatomie Creek on the night of May 24, the group seized five pro-slavery men from their homes and hacked them to death with broadswords. Brown and his men escaped and began plotting a full-scale slave insurrection to take place at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, with financial support from Boston abolitionists.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pro-slavery Territorial government, serving under President Pierce, had been relocated to Lecompton. In April 1856, a Congressional committee arrived there to investigate voting fraud. The committee found the elections improperly elected by non-residents. President Pierce refused recognition of its findings and continued to authorize the pro-slavery legislature, which the Free State people called the \\"Bogus Legislature.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 4, 1856, proclamations of President Pierce led to nearly 500 U.S. Army troops arriving in Topeka from Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley. With their cannons pointed at Constitution Hall and the long fuses lit, Colonel E.V. Sumner, cousin to the senator of the same name beaten on the Senate floor, ordered the dispersal of the Free State Legislature.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1856, thousands of pro-slavery men formed into armies and marched into Kansas. That same month, Brown and several of his followers engaged 400 pro-slavery soldiers in the Battle of Osawatomie. The hostilities raged for another two months until Brown departed the Kansas Territory, and a new territorial governor, John W. Geary, took office and managed to prevail upon both sides for peace. This was followed by a fragile peace broken by intermittent violent outbreaks for two more years. The last major outbreak of violence was touched off by the Marais des Cygnes massacre in 1858, in which Border Ruffians killed five Free State men. In all, approximately 56 people died in Bleeding Kansas by the time the violence ended in 1859.[22] Following the commencement of the American Civil War in 1861, additional guerrilla violence erupted on the border between Kansas and Missouri.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, federal legislation defined a new Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area (FFNHA) and was approved by Congress. A task of the heritage area is to interpret Bleeding Kansas stories, which are also called stories of the KansasÿMissouri border war. A theme of the heritage area is the enduring struggle for freedom. FFNHA includes 41 counties, 29 of which are in eastern Kansas and 12 in western Missouri.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" episode has been dramatically rendered in countless works of American popular culture, including literature, theater, film, and television. Its many depictions and mentions include:","input":"What was the cause of the bleeding kansas?"},{"output":"maize","context":"Agriculture in Mexico has been an important sector of the countrys economy historically and politically even though it now accounts for a very small percentage of Mexicos GDP. Mexico is one of the cradles of agriculture with the Mesoamericans developing domesticated plants such as maize, beans, tomatoes, squash, cotton, vanilla, avocados, cacao, various kinds of spices, and more. Domestic turkeys and Muscovy ducks were the only domestic ticated fowl in the pre-Hispanic period and small dogs were raised for food. There were no large domesticated animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the early colonial period, the Spanish introduced more plants and the concept of animal husbandry, principally cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, goats and sheep, and barn yard animals such as chickens and pigs. Farming from the colonial period until the Mexican Revolution was focused on large private properties. After the Revolution these were broken up and the land redistributed. Since the latter 20th century NAFTA and economic policies have again favored large scale commercial agricultural holdings.\\r\\n\\r\\nMexicos main crops include grains such as corn and wheat, tropical fruits and various vegetables. Agricultural exports are important, especially coffee, tropical fruits and winter fruits and vegetables. Sixty percent of Mexicos agricultural exports go to the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe territory of Mexico roughly corresponds with that of Mesoamerica, which was one of the cradles of plant domestication.[1][2] Archeological research in the Gulf coast of Tabasco shows the earliest evidence of corn cultivation in Mexico. The first fields were along the Grijalva River delta with fossilized pollen evidence showing forest clearing around 5100 BCE. The domestication of corn is followed by that of sunflower seeds and cotton.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAgriculture was the basis of the major Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmecs, Mayas and Aztecs, with the principle crops being corn, beans, squash, chili peppers and tomatoes.[1] The tradition of planting corn, beans and squash together allows the beans to replace the nitrogen that corn depletes from the soil.[3] The three crops together are sometimes referred to as the Three Sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoil erosion from corn production has been a problem since the Mesoamerican period. This and other kinds of environmental degradation have been cited as the cause of the collapse of the Teotihuacan civilization. To create new areas for cultivation, Mesoamericans harvested rainfall, developed lakeshore irrigation systems and created new fields in the form of terraces and \\"chinampas\\" artificial floating islands in shallow waters.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSilver mining brought many Spanish to Mexico and silver was the largest single export from New Spain, but agriculture remained extremely important. There were far more people working in agriculture, not only producing subsistence crops for individual households, but also commercial agriculture to supply Spanish cities. In the early conquest period, Spaniards relied on crops produced by indigenous in central Mexico and rendered as tribute, following existing arrangements. Some Spaniards were awarded grants by the crown of indigenous tribute and labor in the institution of encomienda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expansion of the Spanish population in and the drop in indigenous population in the sixteenth century saw the rise of Spaniards acquiring ownership of land and using non-coercive indigenous labor on landed estates haciendas and smaller farms called ranchos. Much productive land was held in entail by indigenous villages, but the long term trend over the colonial era and the nineteenth century was the transfer of those lands into non-indigenous hands. The Spanish introduced a number of new crops such as wheat, barley, sugar, fruits (such as pear, apple, fig, apricot, and bananas) and vegetables, but their main contributions were domesticated animals, unknown in Mesoamerica. The Spanish brought their breeds of cattle, horses, goats and sheep, many of which are still raised today called \\"criollos.\\"[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of European crops were forbidden or severely restricted in New Spain, including olives, wine grapes and mulberry bushes for silkworms to protect farmers back in the mother country. A number of native plant and animal species from Mexico proved to have commercial value in Europe, leading to their mass cultivation and export including cochineal and indigo (for dyes), cacao, vanilla, henequen (for rope), cotton, and tobacco. A high quality, fast red dye from small cochineal insects that were cultivated and collected from the nopal cactuses on which they thrived was an extremely important export to Europe, the second most valuable after silver. Cochineal production was labor intense and largely remained in indigenous hands.  Mesoamerican staple foods, especially maize, continued to be important.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonial system continued after the Mexican War of Independence, with rural farm workers almost landless, as peons on haciendas.[5] Under the modernization efforts of the Porfirio Daz regime, these large haciendas were encouraged to develop commercial farming for export, especially the production of henequen and rubber. This included the building of railroads to take products to market and the attraction of foreign investment. While these policies succeeded in growing the economy, they benefited only the elite, making life for the common rural worker worse.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result was the Mexican Revolution from 1910 to 1920. The result afterwards was the breakup of most large private landholdings to be redistributed, especially under a system of common tenancy called ejidos. The lands could be worked individually or collectively by members of the ejido but the land could not be leased or sold. The process of dividing lands and developing ejido organizations continued into the 1930s under President Lzaro Crdenas .[1][6] By the end of the 1930s, haciendas almost entirely disappeared from central and southern Mexico with numerous small holdings of ten to twenty acres as well as ejidos becoming dominant.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nLand reform in Mexico was a major achievement of the Mexican Revolution, with the distribution of land to peasants concentrated in Mexico's center and south. The breakup of the haciendas solved a political problem in Mexico, since it was one of the demands of the peasants who fought and was enshrined.  By the 1930s and 40s, agricultural production was dropping and the government sought technical solutions.  In the 1940s during the presidency of Manuel Avila Camacho, the Mexican government partnered with the U.S. government, and the Rockefeller Foundation to launch the so-called Green Revolution (1950ÿ70).[7]  Research facilities developed new strains of wheat, maize, and other crops, to engineer a variety of desirable traits, such as disease resistance, high protein content.  Seeds and inputs of fertilizer and pesticides for irrigated agriculture were suited to Mexico's northwest.  Sorghum, a new crop was introduced to Mexico during the era of the Green Revolution, which was used for animal fodder. Mexico expanded cattle production in this era, fed on sorghum.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ejido system remained intact until the 1990s. However, during World War II, industry became the more important sector of the economy. Mexicos rural population began to fall in the mid century, from 49.3% in 1960 to 25.4% in 2000. Federal policies outside ejidos still favored large agricultural producers over rural peasant production, including the offering of credit and protectionist policies.[1] One of these was the construction of major irrigation systems, especially in the north. The first major irrigation project was the Laguna Project near Torre܇n, followed by the Las Delicias Project near Chihuahua, both with the aim of producing cotton along with wheat.[5] These projects increased the amount of land available for agriculture from 3.7 million acres in 1950 to 8.64 million acres in 1965.[9] In addition, the Mexican government encouraged only crops such as corn and beans, restricting imports of these two staples until 1990.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1970s, agricultural production was unable to keep up with population growth leading to imports of basic staples.[1] The Mexican government initiated programs in the 1970s and 80s to encourage family planning and the utilization of birth control, in order to reduce surging population growth.[10][11]  The peasant population had increased 59% in the period 1940-1960, with the number of work days in the fields going from 190 days in 1950 to 100 days in 1960.[12] Overpopulation was a factor in internal migration as well as migration for work to the U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rise of neoliberalism and the negotiation of NAFTA in the early 1990s pushed agriculture towards even more commercialized enterprises. The Mexican constitution was modified in 1992 to allow for leasing and selling of ejido land if the majority of members voted in favor. The goal of this was to allow ejidos to combine to form larger and more efficient farms, with money invested from private sources, but has resulted in most ejido land becoming privately held.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese changes have had uneven effects on Mexican agriculture.[1] Until the late 1990s, Mexico was a net exporter of agricultural products, but today it is a net importer, mostly from the United States.[9] With the need to compete with imported grains and less direct support from the government, the agricultural sector entered a crisis. Mexican agricultural income has polarized with large commercial farms dominating the sector and at the other end small subsistence farming which still is the main source of income for many, especially in the south of the country. The former are able to take advantage of reduced trade barriers and exports, especially to the United States have increased.[1][5] Former subsidies provided by the government was replaced by a program called Procampo, which gave direct cash payments to farmers growing corn, beans, wheat and other grains, allowing farmers to decide what to plant.[6][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite greater output, agriculture continues to decrease in percentage of Mexicos GDP since 1990.[9] The proportion of GDP of agriculture, forestry and fishing fell from eight percent of the nations GDP in 1990 5.4% of Mexicos GDP in 2006, with a growth rate of only 1.6% during that time, far behind other sectors of the economy.[1][13] In 2010, the structure of the GDP and labor force showed agriculture, forestry, and fishing combined was valued at 3.8% of total value, employing 5,903,300 or 12.5% of the labor force.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommercial agricultural products mostly come from three areas of the country, the tropics of the Gulf of Mexico and Chiapas Highlands, the irrigated lands of the north and northwest and the Bajo region in central Mexico.[5] At the beginning of the 21st century Mexicos main agricultural products include beef, fruits, vegetables, corn, milk, poultry, pork and eggs, which make up about 80% of agricultural production.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most profitable tropical crops are coffee and sugarcane. Coffee is exported but sugarcane is mostly for domestic consumption. Other important tropical crops are fruits such as bananas, pineapples and mangos as well as cacao and rice. Vanilla is still also grown, which is native to Mexico. Cotton is an important crop in the export agricultural areas of the Soconusco in Chiapas and in the north of Mexico.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the early 21st century, the rural workforce is still significant but it is shrinking.[13] Traditional farming methods with small plots worked by families and small communities still dominate in many regions especially those with large indigenous populations such as the Southern Plateau. In these areas the main crops are corn, beans and squash as in the Mesoamerican period. Many peasants still survive on subsistence agriculture earning cash by selling excess crops in local markets, especially in central and southern Mexico.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nExport of agricultural products to the United States is particularly important, especially since the implementation of NAFTA. While only about twelve percent of U.S. agricultural exports go to Mexico, about sixty percent of Mexico agricultural exports go to the United States.[6] Mexicos growing population has made the country a net importer of grains.[13]  Under NAFTA, the US has an advantage in the production of corn but Mexico has the advantage in the production of vegetables, fruits and beverages. The two fastest growing exports to the US are winter fruits and vegetables as well as fruit juices and fresh flowers. Two important products for export to the United States are avocados and tomatoes. The US prohibited import of Mexican avocados for over eighty years for hygienic reasons. In 1997, began to allow import of avocados from Michoacn. Most of the imported tomatoes eaten in the United States now come from Mexico.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant Mexican agribusiness enterprises include Grupo Maseca, headquartered in Monterrey. It has modernized corn flour production in Mexico and is the largest corn flour producer in the United States. Pulsar International in Monterrery has a number of high-tec agribusiness concerns including Savia, which has operations in 123 countries. A number of U.S. agribusiness enterprises have significant investments in Mexico, including Campbell Soup, General Mills, Ralston Purina and Pilgrims Pride. The last is the second largest poultry producer in Mexico.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMexico has a territory of 198 million hectares of which fifteen percent is dedicated to agricultural crops and fifty eight percent which is used for livestock production. Much of the country is too arid and/or too mountainous for crops or grazing. Forests cover 67 million hectares or thirty four percent of the country.[13] The terrain of Mexico consists of two large plateaus (Northern and Southern), the Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental mountain chains and narrow coastal plains. These make for a wide variety of ecosystems, most of them dry due to the fact that most moisture comes from the Gulf of Mexico with the north-south mountain chains blocking much of this flow, especially in the north where it is almost entirely arid or semi arid. The wettest areas of the country are those along the Gulf of Mexico coast.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe climate and topography limits agricultural production to 20.6 million hectares or 10.5% of the nations territory. Twenty five percent of this land must be irrigated. About half of the territory or 98 million hectares is used for grazing including natural grassland, various scrublands, tropical forests and conifer-oak forests. About 75% of grazing land is in northern Mexico.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nSixty five percent of soils in Mexico are shallow and with low yield for crops.  There are eleven main soil types in Mexico, mostly determined by climate patterns.  These are the Northwest, the Gulf of California, the Central Pacific, the North, the Centre,  the Northeast,  the Gulf of Mexico, the Balsas-Oaxaca Valley, the South Pacific, the Southeast and  the Yucatn. Those with high potential cover about twenty six percent of the country and are already heavily exploited. The greatest variety of soils is in the Centre and the Gulf of Mexico, areas with the highest population densities.[1] It is estimated that no more than one-fifth of the territory can be made to be arable.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout one fifth of Mexicos fields are irrigated, which is crucial for commercial production in arid north and northwest Mexico with cotton as the most important irrigated crop.[5] Underground aquifers have been under depletion at rates higher than one meter per year in most regions, with the raising of alfalfa one reason.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nOwnership of agricultural land in Mexico is either private or in some form of collective tenure, most often in an ejido arrangement. Ejidos were created in the first half of the 20th century to give Mexican peasants rights over redistributed lands, but this did not include leasing or selling. In 1992, the Mexican constitution was amended to modify this arrangement. However, most commonly held lands such as ejidos are characterized by small plots worked by families which are not efficient nor qualify for financial products such as loans.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe growing of crops is the most important aspect of Mexicos agriculture, accounting for fifty percent of agricultural output.[9] Main crops include corn, sugarcane, sorghum, wheat, tomatoes, bananas, chili peppers, oranges, lemons, limes, mangos, other tropical fruits, beans, barley, avocados, blue agave and coffee.[13]  The most important crops for national consumption are wheat, beans, corn and sorghum. The most important export crops are sugar, coffee, fruits and vegetables, most of which are exported to the United States.[9] The most important animal feed crop is alfalfa followed by sorghum and corn.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nCorn is still the most important crop in Mexico, grown on almost sixty percent of its cropland and contributing to just over nine percent of human calorie intake and fourteen percent of protein intake.[3] Central Mexico grows about sixty percent of the countrys corn, almost exclusively in the rainy season from June to October. While self-sufficient in the production for human consumption, half of Mexicos grain imports are for feed corn for animals.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of these crops are important regionally. Wheat is the most important crop in the northwest, now the center of Mexicos grain production. Other important crops in the northwest are winter vegetables such as tomatoes and lettuce as well as oilseeds. The traditional area for grain production in Mexico was the Bajo region. The region still produces wheat, corn, vegetables, peanuts, strawberries and beans, mostly on small holdings.[5] Wine grapes are grown in areas such as Baja California, Coahuila and Quertaro.  Mexico produces two crops not generally produced elsewhere, henequen used to produce a strong fiber and maguey, both in the agave family. Maguey is used for the making of pulque as well as mezcal. Tequila is a type of mezcal made from the blue agave in a designated zone mostly in Jalisco.[3][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nLivestock accounts for thirty percent of Mexicos agricultural output, producing milk, poultry, eggs and beef. Mexico is not self-sufficient in the production of meat and fish, importing its remaining needs mainly from the United States.[9] The north of Mexico has been the most important overall ranching area since the Mexican War of Independence. Large haciendas often exceeding 385 square miles in size were created in the 1800s and many large holdings survived the reforms associated with the Mexican Revolution. In the north open-range methods are giving way to rotational grazing systems, with some natural pastures enhanced by means of irrigation, top-seeding and fertilization.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ruminant section has traditionally been dominated by cattle, which provide 95% of the value of ruminant products. Thirty percent are raised in the north, 26% raised in central Mexico and 44% raised in the south. European breeds for meat such as Hereford, Angus and Charolais are dominant in the north, a local breed called criollo (descendants of those brought over by the Spanish) in central Mexico and Zebu breeds dominant in the south. Dairy cattle are varieties of Holstein and criollos, 42% raised in the north, 48% in central Mexico and 10% in the south. Since the 1990s, the raising of cattle, especially for dairy, has grown, mostly in the center and north of Mexico, displacing other kinds of agricultural production.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter cows are goats, with 20% raised in the north, 58% in Central Mexico and 22% in the south. Most of these goats are criollos, descendants of those the Spanish brought with Nubian, Alpino and Saanen breeds being introduced. Seventy five percent of dairy goats are raised in Coahuila, Durango and Guanajuato. About two thirds of meat production is on eight states in various parts of Mexico. Following goats are sheep with 16% raised in the north, 60% in central Mexico and 24% in the south. Criollo and Rambouillet are dominant in the north, with Suffolk and Hampshire dominating since their introduction in the 1970s in central Mexico. In southern Mexico breeds for tropical areas such as Pelibuey, Black-belly and Katahdin increasingly dominate.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs natural pasture is not enough to support modern commercial livestock production, animal feed is produced as a crop or as a measure to enhance natural pastures.  The former has increased since the 1990s and latter has increased more recently with government encouragement, especially in central and northern Mexico. In many areas, land used for the production of animal fodder, such as sorghum, is replacing that used for the growing of corn for human consumption.[1]","input":"Name three common crops grown on indian plantations?"},{"output":"Morarji Desai","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nExecutive:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n Legislature:\\r\\n\\r\\nJudiciary:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nPolitical parties\\r\\n\\r\\nNational coalitions:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nState governments\\r\\n\\r\\nLegislatures:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLocal governments:\\r\\nRural bodies:\\r\\n\\r\\nUrban bodies:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prime Minister of India is the  chief executive of the Government of India. In India's parliamentary system, the Constitution names the President as head of state de jure, but his or her de facto executive powers are vested in the Prime Minister and his Council of Ministers. Appointed and sworn-in by the President, the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the party or alliance that has a majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's Parliament.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1947, India has had fourteen Prime Ministers, fifteen including Gulzarilal Nanda who twice acted in the role. The first was Jawaharlal Nehru of the Indian National Congress party,[2] who was sworn-in on 15 August 1947, when India gained independence from the British. Serving until his death in May 1964, Nehru remains India's longest-serving prime minister. He was succeeded by fellow Congressman Lal Bahadur Shastri, whose 19-month term also ended in death. Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, succeeded Shastri in 1966 to become the country's first woman premier. Eleven years later, she was voted out of power in favour of the Janata Party, whose leader Morarji Desai became the first non-Congress prime minister. After he resigned in 1979, his former deputy Charan Singh briefly held office until Indira Gandhi was voted back six months later. Indira Gandhi's second stint as Prime Minister ended five years later on the morning of 31 October 1984, when she was gunned down by her own bodyguards. That evening, her son Rajiv Gandhi was sworn-in as India's youngest premier, and the third from his family. Thus far, members of Nehru-Gandhi family have been Prime Minister for a total of 37 years and 303 days.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nRajiv's five-year term ended with his former cabinet colleague, V. P. Singh of the Janata Dal, forming the year-long National Front coalition government in 1989. A seven-month interlude under Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar followed, after which the Congress party returned to power, forming the government under P. V. Narasimha Rao in June 1991. Rao's five-year term was succeeded by four short-lived governmentsthe Bharatiya Janata Party's Atal Bihari Vajpayee for 13 days in 1996, a year each under United Front prime ministers H. D. Deve Gowda and I. K. Gujral, and Vajpayee again for 19 months in 1998ÿ99. After Vajpayee was sworn-in for the third time, in 1999, he managed to lead his National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to a full five-year term, the first non-Congressman to do so. Vajpayee was succeeded by Congressman Manmohan Singh, the first Sikh premier, whose United Progressive Alliance government was in office for 10 years between 2004 and 2014. The incumbent Prime Minister of India is Narendra Modi who has headed the BJP-led NDA government since 26 May 2014 which is India's first non-Congress single party majority government.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1952\\r\\n\\r\\nPrime Minister\\r\\n(Re-elected)\\r\\n\\r\\n(acting President)","input":"Who is the fourth prime minister of india?"},{"output":"eighteen","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nA semi-trailer truck (more commonly semi truck or simply \\"semi\\") is the combination of a tractor unit and one or more semi-trailers to carry freight. A semi-trailer attaches to the tractor with a fifth wheel coupling (hitch), with much of its weight borne by the tractor. The result is that both the tractor and semi-trailer will have a distinctly different design than a rigid truck and trailer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is variously known as a transport in Canada; semi or single in Australia and New Zealand; semi, tractor-trailer, big rig, or eighteen-wheeler in the United States; and articulated lorry, abbreviated artic, in the United Kingdom, Ireland and New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn North America, the combination vehicles made up of a powered truck and one or more semitrailers are known as \\"semis\\", \\"semitrailers\\",[1] \\"tractor-trailers\\", \\"big rigs\\", \\"semi trucks\\", \\"eighteen-wheelers\\", or \\"semi-tractor trailers\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tractor unit typically has two or three axles; those built for hauling heavy-duty commercial-construction machinery may have as many as five, some often being lift axles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common tractor-cab layout has a forward engine, one steering axle, and two drive axles. The fifth-wheel trailer coupling on most tractor trucks is movable fore and aft, to allow adjustment in the weight distribution over its rear axle(s).\\r\\n\\r\\nUbiquitous in Europe, but less common in North America since the 1990s, is the cabover engine configuration, where the driver sits next to, or over the engine. With changes in the US to the maximum length of the combined vehicle, the cabover was largely phased out of North American over-the-road (long-haul) service by 2007. Cabovers were difficult to service; for a long time the cab could not be lifted on its hinges to a full 90-degree forward tilt, severely limiting access to the front part of the engine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2016[update], a truck can cost $100,000, while the diesel fuel cost can be $70,000 per year.[2] Trucks average from 4 to 8 miles per US gallon (59 to 29?L/100?km), with fuel economy standards requiring better than 7 miles per US gallon (34?L/100?km) efficiency by 2014.[3] Power requirements in standard conditions are 170?hp at 55?mph (89?km/h) or 280?hp at 70?mph (113?km/h), and somewhat different power usage in other conditions.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cargo trailer usually has tandem axles at the rear, each of which has dual wheels, or eight tires on the trailer, four per axle. In the US it is common to refer to the number of wheel hubs, rather than the number of tires; an axle can have either single or dual tires with no legal difference.[5][6] The combination of eight tires on the trailer and ten tires on the tractor is what led to the moniker eighteen wheeler, although this term is considered by some truckers to be a misnomer (the term \\"eighteen-wheeler\\" is a nickname for a five-axle over-the-road combination). Many trailers are equipped with movable tandem axles to allow adjusting the weight distribution.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo connect the second of a set of doubles to the first trailer, and to support the front half of the second trailer, a converter gear known as a \\"dolly\\" is used. This has one or two axles, a fifth-wheel coupling for the rear trailer, and a tongue with a ring-hitch coupling for the forward trailer. Individual states may further allow longer vehicles, known as \\"longer combination vehicles\\" (or LCVs), and may allow them to operate on roads other than Interstates.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong combination vehicle types include:\\r\\n\\r\\nFuture long combination vehicles under consideration and study for the U.S. MAP-21 transportation bill are container doubles. These combinations are under study for potential recommendation in November 2014:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US federal government, which only regulates the Interstate Highway System, does not set maximum length requirements (except on auto and boat transporters), only minimums. Tractors can pull two or three trailers if the combination is legal in that state. Weight maximums are 20,000?lb (9,100?kg) on a single axle, 34,000?lb (15,000?kg) on a tandem, and 80,000?lb (36,000?kg) total for any vehicle or combination. There is a maximum width of 8.5?ft (2.6?m) and no maximum height.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoads other than the Interstates are regulated by the individual states, and laws vary widely. Maximum weight varies between 80,000?lb (36,000?kg) to 171,000?lb (78,000?kg), depending on the combination.[9] Most states restrict operation of larger tandem trailer setups such as triple units, turnpike doubles and Rocky-Mountain doubles. Reasons for limiting the legal trailer configurations include both safety concerns and the impracticality of designing and constructing roads that can accommodate the larger wheelbase of these vehicles and the larger minimum turning radii associated with them. In general, these configurations are restricted to the Interstates. Except for these units, double setups are not restricted to certain roads any more than a single setup. They are also not restricted by weather conditions or \\"difficulty of operation\\".  The Canadian province of Ontario, however, does have weather-related operating restrictions for larger tandem trailer setups.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe noticeable difference between tractor units in Europe and North America is that almost all European models are cab over engine (called \\"forward control\\" in England[11]), while the majority of North American trucks are \\"conventional\\" (called \\"normal control\\" or \\"bonneted\\" in England[12]).[13]  European trucks, whether straight trucks or fully articulated, have a sheer face on the front. This allows shorter trucks with longer trailers (with larger freight capacity) within the legal maximum total length. Furthermore, it offers greater maneuverability in confined areas, a more balanced weight-distribution and better overall view for the driver. The major disadvantage is that for repairs on COE trucks, the entire cab has to hinge forward to allow maintenance access. Conversely, \\"conventional\\" cab tractors offer the driver a more comfortable driving environment, easier access getting in or out and better protection in a collision.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Europe usually both rear tractor axles have dual wheels, while single or dual wheels are used for the cargo trailer. The most common combination used in Europe is a semi tractor with three axles, one a lift axle, and a cargo trailer with three axles, one also a lift axle, giving six axles and 22 wheels in total. This format is now common across Europe, due to reduced road-loading requirements, especially for bridges. The lift axles used on both tractors and trailers allow the trucks to remain legal, but increases maneuverability  while at the same time reducing fuel consumption and tyre wear when carrying lighter loads, by raising one or multiple axle set(s) off the roadway. Although lift axles usually operate automatically, they can be lowered manually even while carrying light loads, in order to remain within legal (safe) limits when, for example, navigating back-road bridges with severely restricted axle loads. For greater detail, see the United Kingdom section, below.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen using a dolly, which generally has to be equipped with lights and a license plate, rigid trucks can be used to pull semi-trailers. The dolly is equipped with a fifth wheel to which the trailer is coupled. Because the dolly attaches to a pintle hitch on the truck, maneuvering a trailer hooked to a dolly is different from maneuvering a fifth wheel trailer. Backing the vehicle requires same technique as backing an ordinary truck/full trailer combination, though the dolly/semi setup is probably longer, thus requiring more space for maneuvering. The tractor/semi-trailer configuration is rarely used on timber trucks, since these will use the two big advantages of having the weight of the load on the drive wheels, and the loader crane used to lift the logs from the ground can be mounted on the rear of the truck behind the load, allowing a short (lightweight) crane to reach both ends of the vehicle without uncoupling. Also construction trucks are more often seen in a rigid + midaxle trailer configuration instead of the tractor/semi-trailer setup.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the maximum permitted gross weight of a semi-trailer truck, without the use of a Special Type General Order (STGO), is 97,000?lb (44?t). In order for a 97,000?lb semi-trailer truck to be permitted on UK roads the tractor and semi-trailer must have three or more axles each. Lower weight semi-trailer trucks can mean some tractors and trailer having fewer axles.[14] In practice, like double decker buses and coaches in the UK, there is no legal height limit for semi-trailer trucks; however, bridges over 16.5?ft (5.03?m) do not have the height marked on them. Semi-trailer trucks on Continental Europe have a height limit of 13.1?ft (4.0?m).\\r\\nVehicles heavier than 97,000?lb are permitted on UK roads but are indivisible loads, which would be classed as abnormal (or oversize). Such vehicles are required to display an STGO (Special Types General Order) plate on the front of the tractor unit and, under certain circumstances, are required to travel by an authorized route and have an escort.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost UK trailers are 45?ft (13.7?m) long and, dependent on the position of the fifth wheel and kingpin, a coupled tractor unit and trailer will have a combined length of between 50 and 55?ft (15.25 and 16.75?m). Although the Construction and Use Regulations allow a maximum rigid length of 60?ft (18.2?m), this, combined with a shallow kingpin and fifth wheel set close to the rear of the tractor unit, can give an overall length of around 75?ft (22.75?m).[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in January 2012 the Department for Transport is conducting a trial of longer semi-trailers. The trial involves 900 semi-trailers of 48?ft (14.6?m) in length (i.e. 3?ft (1?m) longer than the current maximum), and a further 900 semi-trailers of 51?ft (15.65?m) in length (i.e. 7?ft (2.05?m) longer). This will result in the total maximum length of the semi-trailer truck being 57?ft (17.5?m) for trailers 48?ft in length, and 61?ft (18.55?m) for trailers 51?ft long. The increase in length will not result in the 97,000?lb weight limit being exceeded and will allow some operators to approach the weight limit which may not have been previously possible due to the previous length of trailers. The trial will run for a maximum of 10 years. Providing certain requirements are fulfilled, a Special Types General Order (STGO) allows for vehicles of any size or weight to travel on UK roads. However, in practice any such vehicle has to travel by a route authorized by the Department of Transport and move under escort. The escort of abnormal loads in the UK is now predominantly carried out by private companies, but extremely large or heavy loads that require road closures must still be escorted by the police.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, some semi-trailer trucks have eight tires on three axles on the tractor; these are known as six-wheelers or \\"six leggers\\", with either the center or rear axle having single wheels which normally steer as well as the front axle and can be raised when not needed (i.e. when unloaded or only a light load is being carried; an arrangement known as a TAG axle when it is the rear axle, or mid-lift when it is the center axle).  Some trailers have two axles which have twin tires on each axle; other trailers have three axles, of which one axle can be a lift axle which has super-single wheels. In the UK, two wheels bolted to the same hub are classed as a single wheel, therefore a standard six-axle articulated truck is considered to have twelve wheels, even though it has twenty tires. The UK also allows semi-trailer truck which have six tires on two axles; these are known as four-wheelers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, the operator Denby Transport designed and built a 83?ft  long (25.25?m) B-Train (or B-Double) semi-trailer truck called the Denby Eco-Link to show the benefits of such a vehicle, which were a reduction in road accidents and result in less road deaths, a reduction in emissions due to the one tractor unit still being used and no further highway investment being required. Furthermore, Denby Transport asserted that two Eco-Links would replace three standard semi-trailer trucks while, if limited to the current UK weight limit of 97,000?lb, it was claimed the Eco-Link would reduce carbon emissions by 16% and could still halve the number of trips needed for the same amount of cargo carried in conventional semi-trailer trucks. This is based on the fact that for light but bulky goods such as toilet paper, plastic bottles, cereals and aluminum cans, conventional semi-trailer trucks run out of cargo space before they reach the weight limit. At 97,000?lb, as opposed to 132,000?lb usually associated with B-Trains, the Eco-Link also exerts less weight per axle on the road compared to the standard six-axle 97,000?lb semi-trailer truck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vehicle was built after Denby Transport believed they had found a legal-loophole in the present UK law to allow the Eco-Link to be used on the public roads. The relevant legislation concerned the 1986 Road Vehicles Construction and Use Regulations. The 1986 regulations state that \\"certain vehicles\\" may be permitted to draw more than one trailer and can be up to 85?ft (25.9?m).[citation needed] The point of law reportedly hinged on the definition of a \\"towing implement\\", with Denby prepared to argue that the second trailer on the Eco-Link was one. The Department for Transport were of the opinion that this refers to recovering a vehicle after an accident or breakdown, but the regulation does not explicitly state this.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring BTAC performance testing the Eco-Link was given an \\"excellent\\" rating for its performance in maneuverability, productivity, safety and emissions tests, superseding ordinary semi-trailer trucks in many respects. Private trials had also reportedly shown the Denby vehicle had a 20% shorter stopping distance than conventional semi-trailer trucks of the same weight, due to having extra axles. The active steer system meant that the Eco-Link had a turning circle of 41?ft (12.5?m), the same as a conventional semi-trailer truck.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Department for Transport advised that the Eco-Link was not permissible on public roads, Denby Transport gave the Police prior warning of the timing and route of the test drive on the public highway, as well as outlining their position in writing to the Eastern Traffic Area Office. On 1 December 2009 Denby Transport were preparing to drive the Eco-Link on public roads, but this was cut short because the Police pulled the semi-trailer truck over as it left the gates in order to test it for its legality \\"to investigate any... offenses which may be found\\". The Police said the vehicle was unlawful due to its length and Denby Transport was served with a notice by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) inspector to remove the vehicle from the road for inspection. Having returned to the yard, Denby Transport was formally notified by Police and VOSA that the semi-trailer truck could not be used. Neither the Eco-Link, nor any other B-Train, have since been permitted on UK roads. However, this prompted the Department for Transport to undertake a desk study into semi-trailer trucks, which has resulted in the longer semi-trailer trial which commenced in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maximum overall length in the EU and EEA member states was 18.75?m (61.5?ft) with a maximum weight of 40?tonnes, or 44?tonnes if carrying an ISO container.[16] However, rules limiting the semi-trailers to 16.5?m (54?ft) and 18.75?m are met with trucks carrying a standardized 7.82?m (26?ft) body with one additional 7.82?m body on tow as a trailer.[17] 25.25?metre truck combinations were developed under the branding of EcoCombi which influenced the name of EuroCombi for an ongoing standardization effort where such truck combinations shall be legal to operate in all jurisdictions of the European Economic Area. With the 50% increase in cargo weight, the fuel efficiency increases with an average of 20% with a corresponding relative decrease in carbon emissions and with the added benefit of one third fewer trucks on the road.[16] The 1996 EU regulation defines a Europe Module System (EMS) as it was implemented in Sweden. The wording of EMS combinations and EuroCombi are now used interchangeably to point to truck combinations as specified in the EU document; however, apart from Sweden and Finland, the EuroCombi is only allowed to operate on specific tracks in other EU member states.  Since 1996, when Sweden and Finland formally won a final exemption from the European Economic Area rules with 60?tonne and 25.25?m (83?ft) combinations, all other From 2006, 25.25?m truck trailer combinations are to be allowed on restricted routes within Germany, following a similar (on-going) trial in The Netherlands. Similarly, Denmark has allowed 25.25?m combinations on select routes. These vehicles will run a 60?tonne weight limit. Two types are to be used: 1) a 26-tonne truck pulling a dolly and semi-trailer, or 2) an articulated tractor unit pulling a B-double, member states gained the ability to adopt the same rules. In Italy the maximum permitted weight (unless exceptional transport is authorized) is 44 tonnes for any kind of combination with five axles or more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tractor/semi-trailer configuration is rarely used on timber trucks, since these will use the two big advantages of having the weight of the load on the drive wheels, and the loader crane used to lift the logs from the ground can be mounted on the rear of the truck behind the load, allowing a short (lightweight) crane to reach both ends of the vehicle without uncoupling. Also construction trucks are more often seen in a rigid + midaxle trailer configuration instead of the tractor/semi-trailer setup.\\r\\n\\r\\nDenmark and Norway allow 25.25?m (83?ft) trucks (Denmark from 2008, and Norway from 2008 on selected routes). In Sweden the allowed length has been 24?m (79?ft) since 1967. Before that, the maximum length was unlimited; the only limitations were on axle load. What stopped Sweden from adopting the same rules as the rest of Europe, when securing road safety, was the national importance of a competitive forestry industry.[16][18] Finland, with the same road safety issues and equally important forestry industry, followed suit. The change made trucks able to carry three stacks of cut-to-length logs instead of two, as it would be in a short combination. They have one on stack together with a crane on the 6G4 truck, and two additional stacks on a four axle trailer. The allowed gross weight in both countries is up to 60 tonnes depending on the distance between the first and last axle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the negotiations starting in the late 1980s preceding Sweden and Finland's entries to the European Economic Area and later the European Union, they insisted on exemptions from the EU rules citing environmental concerns and the transportation needs of the logging industry. In 1995, after their entry to the union, the rules changed again, this time to allow trucks carrying a standard CEN unit of 7.82?m (26?ft) to draw a 13.6?m (45?ft) standard semi-trailer on a dolly, a total overall length of 25.25?m. Later, B-double combinations came into use, often with one 6?m (20?ft) container on the B-link and a 12?m (40?ft) container (or two 6?m containers) on a semi-trailer bed. In allowing the longer truck combinations, what would take two 16.5?m (54?ft) semi-trailer trucks and one 18.75?m (62?ft) truck and trailer to haul on the continent now could be handled by just two 25.25?m trucks ÿ greatly reducing overall costs and emissions. Prepared since late 2012 and effective on January 2013, Finland has changed its regulations to allow total maximum legal weight of a combination to be 76?tonnes. At the same time the maximum allowed height would be increased by 20?cm (8?in); from current maximum of 4.2?m (13.8?ft) to 4.4?m (14.4?ft). The effect this major maximum weight increase would cause to the roads and bridges in Finland over time is strongly debated.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, longer and heavier combinations are regularly seen on public roads; special permits are issued for special cargo. The mining company Boliden AB have a standing special permit for 80?tonne combinations on select routes between mines in the inland and the processing plant in Boliden, taking a 50?tonne load of ore. Volvo has a special permit for a 32?m (105?ft), steering B-trailer-trailer combination carrying two 12?m (40?ft) containers to and from Gothenburg harbour and the Volvo Trucks factory, all on the island of Hisingen.[19] Another example is the ongoing project En Trave Till (lit. One more pile/stack) started in December 2008. It will allow even longer vehicles to further rationalize the logging transports. As the name of the project points out, it will be able to carry four stacks of timber, instead of the usual three. The test is limited to Norrbotten county and the European route E4 between the timber terminal in ?verkalix and the sawmill in Munksund (outside Pite?). The vehicle is a 30?m (98?ft) long truck trailer combination with a gross weight exceeding 90?tonnes. It is estimated that this will give a 20% lower cost and 20-25% CO2 emissions reduction compared to the regular 60?tonne truck combinations. As the combinations spreads its weight over more axles, braking distance, road wear and traffic safety is believed to be either the same or improved with the 90?tonne truck-trailer. In the same program two types of 74?tonne combinations will be tested in Dalsland and Bohusl?n counties in western Sweden: an enhanced truck and trailer combination for use in the forest and a b-double for plain highway transportation to the mill in Skoghall. In 2012, the Northland Mining company received permission for 90?tonne combinations with normal axle load (an extra dolly) for use on the 150?km (93?mi) Kaunisvaara-Svappavaara route, carrying iron ore.[20][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralian road transport has a reputation for using very large trucks and road trains. This is reflected in the most popular configurations of trucks generally having dual drive axles and three axles on the trailers, with four tyres on each axle. This means that Australian single semi-trailer trucks will usually have 22 tyres, which is generally more than their counterparts in other countries. Super single tyres are sometimes used on tri-axle trailers. The suspension is designed with travel limiting, which will hold the rim off the road for one blown or deflated tyre for each side of the trailer, so a trailer can be driven at reduced speed to a safe place for repair. Super singles are also often used on the steer axle in Australia to allow greater loading over the steer axle. The increase in loading of steer tyres requires a permit.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong haul transport usually operates as B-doubles with two trailers (each with three axles), for a total of nine axles (including steering). In some lighter duty applications only one of the rear axles of the truck is driven, and the trailer may have only two axles. From July 2007, the Australian Federal and State Governments allowed the introduction of B-triple trucks on a specified network of roads.[23] B-Triples are set up differently from conventional road trains. The front of their first trailer is supported by the turntable on the prime mover. The second and third trailers are supported by turntables on the trailers in front of them. As a result, B-Triples are much more stable than road trains and handle exceptionally well. True road trains only operate in remote areas, regulated by each state or territory government.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn total, the maximum length that any articulated vehicle may be (without a special permit and escort) is 53.5?m (176?ft), its maximum load may be up to 164?tonnes gross, and may have up to four trailers. However, heavy restrictions apply to the areas where such a vehicle may travel in most states. In remote areas such as the Northern Territory great care must be taken when sharing the road with longer articulated vehicles that often travel during the daytime, especially four-trailer road trains.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticulated trucks towing a single trailer or two trailers (commonly known as \\"short doubles\\") with a maximum overall length of 19?m (62?ft) are referred to as \\"General access heavy vehicles\\" and are permitted in all areas, including metropolitan. B-doubles are limited to a maximum total weight of 62.5?tonnes and overall length of 25?m (82?ft), or 26?m (85?ft) if they are fitted with approved FUPS (Front Underrun Protection System) devices. B-doubles may only operate on designated roads, which includes most highways and some major metropolitan roads. B-doubles are very common in all parts of Australia including state capitals and on major routes they outnumber single trailer configurations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaximum width of any vehicle is 2.5?m (8.2?ft) and a height of 4.3?m (14?ft). In the past few years, allowance has been made by several states to allow certain designs of heavy vehicles up to 4.6?m (15?ft) high but they are also restricted to designated routes. In effect, a 4.6?meter high B-double will have to follow two sets of rules: they may access only those roads that are permitted for B-doubles and for 4.6?meter high vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia, both conventional prime movers and cabovers are common, however, cabovers are most often seen on B-doubles on the eastern seaboard where the reduction in total length allows the vehicle to pull longer trailers and thus more cargo than it would otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Australian prime mover Kenworth and B double trailer combination\\r\\n\\r\\nA road train in Australia\\r\\n\\r\\nB-double truck on the Sturt Highway\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Zealand's legislation governing truck dimensions falls under the Vehicle Dimensions and Mass Rules published by NZ Transport Agency.[24] New rules were introduced effective 1 February 2017.[25] which increased the maximum height, width and weight of loads and vehicles to simplify regulations, increase the amount of freight carried and to improve the range of vehicles and trailers available to transport operators. \\r\\n\\r\\nCommon combinations in New Zealand consist of a standard semi-trailer, a B-double or a rigid towing vehicle pulling a trailer with a drawbar. Standard maximum vehicle lengths for trailers with one axle set are:\\r\\n\\r\\nTrailers with two axle sets can be 20?m (66?ft), including heavy rigid vehicles towing two trailers.\\r\\nOversized loads require, at minimum, a permit, and may require a pilot vehicle.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many types of semi-trailers in use, designed to haul a wide range of products.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cargo trailer is, by means of a king pin, hooked to a horseshoe-shaped quick-release coupling device called a fifth wheel or a turntable hitch at the rear of the towing engine that allows easy hook up and release. The truck trailer cannot move by itself because it only has wheels at the rear end: it requires a forward axle, provided by the towing engine, to carry half the load weight.  When braking hard at high speeds, the vehicle has a tendency to fold at the pivot point between the towing vehicle and the trailer. Such a truck accident is called a \\"trailer swing\\", although it is also commonly described as a \\"jackknife\\".[27] Jackknifing is a condition where the tractive unit swings round against the trailer, and not vice versa.\\r\\n\\r\\nSemi trucks use air pressure, rather than hydraulic fluid, to actuate the brake. The use of air hoses allows for ease of coupling and uncoupling of trailers from the tractor unit. The most common failure is brake fade, usually caused when the drums or discs and the linings of the brakes overheat from excessive use.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parking brake of the tractor unit and the emergency brake of the trailer are spring brakes that require air pressure in order to be released. They are applied when air pressure is released from the system, and disengaged when air pressure is supplied. This is a fail-safe design feature which ensures that if air pressure to either unit is lost, the vehicle will stop to a grinding halt, instead of continuing without brakes and becoming uncontrollable. The trailer controls are coupled to the tractor through two gladhand connectors, which provide air pressure, and an electrical cable, which provides power to the lights and any specialized features of the trailer.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlad-hand connectors (also known as palm couplings) are air hose connectors, each of which has a flat engaging face and retaining tabs. The faces are placed together, and the units are rotated so that the tabs engage each other to hold the connectors together. This arrangement provides a secure connection but allows the couplers to break away without damaging the equipment if they are pulled, as may happen when the tractor and trailer are separated without first uncoupling the air lines. These connectors are similar in design to the ones used for a similar purpose between railroad cars. Two air lines typically connect to the trailer unit. An emergency or main air supply line pressurizes the trailer's air tank and disengages the emergency brake, and a second service line controls the brake application during normal operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, male/female quick release connectors (red line or emergency), have a female on the truck and male on the trailer,  but a yellow line or service has a male on the truck and female on the trailer. This avoids coupling errors (causing no brakes) plus the connections will not come apart if pulled by accident. The three electrical lines will fit one way around a primary black, a secondary green, and an ABS lead, all of which are collectively known as suzies or suzie coils.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother braking feature of semi-trucks is engine braking, which could be either a compression brake (usually shortened to Jake brake) or exhaust brake or combination of both. However, the use of compression brake alone produces a loud and distinctive noise, and to control noise pollution, some local municipalities have prohibited or restricted the use of engine brake systems inside their jurisdictions, particularly in residential areas. The advantage to using engine braking instead of conventional brakes is that a truck can descend a long grade without overheating its wheel brakes. Some vehicles can also be equipped with hydraulic or electric retarders which have an advantage of near silent operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the wide variety of loads the semi may carry, they usually have a manual transmission to allow the driver to have as much control as possible. However, all truck manufacturers now offer semi-automatic transmissions (manual gearboxes with automated gear change), as well as automatic transmissions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSemi-truck transmissions can have as few as three forward speeds or as many as 18 forward speeds (plus 2 reverse speeds). A large number of transmission ratios means the driver can operate the engine more efficiently. Modern on-highway diesel engines are designed to provide maximum torque in a narrow RPM range (usually 1200-1500 RPM); having more gear ratios means the driver can hold the engine in its optimum range regardless of road speed (drive axle ratio must also be considered).\\r\\n\\r\\nA ten-speed manual transmission, for example is controlled via a six-slot H-box pattern, similar to that in five-speed cars  five forward and one reverse gear. Gears six to ten (and high speed reverse) are accessed by a Lo/High range splitter; gears one to five are Lo range; gears six to ten are High range using the same shift pattern. A Super-10 transmission, by contrast, has no range splitter; it uses alternating \\"stick and button\\" shifting (stick shifts 1-3-5-7-9, button shifts 2-4-6-8-10).  The 13-, 15-, and 18-speed transmissions have the same basic shift pattern, but include a splitter button to enable additional ratios found in each range. Some transmissions may have 12 speeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother difference between semi-trucks and cars is the way the clutch is set up. On an automobile, the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift, to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine. On a semi-truck with constant mesh transmission (non synchronized), such as by the Eaton Roadranger series, not only is double clutching required, but a clutch brake is required as well. The clutch brake stops the rotation of the gears, and allows the truck to be put into gear without grinding when stationary. The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow smooth engagement of low gears when starting from a full stop; when the truck is moving, the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to break torque for gear changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn electrical connection is made between the tractor and the trailer through a cable often referred to as a pigtail. This cable is a bundle of wires in a single casing. Each wire controls one of the electrical circuits on the trailer, such as running lights, brake lights, turn signals, etc. A straight cable would break when the rig went around corners, so a coiled cable is used which retracts these coils when not under tension. It is these coils that cause the cable to look like a pigtail.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most countries, a trailer or semi-trailer must have minimum\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough dual wheels are the most common, use of two single, wider tires, known as super singles, on each axle is becoming popular among bulk cargo carriers and other weight-sensitive operators. With increased efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the use of the super-single tire is gaining popularity. There are several advantages to this configuration. The first of these is that super singles reduce fuel consumption. In 1999, tests on an oval track showed a 10% fuel savings when super singles were used. These savings are realized because less energy is wasted flexing fewer tire sidewalls. Second, the lighter overall tire weight allows a truck to be loaded with more freight. The third advantage is that the single wheel encloses less of the brake unit, which allows faster cooling and reduces brake fade.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the major disadvantages of the super singles is that they are currently not as widely available as a standard tire. In addition, if a tire should become deflated or be destroyed, there is not another tire attached to the same hub to maintain the dynamic stability of the vehicle, as would be the case with dual wheels. With dual wheels, the remaining tire may be overloaded, but it will typically allow the vehicle to be safely stopped or driven to a repair facility.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Europe, super singles became popular when the allowed weight of semitrailer rigs was increased from 38 to 40 tonnes.[28] In this reform the trailer industry replaced two 10-tonne (22,000?lb) axles with dual wheels, with three 8-tonne (18,000?lb) axles on wide-base single wheels. The significantly lower axle weight on super singles must be considered when comparing road wear from single versus dual wheels. The majority of super singles sold in Europe have a width of 385?mm (15.2?in). The standard 385 tires have a legal load limit of 4,500?kg (9,900?lb). (Note that expensive, specially reinforced 385 tires approved for 5,000?kg (11,000?lb) do exist. Their market share is tiny, except for mounting on the steer axle.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAn innovation rapidly growing in popularity is the skirted trailer. The space between the road and the bottom of the trailer frame was traditionally left open until it was realized that the turbulent air swirling under the trailer is a major source of aerodynamic drag. Three split skirt concepts were verified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide fuel savings greater than 5%, and four split skirt concepts had EPA-verified fuel savings between 4% and 5%.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSkirted trailers are often combined with Underrun Protection Systems (underride guards), greatly improving safety for passenger vehicles sharing the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically called a Rear Underrun Protection System (RUPS), this is a rigid assembly hanging down from the bottom rear of the trailer, which is intended to provide some protection for passenger cars which collide with the rear of the trailer. Public awareness of this safeguard was increased in the aftermath of the accident that killed actress Jayne Mansfield on 29 June 1967, when the car she was in hit the rear of a tractor-trailer, causing fatal head trauma. After her death, the NHTSA recommended requiring a rear underride guard, also known as a Mansfield bar, an ICC bar, or a DOT bumper,[30][31]. In Europe, side and rear underrun protection are mandated on all lorries and trailers with a gross weight of 3,500?kg or more.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bottom rear of the trailer is near head level for an adult seated in a car, and without the underride guard, the only protection for such an adult's head in a rear-end collision would be the car's windshield. The front of the car goes under the platform of the trailer rather than making contact via the passenger car bumper, so the car's protective crush zone becomes irrelevant and air bags are ineffective in protecting the car passengers. The underride guard provides a rigid area for the car to contact at the height of its bumper.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to rear underride guards, truck tractor cabs may be equipped with a Front Underrun Protection System (FUPS) at the front bumper of the truck.  The safest tractor-trailers are also equipped with side underride guards, also called Side Underrun Protection System (SUPS). These additional barriers prevent passenger cars from skidding underneath the trailer from the side, such as in an oblique or side collision, or if the trailer jackknifes across the road.  In addition to safety benefits, these underride guards may improve fuel mileage by reducing air turbulence under the trailer at highway speeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother benefit of having a sturdy underride guard is that it may be secured to a loading dock with a hook to prevent \\"trailer creep\\", a movement of the trailer away from the dock, which opens up a dangerous gap during loading or unloading operations.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent semi-truck manufacturers include:\\r\\n\\r\\nA special driver's license is required to operate various commercial vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegulations vary by province. A license to operate a vehicle with air brakes is required (i.e., normally a Class I, II, or III commercial license with an \\"A\\" or \\"S\\" endorsement in provinces other than Ontario). In Ontario, a \\"Z\\" endorsement[34] is required to drive any vehicle using air brakes; in provinces other than Ontario, the \\"A\\" endorsement is for air brake operation only, and an \\"S\\" endorsement is for both operation and adjustment of air brakes. Anyone holding a valid Ontario driver's license (i.e., excluding a motorcycle license) with a \\"Z\\" endorsement can legally drive any air-brake-equipped truck-trailer combination with a registered- or actual-gross-vehicle-weight (i.e., including towing- and towed-vehicle) up to 11?tonnes, that includes one trailer weighing no more than 4.6?tonnes if the license falls under the following three classes: Class E (school busmaximum 24-passenger capacity or ambulance), F (regular busmaximum 24-passenger capacity or ambulance) or G (car, van, or small-truck).\\r\\n\\r\\nA Class B (any school bus), C (any urban-transit-vehicle or highway-coach), or D (heavy trucks other than tractor-trailers) license enables its holder to drive any truck-trailer combination with a registered- or actual-gross-vehicle-weight (i.e., including towing- and towed-vehicle) greater than 11?tonnes, that includes one trailer weighing no more than 4.6?tonnes.[35] Anyone holding an Ontario Class A license (or its equivalent) can drive any truck-trailer combination with a registered- or actual-gross-vehicle-weight (i.e., including towing- and towed-vehicles) greater than 11 tonnes, that includes one or more trailers weighing more than 4.6 tonnes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrivers of semi-trailer trucks generally require a Class A commercial driver's license (CDL) to operate any combination vehicles with a gross combination weight rating (or GCWR) in excess of 26,000?lb (11,800?kg) if the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of the towed vehicle(s) is in excess of 10,000?lb (4,500?kg). Some states (such as North Dakota) provide exemptions for farmers, allowing non-commercial license holders to operate semis within a certain air-mile radius of their reporting location. State exemptions, however, are only applicable in intrastate commerce; stipulations of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) may be applied in interstate commerce.  Also a person under the age of 21 cannot operate a commercial vehicle outside the state where the commercial license was issued.  This restriction may also be mirrored by certain states in their intrastate regulations.  A person must be at least 18 in order to be issued a commercial license.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, endorsements are necessary for certain cargo and vehicle arrangements and types;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Road Traffic Security Rules (o???t) require a combination vehicle driver license (Chinese: ??H???) to drive a combination vehicle (Chinese: ??). These rules define a combination vehicle as a motor vehicle towing a heavy trailer, i.e., a trailer with a gross weight of more than 750 kilograms (1,653?lb).\\r\\n\\r\\nA category CE driving licence is required to drive a tractor-trailer in Europe. Category C (æ in Greece) is required for vehicles over 7,500?kg (16,500?lb), while category E is for heavy trailers, which in the case of trucks and buses means any trailer over 750?kg (1,650?lb). Vehicles over 3,500?kg (7,700?lb)which is the maximum limit of B licensebut under 7,500 kg can be driven with a C1 license. Buses require a D ( in Greece) license. A bus that is registered for no more than 16 passengers, excluding the driver, can be driven with a D1 license.\\r\\n\\r\\nTruck drivers in Australia require an endorsed license. These endorsements are gained through training and experience. The minimum age to hold an endorsed license is 18?years, and/or must have held open (full) driver's license for minimum 12?months.\\r\\nThe following are the heavy vehicle license classes in Australia:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to obtain an HC License the driver must have held an MR or HR license for at least 12 months. To upgrade to an MC License the driver must have held a HR or HC license for at least 12 months. From licenses MR and upward there is also a B Condition which may apply to the license if testing in a synchromesh or automatic transmission vehicle.

A Class 1 license (car license) will allow the driving of any vehicle with Gross Laden Weight (GLW) or Gross Combination Weight (GCW) of 6,000?kg (13,000?lb) or less. For other types of vehicles the classes are separately licensed as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther information on the New Zealand licensing system for heavy vehicles can be found at the New Zealand Transport Agency.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern day semi-trailer trucks often operate as a part of a domestic or international transport infrastructure to support containerized cargo shipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious types of rail flat bed train cars are modified to hold the cargo trailer or container with wheels or without. This is called Intermodal or piggyback. The system allows the cargo to switch from highway to railway or vice versa with relative ease by using gantry cranes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe large trailers pulled by a tractor unit come in many styles, lengths, and shapes. Some common types are: vans, reefers, flatbeds, sidelifts and tankers. These trailers may be refrigerated, heated, ventilated, or pressurized, depending on climate and cargo. Some trailers have movable wheel axles that can be adjusted by moving them on a track underneath the trailer body and securing them in place with large pins. The purpose of this is to help adjust weight distribution over the various axles, to comply with local laws.","input":"How many tires does a 18 wheeler have?"},{"output":"Aneto","context":"The Pyrenees (/?p?r?ni?z/; Spanish: Pirineos [pi?i?neos], French: Pyrnes [pi?ene], Aragonese: Pirineus, Catalan: Pirineus [pi?i?n?us], Occitan: Pirenus, Basque: Pirinioak [pi??inio?ak]) is a range of mountains in southwest Europe that forms a natural border between Spain and France. Reaching a height of 3,404 metres (11,168?ft) altitude at the peak of Aneto, the range separates the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of continental Europe, and extends for about 491?km (305?mi) from the Bay of Biscay (Cap Higuer) to the Mediterranean Sea (Cap de Creus).\\r\\nFor the most part, the main crest forms a divide between Spain and France, with the microstate of Andorra sandwiched in between. The Catalan Counties and later the Principality of Catalonia alongside with the Kingdom of Aragon in the Crown of Aragon and the Kingdom of Navarre have historically extended on both sides of the mountain range, with smaller northern portions now in France and larger southern parts now in Spain.[1][2]\\r\\nThe demonym for the noun \\"Pyrenees\\" in English is Pyrenean.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Greek mythology, Pyrene is a princess who gave her name to the Pyrenees. The Greek historian Herodotus says Pyrene is the name of a town in Celtic Europe.[3] According to Silius Italicus,[4] she was the virginal daughter of Bebryx, a king in Mediterranean Gaul by whom the hero Hercules was given hospitality during his quest to steal the cattle of Geryon[5] during his famous Labors. Hercules, characteristically drunk and lustful, violates the sacred code of hospitality and rapes his host's daughter. Pyrene gives birth to a serpent and runs away to the woods, afraid that her father will be angry. Alone, she pours out her story to the trees, attracting the attention of wild beasts who tear her to pieces.\\r\\nAfter his victory over Geryon, Hercules passes through the kingdom of Bebryx again, finding the girl's lacerated remains. As is often the case in stories of this hero, the sober Hercules responds with heartbroken grief and remorse at the actions of his darker self, and lays Pyrene to rest tenderly, demanding that the surrounding geography join in mourning and preserve her name:[6] \\"struck by Herculean voice, the mountaintops shudder at the ridges; he kept crying out with a sorrowful noise 'Pyrene!' and all the rock-cliffs and wild-beast haunts echo back 'Pyrene!'  The mountains hold on to the wept-over name through the ages.\\" Pliny the Elder connects the story of Hercules and Pyrene to Lusitania, but rejects it as fabulosa, highly fictional.[7]\\r\\nOther classical sources derived the name from the Greek word for fire, Ancient Greek: ?.[8] According to Greek historian Diodorus Siculus \\"..in ancient times, we are told, certain herdsmen left a fire and the whole area of the mountains was entirely consumed; and due to this fire, since it raged continuously day after day, the surface of the earth was also burned and the mountains, because of what had taken place, were called the Pyrenees.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe Spanish Pyrenees are part of the following provinces, from east to west: Girona, Barcelona, Lleida (all in Catalonia), Huesca (in Aragon), Navarra (in Navarre) and Gipuzkoa (in the Basque Country).\\r\\nThe French Pyrenees are part of the following dpartements, from east to west: Pyrnes-Orientales (North Catalonia and Fenolheda), Aude, Arige, Haute-Garonne, Hautes-Pyrnes, and Pyrnes-Atlantiques (the latter two of which include the Pyrenees National Park).\\r\\nThe independent principality of Andorra is sandwiched in the eastern portion of the mountain range between the Spanish Pyrenees and French Pyrenees.\\r\\nPhysiographically, the Pyrenees may be divided into three sections: the Atlantic (or Western), the Central, and the Eastern Pyrenees. Together, they form a distinct physiographic province of the larger Alpine System division.\\r\\nIn the Western Pyrenees, from the Basque mountains near the Bay of Biscay of the Atlantic Ocean, the average elevation gradually increases from west to east.\\r\\nThe Central Pyrenees extend eastward from the Somport pass to the Aran Valley, and they include the highest summits of this range:\\r\\nIn the Eastern Pyrenees, with the exception of one break at the eastern extremity of the Pyrnes Arigeoises in the Arige area, the mean elevation is remarkably uniform until a sudden decline occurs in the easternmost portion of the chain known as the Albres.\\r\\nMost foothills of the Pyrenees are on the Spanish side, where there is a large and complex system of ranges stretching from Spanish Navarre, across northern Aragon and into Catalonia, almost reaching the Mediterranean coast with summits reaching 2,600?m (8,500?ft).[10] At the eastern end on the southern side lies a distinct area known as the Sub-Pyrenees.[11]\\r\\nOn the French side the slopes of the main range descend abruptly and there are no foothills except in the Corbires Massif in the northeastern corner of the mountain system.[12]\\r\\nThe Pyrenees are older than the Alps: their sediments were first deposited in coastal basins during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. Between 100 and 150 million years ago, during the Lower Cretaceous Period, the Bay of Biscay fanned out, pushing present-day Spain against France and applying intense compressional pressure to large layers of sedimentary rock. The intense pressure and uplifting of the Earth's crust first affected the eastern part and moved progressively to the entire chain, culminating in the Eocene Epoch.\\r\\nThe eastern part of the Pyrenees consists largely of granite and gneissose rocks, while in the western part the granite peaks are flanked by layers of limestone. The massive and unworn character of the chain comes from its abundance of granite, which is particularly resistant to erosion, as well as weak glacial development.\\r\\nThe upper parts of the Pyrenees contain low-relief surfaces forming a peneplain. This peneplain originated no earlier than in Late Miocene times. Presumably it formed at height as extensive sedimentation raised the local base level considerably.[13]\\r\\nConspicuous features of Pyrenean scenery are:\\r\\nThe highest waterfall is Gavarnie (462?m or 1,515?ft), at the head of the Gave de Pau; the Cirque de Gavarnie, in the same valley, together with the nearby Cirque de Troumouse and Cirque d'Estaub, are notable examples of the cirque formation.\\r\\nLow passes are lacking, and the principal roads and the railroads between France and Spain run only in the lowlands at the western and eastern ends of the Pyrenees, near sea level. The main passes of note are:\\r\\nBecause of the lack of low passes a number of tunnels have been created, beneath the passes at Somport, Envalira, and Puymorens and new routes in the center of the range at Bielsa and Vielha.\\r\\nA notable visual feature of this mountain range is La Brche de Roland, a gap in the ridge line, which?ÿ according to legend?ÿ was created by Roland.\\r\\nThe metallic ores of the Pyrenees are not in general of much importance now, though there were iron mines at several locations in Andorra, as well as at Vicdessos in Arige, and the foot of Canigou in Pyrnes-Orientales long ago. Coal deposits capable of being profitably worked are situated chiefly on the Spanish slopes, but the French side has beds of lignite. The open pit of Trimoun close to the commune of Luzenac (Arige) is one of the greatest sources of talc in Europe.\\r\\nMineral springs are abundant and remarkable, and especially noteworthy are the hot springs, of which the Alps are very deficient. The hot springs, among which those of Les Escaldes in Andorra, Panticosa and Lles in Spain, Ax-les-Thermes, Bagnres-de-Luchon and Eaux-Chaudes in France may be mentioned, are sulphurous and mostly situated high, near the contact of the granite with the stratified rocks. The lower springs, such as those of Bagnres-de-Bigorre (Hautes-Pyrnes), Rennes-les-Bains (Aude) and Campagne-sur-Aude (Aude), are mostly selenitic and not very cold.\\r\\nThe amount of precipitation the range receives, including rain and snow, is much greater in the western than in the eastern Pyrenees because of the moist air that blows in from the Atlantic Ocean over the Bay of Biscay. After dropping its moisture over the western and central Pyrenees, the air is left dry over the eastern Pyrenees. The winter average temperature is -2?C (28.4?F).\\r\\nSections of the mountain range vary in more than one respect. There are some glaciers in the western and snowy central Pyrenees, but there are no glaciers in the eastern Pyrenees because there is insufficient snowfall to cause their development. Glaciers are confined to the northern slopes of the central Pyrenees, and do not descend, like those of the Alps, far down into the valleys but rather have their greatest lengths along the direction of the mountain chain. They form, in fact, in a narrow zone near the crest of the highest mountains. Here, as in the other great mountain ranges of central Europe, there is substantial evidence of a much wider expanse of glaciation during the glacial periods. The best evidence of this is in the valley of Argeles Gazost, between Lourdes and Gavarnie, in the dpartement of Hautes-Pyrnes.\\r\\nThe annual snow-line varies in different parts of the Pyrenees from about 2,700 to 2,800 metres above sea level. In average the seasonal snow is observed at least 50% of the time above 1,600 metres between December and April.[14]\\r\\nA still more marked effect of the preponderance of rainfall in the western half of the chain is seen in the vegetation. The lower mountains in the extreme west are wooded, but the extent of forest declines as one moves eastwards. The eastern Pyrenees are peculiarly wild and barren, all the more since it is in this part of the chain that granitic masses prevail. Also moving from west to east, there is a change in the composition of the flora, with the change becoming most evident as one passes the centre of the mountain chain from which point the Corbires stretch north-eastwards towards the central plateau of France. Though the difference in latitude is only about 1, in the west the flora resembles that of central Europe while in the east it is distinctly Mediterranean in character. The Pyrenees are nearly as rich in endemic species as the Alps, and among the most remarkable instances of that endemism is the occurrence of the monotypic genus Xatardia (family Apiaceae), which grows only on a high alpine pass between the Val d'Eynes and Catalonia. Other examples include Arenaria montana, Bulbocodium vernum, and Ranunculus glacialis. The genus most abundantly represented in the range is that of the saxifrages, several species of which are endemic here.\\r\\nIn their fauna the Pyrenees present some striking instances of endemism. The Pyrenean desman is found only in some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains; the only other desmans are confined to the rivers of the Caucasus in southern Russia. The Pyrenean euprocte (Euproctus pyrenaicus), an endemic relative of the salamander, also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among other peculiarities of Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the caverns of Arige, the principal genera of which are Anophthalmus and Adelops.\\r\\nThe Pyrenean ibex mysteriously became extinct in January 2000; the native Pyrenean brown bear was hunted to near-extinction in the 1990s, but it was re-introduced in 1996 when three bears were brought from Slovenia. The bear population has bred successfully, and there are now believed to be about 15 brown bears in the central region around Fos, but only four native ones are still living in the Aspe Valley.\\r\\nPrincipal nature reserves and national parks:\\r\\nThe Pyrenean region possesses a varied ethnology, folklore and history: see Andorra; Aragon; Arige; Basque Country; Barn; Catalonia; Navarre; Roussillon. For their history, see also Almogavars, Marca Hispanica.\\r\\nThe principal languages spoken in the area are Spanish, French, Aragonese, Catalan (in Catalonia and Andorra), and Basque. Also spoken, to a lesser degree, are the Occitan language (the Gascon and Languedocien dialects in France and the Aranese dialect in the Aran Valley).\\r\\nAn important feature of rural life in the Pyrenees is 'transhumance', the moving of livestock from the farms in the valleys up to the higher grounds of the mountains for the summer.[15] In this way the farming communities could keep larger herds than the lowland farms could support on their own. The principal animals moved were cows and sheep, but historically most members of farming families also moved to the higher pastures along with their animals, so they also took with them pigs, horses[16] and chickens.[15] Transhumance thus took the form of a biannual mass annual migration, moving uphill in May or June[17] and returning to the farms in September or October. During the summer period, the families would live in basic stone cabins[15] in the high mountains. Nowadays, industrialisation and changing agriculture practices have diminished the custom. However, the importance of transhumance continues to be recognised through its celebration in popular festivals.[16][17][18]\\r\\nBoth sides of the Pyrenees are popular spots for winter sports such as alpine skiing and mountaineering. The Pyrenees are also a good place for athletes to do high-altitude training in the summertime, such as by bicycling and cross-country running.\\r\\nIn the summer and the autumn, the Pyrenees are usually featured in two of cycling's grand tours, the Tour de France held annually in July and the Vuelta a Espa?a held in September. The stages held in the Pyrenees are often crucial legs of both tours, drawing hundreds of thousands of spectators to the region.\\r\\nThree main long-distance footpaths run the length of the mountain range: the GR 10 across the northern slopes, the GR 11 across the southern slopes, and the HRP which traverses peaks and ridges along a high altitude route. In addition, there are numerous marked and unmarked trails throughout the region.\\r\\nPirena is a dog-mushing competition held in the Pyrenees.\\r\\nSki resorts in the Pyrenees include:\\r\\n?This article?incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:?Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

The sanctuary, which hosts two-thirds of the world's great one-horned rhinoceroses, is a World Heritage Site.[1] According to the census held in March 2018 which was jointly conducted by the Forest Department of the Government of Assam and some recognized wildlife NGOs, the rhino population in Kaziranga National Park is 2,413. It comprises 1,641 adult rhinos (642 males, 793 females, 206 unsexed); 387 sub-adults (116 males, 149 females, 122 unsexed);  and 385 calves.[2] In 2015, the rhino population stood at 2401. Kaziranga is home to the highest density of tigers among protected areas in the world, and was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006 (now the highest tiger density is in Orang National Park, Assam) . The park is home to large breeding populations of elephants, wild water buffalo, and swamp deer.[3] Kaziranga is recognized as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International for conservation of avifaunal species. When compared with other protected areas in India, Kaziranga has achieved notable success in wildlife conservation. Located on the edge of the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot, the park combines high species diversity and visibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaziranga is a vast expanse of tall elephant grass, marshland, and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests, criss-crossed by four major rivers, including the Brahmaputra, and the park includes numerous small bodies of water. Kaziranga has been the theme of several books, songs, and documentaries. The park celebrated its centennial in 2005 after its establishment in 1905 as a reserve forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of Kaziranga as a protected area can be traced back to 1904, when Mary Curzon, Baroness Curzon of Kedleston, the wife of the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon of Kedleston, visited the area.[citation needed] After failing to see a single rhinoceros, for which the area was renowned, she persuaded her husband to take urgent measures to protect the dwindling species which he did by initiating planning for their protection.[4] On 1 June 1905, the Kaziranga Proposed Reserve Forest was created with an area of 232?km2 (90?sq?mi).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next three years, the park area was extended by 152?km2 (59?sq?mi), to the banks of the Brahmaputra River.[6][not in citation given] In 1908, Kaziranga was designated a \\"Reserve Forest\\". In 1916, it was redesignated the \\"Kaziranga Game Sanctuary\\" and remained so till 1938, when hunting was prohibited and visitors were permitted to enter the park.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kaziranga Game Sanctuary was renamed the \\"Kaziranga Wildlife Sanctuary\\" in 1950 by P. D. Stracey, the forest conservationist, in order to rid the name of hunting connotations.[citation needed] In 1954, the government of Assam passed the Assam (Rhinoceros) Bill, which imposed heavy penalties for rhinoceros poaching.[citation needed] Fourteen years later, in 1968, the state government passed the Assam National Park Act of 1968, declaring Kaziranga a designated national park.[citation needed] The 430?km2 (166?sq?mi) park was given official status by the central government on 11 February 1974. In 1985, Kaziranga was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its unique natural environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaziranga has been the target of several natural and man-made calamities in recent decades. Floods caused by the overflow of the river Brahmaputra, leading to significant losses of animal life.[7] Encroachment by people along the periphery has also led to a diminished forest cover and a loss of habitat.[citation needed] An ongoing separatist movement in Assam led by the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) has crippled the economy of the region,[8] but Kaziranga has remained unaffected by the movement; indeed, instances of rebels from the United Liberation Front of Assam protecting the animals and, in extreme cases, killing poachers, have been reported since the 1980s.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the etymology of the name Kaziranga is not certain, there exist a number of possible explanations derived from local legends and records. According to one legend, a girl named Rawnga, from a nearby village, and a youth named Kazi, from Karbi Anglong, fell in love. This match was not acceptable to their families, and the couple disappeared into the forest, never to be seen again, and the forest was named after them.[citation needed] According to another legend, Srimanta Sankardeva, the sixteenth century Vaisnava saint-scholar, once blessed a childless couple, Kazi and Rangai, and asked them to dig a big pond in the region so that their name would live on.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nTestimony to the long history of the name can be found in some records, which state that once, while the Ahom king Pratap Singha was passing by the region during the seventeenth century, he was particularly impressed by the taste of fish, and on asking was told it came from Kaziranga.[10] Kaziranga also could mean the \\"Land of red goats (Deer)\\", as the word Kazi in the Karbi language means \\"goat\\", and Rangai means \\"red\\".[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome historians believe, however, that the name Kaziranga was derived from the Karbi word Kajir-a-rong, which means \\"the village of Kajir\\" (kajiror gaon). Among the Karbis, Kajir is a common name for a girl child,[citation needed] and it was believed that a woman named Kajir once ruled over the area. Fragments of monoliths associated with Karbi rule found scattered in the area seem to bear testimony to this assertion.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaziranga is located between latitudes 2630' N and 2645' N, and longitudes 9308' E to 9336' E within two districts in the Indian state of Assamthe Kaliabor subdivision of Nagaon district and the Bokakhat subdivision of Golaghat district.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park is approximately 40?km (25?mi) in length from east to west, and 13?km (8?mi) in breadth from north to south.[11] Kaziranga covers an area of 378?km2 (146?sq?mi), with approximately 51.14?km2 (20?sq?mi) lost to erosion in recent years.[11] A total addition of 429?km2 (166?sq?mi) along the present boundary of the park has been made and designated with separate national park status to provide extended habitat for increasing the population of wildlife or, as a corridor for safe movement of animals to Karbi Anglong Hills.[12] :p.06 Elevation ranges from 40?m (131?ft) to 80?m (262?ft).[citation needed] The park area is circumscribed by the Brahmaputra River, which forms the northern and eastern boundaries, and the Mora Diphlu, which forms the southern boundary. Other notable rivers within the park are the Diphlu and Mora Dhansiri.[13] :p.05\\r\\n\\r\\nKaziranga has flat expanses of fertile, alluvial soil, formed by erosion and silt deposition by the River Brahmaputra.[citation needed] The landscape consists of exposed sandbars, riverine flood-formed lakes known as, beels, (which make up 5% of the surface area),[citation needed] and elevated regions known as, chapories, which provide retreats and shelter for animals during floods. Many artificial chapories have been built with the help of the Indian Army to ensure the safety of the animals.[14][15] Kaziranga is one of the largest tracts of protected land in the sub-Himalayan belt, and due to the presence of highly diverse and visible species, has been described as a \\"biodiversity hotspot\\".[16] The park is located in the Indomalaya ecozone, and the dominant biomes of the region are Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests of the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome and a frequently flooded variant of the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands of the tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome. Kaziranga is also surrounded by lush green tea plantations, most of them contributing heavily to Assam's economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park experiences three seasons: summer, monsoon, and winter. The winter season, between November and February, is mild and dry, with a mean high of 25?C (77?F) and low of 5?C (41?F).[citation needed] During this season, beels and nullahs (water channels) dry up.[13]:p.06 The summer season between March and May is hot, with temperatures reaching a high of 37?C (99?F).[citation needed] During this season, animals usually are found near water bodies.[13]:p.06 The rainy monsoon season lasts from June to September, and is responsible for most of Kaziranga's annual rainfall of 2,220?mm (87?in).[citation needed] During the peak months of July and August, three-fourths of the western region of the park is submerged, due to the rising water level of the Brahmaputra. It was found that 70% of the National Park was flooded as on 3 August 2016. The flooding causes most animals to migrate to elevated and forested regions outside the southern border of the park, such as the Mikir hills. 540 animals, including 13 rhinos and mostly hog deers perished in unprecedented floods of 2012.[17]\\r\\n[18] However, occasional dry spells create problems as well, such as food shortages and occasional forest fires.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nKaziranga contains significant breeding populations of 35 mammalian species,[20] of which 15 are threatened as per the IUCN Red List.[citation needed] The park has the distinction of being home to the world's largest population of the Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros (1,855),[21][22] wild Asiatic water buffalo (1,666)[23] and eastern swamp deer (468).[24] Significant populations of large herbivores include elephants (1,940),[25] gaur (30) and sambar (58). Small herbivores include the Indian muntjac, wild boar, and hog deer.[18][26] Kaziranga has the largest population of the Wild water buffalo anywhere accounting for about 57% of the world population.[27] The One-Horned rhinoceros, Royal Bengal Tiger, Asian elephant, wild water buffalo and swamp deer are collectively known as 'Big Five' of Kaziranga.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaziranga is one of the few wild breeding areas outside Africa for multiple species of large cats, such as Bengal tigers and leopards.[20] Kaziranga was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006 and has the highest density of tigers in the world (one per five km2), with a population of 118, according to the latest census.[21] Other felids include the jungle cat, fishing cat, and leopard cat.[20] Small mammals include the rare hispid hare, Indian gray mongoose, small Indian mongooses, large Indian civet, small Indian civets, Bengal fox, golden jackal, sloth bear, Chinese pangolin, Indian pangolins, hog badger, Chinese ferret badgers, and particoloured flying squirrel.[18][20][citation needed] Nine of the 14 primate species found in India occur in the park.[4] Prominent among them are the Assamese macaque, capped and golden langur, as well as the only ape found in India, the hoolock gibbon.[18][20][citation needed] Kaziranga's rivers are also home to the endangered Ganges dolphin.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nKaziranga has been identified by Birdlife International as an Important Bird Area.[28] It is home to a variety of migratory birds, water birds, predators, scavengers, and game birds. Birds such as the lesser white-fronted goose, ferruginous duck, Baer's pochard duck and lesser adjutant, greater adjutant, black-necked stork, and Asian openbill stork migrate from Central Asia to the park during winter.[29] Riverine birds include the Blyth's kingfisher, white-bellied heron, Dalmatian pelican, spot-billed pelican, Nordmann's greenshank, and black-bellied tern.[29]:p.10 Birds of prey include the rare eastern imperial, greater spotted, white-tailed, Pallas's fish eagle, grey-headed fish eagle, and the lesser kestrel.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nKaziranga was once home to seven species of vultures, but the vulture population reached near extinction, supposedly by feeding on animal carcasses containing the drug Diclofenac.[31] Only the Indian vulture, slender-billed vulture, and Indian white-rumped vulture have survived.[31] Game birds include the swamp francolin, Bengal florican, and pale-capped pigeon.[29]:p.03\\r\\n\\r\\nOther families of birds inhabiting Kaziranga include the great Indian hornbill and wreathed hornbill, Old World babblers such as Jerdons and marsh babblers, weaver birds such as the common baya weaver, threatened Finn's weavers, thrushes such as Hodgson's bushchat and Old World warblers such as the bristled grassbird. Other threatened species include the black-breasted parrotbill and the rufous-vented grass babbler.[29]:p.07ÿ13\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo of the largest snakes in the world, the reticulated python and rock python, as well as the longest venomous snake in the world, the king cobra, inhabit the park. Other snakes found here include the Indian cobra, monocled cobra, Russell's viper, and the common krait.[20]\\r\\nMonitor lizard species found in the park include the Bengal monitor and the Asian water monitor.[20] Other reptiles include fifteen species of turtle, such as the endemic Assam roofed turtle and one species of tortoise, the brown tortoise.[20] 42 species of fish are found in the area, including the Tetraodon.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour main types of vegetation exist in this park.[32] These are alluvial inundated grasslands, alluvial savanna woodlands, tropical moist mixed deciduous forests, and tropical semi-evergreen forests. Based on Landsat data for 1986, percent coverage by vegetation is: tall grasses 41%, short grasses 11%, open jungle 29%, swamps 4%, rivers and water bodies 8%, and sand 6%.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a difference in altitude between the eastern and western areas of the park, with the western side being at a lower altitude. The western reaches of the park are dominated by grasslands. Tall elephant grass is found on higher ground, while short grasses cover the lower grounds surrounding the beels or flood-created ponds.[citation needed] Annual flooding, grazing by herbivores, and controlled burning maintain and fertilize the grasslands and reeds. Common tall grasses are sugarcanes, spear grass, elephant grass, and the common reed. Numerous forbs are present along with the grasses. Amidst the grasses, providing cover and shade are scattered treesdominant species including kumbhi, Indian gooseberry, the cotton tree (in savanna woodlands), and elephant apple (in inundated grasslands).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThick evergreen forests, near the Kanchanjhuri, Panbari, and Tamulipathar blocks, contain trees such as Aphanamixis polystachya, Talauma hodgsonii, Dillenia indica, Garcinia tinctoria, Ficus rumphii, Cinnamomum bejolghota, and species of Syzygium. Tropical semi-evergreen forests are present near Baguri, Bimali, and Haldibari. Common trees and shrubs are Albizia procera, Duabanga grandiflora, Lagerstroemia speciosa, Crateva unilocularis, Sterculia urens, Grewia serrulata, Mallotus philippensis, Bridelia retusa, Aphania rubra, Leea indica, and Leea umbraculifera.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many different aquatic floras in the lakes and ponds, and along the river shores. The invasive water hyacinth is very common, often choking the water bodies, but it is cleared during destructive floods.[35] Another invasive species, Mimosa invisa, which is toxic to herbivores, was cleared by Kaziranga staff with help from the Wildlife Trust of India in 2005.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wildlife wing of the forest department of the Government of Assam, headquartered at Bokakhat, is responsible for the administration and management of Kaziranga.[13]:p.05 The administrative head of the park is the Director, who is a Chief Conservator of Forests-level officer. A divisional Forest Officer is the administrative chief executive of the park. He is assisted by two officers with the rank of Assistant Conservator of Forests. The park area is divided into five ranges, overseen by Range Forest Officers.[13]:p.11 The five ranges are the Burapahar (HQ: Ghorakati), Western (HQ: Baguri), Central (HQ: Kohora), Eastern (HQ: Agaratoli) and Northern (HQ: Biswanath).

Various laws, which range in dates from the Assam Forest Regulation of 1891 and the Biodiversity Conservation Act of 2002 have been enacted for protection of wildlife in the park.[15]:p.01 Poaching activities, particularly of the rhinoceroses for its horn, has been a major concern for the authorities. Between 1980 and 2005, 567 rhinoceroses were hunted by poachers.[13]:p.10 Following a decreasing trend for the past few years, 18 one-horned rhinoceroses were killed by poachers in 2007.[37] Reports have suggested that there are links between these poaching activities and funding of terrorist organizations.[38][39] But these could not be substantiated in later years.\\r\\nPreventive measures such as construction of anti-poaching camps and maintenance of existing ones, patrolling, intelligence gathering, and control over the use of firearms around the park have reduced the number of casualties.[40][41] Since 2013, the park used cameras on drones which are monitored by security guards to protect the rhino from armed poachers.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nPerennial flooding and heavy rains have resulted in death of wild animals and damage to the conservation infrastructures.[12] To escape the water-logged areas, many animals migrate to elevated regions outside the park boundaries where they are susceptible to hunting, hit by speeding vehicles, or subject to reprisals by villagers for damaging their crops.[citation needed] To mitigate the losses, the authorities have increased patrols, purchased additional speedboats for patrol, and created artificial highlands for shelter.[citation needed] Several corridors have been set up for the safe passage of animals across National Highwayÿ37 which skirts around the southern boundary of the park.[43] To prevent the spread of diseases and to maintain the genetic distinctness of the wild species, systematic steps such as immunization of livestock in surrounding villages and fencing of sensitive areas of the park, which are susceptible to encroachment by local cattle, are undertaken periodically.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWater pollution due to run-off from pesticides from tea gardens, and run-off from a petroleum refinery at Numaligarh, pose a hazard to the ecology of the region.[13]:p.24 Invasive species such as Mimosa and wild rose have posed a threat to the native plants in the region. To control the growth and irradiation of invasive species, research on biological methods for controlling weeds, manual uprooting and weeding before seed settling are carried out at regular intervals.[citation needed] Grassland management techniques, such as controlled burning, are effected annually to avoid forest fires.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nObserving the wildlife, including birding, is the main visitor activity in and around the park. Guided tours by elephant or Jeep are available. Hiking is prohibited in the park to avoid potential human-animal conflicts. Observation towers are situated at Sohola, Mihimukh, Kathpara, Foliamari, and Harmoti for wildlife viewing. The Lower Himalayan peaks frame the park's landscape of trees and grass interspersed with numerous ponds. An interpretation centre is being set up at the Bagori range of Kaziranga, to help visitors learn more about the park.[44] The park remains closed for visitors from 1 May to end-October due to monsoon rains. Four tourist lodges at Kohora and three tourist lodges outside the park are maintained by the Department of Environment and Forests, Government of Assam. Private resorts are available outside the park borders.[12]:p.19 Increase in tourist inflow has led to the economic empowerment of the people living at the fringes of the park, by means of tourism related activities, encouraging a recognition of the value of its protection.[10]:pp.16ÿ17 A survey of tourists notes that 80 percent found rhino sightings most enjoyable and that foreign tourists were more likely to support park protection and employment opportunities financially, while local tourists favored support for veterinary services.[45] Recently set up Kaziranga National Orchid and Biodiversity Park established at Durgapur village is a latest attraction to the tourists. It houses more than 500 species of orchids, 132 varieties of sour fruits and leafy vegetables, 12 species of cane, 46 species of bamboo and a large varieties of local fishes.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthorised guides of the forest department accompany all travelers inside the park. Mahout-guided elephant rides and Jeep or other 4WD vehicles rides are booked in advance. Starting from the Park Administrative Centre at Kohora, these rides can follow the three motorable trails under the jurisdiction of three rangesKohora, Bagori, and Agaratoli. These trails are open for light vehicles from November to end Apr. Visitors are allowed to take their own vehicles when accompanied by guides.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBuses owned by Assam State Transport Corporation and private agencies between Guwahati, Tezpur, and Upper Assam stop at the main gate of Kaziranga on NH 37 at Kohora.[47] The nearest town is Bokakhat, Golaghat situated at 23?km and 65?km away. Major cities near the park are Guwahati, Dimapur and Jorhat . Furkating 75 kilometres (47?mi), which is under the supervision of Northeast Frontier Railway, is the nearest railway station.[citation needed] Jorhat Airport at Rowriah (97 kilometres (60?mi) away), Tezpur Airport at Salonibari (approx 100 kilometres (62?mi) away), Dimapur Airport 172 kilometres (107?mi) and Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport in Guwahati (approximately 217 kilometres (135?mi) away) are the nearby airports.[citation needed]. Transportation is also available from Guwahati to Kaziranga National Park and other places in Assam and Nagaland.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaziranga has been the theme of, or has been mentioned in, several books, songs, and documentaries. The park first gained international prominence after Robin Banerjee, a physician-turned-photographer and filmmaker, produced a documentary titled Kaziranga, which was aired on television in Berlin in 1961 and became a runaway success.[48][49][50] American science fiction and fantasy author, L. Sprague de Camp wrote about the park in his poem, \\"Kaziranga, Assam\\".

Admiral ranks above vice admiral and below fleet admiral in the Navy; the Coast Guard and the Public Health Service do not have an established grade above admiral. Admiral is equivalent to the rank of general in the other uniformed services. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps has never had an officer hold the grade of admiral. However, 37 U.S.C.??201 of the U.S. Code established the grade for the NOAA Corps, in case a position is created that merits the four-star grade.\\r\\nSince the five-star grade of fleet admiral has not been used since 1946, the grade of admiral is effectively the highest appointment an officer can achieve in the United States Navy, the United States Coast Guard, and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Navy did not have any admirals until 1862, because many people felt the title too reminiscent of royaltysuch as the British Royal Navyto be used in the country's navy.[1] Others saw the need for ranks above captain, among them John Paul Jones, who pointed out that the Navy had to have officers who \\"ranked\\" with army generals.[1] He also felt there must be ranks above captain to avoid disputes among senior captains.[1] The various secretaries of the navy repeatedly recommended to Congress that admiral ranks be created because the other navies of the world used them and American senior officers were \\"often subjected to serious difficulties and embarrassments in the interchange of civilities with those of other nations.\\"[1] Congress finally authorized nine rear admirals on July 16, 1862, although that was probably more for the needs of the rapidly expanding navy during the American Civil War than any international considerations.[1] Two years later Congress authorized the appointment of a vice admiral from among the nine rear admirals: David Farragut.[1] Another bill allowed the President of the United States to appoint Farragut to admiral on July 25, 1866, and David Dixon Porter to vice admiral.[1] When Farragut died in 1870, Porter became admiral and Stephen C. Rowan was promoted to vice admiral.[1] Even after they died, Congress did not allow the promotion of any of the rear admirals to succeed them, so there were no more admirals or vice admirals by promotion until 1915 when Congress authorized an admiral and a vice admiral each for the Atlantic, Pacific and Asiatic Fleets.[1]\\r\\nThere was one admiral in the interim, however. In 1899, Congress recognized George Dewey's accomplishments during the SpanishÿAmerican War by authorizing the President to appoint him Admiral of the Navy.[1] He held that rank until he died in 1917. Nobody has since held that title. In 1944, Congress approved the five-star grade of fleet admiral.[1] The first to hold it were William D. Leahy, Ernest J. King, and Chester W. Nimitz.[1] The Senate confirmed their appointments December 15, 1944.[1] Fleet Admiral William F. Halsey got his fifth star in December 1945. None have been appointed since.\\r\\nThe sleeve stripes now used by admirals and vice admirals in the United States date from March 11, 1869, when General Order Number 90 specified that for their \\"undress\\" uniforms admirals would wear a two-inch stripe with three half-inch stripes above it and vice admirals the two-inch stripe with two half-inch stripes above it.[1] The rear admiral got his two-inch stripe and one half-inch stripe in 1866.[1]\\r\\nThe sleeve stripes had been more elaborate. When the rear admiral rank started in 1862 the sleeve arrangement was three stripes of three-quarter-inch lace alternating with three stripes of quarter-inch lace.[1] It was some ten inches from top to bottom.[1] The vice admiral, of course, had even more stripes and when Farragut became admiral in 1866, he had so many stripes they reached from his cuffs almost to his elbow.[1] On their dress uniforms the admirals wore bands of gold embroidery of live oak leaves and acorns.[1]\\r\\nThe admirals of the 1860s wore the same number of stars on their shoulders as admirals of corresponding grades do today.[1] In 1899, the navy's one admiral (Dewey) and 18 rear admirals put on the new shoulder marks, as did the other officers when wearing their white uniforms, but kept their stars instead of repeating the sleeve cuff stripes.[1]\\r\\nDuring the 20th century, the ranks of the modern U.S. admiralty were firmly established. An oddity that did exist was that the navy did not have a one-star rank except briefly during World War II when Congress established a temporary war rank of commodore. The one-star rank was later established permanently in 1986.\\r\\nU.S. law limits the number of four-star admirals that may be on active duty at any time. The total number of active-duty flag officers is capped at 160 for the Navy.[2] For the Army, Navy, and Air Force, no more than about 25% of the service's active-duty general or flag officers may have more than two stars,[3] and statute sets the total number of four-star officers allowed in each service.[3] This is set at 6 four-star Navy admirals.[3]\\r\\nSome of these slots are reserved by statute. For the Navy, the chief of naval operations, vice chief of naval operations; for the Coast Guard the commandant of the coast guard [4] and vice commandant of the coast guard are admirals; for the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, the Assistant Secretary for Health [5] is an admiral if he or she holds an appointment to the regular corps.\\r\\nThere are several exceptions to these limits allowing more than allotted within the statute. A Navy admiral serving as Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff does not count against the Navy's flag-officer cap. A Navy admiral serving in one of several joint positions does not count against his or her service's four-star limit; these positions include the commander of a unified combatant command, the commander of U.S. Forces Korea, and the deputy commander of U.S. European Command but only if the commander of that command is also the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe.[6] Officers serving in certain intelligence positions are not counted against either limit, including the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[7] The President may also add admirals to the Navy if they are offset by removing an equivalent number of four-stars from other services.[3] Finally, all statutory limits may be waived at the President's discretion during time of war or national emergency.[8]\\r\\nFour-star grades go hand-in-hand with the positions of office they are linked to, so these ranks are temporary. Officers may only achieve four-star grade if they are appointed to positions that require the officer to hold such a rank.[9] Their rank expires with the expiration of their term of office, which is usually set by statute.[9] Admirals are nominated for appointment by the President from any eligible officers holding the rank of rear admiral (lower half) or above, who also meets the requirements for the position, under the advice and/or suggestion of their respective department secretary, service secretary, and if applicable the joint chiefs.[9] For some specific positions, statute allows the President to waive those requirements for a nominee whom he deems would serve national interests.[10] The nominee must be confirmed via majority vote by the Senate before the appointee can take office and thus assume the rank.[9] The standard tour length for most four-star positions is three years, bundled as a two-year term plus a one-year extension, with the following exceptions:\\r\\nExtensions of the standard tour length can be approved, within statutory limits, by their respective service secretaries, the secretary of defense, the President, and/or Congress but these are rare, as they block other officers from being promoted. Some statutory limits under the U.S. Code can be waived in times of national emergency or war. Admiral ranks may also be given by act of Congress but this is extremely rare.[citation needed]\\r\\nOther than voluntary retirement, statute sets a number of mandates for retirement. Four-star officers must retire after 40 years of service unless reappointed to grade to serve longer.[11] Otherwise all flag officers must retire the month after their 64th birthday.[12] However, the secretary of defense can defer a four-star officer's retirement until the officer's 66th birthday [12] and the President can defer it until the officer's 68th birthday.[12]\\r\\nFlag officers typically retire well in advance of the statutory age and service limits, so as not to impede the upward career mobility of their juniors.[citation needed] Since there are a limited number of four-star slots available to each service, typically one officer must leave office before another can be promoted.[13] Maintaining a four-star rank is a game of musical chairs; once an officer vacates a position bearing that rank, he or she has no more than 60 days to be appointed or reappointed to a position of equal importance before he or she must involuntarily retire.[9] Historically, officers leaving four-star positions were allowed to revert to their permanent two-star ranks to mark time in lesser jobs until statutory retirement, but now such officers are expected to retire immediately to avoid obstructing the promotion flow.\\r\\nU.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, USPHSCC, NOAACOC insignia\\r\\nA U.S. Coast Guard admiral's flag (unrestricted line officer)\\r\\nThe stars, shoulder boards, and sleeve stripes of a U.S. Coast Guard admiral\\r\\nThe stars, shoulder boards, and sleeve stripes of a U.S. Public Health Service admiral","input":"How many admirals does the us navy have?"},{"output":"December 4, 1967","context":"SCLC members\\r\\nThe Poor People's Campaign, or Poor People's March on Washington, was a 1968 effort to gain economic justice for poor people in the United States. It was organized by Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and carried out under the leadership of Ralph Abernathy in the wake of King's assassination.\\r\\nThe campaign demanded economic and human rights for poor Americans of diverse backgrounds. After presenting an organized set of demands to Congress and executive agencies, participants set up a 3,000-person protest camp on the Washington Mall, where they stayed for six weeks in the spring of 1968.\\r\\nThe Poor Peoples Campaign was motivated by a desire for economic justice: the idea that all people should have what they need to live. King and the SCLC shifted their focus to these issues after observing that gains in civil rights had not improved the material conditions of life for many African Americans. The Poor Peoples Campaign was a multiracial effortincluding African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Native Americansaimed at alleviating poverty regardless of race.[1][2]\\r\\nAccording to political historians such as Barbara Cruikshank, \\"the poor\\" did not particularly conceive of themselves as a unified group until President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty (declared in 1964) identified them as such.[3] Figures from the 1960 census, Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Commerce Department, and the Federal Reserve estimated anywhere from 40 to 60 million Americansor 22 to 33 percentlived below the poverty line. At the same time, the nature of poverty itself was changing as America's population increasingly lived in cities, not farms (and could not grow its own food).[4] Poor African-Americans, particularly women, suffered from racism and sexism that amplified the impact of poverty, especially after \\"welfare mothers\\" became a nationally recognized concept.[5]\\r\\nBy 1968, the War on Poverty seemed like a failure, neglected by a Johnson administration (and Congress) that wanted to focus on the Vietnam War and increasingly saw anti-poverty programs as primarily helping African-Americans.[6] The Poor Peoples Campaign sought to address poverty through income and housing. The campaign would help the poor by dramatizing their needs, uniting all races under the commonality of hardship and presenting a plan to start to a solution.[7] Under the \\"economic bill of rights,\\" the Poor People's Campaign asked for the federal government to prioritize helping the poor with a $30?billion anti-poverty package that included, among other demands, a commitment to full employment, a guaranteed annual income measure and more low-income housing.[8] The Poor Peoples Campaign was part of the second phase of the civil rights movement. King said, \\"We believe the highest patriotism demands the ending of the war and the opening of a bloodless war to final victory over racism and poverty\\".[9]\\r\\nKing wanted to bring poor people to Washington D.C., forcing politicians to see them and think about their needs: \\"We ought to come in mule carts, in old trucks, any kind of transportation people can get their hands on. People ought to come to Washington, sit down if necessary in the middle of the street and say, 'We are here; we are poor; we don't have any money; you have made us this way...and we've come to stay until you do something about it.'\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Poor Peoples Campaign had complex origins. King considered bringing poor people to the nation's capital since at least October 1966, when welfare rights activists held a one-day march on the Mall.[11] In May 1967 during a SCLC retreat in Frogmore, South Carolina, King told his aides that the SCLC would have to raise nonviolence to a new level to pressure Congress into passing an Economic Bill of Rights for the nations poor. The SCLC resolved to expand its civil rights struggle to include demands for economic justice and to challenge the Vietnam War.[12] In his concluding address to the conference, King announced a shift from \\"reform\\" to \\"revolution\\" and stated: \\"We have moved from the era of civil rights to an era of human rights.\\"[13]\\r\\nIn response to the anger that led to riots in Newark (July 12ÿ17, 1967) and Detroit (July 23ÿ27, 1967), King and his close confidante, Stanley Levison, wrote a report in August (titled \\"The Crisis in America's Cities\\") which called for disciplined urban disruption, particularly in Washington:[14][15]\\r\\nTo dislocate the functioning of a city without destroying it can be more effective than a riot because it can be longer-lasting, costly to society but not wantonly destructive. Moreover, it is more difficult for government to quell it by superior force. Mass civil disobedience can use rage as a constructive and creative force. It is purposeless to tell Negroes they should not be enraged when they should be. Indeed, they will be mentally healthier if they do not suppress rage but vent it constructively and use its energy peacefully but forcefully to cripple the operations of an oppressive society. Civil disobedience can utilize the militancy wasted in riots to seize clothes or groceries many did not even want.\\r\\nCivil disobedience has never been used on a mass scale in the North. It has rarely been seriously organized and resolutely pursued. Too often in the past was it employed incorrectly. It was resorted to only when there was an absence of mass support and its purpose was headline-hunting. The exceptions were the massive school boycotts by Northern Negroes. They shook educational systems to their roots but they lasted only single days and were never repeated. If they are developed as weekly events at the same time that mass sit-ins are developed inside and at the gates of factories for jobs, and if simultaneously thousands of unemployed youth camp in Washington, as the Bonus Marchers did in the thirties, with these and other practices, without burning a match or firing a gun, the impact of the movement will have earthquake proportions. (In the Bonus Marches, it was the government that burned down the marchers' shelters when it became confounded by peaceful civil disobedience.)\\r\\nAlso in August, Senator Robert F. Kennedy asked Marian Wright Edelman \\"to tell Dr. King to bring the poor people to Washington to make hunger and poverty visible since the countrys attention had turned to the Vietnam War and put poverty and hunger on the back burner.\\"[17] At another SCLC retreat in September, Edelman transmitted Kennedy's message to King and suggested that King and a handful of poor people hold a sit-in at the Department of Agriculture. Stanley Levison proposed an even more ambitious crusade that modeled itself on the Bonus Army of 1932.[11]\\r\\nThe SCLCs major planning before announcing the campaign took place during a five-day meeting (November 27ÿDecember 1, 1967) in Frogmore, SC. With Kings leadership, the group agreed to organize a civil disobedience campaign in Washington, D.C., focused on jobs and income. King wanted the demonstration to be nonviolent, but militant, and as dramatic, as dislocative, as disruptive, as attention-getting as the riots without destroying property.[18]\\r\\nNot all members of the SCLC agreed with the idea of occupying Washington. Bayard Rustin opposed civil disobedience. Other members of the group (like Jesse Jackson) wanted to pursue other priorities.[19] Dissent continued throughout the planning of the campaign.\\r\\nKing traveled to Washington in February 1968 in order to meet with local activists and prepare the resources necessary to support the campaign.[20]\\r\\nMarchers were scheduled to arrive in Washington on May 2.[21] Some planners wanted to target specific politicians; others wanted to avoid \\"begging\\" and focus on movement-building and mutual education.[22]\\r\\nThe SCLC announced the campaign on December 4, 1967. King delivered a speech which identified \\"a kind of social insanity which could lead to national ruin.\\"[23] In January 1968, the SCLC created and distributed an \\"Economic Fact Sheet\\" with statistics explaining why the campaign was necessary.[24] King avoided providing specific details about the campaign and attempted to redirect media attention to the values at stake.[25] The Poor Peoples Campaign held firm to the movements commitment to non-violence. We are custodians of the philosophy of non-violence, said King at a press conference. And it has worked.[9] King originally wanted the Poor People's Campaign to start in Quitman County, Mississippi because of the intense and visible economic disparity there.[26]\\r\\nIn February 1968, King announced specific demands: $30 billion for antipoverty, full employment, guaranteed income, and the annual construction of 500,000 affordable residences.[10]\\r\\nKing toured a number of cities to raise support for the campaign. On March 18, 1968, King visited the town of Marks, Mississippi. He watched a teacher feeding schoolchildren their lunch, consisting only of a slice of apple and some crackers, and was moved to tears. King's visits were carefully orchestrated and the media tightly controlled; meetings with militant Black leaders were held behind closed doors.[27]\\r\\nThe media often discouraged those within the movement who were committed to non-violence. Instead of focusing on issues of urban inequality and the interracial efforts concerted to address them, the media concentrated on specific incidences of violence, leadership conflicts and protest tactics.[28]\\r\\nThe SCLC recruited marshals, who came to a training workshop in Atlanta in March then returned home to recruit participants, raise funds, and solicit organizational support.[21] Participants were required to sign an agreement to use non-violence and to obey the marshals.[32]\\r\\nReactions to the campaign were mixed, and some were outright hostile based on their perceptions of King and the SCLC.[33] Leaders and recruiters had to construct their images carefully in order to appeal to potential marchers across lines of wealth and denominationthey de-emphasized their middle-class status, wearing denim instead of suits.[34] They faced the delicate challenge of simultaneously appealing to radicals and moderates (including campus liberals).[35]\\r\\nCampaign leaders recruited across the country, first in the East and South, and then increasingly westward, reaching poor people in Texas and the Southwest, as well as California and the West Coast. People of all walks of life came from across the nation. Many volunteers were women and many had been involved in other civil rights protests.[36] People commenting on their reasons for participation explained that they wanted to participate in the decisions that affected their lives, and to explain how federal programs, intended to help them, sometimes left them behind completely.[37] They stressed that they were deprived of their basic human rights, and they wanted to make their situations known in the nation's capital.[38] Most did not own their homes or have basic utilities where they lived.[39] Many did not receive federal benefits of any sort.[40]\\r\\nIn one of the campaign's more important recruitment efforts, SCLC hosted about 80 representatives of other poor, often minority groups in Atlanta, with whom the civil rights organization had had little to no relationship up to that point. On March 14, 1968, delegates attended the so-called \\"Minority Group Conference\\" and discussed the upcoming campaign and whether or not their specific issues would be considered. Among the delegates were Chicano Movement leaders Reies Tijerina, Corky Gonzales, Jose Angel Gutierrez, and Bert Corona; white coal miners from Kentucky and West Virginia; Native American and Puerto Rican activists; and Myles Horton, organizer and founder of the Highlander Folk School. With a skeptical and fast-weakened Cesar Chavez occupied by a farm workers' hunger strike, Reies Tijerina was the most prominent Chicano leader present. At the end of a long day, most delegates decided to participate in the campaign, convinced that specific demands that often revolved around land and treaty rights would be honored by campaign organizers.[41]\\r\\nThe National Welfare Rights Organization and the American Friends Service Committee were key partners in the campaign's organizing, including developing demands, fundraising, and recruitment.[42]\\r\\nThe American Federation of Teachers promised to set up \\"freedom schools\\" for children in the camps; the National Association of Social Workers also said it would help with child care.[43] The Youth International Party held its own rallies in support.[44] The campaign received an endorsement from the YMCA.[45]\\r\\nVolunteer advocates from the Peace Corps and VISTA formed a speakers bureau, which helped publicize the campaign and educate outsiders.[46]\\r\\nOrganizers already in D.C. were enthusiastic about the campaign, and by March 1968 over 75 people were meeting in committees to prepare for the incoming marchers.[47] The campaign was endorsed by a variety of local organizations, especially religious congregations.[48]\\r\\nThe campaign received a limited endorsement and financial support from SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. SNCC (soon to change its name to the Student National Coordinating Committee) announced that it would not march with the Poor People's Campaign in D.C. because it did not believe in strict adherence to nonviolence.[49] SCLC also reported receiving major financial support for the march from middle-class whites.[50] The Steering Committee Against Repression (SCAR)which included members from SNCC as well as from a variety of other groupsalso gave a partial endorsement, urging the SCLC to focus the campaign on state repression, surveillance, persecution, and political prisoners.[51]\\r\\nThe campaign had support from within the organized labor movement, including endorsements by The Daily Worker, United Steelworkers, and Walter Reuther. However, the official leadership of the AFLÿCIOparticularly President George Meanywould not endorse the campaign because of disagreement over the Vietnam War.[52]\\r\\nThe prospect of an occupation of Washington by thousands of poor people triggered fears of rioting.[53]\\r\\nThe Johnson administration prepared for the campaign as though it might attempt a violent takeover of the nations capital.[54]\\r\\nSome members of Congress were outspoken about their fear of the campaign. Democratic Senator Russell B. Long called for the censure of congresspeople whom he accused of \\"bending the knee\\" to the campaign, also saying: \\"When that bunch of marchers comes here, they can just burn the whole place down and we can just move the capital to some place where they enforce the law.\\"[55] Another Democratic Senator, John L. McClellan, accused the SCLC of attempting to start a riot, and decried a recent court decision that he said would allow marchers to go to Washington one night and get on welfare the next day, rendering D.C. a Mecca for migrants.[56]\\r\\nRichard Nixon, campaigning for the 1968 presidential election, asked Congress not to capitulate to the campaigners demands.[57]\\r\\n20,000 army soldiers were activated and prepared for a military occupation of the capital should the Poor Peoples Campaign pose a threat.[58]\\r\\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) strove to monitor and disrupt the campaign, which it code-named POCAM.[59] The FBI, which had been targeting King since 1962 with COINTELPRO, increased its efforts after Kings April 4, 1967 speech titled Beyond Vietnam. It also lobbied government officials to oppose King on the grounds that he was a communist, an instrument in the hands of subversive forces seeking to undermine the nation, and affiliated with two of the most dedicated and dangerous communists in the country (Stanley Levison and Harry Wachtel).[60] After Beyond Vietnam these efforts were reportedly successful in turning lawmakers and administration officials against King, the SCLC, and the cause of civil rights.[61] After King was assassinated and the marches got underway, reports began to emphasize the threat of black militancy instead of communism.[62]\\r\\nOperation POCAM became the first major project of the FBIs Ghetto Informant Program (GIP), which recruited thousands of people to report on poor black communities.[63] Through GIP, the FBI quickly established files on SCLC recruiters in cities across the US.[64] FBI agents posed as journalists, used wiretaps, and even recruited some of the recruiters as informants.[65]\\r\\nThe FBI sought to disrupt the campaign by spreading rumors that it was bankrupt, that it would not be safe, and that participants would lose welfare benefits upon returning home.[66] Local bureaus reported particular success for intimidation campaigns in Birmingham, Alabama, Savannah, Georgia, and Cleveland, Ohio.[67] In Richmond, Virginia, the FBI collaborated with the John Birch Society to set up an organization called Truth About Civil Turmoil (TACT). TACT held events featuring a Black woman named Julia Brown who claimed to have infiltrated the civil rights movement and exposed its Communist leadership.[68]\\r\\nIn FebruaryÿMarch 1968, King directed his attention to the Memphis Sanitation Strike. Although King continued to tour to raise support for the marches to Washington, he declared the Memphis strike to be a major part of the campaign itself.\\r\\nOn March 28, unusual violent incidents in Memphis brought negative media scrutiny to the Poor People's Campaign.[69] The FBI released negative editorials for newspaper publication, implying that the Memphis outbursts foreshadowed mass violence by the Poor People's Campaign in Washington.[70] The SCLC released counter-editorials which included the statement, \\"The issue at stake is not violence vs. nonviolence but POVERTY AND RACISM\\".[71]\\r\\nKing flew back to Memphis on April 3 and was murdered in the evening on April 4. The assassination of King dealt a major blow to the campaign, leading to greater emphasis on affirmative action than on race-blind policies such as King's recommendation of basic income in his last book.\\r\\nAt King's funeral on April 9, 1968, tens of thousands[72] marched through Atlanta with Coretta Scott Kingfollowing King's casket on a mule-drawn wagon.[73]\\r\\nThe SCLC, now led by Ralph Abernathy, held a retreat in Atlanta on April 16ÿ17. They resolved to proceed with the campaign after learning that the Memphis strike had ended in relative success.[74] The SCLC applied for a permit to camp on the Washington Mall and reoriented the campaign away from civil disobedience and towards the creation and maintenance of a tent city.[75]\\r\\nThe April 16 edition Look magazine carried a posthumous article from King titled \\"Showdown for Nonviolence\\"his last statement on the Poor People's Campaign.[76] The article warns of imminent social collapse and suggests that the campaign presents government with what may be its last opportunity to achieve peaceful changethrough an Economic Bill of Rights.\\r\\nThe Committee of 100 was a group formed to lobby for the Poor People's Campaign in advance of the arrival of thousands for Resurrection City. On April 29, 1968 the Committee began lobbying members of Congress and leaders of executive agencies. The group, a diverse coalition of different people from around the country, acted as a formal lobby that delivered organized presentations of the campaign's demands.[77] Tijerina was arrested in New Mexico (on charges that had earlier been dismissed) hours before he was scheduled to leave for Washington to join the lobby. His arrest was interpreted as an intentional effort to thwart the campaign.[78] SCLC leaders including Abernathy, Young, and Lafayette were present and led delegations. Poor people from around the country made up most of the group. Many officials perceived even this group as threatening.[79]\\r\\nThe Committee demanded an Economic Bill of Rights with five planks:[80]\\r\\nAbernathy defended these demands by highlighting the use of slave labor in the production of America's capital and arguing that historically oppressed populations did not have the same opportunities as whites who already controlled economic and political resources. Regarding the last point, Abernathy also made specific call for collective bargaining, invoking King's recent involvement with the Memphis strike.[78]\\r\\nThe Committee visited several executive agencies to raise awareness and make demands:[81]\\r\\nThe Committee of 100 also lobbied the Senate Committee on Manpower, Employment, and Poverty, which had more direct power to act and appropriate funds. The Senate Committee created a new ad hoc poverty committee that met during the Poor People's Campaign occupation.[95]\\r\\nMedia reports were mixed on the Committee of 100. Many delegates received the opportunity to tell their stories for the first time, publicly challenging those in power (who typically enjoyed automatic access to the media). Congress's reaction, as quoted in the media, was hostile. Appropriations chair George H. Mahon suggested that the Committee would be mostly ignored because Congress could not \\"legislate under threats of violence.[96]\\r\\nOn June 5, activist Bayard Rustin had drafted an \\"Economic Bill of Rights,\\" which he published in the New York Times with more specific aims intended to convince the middle class and labor groups to support the action.[97] Rustin suggested that the federal government should:[97]\\r\\nOn Sunday May 12, 1968, demonstrators led by Coretta Scott King began a two-week protest in Washington, D.C., demanding an Economic Bill of Rights.[98] May 12 was Mothers Day, and five thousand people marched to protest 1967 cuts to Head Start, as well as Senator Longs description of mothers on welfare as brood mares and other elements of mounting racist stigmatization.[99][100]\\r\\nThroughout May, nine major caravans of poor people gathered and prepared to converge on Washington.[101] One caravan originated at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. Others originated in Los Angeles, Seattle, and San Francisco. Most media attention was focused on Mule Train, which departed on May 13 (the last to leave) from Marks, Mississippi.[102][103][104]\\r\\nMarshals for many of the caravans were militant young Black men, often affiliated with radical groups like the Memphis Invaders, who had been connected to the outburst of violence in March.[105]\\r\\nThe FBI gathered copious information (including photographs) about each caravan, concerning participants, route, finances, and supplies.[106] The marchers received assistance from the Department of Justices Community Relations Service Division, newly led by Roger Wilkins, which negotiated with local governments to help Campaign proceed smoothly.[107]\\r\\nThe only incident of police brutality on the march came at Detroits Cobo Center, where police surrounded a stalled van, provoking a standoff that eventually led to marchers being clubbed and stomped by mounted police.[108]\\r\\nOn Tuesday, May 21, 1968, thousands of poor people set up a shantytown known as Resurrection City, which existed for six weeks.[52][109] The city had its own zip code, 20013.[110]\\r\\nThe City initially scrambled to build shelters and meet basic needs of its initial 3000 residents. Many people volunteered to help construct shelters for the campaign's Building and Structures Committee, chaired by University of Maryland architect John Wiebenson.[111] The group struggled in choosing a name and a location for the demonstration, and did not decide on \\"Resurrection City\\" and the National Mall until two days before the arrival of marchers.[112] In exchange for a permit to camp on the most famous strip of grass in the United States, the campaign agreed to limit the city to 3000 people and 36 days.[113]\\r\\nThe group was, of course, poor to begin with, and had now gambled on survival in a strange environment. The Baltimore Afro-American reported that the camp, receiving a flood of donations and volunteers, had reached a sort of equilibrium by Friday (May 24) of that week. It also reported the appearance of celebrity visitors, including D.C. Mayor Walter Washington, Illinois Senator Charles H. Percy, and prominent SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael.[114]\\r\\nReports surfaced quickly that some of the young marshals were bullying people, particularly white journalists who had been invited to cover the city.[115] It also encountered confusion and criticism when Bernard Lafayette announced that Resurrection City needed $3 million, but couldnt convincingly explain why.[116]\\r\\nSCLC leaders led groups of residents on marches and small excursions in attempts to meet with members of Congress. These actions were mostly uneventful.[117] The City never conducted large-scale civil disobedience actions in Washington as King had envisioned.[109]\\r\\nThe Community Relations Service sent agents, dubbed the RC squad, who monitored and assisted the camp, actively endeavoring to sustain its morale.[118]\\r\\nFBI surveillance of the campaign also continued with agents posing as journalists and payment of Black informants within the City.[119] Military intelligence also spied on the city, wiretapping the campaign,[120] posing as press and generally duplicating FBI efforts.[121]\\r\\nThousands of people lived in Resurrection City and in some ways it resembled other cities. Gordon Mantler[122] writes:\\r\\nResurrection City also became a community with all of the tensions that any society contains: hard work and idleness, order and turmoil, punishment and redemption. Businesses flourished inside the tent citys walls, as did street crime. Older men informally talked politics while playing checkers or having their hair cut; others argued in more formal courses and workshops.[123]\\r\\nThere were unusual problems but there was also unusual dignity. Residents called it the city where you dont pay taxes, where theres no police brutality and you dont go to jail.[124] Resurrection City had a university, a \\"Soul Tent\\", a psychiatrist, and a city hall.[52]\\r\\nThe group suffered from political demoralization, conflicts over leadership, racial tension,[125] and, always, difficult living conditions.[10] Permanent residents became fewer as the occupation went on. People reported discipline problems, attributed to a few problematic residents who continually harassed and abused their neighbors.[126] Abernathy was criticized for staying in a hotel[52] and for cooperating with the Johnson administration to reduce the impact of the demonstration.[109]\\r\\nThe camp suffered from the mud produced by continual rain, which at one point created standing water five inches deep. The wet and muddy protestors nevertheless made numerous mostly unsuccessful efforts to meet with their members of Congress.[127]\\r\\nResurrection City was stunned when Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated on June 5; many took this second killing as a sign of bad things to come.[31] Kennedy's funeral procession passed through Resurrection City en route to Arlington National Cemetery and many residents joined the group in singing \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" at the Lincoln Memorial.[128][129]\\r\\nSome marchers, including the grand majority of Chicano activists, chose to live in the Hawthorne School, an alternative high school in D.C. a few miles away from Resurrection City. Not only did the school offer dry conditions, in contrast to Resurrection City, it also witnessed interesting interactions between people of different backgrounds. Residents referred to it as a tight-knit community in which cultural exchange flourished between Chicanos, poor Appalachian whites, and other folks escaping the poor weather. It was also from Hawthorne where protesters marched to the Supreme Court and held one of the campaign's most captivating protests. Opposed to a recent court ruling on native fishing rights, the mostly African-American, Chicano, and Native American protesters pounded on the court's front doors and received considerable media attention.[130]\\r\\nA Solidarity Day rally, initially planned for May 30, was postponed by Abernathy, who asked Bayard Rustin to organize the rescheduled event. On June 8, however, it was announced that Rustin had been dropped from the Poor People's Campaign following a fallout with Ralph Abernathy, who believed Rustin's proposal for an Economic Bill of Rights ignored many issues important to SCLC's campaign partners, including opposition to the Vietnam War.[131][132] Following Rustin's departure, SCLC leaders agreed to appoint Washington Urban League Director Sterling Tucker, who was relatively unknown outside the Washington metro area,[131] to lead the Solidarity Day march.[131] Solidarity Day was ultimately held on Wednesday, June 19 (Juneteenth), and attracted between 50,000 and 100,000 people (including many whites).[133] The crowd was addressed not only by SCLC leadersincluding Abernathy and Coretta Scott King (who spoke against the Vietnam War)but also by Tijerina, Native American activist Martha Grass, and politicians such as Eugene McCarthy (whom they applauded) and Hubert Humphrey (whom they booed). Labor unions, including the United Auto Workers, had a strong presence at the event.[133] Puerto Rican and Chicano marchers held a separate rally on the weekend before when people were less likely to be working.[134]\\r\\nOn Thursday, June 20, police fired several canisters of tear gas into the cityreportedly after members of the Milwaukee NAACP provoked them by throwing rocks. Life in the camp had become extremely chaotic. There were reports of vandalism from escaped mental patients.[135] A number of people were hospitalized but none were seriously injured. On Sunday, June 23, a white visitor to the camp was beaten, shot in the knee, and robbed.[136] Abernathy accused police of provoking \\"all the violence\\"through \\"paid infiltrators\\" and with the use of tear gas canisters and Molotov cocktailsand called for an investigation into \\"mass police brutality against the people of Resurrection City.\\"[136][137]\\r\\nWhen the demonstration's National Park Service permit expired on Sunday, June 23, 1968, some members of the House of Representatives called for immediate removal.[138]\\r\\nOn June 24, over one thousand[139] police officers arrived to clear the camp and its 500 remaining residents. Some had been led by Abernathy to another site for a pre-arranged arrest.[109] In the camp, police still found some people singing and clapping.[137] Police systematically searched the camp's shelters and arrested people inside and nearby the city.[137][137] Police ultimately arrested 288 demonstrators including Abernathy.[140]\\r\\nOn the afternoon of June 24, police reported being hit with rocks near 14th St. & U St., an intersection central to April disturbances following the King assassination. Broken windows and a fire bomb were also reported.[141] One hundred police in riot gear responded with tear gas. The area was sealed off, a curfew was declared, and Mayor Washington declared a state of emergency.[140] 450 National Guardsman began patrolling the streets that night, and few incidents were reported (one man leaving a liquor store was wounded by a police officer's bullet).[141]\\r\\nAn economic bill of rights was never passed, and leaders spoke with regret about the occupation. SCLC director Bill Rutherford described the campaign as the movement's \\"Little Bighorn.\\"[98][128] Andrew Young, vice president of the SCLC, suggested that Resurrection City was spending $27,000 a week on food and had been about to run out of money.[141] The mainstream media contrasted the Poor People's Campaign unfavorably with (an idealized version of) the 1963 March on Washington, which they portrayed as organized and palatable.[142]\\r\\nThe campaign did produce some changes, however subtle. They included more money for free and reduced lunches for school children and Head Start programs in Mississippi and Alabama. The USDA released surplus commodities to the nation's one-thousand poorest counties, food stamps were expanded, and some federal welfare guidelines were streamlined. Marian Wright Edelman formed a network of agency bureaucrats concerned about poverty issues.[143] Activists in the National Welfare Rights Organization also gained important connections in the capital.[144] Meanwhile, other marchers, especially Chicano activists, spoke of eye-opening experiences that made them more sophisticated in their thinking about poverty and their relationships with each other, when they returned West.[145]\\r\\nThe SCLC organized a protest caravan, driven by mule-power, to work its way down to the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida in early August. Nixon continued to make rioting a campaign issue, explicitly seeking the votes of suburban whites, \\"the nonshouters, the nondemonstrators\\", by promising increased policing, crackdowns on rioters, and an end to educational integration.[146]\\r\\nThe Mule Train traveled on and arrived in Chicago for the turbulent Democratic Convention in Chicago, where the demonstrators got caught in the midst of violence in the streets surrounding the convention site.[147]\\r\\nIn 1969, a Poor People's Campaign delegation, including Abernathy, met with President Nixon and asked him to address hunger and malnutrition.[17]\\r\\nDuring the 1972 Democratic National Convention, Abernathy and the SCLC organized \\"Resurrection City II\\" in Miami. There, they camped alongside other groups, including Students for a Democratic Society and Jerry Rubin's Yippees.[148]\\r\\nIn Savannah, Georgia, there is a group of Socialists that carry on the Poor People's Campaign legacy, calling themselves \\"PPC/CAT\\", \\"CAT\\" meaning \\"Community Action Team\\". They provide clothes and household items to anyone who needs them at Direct Action events throughout the city.","input":"When did the poor people's campaign start?"},{"output":"Junie B. Jones and the Stupid Smelly Bus","context":"Junie B. Jones is a children's book series written by Barbara Park and illustrated by Denise Brunkus. Published by Random House from 1992 to 2013, the stories begin with Junie B. Jones and the Stupid Smelly Bus, in which Junie B. is an \\"almost six year old\\" starting her first day of kindergarten.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAimed at beginning readers, the series centers on Junie B. Jones, a young girl who is just entering kindergarten in the first book in the series, Junie B. Jones and the Stupid Smelly Bus (1992).[1] In the opening sentences of that book, she declares, My name is Junie B. Jones. The B stands for Beatrice. Except I dont like Beatrice. I just like B and thats all.[1]\\r\\nJuniper Beatrice \\"Junie B.\\" Jones: The series' title character and main protagonist, Junie B. lives with her parents, Robert and Susan, and her baby brother, Ollie. Her birthday is in the month of June. She also has a dog named Tickle. She is 5 years old in the first kindergarten adventures, and 6 years old in the first grade stories. Junie B. is friendly and has a bright personality.[2] In kindergarten, her two best friends are Lucille and Grace. In first grade, her best friends are Herb, Jos, and Lennie. Junie B. has two rivals: Jim in kindergarten and May in first grade. In kindergarten, her classroom is Room Nine, and in First Grade, Room One. Junie B.'s favorite foods are spaghetti and meatballs, lemon pie, and ice cream. She has many catchphrases such as; \\"Wowie wow wow!\\", \\"Yeah, only\\", and \\"Hello! How are you today?\\". She is afraid of roosters because she thinks \\"they can peck your head into a nub\\", ponies because she thinks \\"they can stomple you to the ground and kill you\\", and clowns because she thinks \\"they are not normal people\\". She is shown to have reddish-brown hair and blue-green eyes. In the kindergarten series she was shown with short hair and a bow, she wears a pink sweater, purple skirt, white socks and signature black Mary Jane shoes. In the first grade series she had longer, messier hair, wore pants, and the bow was dropped, being replaced by her purple glasses. In Junie B. Jones is A Beauty Shop Guy, she is shown that she wants to be a beauty shop guy herself, though in Junie B. Jones and her Big Fat Mouth she wants to be a janitor when she grows up. In Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business, her grandpa lets her put syrup on her waffles without saying \\"WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!\\" It's also implied that she and her family possibly lives in Arizona.\\r\\nRobert \\"Bob\\" Jones: Junie B. and Ollie's loving father, whom Junie B. calls \\"Daddy.\\" He takes Junie B. to the beauty shop with him in Junie B. Jones is a Beauty Shop Guy, where she causes a disaster. In Junie B., First Grader: One Man Band, he teaches Junie B. to juggle. Robert is said to be playful and silly around his daughter. In Junie B. Jones is a Beauty Shop Guy, Junie B. says \\"he has other names too. Some people call him Bob, and other people call him Bobby. Plus today Mother called him Ace.\\"\\r\\nPhilip Johnny Bob: Junie B.'s beloved stuffed elephant. She brings him on trips with her, as seen in Junie B. Jones is a Party Animal and Aloha-ha-ha!. Junie B. seems to feel a lot safer when he is around, as shown in Junie B. Jones has a Monster Under her Bed and BOO! And I MEAN It!. In \\"Aloha-ha-ha!\\", Junie B.'s mother brings her a new Hawaiian Barbie doll which Junie B. names Delores. Philip Johnny Bob is shown to dislike Delores because of her \\"pointy, hard hands\\" poking him in the backpack while on the trip to Hawaii. Delores is only mentioned in this book.\\r\\nSusan Jones (ne Miller): Junie B.'s and Ollie's protective but caring mother, whom Junie B. calls \\"Mother.\\" Since Junie B. loves ice cream, Susan made a rule at the grocery store that Junie B. can't shout \\"I WANT ICE CREAM!\\" and not to call her a \\"big meanie\\" when she won't buy it. In \\"Junie B. Jones and Some Sneaky Peeky Spying\\", she gets very annoyed with Junie B. spying but despite her attempts, Junie B. continues to spy on people. She is shown to have short, blonde hair and wears make-up. In Top Secret Personal Beeswax, Junie B. says \\"sometimes Daddy calls her Buttercup. That is ridiculous, I think.\\" In Junie B.'s Essential Survival Guide to School she is said to have been at a school called Brainerd Elementary in 1st grade between 1983 and 1984 on her old report card, which she did not do so well on. Junie B. sees the report card and says \\"Mother was a bad kid.\\"\\r\\nOliver \\"Ollie\\" Jones: Junie B.'s baby brother. He is born in the book Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business. He is said to be ten months old in the month of October, so he is probably born in December. Junie B. often dislikes her brother, and they have somewhat of a sibling rivalry, stating that the family didn't actually need a baby but no one consulted her about it. However, she does show that she cares for him sometimes, like in Junie B., First Grader: Toothless Wonder where Junie B. concludes that Ollie's first tooth was the baby tooth Junie B. lost, and she smiles at him. Ollie's first word was \\"moo\\" which was revealed in Junie B., First Grader: BOO...and I MEAN It! which was the reason he was dressed up in a cow suit. In Junie B. Jones and That Meanie Jim's Birthday he is shown to have a hard time getting to sleep.\\r\\nFrank Miller (Grampa Miller): Junie B.'s grandfather. Grampa Miller, along with his wife, Helen Miller, babysits for her and her brother while their parents are at work. Junie B. calls Grampa Miller her \\"favoritest babysitter 'cause he doesn't even follow the 'structions!\\" In Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business, he is shown to be a smoker and smokes a cigar indoors and in \\"Junie B. Jones is a Graduation Girl\\" it mentions that he enjoys an occasional beer. Junie B. enjoys helping him fix the upstairs toilet and \\"touching the big ball that floats on top.\\"\\r\\nHelen Miller (Grandma Miller): Junie B.'s grandmother. Grandma Miller also babysits for Junie B. and her brother on occasion. She is also known to try and help Junie B. when ever she's in a crisis, such as in Meanie Jim's Birthday, Grandma Miller tries to help when Junie B. isn't invited to a party. Junie B. often calls her grandmother by her first name much to her annoyance. Grandma Miller has a pet canary bird named Twitter.\\r\\nTickle: Junie B.'s dog of unknown breed. He has short yellowish fur. He has been around since before Junie B. was born. Junie B. practices hairstyling by cutting his fur in Junie B. Jones is a Beauty Shop Guy. Also, she once fed him sugary cereal, causing him to throw up on a rug. Susan will not allow him on Junie B.'s bed, as revealed in Junie B. Jones Has a Monster Under Her Bed. He appears less often in the first grade books, implying that he may have died after Junie B.'s Top Secret Personal Beeswax. He and Junie B. watch her parents make Ollie's room in Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business.\\r\\nFlo Miller: Junie B.'s aunt and Susan's sister. She, her husband, and sister-in-law are only mentioned in \\"Junie B. Jones is (Almost) a Flower Girl\\", where she is getting married to her future husband Joe. She named Junie B. alternate flower girl, since her 5-year-old sister-in-law Bo was already chosen to be the flower girl. Miller was her maiden name and it is unknown what her last name was changed to, if at all. Bos older brother Joe is Flos husband. Junie B. has a misunderstanding with Bo at first, since Bo thought Junie B. was trying to steal her basket when she only wanted two petals, but the two later enjoy themselves at Flo and Joes wedding and promise to contact each other after they learn to read and write better.\\r\\nLucille: Junie B.'s rich, beautiful, but rather spoiled best friend in kindergarten. She has a grandmother who pampers her and always gives her what she wants except dogs, since Nana is allergic to them. She always wears nail polish, usually in shades of red. Although Lucille is in Junie B.'s first grade class, she and Junie B. are still good friends, but she gives 2 twins a turn to be her best friend in the beginning of the first grade and befriends the twins, Camille and Chenille. Junie B. says that she doesn't like Lucille very much in the first grade series, although they somewhat get along during an egg hunt and when Junie B. shows off her glasses. She also didn't like her in Junie B. Jones and Her Big Fat Mouth. In the kindergarten books, she is shown to have brown hair, although in the first grade books, she is shown to have blond hair. She likes to wear lacy socks with bows on them. She also has an older brother. She tries to make her nana get a poodle, but Junie B. ruins her chance. Also, she and her family cannot stand sweat.\\r\\nGrace (That Grace): Junie B.'s athletic, best friend in kindergarten. Like Junie B., she has a baby brother. Grace is a very fast runner and wears pink high-top sneakers. In contrast with Junie B., Grace is very well-behaved, and she speaks with proper grammar. She sits with Junie B. every day on the school bus in Kindergarten. In first grade she makes a new friend named Bobbi Jean Piper, whom Junie B. shares a rivalry with. In kindergarten, Junie B. calls Grace \\"That Grace\\". Grace is known to be competitive and a bit of a show-off. She sometimes fights with Lucille. She also has a younger brother and an older sister. Warren becomes Grace's boyfriend, Junie B. and Lucille are not okay with it, showing feelings of jealousy. Her grandmother has a condo in Florida. She is not in the same first grade class that Junie B. is in. Although Junie B. states that she is dropping Grace in first grade, she later admits in Top Secret Personal Beeswax that she misses her. Graces phone number is 555-5555.\\r\\nRicardo: Junie B.'s \\"boyfriend\\" in kindergarten until Junie B. Jones is (Almost) a Flower Girl where Junie B. confronts him about chasing \\"New\\" Thelma during recess and says that only boyfriends and girlfriends should chase each other, in which Ricardo tells her that they should start \\"chasing other people\\" and leaves, much to Junie B.'s dismay. He likes monkeys, has freckles, and wears cowboy boots.\\r\\nPaulie Allen Puffer: A boy in Junie B.'s kindergarten class that often tells her scary or funny stories which she always believes are true. In Junie B. Jones Has a Monster Under Her Bed, he tells her about the monster that lives under the bed which rekindles her fear of monsters. In \\"Junie B. Jones and Some Sneaky Peeky Spying\\", he discovers a dead cat that was ran over by an ice cream truck. Junie B. Jones is a Graduation Girl he tells her that being in the first grade is really fun because they are the boss of the kindergarteners. He seems to be one of the oldest students in the class, since he turned six in \\"Junie B. Jones and that Meanie Jim's Birthday.\\" He is best friends with Jim. In Junie B., First Grader: BOO...and I MEAN It! it is said that he tells Junie B. \\"five scary secrets\\" from kindergarten. He also has an older brother in the seventh grade (later eighth grade).\\r\\nWilliam: A very shy and soft-spoken boy who Junie B. says would be easy for her to beat up. She refers to him as \\"Crybaby William\\". He can be upset very easily as seen in Junie B. Jones and That Meanie Jim's Birthday when she runs past him stealing his invitation. He also has stage fright as seen in Junie B. Jones Smells Something Fishy when he became nervous after the teacher asked him if he'd like to take out his pet bullfrog and also in Junie B. Jones is a Graduation Girl when he tries to run away to the school parking lot during graduation rehearsal. Also in Junie B. Jones Is Captain Field Day when it was almost William's turn to play a game, he told Junie B. Jones he was never good at it, but he came through in the Pull Up game. His crickets die in Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business.\\r\\nHerbert (Herb): Junie B.'s best friend in first grade. He seems to dislike May as much as Junie B. does. In Junie B.'s Top Secret Personal Beeswax, he and Junie B. seem to have a crush on each other. He was in a different school before first grade.\\r\\nJos: Another one of Junie B.'s best friends in first grade. He is Hispanic and speaks both English and Spanish. He plays soccer. Sometimes, he greets Junie B. in Spanish. He won the bouquet of flowers for his mom in Junie B., First Grader: Dumb Bunny. He has a sister. Jos has his own remote control.\\r\\nLeonard aka Lennie: Another one of Junie B.'s best friends in first grade. He is quiet and almost always agrees with Junie B.. Lennie has spiky hair. He has a washcloth puppet. In Dumb Bunny, he and Shirley mention that they are Jewish.\\r\\nSheldon Potts: A good friend of Junie B. in first grade. He is one of a handful of characters whose first and last names are known. Sheldon is known for showing his bare feet in class when taking off his shoes and socks. He can be awfully shy in front of a crowd as revealed in Junie B., First Grader: One Man Band. In Junie B., First Grader: Dumb Bunny, he and Lucille are shown to have a crush on each other.

She used to be Junie B.s bathroom buddy until May caught them taking too long to wash their hands.\\r\\nRoger: A boy with freckles who is in the same classes as Junie B. for both the kindergarten and first grade books. Not a lot of information is revealed about him. He had his lunch money stolen by a boy named Jeff Hooks in kindergarten, and has an older brother named Rodney who was previously in Mr. Scarys class.\\r\\nJamal Hall: A boy in the kindergarten class. Very little information is known about him, besides the fact that his mother is the art teacher.\\r\\nCharlotte: A girl in the kindergarten class. She doesn't always get along with Junie B. In the book Junie B. Jones Has a Peep in Her Pocket, Charlotte sees Junie B.'s drawing of a rooster stuck under a tree and says that she hates it, to which Junie B. replies \\"You wouldn't say that if your head was a nub, sister.\\" She somewhat resembles May except she doesn't have freckles and wears glasses.\\r\\nMay Murkee: a girl who sits next to Junie B in the first grade part of the series. Junie B. does not like her because she won't say her B in her name and just calls her Junie Jones. She tattletales to Mr. Scary about Junie B. They get into arguments a lot and May gets annoyed with Junie B. when she does something Mr. Scary had told her not to do. Junie B. calls her as Blabber-mouth May. They are never shown to like each other at all. Her last name is Murkee, as revealed in Turkeys We Have Loved And Eaten (And Other Thankful Stuff). She says that E stands for excellent in her report card in one of the first grade books. She is spoiled by her mother Mary.\\r\\nJim: Junie B. and Jim are said to hate each other until Junie B. Jones and the Mushy Gushy Valentine when he gives a nice valentine to her. He tries to keep it a secret but he accidentally gives the game away when she catches him looking at the card while the rest of the children are on the playground. He tries to cover it up but he realizes that it is too late when she says his words are \\"sputtery.\\" He then admits that he's always liked her and that she makes Room Nine \\"sparky.\\" Although the reason is unknown it seems that not a hint of friendship is shown throughout the rest of the series, though in Junie B. Jones is a Graduation Girl after she get grape juice stains on her graduation outfit he suggest that everyone else color on their clothes so she would feel better. Jim as well as most of the kindergarten children are never shown again and calls her \\"Goony Bird Jones.\\" He says that Junie B.'s brother is not a monkey in Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business.\\r\\nPink Fluffy Girl: a fellow student at Junie B.'s school who wears a pink jacket is well known for stealing her beloved mittens in Junie B. Jones is not a Crook. How ever she gets caught and gets her comeuppance for stealing and Junie B. gets her mittens back.\\r\\nBobbi Jean Piper: Grace's new friend in first grade. She sat next to Grace and Junie B. is not okay with it.\\r\\nMrs.: Junie B.'s kindergarten teacher and in charge of Room Nine. In all of the Kindergarten adventures, Junie B. says: \\"Her name is Mrs. She has another name too but I just like Mrs. and that's all.\\" In the first book, Junie B. says that she does not remember the teacher's last name. In Junie B. Jones and Some Sneaky Peeky Spying, Junie B. catches Mrs. stealing grapes while at a grocery store and kissing her husband. She will miss Junie B. as shown in the last kindergarten book in the series.\\r\\nMr. Scary: Junie B.'s kind and warm first grade teacher. She believes that he made up his name because he is actually very nice and \\"doesn't even scare her, hardly.\\" He makes his class keep journals, where they write about whatever subjects they want. Mr. Scary often has to break up Junie B. and May's arguments. He can also be very firm when Junie B. and May tattle on each other.\\r\\nPrincipal: The principal at Junie B.'s school, whom she believes lives in his office and is \\"the king of the school, only he doesn't actually wear a crown.\\" She refers to him only as \\"Principal.\\" His first appearance was in Junie B. Jones and the Stupid, Smelly Bus, where he sternly scolds Junie B. for not getting on the bus and hiding in the school. They get to know each other pretty well during the kindergarten series since Junie B's antics often wind up getting her sent to the office. Junie B. does not like to go to his office because there is a \\"grouchy typing lady\\" in there that is somewhat mean, never smiles, and always \\"forces\\" her to sit in a blue chair which she says is \\"where bad kids have to sit.\\" Her mom eventually made a rule at home that getting herself sent to the office would get her \\"grounded, young lady.\\"\\r\\nGus Vallony: The janitor who is often friendly around Junie B. He helps her out when she is accidentally locked in the school in Stupid, Smelly Bus, where he was originally known as the \\"man with the can\\". She dresses up as a janitor for career day in Big Fat Mouth. He was born in an unknown foreign country. He cleans up \\"splat-o\\" (vomit) in Shipwrecked.\\r\\nMrs. Gladys Gutzman: The school cafeteria lady. She brings cookies to the kindergarten students. In Boss of Lunch, Junie B. helps her out in the cafeteria after she complains about how the first graders don't get cookies.\\r\\nMrs. Weller: The school nurse. In Junie B. Jones and Some Sneaky Peeky Spying she puts a band-aid on Junie B.'s head after Lucille tells her \\"it's not a good idea to keep secrets inside your head\\", after which Junie B. runs into the office yelling \\"my head's gonna blow!\\" In First Grader At Last! she tells Junie B. that she needs glasses after Mr. Scary finds out she has issues reading from the boards. Her names is unknown by Junie B. throughout the kindergarten series.\\r\\nMr. Woo: The Bus driver, who drives Junie B. and the other kids to school. He is friendly towards the kids, but often gets frustrated with them from time to time. He has given Junie B. two bus misbehavior warnings, one for shouting for the bus to go faster and one for tickling another student.\\r\\nGrouchy typing lady: Principal's secretary who works at the front office. Junie B. often fears her because she is \\"grouchy\\", though she is shown to be considerate to Junie B. at times, such as in Junie B. Jones is Not a Crook, where she is proud of Junie B. for returning the colorful pen she found to the Lost and Found box. Junie B.s response to her telling her to sit down is often Yeah, only Im not even bad or Yeah, only thats the bad kids chair. And Im not even bad.\\r\\nMr. Toot: The music teacher, who is also in charge of the annual Holiday Sing-Along.\\r\\nMrs. Hall: The art teacher. She was mentioned in Junie B. Jones and the Yucky Blucky Fruitcake, where she ran the Cake Walk in Room Nine. She has a son named Jamal.\\r\\nSince the original book was published by Random House in 1992, twenty-eight other Junie B. Jones books have been published. Twenty-seven books belong to the Junie B. Jones Series and there is also a Junie B. Jones Journal. The Junie B. Jones series has also been translated into Spanish and French.\\r\\nJunie B Jones The Junie B. Jones series came in at #71 on the American Library Association's list of the Top 100 Banned or Challenged Books from 2000-2009.[3] Reasons cited are poor social values taught by the books and Junie B. Jones not being considered a good role model due to her mouthiness and bad spelling and grammar.[citation needed] While Junie B. Jones writer Barbara Park appreciated being on banned lists with writers she respected (like Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison), she stopped reading information about her books because the comments were \\"too hurtful\\".[4] Park once wrote that some people \\"believe that the value of a children's book can be measured only in terms of the moral lessons it tries to impose or the perfect role models it offers. Personally, I happen to think that a book is of extraordinary value if it gives the reader nothing more than a smile or two. In fact, I happen to think that's huge.\\"[5]\\r\\nThe only mentioning of a theatrical feature film based on the books comes from a question and answer thread from Barbara Park where she stated that \\"Junie B has been pretty successful already living in the readers' imaginations, so I am happy with that.\\"[9]","input":"What is the first junie b. jones book?"},{"output":"8 July 2017","context":"The All Blacks first played against the British and Irish Lions at rugby union in 1904, beating them 9ÿ3 at Athletic Park, Wellington.

The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).\\r\\n\\r\\nBy volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen,[2] 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere. Air content and atmospheric pressure vary at different layers, and air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's troposphere and in artificial atmospheres.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15G1018?kg,[3] three quarters of which is within about 11?km (6.8?mi; 36,000?ft) of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. The Krmn line, at 100?km (62?mi), or 1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around 120?km (75?mi). Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science (aerology). Early pioneers in the field include Lon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three major constituents of Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around 10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air (without water vapor).[5] The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases,[6] among which are the greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash. Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine (elemental or in compounds), fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor. Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide (SO2) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.\\r\\n\\r\\n(A) volume fraction is equal to mole fraction for ideal gas only, ????also see volume (thermodynamics)\\r\\n(B) ppmv: parts per million by volume \\r\\n(C) Water vapor is about 0.25% by mass over full atmosphere\\r\\n(D) Water vapor strongly varies locally[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relative concentration of gasses remains constant until about 10,000?m (33,000?ft).[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere. However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see the temperature section, below). Because the general pattern of the temperature/altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of instrumented balloon soundings, the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers. Excluding the exosphere, the atmosphere has four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.[10] From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the exobase, which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700?km above sea level, to about 10,000?km (6,200?mi; 33,000,000?ft) where it merges into the solar wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. These free-moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible. However, the aurora borealis and aurora australis sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about 80?km (50?mi; 260,000?ft) up to the thermopause at an altitude range of 500ÿ1000?km (310ÿ620?mi; 1,600,000ÿ3,300,000?ft). The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity.[11] Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the exobase. The lower part of the thermosphere, from 80 to 550 kilometres (50 to 342?mi) above Earth's surface, contains the ionosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike the stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature inversion is due to the absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise as high as 1500?C (2700?F), though the gas molecules are so far apart that its temperature in the usual sense is not very meaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of oxygen, for example) travels an average of 1 kilometre (0.62?mi; 3300?ft) between collisions with other molecules.[13] Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However, non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between 350 and 420?km (220 and 260?mi).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about 50?km (31?mi; 160,000?ft) to the mesopause at 80ÿ85?km (50ÿ53?mi; 260,000ÿ280,000?ft) above sea level.\\r\\n\\r\\nTemperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around ?85?C (?120?F; 190?K).[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nJust below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar-mesospheric noctilucent clouds. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon. Lightning-induced discharges known as transient luminous events (TLEs) occasionally form in the mesosphere above tropospheric thunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocket-powered aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause. This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly 12?km (7.5?mi; 39,000?ft) above Earth's surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 to 55?km (31 to 34?mi; 164,000 to 180,000?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the pressure at sea level. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation (UV) radiation from the Sun by the ozone layer, which restricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be ?60?C (?76?F; 210?K) at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near 0?C.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar stratospheric or nacreous clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about 12?km (7.5?mi; 39,000?ft), although this altitude varies from about 9?km (5.6?mi; 30,000?ft) at the geographic poles to 17?km (11?mi; 56,000?ft) at the Equator,[12] with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause, a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion (i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone which is isothermal with height.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere (i.e. Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere. This promotes vertical mixing (hence, the origin of its name in the Greek word ??, tropos, meaning \\"turn\\"). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the mass of Earth's atmosphere.[19] The troposphere is denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower 5.6?km (3.5?mi; 18,000?ft) of the troposphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically all the weather-associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the five principal layers that are largely determined by temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface is 14?C (57?F; 287?K)[22] or 15?C (59?F; 288?K),[23] depending on the reference.[24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the International Standard Atmosphere as 101325 pascals (760.00?Torr; 14.6959?psi; 760.00?mmHg). This is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard atmospheres (atm). Total atmospheric mass is 5.1480G1018 kg (1.135G1019 lb),[28] about 2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of 51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density from sea level, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of 8.50?km (27,900?ft). It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every 5.6?km (18,000?ft) or by a factor of 1/e every 7.64?km (25,100?ft), the average scale height of the atmosphere below 70?km (43?mi; 230,000?ft). However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at 8,848?m (29,029?ft);\\r\\ncommercial airliners typically cruise between 10 and 13?km (33,000 and 43,000?ft) where the thinner air improves fuel economy; weather balloons reach 30.4?km (100,000?ft) and above; and the highest X-15 flight in 1963 reached 108.0?km (354,300?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\nEven above the Krmn line, significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur. Meteors begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth's ionosphere, important to HF radio propagation, begin below 100?km and extend beyond 500?km. By comparison, the International Space Station and Space Shuttle typically orbit at 350ÿ400?km, within the F-layer of the ionosphere where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months. Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700ÿ800?km.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above 11?km, where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the stratosphere, starting above about 20?km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the ozone layer caused by capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named thermosphere above 90?km.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause in an ideal gas of constant composition the speed of sound depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile (see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe density of air at sea level is about 1.2?kg/m3 (1.2?g/L, 0.0012 g/cm3). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the ideal gas law). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula. More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5G1015) tonnes or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American National Center for Atmospheric Research, \\"The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480G1018?kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5G1015?kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27G1016?kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 I0.0003G1018?kg.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSolar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O2 and O3 absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 nanometers. Water (H2O) absorbs many wavelengths above 700?nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave \\"windows\\" of low opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The optical window runs from around 300?nm (ultraviolet-C) up into the range humans can see, the visible spectrum (commonly called light), at roughly 400ÿ700?nm and continues to the infrared to around 1100?nm. There are also infrared and radio windows that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter waves.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmission is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their \\"black body\\" emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately 6,000?K (5,730?C; 10,340?F), its radiation peaks near 500?nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is approximately 290?K (17?C; 62?F), so its radiation peaks near 10,000?nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are CO2 and H2O.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe refractive index of air is close to, but just greater than 1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of Earth's surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe refractive index of air depends on temperature,[33] giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the mirage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAtmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means (with ocean circulation) by which heat is distributed around Earth. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth's rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen. There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), notably water vapor, methane and ammonia.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nOutgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide and inert gases.[34] A major part of carbon-dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form carbonates that were deposited as sediments. Water-related sediments have been found that date from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable \\"second atmosphere\\". The influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints of early life-forms appear as early as 3.5 billion years ago.[36] How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out 30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the \\"faint young Sun paradox\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe geological record however shows a continuous relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of Earth ÿ with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late Archean Eon an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing cyanobacteria (see Great Oxygenation Event), which have been found as stromatolite fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy (isotope ratio proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle became established as early as 4 billion years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient sediments in the Gabon dating from between about 2,150 and 2,080 million years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution. These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe constant re-arrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded iron formations.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen. This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere. O2 showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian.[40] The following time span from 541 million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic Eon, during the earliest period of which, the Cambrian, oxygen-requiring metazoan life forms began to appear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: Plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, releasing oxygen. Breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is great enough for this rapid development of animals.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAir pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate matter or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to organisms.[42] Stratospheric ozone depletion is caused by air pollution, chiefly from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientific consensus is that the anthropogenic greenhouse gases currently accumulating in the atmosphere are the main cause of global warming.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 19, 2015 NASA started a website containing daily images of the full sunlit side of Earth on http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/.

He is the cousin of Mr Bennet, and is the clergyman at the Hunsford parsonage near Rosing's Park, the estate of his patroness Lady Catherine De Bourgh. Since Mr and Mrs Bennet have no sons, Mr Collins is the current heir presumptive to the Bennet's family estate of Longbourn House.[1] Mr Collins is first introduced during his visit to Longbourn, Mr Bennet's estate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr William Collins, 25 years old as the novel begins, is Mr Bennet's distant cousin, a clergyman, and the heir presumptive to Mr Bennet's estate of Longbourn. The property is entailed to heirs male, meaning that Mr Bennet's daughters and their issue cannot inherit. Unless Mr Bennet has a son (which he and Mrs Bennet have no expectation of), the estate of two thousand a year will pass to Mr Collins.\\r\\nBorn to a father, Mr Collins Sr, who is described as an \\"illiterate and miserly father\\", the son, William Collins is not much better (sans the miser part)'. The greatest part of his life has been spent under his father's guidance. So the younger Collins is \\"not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society\\". He's further described as having \\"belonged to one of the universities\\" (either Oxford or Cambridge), but he'd \\"merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance\\", nor accomplishments. He is an insensible man, obsequious and lacking in common sense, and all too easily defers and kowtows to his social superiors. His father passes away some point not too long prior to events at the beginning of the novel. His physical appearance is described as being \\"tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal\\".\\r\\nAusten writes that prior to his entry into the novel, his circumstances in early life, and the 'subjection' in which his father had brought him up, had \\"originally given him great humility of manner\\". However, this characteristic has been \\"now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement\\", altered greatly and been replaced with arrogance and vanity due to \\"early and unexpected prosperity\\".[2] This early prosperity came, by chance, at the hands of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, when a vacancy arose for the living of the Hunsford parish, \\"and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility\\". He has a ridiculously high regard for Lady Catherine de Bourgh and her daughter, of whom he is \\"eloquent in their praise\\".[3]\\r\\nElizabeth's rejection of Mr Collins's marriage proposal is welcomed by her father, regardless of the financial benefit to the family of such a match. Mr Collins then marries Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte Lucas. Mr Collins is usually considered to be the foil to Mr. Darcy, who is grave and serious, and acts with propriety at all times. On the other hand, Mr Collins acts with impropriety and exaggerated humility, which offers some comedic relief. He likes things, especially if they are expensive or numerous, but is indifferent to true beauty and value (\\"Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump[4]).\\r\\nMr Collins is first mentioned when Mr. Bennet tells his wife that his cousin will be visiting them. Mr Bennet reads them a letter sent to him from Mr Collins where Collins speaks of making amends for any past disagreements between his father and Mr Bennet. In his letter, Mr Collins readily assumes that his overtures of peace will be gratefully accepted and presumes upon the family to announce that he will come stay with them for a week.\\r\\nUpon the first night of his visit he spends time dining with the family and reading to them from Fordyce's Sermons in their parlour. It is at this point that Mr Collins seems to take a fancy to the eldest daughter, Jane Bennet. When discussing his intentions with Mrs. Bennet he is told that Jane may very soon be engaged.[2] It takes Mr Collins only a few moments to redirect his attentions to Elizabeth Bennet, who in he believes in \\"birth and beauty\\",[2] succeeds her sister.\\r\\nHe spends the rest of his stay making visits around the neighbourhood with the young Misses Bennet. They visit Mrs Phillips, Mrs Bennet's sister. Mr Collins is quite charmed by this encounter and seems extremely pleased to be treated so well by the family. He continues to pay specific attention to Miss Elizabeth.\\r\\nCollins first gives Elizabeth a hint of his intentions prior to the Netherfield ball hosted by Charles Bingley. He asks Elizabeth if she will allow him the pleasure of being her partner for the first two dances.[5] Though Mr Collins quite enjoys himself during these dances, Elizabeth has entirely different feelings on the matter. Miss Elizabeth has a strong aversion for Mr Collins. However, she usually tries to avoid any conversation beyond what is polite and proper. At the Netherfield ball she describes her dances with Mr Collins as \\"dances of mortification\\". She comments that Mr Collins acts awkwardly and solemn and gives her \\"all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give\\".[5]\\r\\nAt the end of Mr Collins' weeklong visit he seeks a private audience with Miss Elizabeth. Oblivious to how Elizabeth might be feeling, Mr Collins tells her that \\"almost as soon as he entered the house, he singled her out as the companion of his future life\\". He also expounds upon his reasons for getting married which are:\\r\\nWhen Elizabeth rejects his proposal, despite her mother's approval of the match, Collins is quite taken aback and does not believe that she is serious. Elizabeth has to tell him firmly that she is in fact serious. Mr Collins seems surprised and insulted. He had not considered that his proposal would ever be undesirable. Miss Elizabeth has to insistently repeat to Mr Collins that she does not intend to marry him since he believes she is really only trying to behave with propriety by refusing him. Collins only accepts her refusal once Mrs Bennet admits that it is not likely that Elizabeth intends changing her mind.\\r\\nIn a few short days after this rejection, Mr Collins' sentiments are quickly transferred to Elizabeth's friend Charlotte Lucas, who encourages his regard because she seeks to improve her own social position (and does not wish to remain a spinster). Since Collins has very good prospects, Charlotte is determined to gain his favour.[7] Her plan works well. A few days after this Elizabeth hears that Charlotte is now engaged to Mr Collins. Upon hearing this news from Charlotte herself, Elizabeth declares it impossible and wonders how it is that someone could find Mr Collins less than ridiculous, let alone choose to marry him. This engagement takes place rather quickly and later, Mr Collins comes to visit the Bennets with his new wife to pay their respects.\\r\\nA few months later Elizabeth is invited to visit Charlotte at her new home in Hunsford. Mr Collins makes it his goal to show Elizabeth that she made a grave mistake when refusing to marry him. Later on, he seems intent on convincing the Bennets that his pride was never injured and that he never had intentions towards Miss Elizabeth or any of her sisters.[8]\\r\\nMr Collins is only mentioned a few more times throughout the novel in passing.\\r\\nSome scholarly analysis has been conducted on Jane Austen's characterisation of Mr Collins. Possibly the most thorough examination of this character was made by Ivor Morris in his book Mr Collins Considered: Approaches to Jane Austen. Morris says \\"there is no one quite like Mr Collins [...] his name has become a byword for a silliness all of his owna felicitous blend of complacent self-approval and ceremonious servility.\\"[9] He continues to say that Austen designed Mr Collins as a flat character, yet he is one of her great accomplishments. Morris suggests that though Mr Collins has few dimensions, he is just as rounded as Sense and Sensibility's Edward Ferrars and Colonel Brandon, or Emma's Mr Knightley and Harriet Smith.[10] In another analysis, Deirdre Le Faye wrote \\"what does make Mr Collins a figure of fun and rightful mockery is his lack of sense, of taste, and of generosity of spirit contrasted to his own supreme unawareness of his shortcomings in these respects\\".[11] He has also been criticised for taking such a casual air of his own marriage, which is one of the primary concerns of the Church.[12]\\r\\nIn a book review written by Dinah Birch, a professor at the University of Liverpool, she examines the role of Mr Collins as a clergyman in Jane Austen's writing. Birch says that \\"one of the strongest points of Pride and Prejudice is its understanding that Jane Austen's Christianity ... is also an imaginative force in her writing\\", because Austen is \\"deeply interested in the role of the church\\", in her society.[13] She writes about the lack of religious dedication she sees in some clergyman through her character Mr Collins who is \\"by no means an aspirant to sainthood\\".[14] Margaret Kirkham regards the \\"asinine\\" Mr Collins, who will inherit Longbourn, as a way that Austen \\"mocks sexist pride and prejudice\\" in legal customs.[15]","input":"Which bennet sister did mr. collins first propose to?"},{"output":"patricians","context":"Social class in ancient Rome was hierarchical, but there were multiple and overlapping social hierarchies, and an individual's relative position in one might be higher or lower than in another.[1] The status of freeborn Romans during the Republic was established by:\\r\\nFor example, men who lived in towns outside Rome (such as municipia or colonies) might hold citizenship, but lack the right to vote (see ius Latinum); free-born Roman women were citizens, but could not vote or hold political office.\\r\\nThere were also classes of non-citizens with different legal rights, such as peregrini. Under Roman law, slaves were considered property and had no rights as such. However, some laws regulated slavery and offered slaves protections not extended to other forms of property such as animals. Slaves who had been manumitted were freedmen (liberti), and for the most part enjoyed the same legal rights and protections as free-born citizens.\\r\\nRoman society was patriarchal in the purest sense; the male head of household (paterfamilias) held special legal powers and privileges that gave him jurisdiction (patria potestas) over all the members of his familia ÿ a more encompassing term than its modern derivative \\"family\\" that included adult sons, his wife (but only in Rome's earlier history, when marriage cum manu was practiced), married daughters (in the Classical period of Roman history), various dependent relatives, and slaves. The patron-client relationship (clientela), with the word patronus deriving from pater (father), was another way in which Roman society was organized into hierarchical groups, though clientela also functioned as a system of overlapping social networks. A patron could be the client of a socially superior or more powerful patron; a client could have multiple patrons.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Roman Kingdom and the early Roman Republic the most important division in Roman society was between the patricians and the plebeians. The patricians were a small elite whose ancestry was traced to the first Senate established by Romulus,[3] who monopolised political power. The plebeians comprised the majority of Roman citizens (see below). Adult males who were not Roman citizens, whether free or slave, fall outside this division. Women and children were also not citizens, but took the social status of their father or husband, which granted them various rights and protections not available to the women and children of men of lower rank.\\r\\nThe common assumptions that the patricians and the Roman elite were one and the same throughout the history of ancient Rome, and that all plebeians were of non-elite status throughout the history of ancient Rome, are entirely incorrect. From the Late Republic era onward many members of the elite, including an increasing proportion of senators, came from plebeian families. The first Roman Emperor, Augustus, was of plebeian origin, as were many of his successors. By the Late Empire, few members of the Senate were from the original patrician families, most of which had died out. Rome continued to have a hierarchical class system, but it was no longer dominated by the distinction between patricians and plebeians.\\r\\nOriginally, all public offices were open only to patricians, and the classes could not intermarry. Plebeians and Patricians were always at odds due to the fact that Plebeians wanted to increase their power.[4] A series of social struggles (see Conflict of the Orders) saw the plebs secede from the city on three occasions, the last in 297?BCE, until their demands were met. They won the right to stand for office, the abolition of the intermarriage law, and the creation of office of tribune of the plebs. This office, founded in 494?BCE as a result of a plebeian secession, was the main legal bulwark against the powers of the patrician class, and only plebeians were eligible. The tribunes originally had the power to protect any plebeian from a patrician magistrate. Later revolts forced the Senate to grant the tribunes additional powers, such as the right to veto legislation. A tribunes person was sacrosanct, and he was obliged to keep an open house at all times while in office. Some patricians, notably Clodius Pulcher in the late 60s?BCE, petitioned to be assigned plebeian status, in order to accumulate the political influence among the people that the office of tribune afforded. The conflict between the classes came to a climax in 287?BCE when patricians and plebeians were declared equal under the law.\\r\\nFollowing these changes the distinction between patrician and plebeian status became less important, and by the Late Republic the only patrician prerogatives were certain priesthoods. Over time, some patrician families declined, some plebeian families rose in status, and the composition of the ruling class changed. A plebeian who was the first of his line to become consul was known as a novus homo (new man), and he and his descendants became noble (nobiles). Notable examples of novi homines are the seven-time consul Marius, and Cicero, whose rise was unusual in that it was driven by his oratorical and intellectual abilities rather than, as with Marius, military success. During the Empire, patricius became a title of nobility bestowed by emperors.[5][6]\\r\\nThe census divided citizens into six complex classes based on property. The richest were the senatorial class, who during the Late Republic had to be worth at least 400,000?sestertii, the same as the equites; when Augustus reformed the senate during the first years of the Principate, he raised the property requirement to 1,000,0000?sestertii.[7] The wealth of the senatorial class was based on ownership of large agricultural estates, and by custom members did not engage in commercial activity.\\r\\nBelow the senatores in rank, but above others were the equites (equestrians or knights), with 400,000?sestertii, who could engage in commerce and formed an influential business class. Certain political and quasi-political positions were filled by equites, including tax farming and, under the Principate, leadership of the Praetorian Guard. Below the equites were three more classes of property-owning citizens; and lastly the proletarii, whose property was valued below 11,000?asses.[8]\\r\\nmoney (property)\\r\\n(self-supplied)\\r\\nFree-born women in ancient Rome were citizens (cives), but could not vote or hold political office.[11] The form of Roman marriage called conubium, for instance, requires that both spouses be citizens; like men from towns granted civitas sine suffragio, women eligible for legal marriage were citizens without suffrage. The legal status of a mother as a citizen affected her son's citizenship.[12] The phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos (children born of two Roman citizens) indicates that a Roman woman was regarded as having citizen status, in specific contrast to a peregrina.\\r\\nThe Latin Right was a form of citizenship with limited rights. It was conferred originally on the allied towns of Latium in the Republican era, and gradually extended to communities throughout the Empire. Latin citizens had rights, but not the vote, although their leading magistrates could become full citizens.\\r\\nFree-born foreign subjects were known as peregrini, and special laws existed to govern their conduct and disputes. These distinctions continued until 212?CE, when Caracalla extended full Roman citizenship to all free-born men in the empire.\\r\\nSlaves (servi) were not citizens, and lacked even the legal standing accorded free-born foreigners. For the most part, slaves descended from debtors and from prisoners of war, especially women and children captured during sieges and other military campaigns in Greece, Italy, Spain, and Carthage. In the later years of the Republic and into the Empire, more slaves came from newly conquered areas of Gaul, Britain, North Africa, and Asia Minor. Many slaves were created as the result of Rome's conquest of Greece, but Greek culture was considered in some respects superior to that of Rome: hence Horace's famous remark Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit (\\"Captured Greece took her savage conqueror captive\\"). The Roman playwright Terence is thought to have been brought to Rome as a slave. Thus slavery was regarded as a circumstance of birth, misfortune, or war; it was defined in terms of legal status, or rather the lack thereof, and was neither limited to or defined by ethnicity or race, nor regarded as an inescapably permanent condition.\\r\\nSlaves who lacked skills or education performed agricultural or other forms of manual labor. Those who were violent or disobedient, or who for whatever reason were considered a danger to society, might be sentenced to labor in the mines, where they suffered under inhumane conditions. Slaves subjected to harsh labor conditions also had few if any opportunities to obtain their freedom.\\r\\nSince slaves were legally property, they could be disposed of by their owners at any time. All children born to female slaves were slaves. Some slave owners, as for instance Tacitus,[citation needed] freed slaves whom they believed to be their natural children. Slaves who had the education or skills to earn a living were often manumitted upon the death of their owner as a condition of his will. Slaves who conducted business for their masters were also permitted to earn and save money for themselves, and some might be able to buy their own freedom.\\r\\nOver time, legislation was passed to protect the lives and health of slaves. Although many prostitutes were slaves, for instance, the bill of sale for some slaves stipulated that they could not be used for commercial prostitution.[13]\\r\\nFreed men (libertieu) were freed slaves, whose free-born children were full citizens. The status of liberti developed throughout the Republic as their number increased. Livy states[citation needed] that freedmen in the Early Republic mainly joined the lower classes of the plebeians. Juvenal, writing during the Empire when financial Freedmen were often highly educated and made up the bulk of the civil service during the early Empire. The Augustan poet Horace was himself the child of a freedman from Venusia in southern Italy. Many became enormously wealthy as the result of bribes, fraud, or other forms of corruption, or were given large estates by the Emperor they served.[citation needed] Other freedmen engaged in commerce, amassing vast fortunes often only rivalled by those of the wealthiest nobiles. Many of the Satires of Juvenal contain angry denouncements of the pretensions of wealthy freedmen, some 'with the chalk of the slave market still on their heel'. Juvenal saw these successful men as nouveaux riches who were far too ready to show off their (often ill-gotten) wealth. Another famous caricature is seen in the absurdly extravagant character of Trimalchio in Satyricon. The majority of freedmen, however, joined the plebeian classes, and often worked as farmers or tradesmen.","input":"What were the two classes of roman society?"},{"output":"2.5 miles","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nOcean City is a city in Cape May County, New Jersey, United States.

Ocean City was incorporated as a city, its current government form, on March 25, 1897.[24][25] The city is named for its location on the Atlantic Ocean.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nKnown as a family-oriented seaside resort, Ocean City has prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages within its limits since its founding in 1879,[28][29] offering miles of guarded beaches, a boardwalk that stretches for 2.5 miles (4.0?km), and a downtown shopping and dining district.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Travel Channel rated Ocean City as the Best Family Beach of 2005.[31] It was ranked the third-best beach in New Jersey in the 2008 Top 10 Beaches Contest sponsored by the New Jersey Marine Sciences Consortium.[32] In the 2009 Top 10 Beaches Contest, Ocean City ranked first.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Ocean City was established, local Native Americans set up camps on the island for fishing in the summer months.[34] In 1633, Dutch navigator David Pietersz. de Vries referred to \\"flat sand beaches with low hills between Cape May and Egg Harbor\\", possibly the earliest reference to the island that became Ocean City. In 1695, Thomas Budd surveyed the land on behalf of the West Jersey Society. Around 1700, John Peck used the island as a base of operation for storing freshly hunted whales, and subsequently the land became known as Peck's Beach. The first record of a house on Peck's Beach was in 1752. During the 18th century, cattle grazers brought cows to the island, where plentiful trees, weeds, brush, and seagrass provided suitable condition. Parker Miller was the first resident permanent resident of Peck's Beach in 1859.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally purchased by the Somers family, the island was formerly named Peck's Beach, believed to have been given the name for a whaler named John Peck.[36] In 1700, whaler John Peck began using the barrier island as a storage place for freshly caught whales. The island was also used as cattle-grazing area, and mainlanders would boat over for a picnic or to hunt.[37] On September 10, 1879, four Methodist ministers ÿ Ezra B. Lake, James Lake, S. Wesley Lake, and William Burrell ÿ chose the island as a suitable spot to establish a Christian retreat and camp meeting on the order of Ocean Grove. They met under a tall cedar tree, which stands today in the lobby of the Ocean City Tabernacle. Having chosen the name \\"Ocean City\\", the founders incorporated the Ocean City Association, and laid out street and lots for cottages, hotel, and businesses. The Ocean City Tabernacle was built between Wesley and Asbury Avenues and between 5th and 6th Streets. Camp meetings were held by the following summer and continue uninterrupted to this day.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1881, the first school on the island opened.[34] The first bridge to the island was built in 1883, and the West Jersey Railroad opened in 1884.[39] Based on a referendum on April?30, 1884, the borough of Ocean City was formed from portions of Upper Township, following an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 3, 1884.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship Sindia joined other shipwrecks on the beach on December 15, 1901, on its way to New York City from Kobe, Japan, but has since sunk below the sand.

The town banned the manufacturing or sale of alcohol in 1909.[44] Promoting water instead of drinking alcohol, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union donated a public fountain, dedicated on Memorial Day in 1915.[45] Despite the prohibition of alcohol within the municipality, illegal saloons operated within Ocean City, and in 1929, prosecutors raided 27?speakeasies.[46] In 1951, the town banned the consumption of alcohol on the beach, and banned all public alcohol consumption in 1958.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the city owned its own dredge, but ceased replenishment projects when it could not secure permits for dredging the lagoons.[52] Since 1992, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has handled responsibility for beach nourishment projects, periodically adding 1.1?million cubic yards (841,000?cubic meters), roughly every three years, using the shoal area about 5,000?ft (1,525?m) offshore the Great Egg Harbor Inlet.

The racial makeup of the city was 93.57% White, 4.31% African American, 0.12% Native American, 0.56% Asian, 0.07% Pacific Islander, 0.52% from other races, and 0.86% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.99% of the population.[61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were 7,464 households out of which 16.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.9% were married couples living together, 9.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.3% were non-families. 40.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 17.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.02 and the average family size was 2.71.[61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 16.4% under age 18, 5.6% from 18 to 24, 23.8% from 25 to 44, 28.3% from 45 to 64, and 25.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 48 years. For every 100 females, there were 86.4 males. For every 100 women age 18 and over, there were 82.8 men.[61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the city was $44,158, and the median income for a family was $61,731. Males had a median income of $42,224 versus $31,282 for females. The per capita income for the city was $33,217. About 4.3% of families and 6.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.0% of those under age 18 and 6.5% of those age 65 or over.[61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst approved in 1976, beach tags are a major source of revenue for the city, with the $4.1 million in revenue generated in the 2016 season the most of any municipality in the state.[64] In the 2017 budget, the projected $4.1 million in fees for beach tag and $3 million for parking were two of the city's biggest revenue sources, accounting for almost 9% of the city's annual budget of almost $80 million.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom early June through Labor Day, Ocean City requires individuals age 12 and up to purchase a beach tag to access its beaches.[66] For the 2018 season (from June 2, 2018 through September 3, 2018), a one-day pass cost $5, a weekly pass was $10, and a seasonal pass for the full summer season will be $25. Beach tag revenue is used by the city to cover the costs of maintaining and cleaning the beaches, as well as providing lifeguards.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ocean City boardwalk is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the resort. It is also one of the most well-known boardwalks in the world.[citation needed] It is 2.5-mile (4.0?km) long and runs north from 23rd Street to St. James Place, with mile markers for people who are exercising.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boardwalk was first built in 1880 from the Second Street wharf to Fourth Street and West Avenue. In 1885, plans to extend the boardwalk along the entire beach were made as the city's first amusement house, a pavilion on the beach at 11th street called \\"The Excursion\\" opened. A second amusement park, the \\"I.G. Adams pavilion\\", at Ninth Street and the boardwalk, opened soon after but was destroyed by fire in 1893. Following a second catastrophic fire in 1927, the boardwalk and its businesses were rebuilt 300 feet (91?m) closer to the ocean on concrete pilings, with parking created for cars in the space where the buildings and boardwalk once stood.[69] The Ocean City Music Pier partially opened one year later, with work completed in time for the 1929 season.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007 controversy emerged about the city's proposed use of ip, a type of wood, to re-deck parts of the boardwalk. Environmental activists protested against the city's use of the wood, but the plan went ahead.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Fall 2013, the city began a $10?million project to rebuild the 85?year old boardwalk from 5th to 12th Streets. This replaced the concrete substructure from 1928 with wooden supports and pine decking, and included the removal of 12,000?yd3 of sand. Originally intended to be a seven-year project, the work is two years ahead of schedule, and is scheduled to be completed in March 2018.[72][73][74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, the Wonderland Amusement Park opened on the boardwalk at 6th Street, which is now known as \\"Gillian's Wonderland Pier\\". Runaway Train, a steel twister, is the only major coaster that operates there.[75] Playland's Castaway Cove, is located on the boardwalk at 10th Street. Two major roller coasters operated there, which were the Python, a looping coaster, and the Flitzer, a wild mouse coaster. A new major shuttle coaster at Castaway Cove, Storm, was planned to be finished in summer 2013.[76] The two older coasters (Python and Flitzer) were removed and for the 2016 summer season, a new ride called \\"GaleForce\\" is under construction, which will be a high thrill roller coaster with three linear synchronous motor launches reaching speeds of 64 miles per hour (103?km/h) and a 125-foot (38?m) beyond vertical drop. The new \\"Wild Waves\\" ride will be a family-oriented coaster, with a height of 50 feet (15?m), that will wrap around the GaleForce coaster. The new \\"Whirlwind\\" ride is a figure eight kiddie coaster with spinning cars.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a water park located on the boardwalk called \\"OC Waterpark\\", open during the summer months.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, there are bike and surrey rentals available along many boardwalk cross streets, but bikes and surreys can only be ridden on the boardwalk before noon during the summer. Attractions along the boardwalk include two family amusement parks with rides and games, an arcade, the Music Pier, a water park and various themed miniature golf courses. The Ocean City boardwalk has a wide variety of dining options, from sit-down restaurants to funnel cake.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the summer months, frequent episodes of high humidity occur. Occasionally, heat index values exceed 95?F (35?C). During most summer afternoons, a sea breeze dominates the coastline keeping high temperatures several degrees cooler compared to areas farther inland. During most nights, relatively mild ocean waters keep the coastline several degrees warmer than areas farther inland. On average, July is the annual peak for thunderstorm activity. During the winter months, wind chill values occasionally fall below 0?F (-18?C). On average, the snowiest month of the year is February which corresponds with the annual peak for nor'easter activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nOcean City Nor'easters of the USL Premier Development League play at Carey Stadium.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross from the Ocean City Airport is the Howard Stainton Wildlife Refuge, a 16 acres (6.5?ha) area of wetlands established in 1997. There are no trails, but there is a viewing platform accessible from Bay Avenue.[82] Adjacent to the airport is the Ocean City Municipal Golf Course, a 12ÿhole course run by the city and open to the public.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the southern end of the island is Corson's Inlet State Park, which was established in 1969 to preserve one of the last undeveloped tracts of land along the oceanfront. The park is accessible by Ocean Drive (Cape May County Route 619), which bisects the park.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe City of Ocean City was incorporated on March 25, 1897. Since July 1, 1978, the city has operated within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the mayorÿcouncil system of municipal government. The mayor, the chief executive of the community, is chosen at-large for a four-year term at the municipal election in May and serves part-time for a yearly salary. The mayor neither presides over, nor has a vote on the council. The mayor has veto power over ordinances, but any veto can be overridden by a vote of two-thirds of the Council. The City council is the legislative body and has seven members. Four members represent individual wards and three are elected at-large. Each council person serves a staggered four-year term. The three at-large seat and the mayoral seat are up for election together, followed by the four ward seats which are voted upon two years later.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2018[update], the mayor of Ocean City is Jay A. Gillian, whose term of office ends June 30, 2022.[4][5] Members of the city council are Council President Peter Madden (2018; At Large), Council Vice President Anthony P.

The installation borders the towns of Fayetteville, Spring Lake, and Southern Pines. It was also a census-designated place in the 2000 census, during which a residential population of 29,183 was identified.[2] It is named for Confederate General Braxton Bragg. It covers over 251 square miles (650?km2). It is the home of the Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and is the headquarters of the United States Army Special Operations Command, which oversees the U.S. Army 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) and 75th Ranger Regiment.[3] It is also home to the U.S. Army Forces Command, U.S. Army Reserve Command, and Womack Army Medical Center. Fort Bragg maintains two airfields: Pope Field, where the United States Air Force stations global airlift and special operations assets as well as the Air Force Combat Control School, and Simmons Army Airfield, where Army aviation units support the needs of airborne and special operations forces on post.\\r\\n\\r\\nCamp Bragg was established in 1918 as an artillery training ground. The Chief of Field Artillery, General William J. Snow, was seeking an area having suitable terrain, adequate water, rail facilities, and a climate suitable for year-round training, and he decided that the area now known as Fort Bragg met all of the desired criteria.[5] Camp Bragg was named to honor a native North Carolinian, Braxton Bragg, who commanded Confederate States Army forces in the Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim was for six artillery brigades to be stationed there and $6,000,000 was spent on the land and cantonments.[6] There was an airfield on the camp used by aircraft and balloons for artillery spotters. The airfield was named Pope Field on April 1, 1919, in honor of First Lieutenant Harley H. Pope,[6] an airman who was killed while flying nearby. The work on the camp was finished on November 1, 1919.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original plan for six brigades was abandoned after World War I ended[6] and once demobilization had started. The artillery men, and their equipment and material from Camp McClellan, Alabama, were moved to Fort Bragg and testing began on long-range weapons that were a product of the war.[6] The six artillery brigades were reduced to two cantonments and a garrison was to be built for Army troops as well as a National Guard training center.[6]  In early 1921 two field artillery units, the 13th and 17th Field Artillery Brigades, began training at Camp Bragg. The same year, the Long Street Church and six acres of property were acquired for the reservation.[7]  The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the post-war cutbacks, the camp was nearly closed for good when the War department issued orders to close the camp on August 7, 1921. General Albert J. Bowley was commander at the camp and after much campaigning, and getting the Secretary of War to visit the camp, the closing order was cancelled on September 16, 1921. The Field Artillery Board was transferred to Fort Bragg on February 1, 1922.\\r\\n\\r\\nCamp Bragg was renamed Fort Bragg, to signify becoming a permanent Army post, on September 30, 1922. From 1923 to 1924 permanent structures were constructed on Fort Bragg, including four barracks.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1940, during World War II, the population of Fort Bragg had reached 5,400; however, in the following year, that number ballooned to 67,000. Various units trained at Fort Bragg during World War II, including the 9th Infantry Division, 2nd Armored Division, 82nd Airborne Division, 100th Infantry Division, and various field artillery groups. The population reached a peak of 159,000 during the war years.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing World War II, the 82nd Airborne Division was permanently stationed at Fort Bragg, the only large unit there for some time. In July 1951, the XVIII Airborne Corps was reactivated at Fort Bragg. Fort Bragg became a center for unconventional warfare, with the creation of the Psychological Warfare Center in April 1952, followed by the 10th Special Forces Group.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1961, the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was activated at Fort Bragg, with the mission of training counter-insurgency forces in Southeast Asia.  Also in 1961, the \\"Iron Mike\\" statue, a tribute to all Airborne soldiers, past, present, and future, was dedicated. In early 1962 the 326 Army Security Agency Company, de-activated after the Korean War, was reactivated at Ft. Bragg under XVIII Corps. In August of that year, an operational contingent of that Company was relocated to Homestead AFB Florida, due to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Circa 1963, that contingent was reassigned to the newly created USASA 6th Field Station.[11] More than 200,000 young men underwent basic combat training here during the period 1966ÿ70.  At the peak of the Vietnam War in 1968, Fort Bragg's military population rose to 57,840.  In June 1972, the 1st Corps Support Command arrived at Fort Bragg.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, there was a series of deployments of tenant units to the Caribbean, first to Grenada in 1983, Honduras in 1988, and to Panama in 1989. The 5th Special Forces Group departed Fort Bragg in the late 1980s.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, the XVIII Airborne Corps and the 82nd Airborne Division deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. In the mid- and late 1990s, there was increased modernization of the facilities in Fort Bragg. The World War II wooden barracks were largely removed, a new main post exchange was built, and Devers Elementary School was opened, along with several other projects.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, the units on Fort Bragg have seen a sizeable increase to their operations tempo (OPTEMPO), with units conducting two, three, or even four or more deployments to combat zones. As directed by law, and in accordance with the recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, Fort McPherson, Georgia, closed and U.S. Army Forces Command and U.S. Army Reserve Command relocated to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. A new FORSCOM/U.S. Army Reserve Command Headquarters facility completed construction at Fort Bragg in June 2011. Forces Command hosted June 24, 2011 an Army \\"Casing of the Colors\\" ceremony on Fort McPherson and an \\"uncasing of colors ceremony\\" on August 1, 2011, at Fort Bragg. On March 1, 2011, Pope Field, the former Pope Air Force Base, was absorbed into Fort Bragg.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major commands at the installation are the United States Army Forces Command, the United States Army Reserve Command, and the United States Army Special Operations Command. Several airborne and special operations units of the United States Army are stationed at Fort Bragg, notably the 82nd Airborne Division, the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne), and the Delta Force. The latter is controlled by the Joint Special Operations Command, based at Pope Field within Fort Bragg.\\r\\n\\r\\nFort Bragg is at 358'21\\" north, 7859'57\\" west (35.139064, ?78.999143).[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the post has a total area of 19.0?square miles (49.2?km2), of which, 19.0?square miles (49.1?km2) of it is land and 0.1?square miles (0.2?km2) of it is water.

This caused a tremendous problem for Fort Bragg, where many of these birds lived. Training stopped, ranges were closed, and troops were temporarily moved to other installations for training.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Army and the conservationists eventually came to an agreement, which put in place training restrictions around the woodpeckers' habitat. White stripes were painted on trees to indicate the location of the habitats, and restrictions limited the scope and duration of training that could take place within 200 feet of these locations.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the clusters of woodpeckers has more than doubled in size (200 to 493), and many of the training restrictions have been lifted.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the census[4] of 2000, there were 29,183 people, 4,315 households, and 4,215 families residing on the base.

The show focuses on the personal and professional lives of the KardashianÿJenner blended family. Its premise originated with Ryan Seacrest, who also serves as an executive producer. The series debuted on October 14, 2007 and has subsequently become one of the longest-running reality television series in the country. The fifteenth season premiered on August 5, 2018.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series focuses mainly on sisters Kourtney, Kim, and Khlo Kardashian and their half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner. It also features their parents Kris and Caitlyn Jenner (previously known as Bruce Jenner), and brother Rob Kardashian. The significant others of the Kardashian sisters have also appeared on the show, including Kourtney's ex-boyfriend Scott Disick, Kim's ex-husband Kris Humphries and Khlo's ex-husband Lamar Odom and ex-boyfriend French Montana. Caitlyn's son Brody Jenner made cameo appearances in the early seasons, before appearing regularly between the 8th and 11th seasons, along with brother Brandon and Brandon's wife Leah. Kim's friend Jonathan Cheban and Khlo's friend Malika Haqq have also been part of the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians has received very poor critical reviews since its premiere. It is often criticized for the high degree of emphasis on the \\"famous for being famous\\" concept, and for appearing to fabricate some aspects of its storylines. Several critics also noted the show's lack of intelligence.[3] However, some critics recognized the reality series as a \\"guilty pleasure\\" and acknowledged the family's success. Despite the negative reviews, Keeping Up with the Kardashians  has attracted high viewership ratings, becoming one of the network's most successful shows and winning several audience awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series' success has led additionally to the creation of numerous spin-off series, including: Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Khlo & Lamar, Kourtney and Khlo Take The Hamptons, Dash Dolls, Rob & Chyna, and Life of Kylie. The network has also broadcast several television specials featuring special events involving members of the family and friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Kardashian (1944ÿ2003) and Kristen Mary \\"Kris\\" Houghton (born 1955) married in 1978, and had four children together: daughters Kourtney (born 1979), Kim (born 1980), and Khlo (born 1984), and son Rob (born 1987). The couple divorced in 1991. In 1994, Robert rose to prominence when he defended O. J. Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman during the O.J. Simpson trial.[4][5] In 1991, Kris married retired Olympic decathlon champion Caitlyn Jenner (born 1949; formerly known as Bruce Jenner before undergoing a gender transition in 2015).[6] Kris and Caitlyn had two daughters together, Kendall (born 1995) and Kylie (born 1997). Robert died in 2003, eight weeks after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer.[7] The Kardashian sisters began appearing in the media spotlight more often. In 2004, Kim became a personal stylist for recording artist Brandy Norwood. She eventually developed into a full-time stylist, and was a personal shopper and stylist for actress Lindsay Lohan.[8] Khlo, Kim, and Kourtney ventured further into fashion, opening a high fashion boutique Dash in Calabasas, California. Throughout Kim's early career, she was involved in some high-profile relationships including Brandy Norwood's brother, singer Ray J, and later, singer Nick Lachey.[8] In 2006, Kourtney starred in her first reality television series, Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive.[9] In February 2007, a home sex video that Kim made with Ray J years earlier was leaked.[10] Vivid Entertainment bought the rights for $1 million and released the film as Kim Kardashian: Superstar on February 21.[10] Kim sued Vivid for ownership of the tape, but dropped the suit in April 2007 settling with Vivid Entertainment for $5 million.[11] It is often assumed that the release of the sex tape was a major contributor to the rising fame of Kim Kardashian and her family.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan Seacrest on developing the idea for the reality series.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of creating a reality series originated in 2006 when Kris Jenner showed an interest in appearing on a television show together with her family.[14] Jenner commented: \\"Everybody thinks that [my children] could create a bunch of drama in their lives, but it's something that I felt I didn't even have to think about. It would be natural.\\"[15] Producer Ryan Seacrest, who had his own production company, decided to develop the idea, having the popular family-based show The Osbournes in mind. He hired a camera man to visit the Kardashian's family home to film them having a Sunday barbeque: \\"They were all together  as crazy and as fun as loving as they are,\\" Seacrest described the family after seeing the tape. He later initiated the series by sharing the tape with E!, an American cable network which features mostly entertainment-related programming, and reality television series; the show was eventually picked up.[13][16] In August 2007, it was announced that the Kardashian and Jenner families would star in a yet-to-be-titled reality show on E! described as a \\"new non-scripted family sitcom\\", being produced by Ryan Seacrest and Bunim/Murray Productions. The series' announcement came one week after Paris Hilton and her friend Nicole Richie announced that their popular E! series, The Simple Life, was ending.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show, entitled Keeping Up With the Kardashians, premiered on October 14, 2007.[18] The reality series centers around the members of the Kardashian-Jenner blended family, focusing on the sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khlo. Most episodes have very similar structure: the family \\"show[s] off their privileged lifestyle and maybe get into one or two minor family squabbles before ultimately wrapping things up with a monologue that reinforces the importance of family,\\" as noted by Caroline Siede of Quartz.[19] Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described the reality series as a: \\"Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections\\".[20] Kim Kardashian described the beginning of filming the show, \\"When we first started [the show], we came together as a family and said, 'If we're going to do this reality show, we're going to be 100 percent who we really are.'\\".[21] She further commented on the show's authenticity by saying that the network \\"has never once put anything out there that we haven't approved of or accepted\\".[21] The series was renewed for a second season one month after its premiere due to high ratings.[18] Seacrest described the show's success: \\"At the heart of the seriesdespite the catfights and endless sarcasmis a family that truly loves and supports one another [] The familiar dynamics of this family make them one Hollywood bunch that is sure to entertain.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following year, Keeping Up with the Kardashians was picked up for a third season.[22] In April 2012, E! signed a three-year deal with the Kardashian family that kept the series airing through seasons seven, eight and nine.[23] Keeping up with the Kardashians was later renewed for a tenth season which premiered on March 15, 2015.[24] In February 2015, it was announced that the show had been renewed for four more years, along with an additional spin-off series, making it one of the longest-running reality television series in the country.[25][26] In terms of the show's future, Kim Kardashian has commented that the reality series could go for an indefinite number of seasons saying that she: \\"hope[s] it goes on for as long as it can.\\"[27] Keeping Up With the Kardashians, including its spin-off series, has become the cable network's flagship show and its most lucrative franchise. \\"It has changed the face of E!\\" said Lisa Berger, the network's executive producer. \\"We were a place to report on celebrity; we weren't a place to break and make celebrity, which is now the whole idea of the E! brand.\\"[28] The show's success contributed significantly towards building the \\"Kardashian brand\\", or \\"Kardashian Inc.\\" as it is called by The Hollywood Reporter. \\"These shows are a 30-minute commercial,\\" Khlo Kardashian admitted in 2011, in response to a suggestion that the television series is used to promote their retail stores and endorsement deals.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 3, 2017, it was announced the show's 10 year anniversary will premiere on September 24, 2017 following the show's season 14 premiere.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 24, 2017, it was announced the family had signed a $150 million deal with E!.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reality series revolves around the children of Kris Jenner, and originally focused mainly on the children from her first marriage to deceased attorney Robert Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khlo, and Rob. Kris' children Kendall and Kylie from her subsequent marriage to American athlete Caitlyn (formerly Bruce) Jenner have also been featured on the show since its beginning,[31][32] along with Jenner's son Brody from another marriage, although he appeared very few times during the early seasons, mostly being called by his step-brother Rob to babysit their half-sisters Kylie and Kendall.[33] Kourtney's boyfriend Scott Disick has also been appearing frequently on the show since the first season, as well as on the show's spin-offs.[31] Cast members also include numerous friends and other acquaintances of the family members, most notably Malika Haqq and Jonathan Cheban who joined Keeping Up with the Kardashians in the second and third seasons, respectively.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the Kardashian sisters' significant others have appeared on the reality series. Kim's relationship with football player Reggie Bush was featured on the show when they were dating; after the breakup, Bush commented on appearing on the show saying that he never felt comfortable being followed by cameras, adding: \\"I do it because it's important to [Kim].\\"[36] Rob's relationship with singer Adrienne Bailon has also been documented on the show when they were dating from 2007 to 2009; although Bailon later admitted that the decision to appear on the show, and be associated with the family, hurt her career.[37] Kim's eventual husband Kris Humphries first appeared on the show during the premiere of the sixth season; their relationship was chronicled throughout the season and ended with the couple's wedding special \\"Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event\\".[38] They eventually went through a highly publicized divorce; Kardashian's former publicist later claimed that Humphries was allegedly set up to be portrayed on the show in a negative way and that the short-lived marriage was staged for the cameras as a ploy to generate money.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nKhlo married basketball player Lamar Odom during a fourth-season premiere aired in 2009. He later had a major role as part of the supporting cast of the series, though he did not appear regularly during the following seasons as he was attempting to repair his marriage with Khlo.[41] Kim's current husband Kanye West made his first appearance on Keeping Up with the Kardashians in July 2012 during the seventh season when he started dating Kim.[42] However, West was seldom seen in subsequent seasons. He explained the reasons for not appearing on the show later: \\"You know, the amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore. And it's not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get.\\"[43] He also criticized the show for its cinematography and further complained about the way how the show is filmed.[44] In the eighth season, Caitlyn Jenner's sons Brandon and Brody Jenner, as well as Brandon's wife Leah, joined the cast for regular appearances.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe success of the reality series resulted in the development of several spin-off shows and other related programming. In April 2009, E! announced the first spin-off of Keeping Up with the Kardashians entitled Kourtney and Khlo in Miami, which was later renamed Kourtney and Khlo Take Miami. The series followed the sisters who moved to Miami to open a new Dash boutique. Ted Harbert, president and CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, considered the sisters capable of handling their own standalone series. \\"It's a very simple formula that we took from scripted TV and applied to a reality show. [] There are a lot of family sitcom elements to 'Kardashians,' and we think that humor and warmth will carry over to Miami,\\" Harbert added.[45] The show premiered on August 16, 2009 to very high ratings; the first episode brought in 2.7 million total viewers and then became the most-watched show on the network since The Anna Nicole Show in 2002.[46] The spin-off was subsequently renewed for a second season which premiered on June 13, 2010,[47] and later returned as Kourtney and Kim Take Miami for a third season on January 20, 2013.[48] Additionally, a series of webisodes entitled Lord Disick: Lifestyles of a Lord were released following the show, which showcased Disick as he informed viewers how to live like a \\"king\\".[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nLisa Berger, the executive vice president of the network.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2010, the network announced another spin-off called Kourtney and Kim Take New York which followed the same format as its predecessor. The show debuted on January 23, 2011, and followed the sisters who opened a Dash location in New York City.[51] The series returned for another season which premiered on November 27 the same year.[52] In January 2011, Khlo & Lamar, which featured Khlo and her husband Lamar Odom, became the third spin-off of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[53] The show premiered on April 10, 2011, and lasted two seasons.[54] In March 2014, E! announced the fourth spin-off entitled Kourtney and Khlo Take The Hamptons.[55] The series premiered on November 2, 2014, and followed Kourtney and Khlo who relocated to the Hamptons to work on opening a new Dash pop-up store.[56] The fifth spin-off series called Dash Dolls premiered on September 20, 2015. The reality series chronicles the daily life of the employees of the Dash boutique in Los Angeles.[57] In June 2016, the network announced another show entitled Rob & Chyna which premiered on September 11 the same year, and follows the relationship of Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna as they prepare to welcome their first child.[58] The show was later renewed for a second season.[59] In July 2017, E! confirmed the series was put on hold, and not on their current schedule.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe network has also aired several television specials featuring important family events. A two-part television event called \\"Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event\\", showcasing the wedding between Kim and Kris Humphries, was broadcast on October 9 and 10, 2011 as part of the sixth season; the special was highly successful with a combined 10.5 million viewers.[61] A few days after Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce) came out as a trans woman during a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer in May 2015, E! aired a two-part special on Keeping Up with the Kardashians entitled \\"About Bruce\\", in which another side of the story was told featuring family members who were not involved in the previous interview on 20/20.[62] The first part of the special debuted on May 17, 2015, and attracted 2.92 million total viewers, a 40% increase from the previous episode, while the second part aired the following day with similar viewership.[63] I Am Cait, a separate documentary series, was announced immediately after the 20/20 interview. Jeff Olde, head of programming at E! network, said that the series is \\"not at all a Kardashian spin-off\\", and that \\"we will not resort to spectacle,\\" trying to emphasize its distinct format that is entirely different from most programming on the network, including Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[64] The eight-part, one-hour docuseries debuted on July 26, 2015, on E!, and focused on how Jenner was handling the aftermath of the transition; it also attempted to deal with various LGBT-related issues.[65][66] It was later cancelled after two seasons.[67] In April 2017, it was announced E! had ordered an 8-episode spin-off Life of Kylie revolving around Kylie Jenner. It premiered on August 6, 2017.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nRob Sheffield from Rolling Stone[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians has been the subject of constant panning by critics since its inception. Brian Lowry, reviewing the show for Variety, said that the network: \\"widens its lens to encompass the whole irritating brood  including Kim's sisters Khlo and Kourtney, mom-manager Kris and stepdad Bruce Jenner, who now has the distinction of having two sets of useless rich kids featured in pointless reality shows.\\"[70] Ginia Bellafonte of The New York Times compared the show to reality series Gene Simmons Family Jewels and exclaimed that: \\"the Kardashian show is not about an eccentric family living conventionally; it is purely about some desperate women climbing to the margins of fame, and that feels a lot creepier.\\"[71] Laura Burrows of IGN criticized the family for being too self-seeking and using the given platform only to gain more notoriety for themselves. Following the conclusion of the second season of the series, Burrows wrote: \\"Those of us who watch this show [] want to believe that these whores of attention have souls and would actually do something for their fellow man and not reap the benefits of their service, but two seasons' worth of self-absorbed egocentrism speaks to the contrary.\\"[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoxana Hadadi, reviewing Keeping Up with the Kardashians for The Washington Post, was extremely negative towards the reality series due to its absurdity, and commented that the show: \\"firmly captures all of Kim and Co.'s dumbest instances from the series' debut  from the simply self-absorbed to the downright despicable.\\"[73] Amaya Rivera, writing about the series for Popmatters, noted: \\"Indeed, there is something disturbing about the Kardashians' intense hunger for fame. But even worseit is downright boring to watch this family live out their tedious lives.\\"[74] John Kubicek, the senior writer of BuddyTV, reviewed the premiere of the third season of the show and discussed the reason for the family's success by saying that: \\"the Kardashians' fame is a lot like M?bius strip or an M. C. Escher painting.\\"[75] Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described Keeping Up with the Kardashians as a: \\"Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections\\".[20] Jessica Chasmar of The Washington Times said that series: \\"illustrates our nation's moral, spiritual and cultural decay.\\" Chasmar emphasized its negative influence and noted: \\"America of 50 years ago would regard Ms. Kardashian with a mixture of disdain and pity, embarrassed by the very idea of a young lady's most private moments being broadcast for all the world to see.\\"[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoal Auzeen Saedi, reviewing Keeping Up with the Kardashians for Psychology Today, emphasized the show's influence saying that: \\"The Kardashians become more relatable the more famous they become.\\" Saedi also questioned their decision to appear on the show and added: \\"But if living life in the spotlight is so taxing and demands multiple justifications for the way your life is being lived and criticized, perhaps you can take the cameras out of your house.\\"[77] Vinnie Mancuso, writing for New York Observer, criticized the show and felt: \\"roughly one iota of shadenfreudic pleasure from this endeavor, but for the most part this show is the 100% drizzling poops.\\"[78] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News, reviewing the tenth season, said that \\"even when you think something about the Kardashians could be interesting, it's not,\\" adding that the \\"entertainment value [of the show] is like having spent 10 years in Rapid City, S.D., watching the traffic lights change.\\"[79] Amy Amatangelo of The Hollywood Reporter said that \\"in true Kardashian fashion, they managed to make everything about them,\\" after Caitlyn Jenner came out as a trans woman to her family in the \\"About Bruce\\" special aired as part of the tenth season. Amatangelo felt that the conversations \\"seemed a little too staged, too controlled\\", and noted that \\"there was no attempt to educate the viewers about transgender issues.\\"[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nGareth Dimelow from Sabotage Times[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, several critics were more positive towards the show. A number of publications welcomed the show as \\"guilty pleasure\\", including The Huffington Post, The Atlantic, and The Week.[82][83][84] Tim Stack, writing for Entertainment Weekly, described the reality series as: \\"my favorite little slice of reality TV spongecake.\\"[85] Lauren Le Vine of Refinery29 appreciated the success of the family which \\"achieved the American dream of making something out of nothing,\\" using the given platform.[86] Libby Hill of The A.V. Club also acknowledged the show's success and said: \\"Keeping Up With The Kardashians gives us real, joyous, ugly, unsavory, hilarious life, with all the polished sitcom trappings. And though the latter may have launched a multimedia empire, the former has made it last\\".[87] Maura Kelly of The Guardian evaluated the aftermath of the failed wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries, which was documented on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and subsequently caused public outrage, including an online protest petition to cancel the show. \\"Since Kim doesn't exactly seem to be an exemplar of self-awareness, I suppose it's possible that she really believed she and Humphries would live happily ever after,\\" Kelly speculated whether or not the marriage was a publicity stunt. \\"But more likely, she and E! are laughing all the way to the bank ÿ 10.5 million viewers tuned into \\"Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event\\", after all,\\" Kelly summarized the controversy.[88] Josh Duboff, writing for Vanity Fair, commented on the show's long run and said that \\"it is near impossible to argue that their continued relevance, 10 years later, is anything other than awe-inspiring and remarkable\\".[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nE! President Suzanne Kolb discusses the popularity of the series in an interview with The Wrap.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians has been a ratings success for E! ÿ in its first month it became the highest-rated series aired on Sunday nights for adults 18ÿ34 and was seen by 1.3 million total viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research.[18][91] Lisa Berger, executive vice president of original programming and series development for E!, said: \\"The buzz surrounding the series is huge, and viewers have clearly fallen for the Kardashians. [] Seacrest and Bunim-Murray's unique ability to capture this family's one-of-a-kind dynamics and hilarious antics has made the series a fantastic addition to our prime-time lineup.\\"[18] The second season continued the success and was viewed by 1.6 million viewers on average, which led to a third season renewal.[92] The two-hour fourth-season premiere, which aired on November 8, 2009, and featured the wedding ceremony of Khlo and Lamar Odom, brought in then-record ratings with 3.2 million viewers.[93] The subsequent season debuted with nearly 4.7 million total viewers, which ranked as the highest-rated season premiere of the show, as of August 2015.[94] It was also the second highest-rated episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, second only to the previous season's record-breaking finale with 4.8 million viewers.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seventh-season premiere of the series, which aired on May 20, 2012 in its earlier timeslot, continued to deliver high ratings attracting almost three million total viewers which exceeded the premiere of the previous season by 16%.[96] Kim Kardashian has explained the success of the show by saying that people tune in to watch the series because they can relate themselves to the members of the family; in an interview with the V magazine she said: \\"You can see that soap operas aren't on the air as much anymore. I think reality shows are taking over that genre, but I think the draw to our show is that we are relatable.\\"[97] The eighth season debuted to 3 million viewers, up 6% from the previous season, while the subsequent ninth season's premiere was down by 20%.[98][99] The ninth season averaged 3.3 million total viewers and almost 2.2 million in the 18ÿ49 years adult demographic, the most sought after by advertisers.

The restaurant is sandwiched between two other commercial buildings, one of which houses \\"It's Your Funeral Home and Crematorium\\", whose owner Mort is a regular at the restaurant. One of the show's running gags involves the other building, which is generally vacant during episodes but has been home to such businesses as \\"Uncle Marty's Breast Pumps\\", \\"Extra Moist Yoga\\", \\"That's A-Door-A-Bell Doorbells\\", and \\"Tire-Rhea\\".\\r\\nSuccess is not easy, as Bob must compete with several other eateries for business. His biggest rival is Jimmy Pesto's Pizzeria, which is located right across the street. It reels in way more customers than Bob's Burgers, creating tension between the two owners. Jimmy particularly enjoys humiliating Bob, an example being when he got a higher score on an arcade machine than Bob, who had rented the game, and taunted him by putting \\"BOB SUX\\" as his initials. The hatred between Bob and Jimmy Pesto is full of humor as although they dislike each other very much, Bob's daughter, Tina, shows obsessive interest toward Pesto's son, Jimmy Jr. However, it is often unclear how Jimmy Jr. feels toward Tina, although he always tries to get her back when she strays.. He approves of her erotic friend fiction, starring himself, in \\"Bad Tina\\", but tends to forget they are dating because he is always occupied with activities, such as spending time with best friend and wrestling buddy, Zeke, and dancing by himself.[clarification needed]\\r\\nBob's restaurant also has seen its fair share of bad luck. For example, in the show's opening, the property falls victim to a fire, an infestation of vermin, and a broken front window caused by a car knocking down a utility pole. In spite of all this, Bob does have a small but loyal group of regular customers, including the aforementioned Mort and Teddy, the local handyman.\\r\\nThe Belcher family runs a hamburger restaurant. Bob is the restaurant's owner and husband to the fun-loving and happy-go-lucky Linda. Their three children are Tina, the oldest, Gene, the only boy, and Louise, the youngest. All three kids help out around the restaurant to some extent. Louise is somewhat of a precocious menace and an instigator of many of the debacles that face the Belcher family. Tina is awkward, but full of heart, and muddles her way through her pubescent experiences, such as leg waxing and strong fixations on neighborhood boys. Gene is the more light hearted goofball type and aspires to be a great musician. His musical numbers are often featured throughout the show, though Linda is very musical herself. One of her songs from Episode 5 Season 3, \\"An Indecent Thanksgiving Proposal,\\" gained so much popularity that it was covered by the band The National.[13] Of all the musical numbers throughout the first three seasons however, the show's writers dub \\"Electric Love\\" as the best musical number so far. This song is written by Gene and featured in the episode \\"Topsy\\" from season 3.[14]\\r\\nThere are various recurring characters in the series including Jimmy Pesto, Sr., Bob's rival who owns a pizzeria across the street, and his sons Jimmy Jr. (Tina's love interest) and hyperactive twins Andy and Ollie, who are friends of Louise. Other recurring characters include the aforementioned Mort and Teddy, as well as Linda's eccentric sister Gayle, and the Belchers' sometimes-meddling landlord, Calvin Fischoeder.\\r\\nCreator Loren Bouchard said Bob's Burgers came about because Fox's animation brand centers mostly on family, but he also wanted to dabble in workplace comedy.[15] The show has generally been viewed as a spiritual successor to King of the Hill, which carried less emphasis on shock comedy and focused more on character-driven humor; Bob's Burgers executive producer Jim Dauterive worked on King of the Hill for nearly its entire run.[16]\\r\\nBefore the show was aired, the team created a proof of concept so Fox Broadcasting Company knew what to expect if they bought the show. Jay Howell had his art featured in a test animation based on Bob forgetting about his and Linda's wedding anniversary. The actual show has never used a word that needed to be censored by the network. The proof of concept eventually turned into the pilot episode. It had the same synopsis as the official pilot (aired in 2011) but had both cosmetic and substantial differences. These included:\\r\\nThe original pilot can be seen on the DVD release of the first season, released on April 17, 2012.[17]\\r\\nBob's Burgers first appeared on the development slate at Fox on August 6, 2009.[18] On December 1, 2009, Fox ordered 13 episodes for the first season.[19] On May 17, 2010, Fox placed the series on the primetime slate for the 2010ÿ11 television season.[20] A special preview aired on Thanksgiving on November 25, 2010.[21]\\r\\nCreator Loren Bouchard serves as the executive producer, alongside developer Jim Dauterive. They have served as executive producers since the first season. Dan Fybel and Rich Rinaldi were promoted to executive producers during season 6.\\r\\nThe team of writers includes Loren Bouchard, Jim Dauterive, Scott Jacobson, Lizzie Molyneux, Wendy Molyneux, Holly Schlesinger, Nora Smith, Steven Davis, Kelvin Yu, Dan Fybel, Rich Rinaldi, Greg Thompson, and Jon Schroeder. Past writers on the show include Kit Boss, Aron Abrams and Mike Benner. H. Jon Benjamin, Rachel Hastings, Justin Hook, Dan Mintz, and Mike Olsen have also written or co-written episodes. After the writing has been completed, the voice actors read the script as written, but later are allowed to improvise lines. The editors and writer decide what improvised lines make the final cut.\\r\\nBob's Burgers has five main cast members: H. Jon Benjamin as Bob Belcher, John Roberts as Linda Belcher, Dan Mintz as Tina Belcher, Eugene Mirman as Gene Belcher, and Kristen Schaal as Louise Belcher.[22]\\r\\nThe components of a burger fall into place on a white screen, and Bob's hands appear underneath to hold it. The other family members appear around him one at a time, beginning with Linda and ending with Louise. Linda puts her arm around Bob, Tina stands there expressionless, Gene plays a sound effect on his keyboard, and Louise poses for the camera. The restaurant then materializes behind them and the neighboring businesses slide into place, with a funeral parlor at screen left, and the street slides into view in front. A \\"Grand Opening\\" banner is placed over the door, followed by a series of mishaps. First, the restaurant catches on fire. Then, vermin come running toward the restaurant as an exterminator pulls up in a van. Lastly, a car crashes into the utility pole next to the funeral home, which causes the pole to fall through the front window of the restaurant. A new banner is hung up after each event: \\"Grand Re-Opening,\\" \\"Grand Re-Re-Opening,\\" and finally \\"Grand Re-Re-Re-Opening.\\" The camera then zooms in on the burger Bob is holding, and the view fades in to the start of the episode.\\r\\nAs with other Fox animated series such as Futurama, The Simpsons and American Dad!, the show employs the \\"changing element\\" running gag in its opening credits. The gag present on Bob's Burgers involves the store located to the right of the restaurant, which has a new, humorously named client in every episode (such as \\"Betty's Machetes\\" in \\"Purple Rain-Union\\"). Additionally, beginning with Season 2, the pest control van in the sequence has the name of a different company on each episode; the van read \\"Rat's all Folks! Exterminators\\" on all episodes of Season 1. On certain episodes, an element is changed for a special night (a flash frame saying \\"HAPPY HALLOWEEN\\" was shown during the title sequence of \\"Fort Night\\").\\r\\nIn an article written by the writers of the show ranking the best 10 musical numbers of the first three seasons, it is explained by show creator and theme composer Loren Bouchard that the ukulele track heard in the theme is an edited version of the first recording he did as well as the first take in 2008. Bouchard explains that if the EQ is taken off the original track, there is noise audible from the nightclub below the apartment he was living in when he recorded the theme.[14]\\r\\nThe credits sequence of Bob's Burgers often features the Belcher family at work. The scene is the kitchen of Bob's Burgers drawn with a black outline over a white background and the characters in full color, with the credits off to the right hand side. The sequence consists of Bob cooking a burger and Louise and Tina doing prep. Bob places the burger on the plate for Louise to give to Linda, who takes it from the window, and a few seconds later Gene walks through the kitchen wearing his burger costume.\\r\\nAlthough the kitchen scene is still the main closing sequence the show uses, beginning in season two the producers began to use different elements from the show in the credits. Some examples:\\r\\nOther times, the scene will play out as usual, but with something from the episode going on in the background, etc. For instance:\\r\\nEvery episode features one or more \\"Today's Special\\" burgers on a chalk board on the wall behind the counter. The name of the special is usually a play on words that indicates what comes on the burger (ex.: \\"It's Fun to Eat at the rYe M C A Burger\\": Comes with Rye, Mustard, Cheese, and Avocado). Other \\"Special\\" burgers are also mentioned by the family without being written on their chalkboard. The joke is often that the play on words is overly complex or obscure.\\r\\nThe first season through the current season of the show are available on the iTunes Store for download. The first 6 seasons are available from Amazon Video. Seasons 1-7 are available on Hulu .\\r\\nBob's Burgers initially received mixed reviews for season 1, with a Metacritic score of 54 out of 100.[28] However, by season 2, the ratings had reached a score of 78 out of 100, proving a rise in popularity with praises about its \\"daffy comedic momentum\\" and how it is \\"new and fresh.\\" [29] Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season a 58% from the collective critic feedback, admitting while it has potential, it needs to find its \\"rhythm.\\" [30] The Washington Post described the show as \\"pointlessly vulgar and derivatively dull\\", while Reuters stated that \\"It's unwise ÿ and unnecessary ÿ to launch an animated sitcom on Fox that appears intent to ape the vulgarity quotient of Family Guy.\\"[31][32] USA Today stated that \\"Bob's Burgers isn't very tasty\\" describing the comedy as just \\"lop[ing] along, stumbling from one tasteless moment to the next\\"[33] The New York Times described the show as having \\"a lackadaisical vibe; its humor, no matter how anarchic, slides by in a deadpan monotone.\\"[34]\\r\\nHowever, as the first season progressed and concluded and the second began, critics began giving the series praise. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club has recalled, \\"...the show was amusing, yes, and there was certainly potential, but it took half a dozen episodes before it really began to meet that potential.\\"[35] Season 2 has a Metacritic score of 78 out 100.[36] The first season is considered by many fans as very rough in comparison to the quality in later seasons.\\r\\nEntertainment Weekly gave the show an A- grade in its review, remarking that \\"a comedy this well done is very rare indeed\\".[37] Ain't It Cool News called Bob's Burgers \\"perhaps the funniest half-hour currently airing on broadcast TV.\\"[38] In its review, CNN called the show \\"wickedly funny\\" and said there are \\"too many highlights to list here\\".[39] Speaking about the show during its second season, The A.V. Club reviewer Rowan Kaiser said: \\"After an uneven start, Bob's Burgers is becoming one of television's best comedies!\\"[40] Since the debut of season two of the series, the show's positive reception has increased.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe A.V. Club voted Bob's Burgers as the 10th best TV show of 2012,[41] the 3rd best show of 2013,[42] the 20th best show of 2014,[43] and the 35th best show of 2015.[44]\\r\\nAfter airing, the show became the highest-rated series premiere of the season and also finished 9th in the ratings for the week it aired.[74][75] Despite this, the ratings went on a slide with ratings expert Bill Gorman of TV by the Numbers calling it a \\"toss up\\" for renewal before the series was renewed for a second season[76] which premiered on March 11, 2012.\\r\\nAdult Swim acquired the rights to air Bob's Burgers in 2013. Episodes air six nights a week, with a 1:30 am airing on Sunday and 8:30 pm airings Monday through Friday. An additional episode airs every Monday through Thursday at 9:00 pm. Adult Swim currently has rights to all five seasons of Bob's Burgers and recently began airing the season five episodes on Mondays.[98]\\r\\n20th Television began distributing Bob's Burgers to local stations in 2015. The syndication package began airing on its affiliates on the weekend of September 19ÿ20, 2015, and two episodes air each weekend.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe series also premiered on September 26, 2016 on TBS and airs Mondays afternoons (along with Family Guy, American Dad!, and The Cleveland Show) and on Friday nights.[99]\\r\\nOn January 6, 2011, some Fatburger locations were re-branded as Bob's Burgers for the day as a promotion.[100] It also offered limited-time offers, such as a free burger giveaway, and a special, \\"The Thanks a Brunch Burger\\", on the menu until February 2011.[100] There were also \\"Bob's Burgers\\" coupons offered for a free medium Fatburger special.[100][101] Across the United States, 4 locations were re-branded as Bob's Burgers, in California, New Jersey, Nevada, and Illinois.[100][101] At least one restaurant location in California continues to use the Bob's Burgers appellation into 2016.\\r\\nIn the Family Guy episode \\"Space Cadet\\", the principal shows Peter and Lois a picture of Bob Belcher as a sign that Chris is doing poorly in his Advanced Art class. Peter mutters \\"I'm very embarrassed\\", and the principal replies \\"Yeah, well, someone should be.\\" In \\"Boopa-dee Bappa-dee\\", Louise is one of many characters Stewie is turned into by Peter using a remote control. Bob's Burgers is also mentioned on \\"He's Bla-ack!\\", as one of the reasons why The Cleveland Show did not succeed.\\r\\nThe season 4 premiere episode of Archer features a crossover where the Belcher family is shown, but Bob is revealed to be Sterling Archer (also voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) in a fugue state. Archer has taken the place of Bob Belcher, with Bob inexplicably missing. The menu board touts the \\"Thomas Elphinstone Hambledurger, with Manning Coleslaw\\", a play on amnesiac secret agent Tommy Hambledon, a character in a series of novels by Manning Coles.\\r\\n\\"Homerland\\", the season 25 premiere episode of The Simpsons, features a couch gag in which the Belcher family (skinned yellow according to the standard character coloring of the series) attend a 25th anniversary party in the Simpson family living room with the main characters of their fellow Animation Domination series. Bob made another cameo in the episode \\"The Girl Code\\", where a picture of him is shown, and explaining that the restaurant was boycotted by short people due to an offensive Burger of the Day.\\r\\nBob makes a cameo appearance in the hour-long Simpsons-Family Guy crossover \\"The Simpsons Guy\\".[102] He appears on the same airplane as Homer and Peter in a cutaway about them being a greater team than the Air Force. Peter remarks to Homer that they have to carry Bob, and then Peter points to Cleveland's plane and says \\"We let that other guy try and look what happened.\\" Cleveland, repeatedly saying \\"no\\", crashes in flames. This is a reference to the poor ratings of Bob's Burgers and the cancellation of The Cleveland Show.[103]\\r\\nIn Aqua Teen Hunger Force a character previously known as Dr. Eugene Mirman (obviously played by himself) was renamed to Dr. Gene Belcher in the episode \\"Hospice\\". The character's name was revealed on Aqua Teen Hunger Force's creator, Dave Willis' Twitter account two hours before the episode. The character had been introduced in 2006, which was 5 years before Bob's Burgers aired.[104]\\r\\nSeattle rock band Sleater-Kinney collaborated with Bob's Burgers and its crew for their 2015 single \\"A New Wave\\", off of the album No Cities to Love. The resultant music video featured the band, animated in the cartoon's style, performing for the Belcher children in Tina's bedroom.[105][106][107]\\r\\nIn 2016, The Bob's Burgers Burger Book, edited by series creator Bouchard, was released.

Though there is no certain evidence of a pre-Christian Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible, some scholars have suggested that Jewish congregations in Rome and the Western part of the Roman Empire may have used Latin translations of fragments of the Hebrew Bible.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known translations into Latin consist of a number of piecework translations during the early Church period. Collectively, these versions are known as the Vetus Latina and closely follow the Greek Septuagint. The Septuagint was the usual source for these anonymous translators, and they reproduce its variations from the Hebrew Masoretic Text.  They were never rendered independently from the Hebrew or Greek; they vary widely in readability and quality, and contain many solecisms in idiom, some by the translators themselves, others from literally translating Greek language idioms into Latin.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier translations were made mainly obsolete by St. Jerome's Vulgate version of the Bible. Jerome knew Hebrew, and revised and unified the Latin Bibles of the time to bring them into conformity with the Hebrew as he understood it. The liturgical Psalms, however, are often taken from the older Latin bibles. \\r\\nAs discussed in the Vulgate article, there are several different editions of the Vulgate, including the Clementine Vulgate (1592), and two major modern revisions; the Stuttgart Vulgate (1969), and the Nova Vulgata (NT 1971, OT 1979). These represent various attempts to either revise or modernise the Vulgate, or to recover Jerome's original text.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from full Old Testaments, there are more versions of the Psalms only, three of them by Jerome, one from the Greek Vulgate, one from the Hexapla, and one from the Hebrew: These are the Versio Romana \\"Roman version\\", Versio Gallicana \\"Gallican version\\" (the standard), Versio juxta Hebraicum Jerome's Hebrew-based psalter, respectively. Other versions include the Versio ambrosiana \\"version of Saint Ambrose,\\"  Versio Piana \\"version of Pius XII,\\" and so on.  \\r\\nSee the main Vulgate article for a comparison of Psalm 94.\\r\\n\\r\\nMetrical Latin Bible translations are primarily Psalm paraphrases, or paraphrases of Song of Songs, Lamentations,[3] in Latin verse which appeared in the 16th century, then abruptly disappeared.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1527, Xanthus Pagninus produced his Veteris et Novi Testamenti nova translatio, notable for its literal rendering of the Hebrew. This version was also the first to introduce  verse numbers in the New Testament, although the system used here did not become widely adopted; the system used in Robertus Stephanus's Vulgate would later become the standard for dividing the New Testament.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Protestant Reformation, several new Latin translations were produced:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1907 Pope Pius X proposed that the Latin text of Saint Jerome be recovered using the principles of Textual criticism as a basis for a new official translation of the Bible into Latin.[12] This revision ultimately led to the Nova Vulgata issued by Pope John Paul II in 1978.[13] This final revision was intended to be a correction to the Vulgate based on the critical Greek and Hebrew edition, while retaining as much as possible of the Vulgate's language.","input":"When was the bible first written in latin?"},{"output":"original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs","context":"Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding[1][2]) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.\\r\\nRelated tasks include testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code, implementation of the build system, and management of derived artifacts such as machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of source code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProgrammable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD, when the automata of Al-Jazari were programmable, via pegs and cams, to play various rhythms and drum patterns;[3] and the 1801 Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the \\"program\\" - a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.\\r\\nHowever, the first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.[4]\\r\\nIn the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.[5] Later a control panel (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way; as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computers introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.\\r\\nMachine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine, often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language, any two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.\\r\\nHigh-level languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are more abstract, and less bound to the underlying hardware. They harness the power of computers to make programming easier[6] by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula directly (e.g., Y = X*2 + 5*X + 9). FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957[7] and many other languages were soon developed - in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.\\r\\nPrograms were mostly still entered using punched cards or paper tape. See computer programming in the punch card era. By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers. Text editors were developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards.\\r\\nWhatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The following properties are among the most important:\\r\\nIn computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, control flow, and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability, usability and most importantly maintainability.\\r\\nReadability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to bugs, inefficiencies, and duplicated code. A study[9] found that a few simple readability transformations made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.\\r\\nFollowing a consistent programming style often helps readability. However, readability is more than just programming style. Many factors, having little or nothing to do with the ability of the computer to efficiently compile and execute the code, contribute to readability.[10] Some of these factors include:\\r\\nThe presentation aspects of this (such as indents, line breaks, color highlighting, and so on) are often handled by the source code editor, but the content aspects reflect the programmer's talent and skills.\\r\\nVarious visual programming languages have also been developed with the intent to resolve readability concerns by adopting non-traditional approaches to code structure and display. Integrated development environments (IDEs) aim to integrate all such help. Techniques like Code refactoring can enhance readability.\\r\\nThe academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problem. For this purpose, algorithms are classified into orders using so-called Big O notation, which expresses resource use, such as execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.\\r\\nThe first step in most formal software development processes is requirements analysis, followed by testing to determine value modeling, implementation, and failure elimination (debugging). There exist a lot of differing approaches for each of those tasks. One approach popular for requirements analysis is Use Case analysis. Many programmers use forms of Agile software development where the various stages of formal software development are more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather than years. There are many approaches to the Software development process.\\r\\nPopular modeling techniques include Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) and Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA.\\r\\nA similar technique used for database design is Entity-Relationship Modeling (ER Modeling).\\r\\nImplementation techniques include imperative languages (object-oriented or procedural), functional languages, and logic languages.\\r\\nIt is very difficult to determine what are the most popular of modern programming languages. Methods of measuring programming language popularity include: counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language,[11] the number of books sold and courses teaching the language (this overestimates the importance of newer languages), and estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language (this underestimates the number of users of business languages such as COBOL).\\r\\nSome languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications, while some languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications. For example, COBOL is still strong in corporate data centers[12] often on large mainframe computers, Fortran in engineering applications, scripting languages in Web development, and C in embedded software. Many applications use a mix of several languages in their construction and use. New languages are generally designed around the syntax of a prior language with new functionality added, (for example C++ adds object-orientation to C, and Java adds memory management and bytecode to C++, but as a result, loses efficiency and the ability for low-level manipulation).\\r\\nDebugging is a very important task in the software development process since having defects in a program can have significant consequences for its users. Some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because their specification does not require compilers to perform as much checking as other languages. Use of a static code analysis tool can help detect some possible problems. Normally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce the problem. This can be a non-trivial task, for example as with parallel processes or some unusual software bugs. Also, specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem.\\r\\nAfter the bug is reproduced, the input of the program may need to be simplified to make it easier to debug. For example, a bug in a compiler can make it crash when parsing some large source file. However, after simplification of the test case, only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash. Such simplification can be done manually, using a divide-and-conquer approach. The programmer will try to remove some parts of original test case and check if the problem still exists. When debugging the problem in a GUI, the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear.\\r\\nDebugging is often done with IDEs like Eclipse, Visual Studio, Xcode, Kdevelop, NetBeans and Code::Blocks. Standalone debuggers like GDB are also used, and these often provide less of a visual environment, usually using a command line. Some text editors such as Emacs allow GDB to be invoked through them, to provide a visual environment.\\r\\nDifferent programming languages support different styles of programming (called programming paradigms). The choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from \\"low-level\\" to \\"high-level\\"; \\"low-level\\" languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas \\"high-level\\" languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. It is usually easier to code in \\"high-level\\" languages than in \\"low-level\\" ones.\\r\\nAllen Downey, in his book How To Think Like A Computer Scientist, writes:\\r\\nMany computer languages provide a mechanism to call functions provided by shared libraries. Provided the functions in a library follow the appropriate run-time conventions (e.g., method of passing arguments), then these functions may be written in any other language.\\r\\nComputer programmers are those who write computer software.

The Russian Empire collapsed with the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II and the old regime was replaced by a provisional government during the first revolution of February 1917 (March in the Gregorian calendar; the older Julian calendar was in use in Russia at the time). Alongside it arose grassroots community assemblies (called 'soviets') which contended for authority. In the second revolution that October, the Provisional Government was toppled and all power was given to the soviets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe February Revolution (March 1917) was a revolution focused around Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg), the capital of Russia at that time. In the chaos, members of the Imperial parliament (the Duma) assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government which was heavily dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the noble aristocracy. The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution, resulting in Nicholas's abdication. The soviets, which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial working class, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule, but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias. The February Revolution took place in the context of heavy military setbacks during the First World War (1914ÿ18), which left much of the Russian Army in a state of mutiny.\\r\\n\\r\\nA period of dual power ensued, during which the Provisional Government held state power while the national network of soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and, increasingly, the left-leaning urban middle class. During this chaotic period there were frequent mutinies, protests and many strikes. Many socialist political organizations were engaged in daily struggle and vied for influence within the Duma and the soviets, central among which were the Bolsheviks (\\"Ones of the Majority\\") led by Vladimir Lenin who campaigned for an immediate end to the war, land to the peasants, and bread to the workers. When the Provisional Government chose to continue fighting the war with Germany, the Bolsheviks and other socialist factions were able to exploit virtually universal disdain towards the war effort as justification to advance the revolution further. The Bolsheviks turned workers' militias under their control into the Red Guards (later the Red Army) over which they exerted substantial control.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the October Revolution (November in the Gregorian calendar), the Bolsheviks led an armed insurrection by workers and soldiers in Petrograd that successfully overthrew the Provisional Government, transferring all its authority to the soviets with the capital being relocated to Moscow shortly thereafter. The Bolsheviks had secured a strong base of support within the soviets and, as the now supreme governing party, established a federal government dedicated to reorganizing the former empire into the world's first socialist republic, practicing soviet democracy on a national and international scale. The promise to end Russia's participation in the First World War was honored promptly with the Bolshevik leaders signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany in March 1918. To further secure the new state, the Cheka was established which functioned as a revolutionary security service that sought to weed out and punish those considered to be \\"enemies of the people\\" in campaigns consciously modeled on similar events during the French Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after, civil war erupted among the \\"Reds\\" (Bolsheviks), the \\"Whites\\" (counter-revolutionaries), the independence movements and the non-Bolshevik socialists. It continued for several years, during which the Bolsheviks defeated both the Whites and all rival socialists and thereafter reconstituted themselves as the Communist Party. In this way, the Revolution paved the way for the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922. While many notable historical events occurred in Moscow and Petrograd, there was also a visible movement in cities throughout the state, among national minorities throughout the empire and in the rural areas, where peasants took over and redistributed land.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian Revolution of 1905 was said to be a major factor contributing to the cause of the Revolutions of 1917. The events of Bloody Sunday triggered nationwide protests and soldier mutinies. A council of workers called the St. Petersburg Soviet was created in this chaos.[2] While the 1905 Revolution was ultimately crushed, and the leaders of the St. Petersburg Soviet were arrested, this laid the groundwork for the later Petrograd Soviet and other revolutionary movements during the leadup to 1917. The 1905 Revolution also led to the creation of a Duma (parliament), that would later form the Provisional Government following February 1917.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outbreak of World War I prompted general outcry directed at Tsar Nicholas II and the Romanov family. While the nation was initially caught up in a wave of nationalism, increasing numbers of defeats and poor conditions soon made the opposite true. The Tsar attempted to remedy the situation by taking personal control of the army in 1915. This proved disastrous, as the Tsar was now held personally responsible for Russia's continuing defeats and losses. In addition, the Tsarina Alexandra, left to rule in while the Tsar was commanding at the front, was German born, leading to suspicion of collusion, only exacerbated by rumors relating to her relationship with the controversial mystic Rasputin. Rasputin's influence led to disastrous ministerial appointments and corruption, resulting in a worsening of conditions within Russia. This led to general dissatisfaction with the Romanov family, and was a major factor contributing to the retaliation of the Russian Communists against the royal family.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the entry of the Ottoman Empire on the side of the Central Powers in October 1914, Russia was deprived of a major trade route through the Dardanelles, which further contributed to the economic crisis, in which Russia became incapable of providing munitions to their army in the years leading to 1917. However, the problems were primarily administrative, and not industrial, as Germany was producing great amounts of munitions whilst constantly fighting on two major battlefronts.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conditions during the war resulted in devastating loss of morale within the Russian army, as well as the general population. This was particularly apparent in the cities, owing to a lack of food in response to the disruption of agriculture. Food scarcity had become a considerable problem in Russia, but the cause of this did not lie in any failure of the harvests, which had not been significantly altered during wartime. The indirect reason was that the government, in order to finance the war, had been printing millions of ruble notes, and by 1917 inflation had made prices increase up to four times what they had been in 1914. Farmers were consequently faced with a higher cost of living, but little increase in income. As a result, they tended to hoard their grain and to revert to subsistence farming. Thus the cities were constantly short of food. At the same time, rising prices led to demands for higher wages in the factories, and in January and February 1916 revolutionary propaganda, in part aided by German funds, led to widespread strikes. This resulted in a growing criticism of the government, including an increased participation of workers in revolutionary parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiberal parties too had an increased platform to voice their complaints, as the initial fervor of the war had resulted in the Tsarist government creating a variety of political organizations.  In July 1915, a Central War Industries Committee was established under the chairmanship of a prominent Octobrist, Alexander Guchkov (1862-1936), including ten workers' representatives. The Petrograd Mensheviks agreed to join despite the objections of their leaders abroad. All this activity gave renewed encouragement to political ambitions, and, in September 1915, a combination of Octobrists and Kadets in the Duma demanded the forming of a responsible government. The Tsar rejected these proposals.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these factors had given rise to a sharp loss of confidence in the regime, even within the ruling class, growing throughout the war. Early in 1916, Guchkov discussed with senior army officers and members of the Central War Industries Committee about a possible coup to force the abdication of the Tsar. In December, a small group of nobles assassinated Rasputin, and in January 1917 the Tsar's uncle, Grand Duke Nicholas, was asked indirectly by Prince Lvov whether he would be prepared to take over the throne from his nephew, Tsar Nicholas II. None of these incidents were in themselves the immediate cause of the February Revolution, but they do help to explain why the monarchy survived only a few days after it had broken out.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Socialist Revolutionary leaders in exile, many of them living in Switzerland, had been the glum spectators of the collapse of international socialist solidarity. French and German Social Democrats had voted in favour of their respective governments' war efforts. Georgi Plekhanov in Paris had adopted a violently anti-German stand, while Parvus supported the German war effort as the best means of ensuring a revolution in Russia. The Mensheviks largely maintained that Russia had the right to defend herself against Germany, although Martov (a prominent Menshevik), now on the left of his group, demanded an end to the war and a settlement on the basis of national self-determination, with no annexations or indemnities.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was these views of Martov that predominated in a manifesto drawn up by Leon Trotsky (at the time a Menshevik) at a conference in Zimmerwald, attended by 35 Socialist leaders in September 1915. Inevitably Vladimir Lenin, supported by Zinoviev and Radek, strongly contested them. Their attitudes became known as the Zimmerwald Left. Lenin rejected both the defence of Russia and the cry for peace. Since the autumn of 1914, he had insisted that \\"from the standpoint of the working class and of the labouring masses from the lesser evil would be the defeat of the Tsarist Monarchy\\"; the war must be turned into a civil war of the proletarian soldiers against their own governments, and if a proletarian victory should emerge from this in Russia, then their duty would be to wage a revolutionary war for the liberation of the masses throughout Europe.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn elementary theory of property, believed by many peasants, was that land should belong to those who work on it. At the same time, peasant life and culture was changing constantly. Change was facilitated by the physical movement of growing numbers of peasant villagers who migrated to and from industrial and urban environments, but also by the introduction of city culture into the village through material goods, the press, and word of mouth.[nb 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nWorkers also had good reasons for discontent: overcrowded housing with often deplorable sanitary conditions, long hours at work (on the eve of the war a 10-hour workday six days a week was the average and many were working 11ÿ12 hours a day by 1916), constant risk of injury and death from poor safety and sanitary conditions, harsh discipline (not only rules and fines, but foremen's fists), and inadequate wages (made worse after 1914 by steep wartime increases in the cost of living). At the same time, urban industrial life was full of benefits, though these could be just as dangerous, from the point of view of social and political stability, as the hardships. There were many encouragements to expect more from life. Acquiring new skills gave many workers a sense of self-respect and confidence, heightening expectations and desires. Living in cities, workers encountered material goods such as they had never seen in villages. Most important, living in cities, they were exposed to new ideas about the social and political order.[nb 2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe social causes of the Russian Revolution mainly came from centuries of oppression of the lower classes by the Tsarist regime, and Nicholas's failures in World War I. While rural agrarian peasants had been emancipated from serfdom in 1861, they still resented paying redemption payments to the state, and demanded communal tender of the land they worked. The problem was further compounded by the failure of Sergei Witte's land reforms of the early 20th century. Increasing peasant disturbances and sometimes actual revolts occurred, with the goal of securing ownership of the land they worked. Russia consisted mainly of poor farming peasants, with 1.5% of the population owning 25% of the land.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapid industrialization of Russia also resulted in urban overcrowding and poor conditions for urban industrial workers (as mentioned above). Between 1890 and 1910, the population of the capital, Saint Petersburg, swelled from 1,033,600 to 1,905,600, with Moscow experiencing similar growth. This created a new 'proletariat' which, due to being crowded together in the cities, was much more likely to protest and go on strike than the peasantry had been in previous times. In one 1904 survey, it was found that an average of sixteen people shared each apartment in Saint Petersburg, with six people per room. There was also no running water, and piles of human waste were a threat to the health of the workers. The poor conditions only aggravated the situation, with the number of strikes and incidents of public disorder rapidly increasing in the years shortly before World War I. Because of late industrialization, Russia's workers were highly concentrated. By 1914, 40% of Russian workers were employed in factories of 1,000+ workers (32% in 1901). 42% worked in 100ÿ1,000 worker enterprises, 18% in 1ÿ100 worker businesses (in the US, 1914, the figures were 18, 47 and 35 respectively).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld War I added to the chaos. Conscription swept up the unwilling across Russia. The vast demand for factory production of war supplies and workers caused many more labor riots and strikes. Conscription stripped skilled workers from the cities, who had to be replaced with unskilled peasants, and then, when famine began to hit due to the poor railway system, workers abandoned the cities in droves seeking food. Finally, the soldiers themselves, who suffered from a lack of equipment and protection from the elements, began to turn against the Tsar. This was mainly because, as the war progressed, many of the officers who were loyal to the Tsar were killed, and were replaced by discontented conscripts from the major cities, who had little loyalty to the Tsar.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany sections of the country had reason to be dissatisfied with the existing autocracy. Nicholas II was a deeply conservative ruler and maintained a strict authoritarian system. Individuals and society in general were expected to show self-restraint, devotion to community, deference to the social hierarchy and a sense of duty to the country. Religious faith helped bind all of these tenets together as a source of comfort and reassurance in the face of difficult conditions and as a means of political authority exercised through the clergy. Perhaps more than any other modern monarch, Nicholas II attached his fate and the future of his dynasty to the notion of the ruler as a saintly and infallible father to his people.[nb 3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis idealized vision of the Romanov monarchy blinded him to the actual state of his country. With a firm belief that his power to rule was granted by Divine Right, Nicholas assumed that the Russian people were devoted to him with unquestioning loyalty. This ironclad belief rendered Nicholas unwilling to allow the progressive reforms that might have alleviated the suffering of the Russian people. Even after the 1905 revolution spurred the Tsar to decree limited civil rights and democratic representation, he worked to limit even these liberties in order to preserve the ultimate authority of the crown.[nb 3]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite constant oppression, the desire of the people for democratic participation in government decisions was strong. Since the Age of Enlightenment, Russian intellectuals had promoted Enlightenment ideals such as the dignity of the individual and the rectitude of democratic representation. These ideals were championed most vociferously by Russia's liberals, although populists, Marxists, and anarchists also claimed to support democratic reforms. A growing opposition movement had begun to challenge the Romanov monarchy openly well before the turmoil of World War I.\\r\\n\\r\\nDissatisfaction with Russian autocracy culminated in the huge national upheaval that followed the Bloody Sunday massacre of January 1905, in which hundreds of unarmed protesters were shot by the Tsar's troops. Workers responded to the massacre with a crippling general strike, forcing Nicholas to put forth the October Manifesto, which established a democratically elected parliament (the State Duma). The Tsar undermined this promise of reform but a year later with Article 87 of the 1906 Fundamental State Laws, and subsequently dismissed the first two Dumas when they proved uncooperative. Unfulfilled hopes of democracy fueled revolutionary ideas and violent outbursts targeted at the monarchy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the Tsar's principal rationales for risking war in 1914 was his desire to restore the prestige that Russia had lost amid the debacles of the Russo-Japanese war. Nicholas also sought to foster a greater sense of national unity with a war against a common and ancient enemy. The Russian Empire was an agglomeration of diverse ethnicities that had shown significant signs of disunity in the years before the First World War. Nicholas believed in part that the shared peril and tribulation of a foreign war would mitigate the social unrest over the persistent issues of poverty, inequality, and inhuman working conditions. Instead of restoring Russia's political and military standing, World War I led to the horrifying slaughter of Russian troops and military defeats that undermined both the monarchy and society in general to the point of collapse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outbreak of war in August 1914 initially served to quiet the prevalent social and political protests, focusing hostilities against a common external enemy, but this patriotic unity did not last long. As the war dragged on inconclusively, war-weariness gradually took its toll. More important, though, was a deeper fragility: although many ordinary Russians joined anti-German demonstrations in the first few weeks of the war, the most widespread reaction appears to have been skepticism and fatalism. Hostility toward the Kaiser and the desire to defend their land and their lives did not necessarily translate into enthusiasm for the Tsar or the government.[9][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia's first major battle of the war was a disaster: in the 1914 Battle of Tannenberg, over 30,000 Russian troops were killed or wounded and 90,000 captured, while Germany suffered just 12,000 casualties. However, Austro-Hungarian forces allied to Germany were driven back deep into the Galicia region by the end of the year. In the autumn of 1915, Nicholas had taken direct command of the army, personally overseeing Russia's main theatre of war and leaving his ambitious but incapable wife Alexandra in charge of the government. Reports of corruption and incompetence in the Imperial government began to emerge, and the growing influence of Grigori Rasputin in the Imperial family was widely resented. In the eyes of Michael Lynch, a revisionist historian (member of the School of Historical Studies at the University of Leicester) who focuses on the role of the people, Rasputin was a \\"fatal disease\\" to the Tsarist regime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1915, things took a critical turn for the worse when Germany shifted its focus of attack to the Eastern front. The superior German army?ÿ better led, better trained and better supplied?ÿ was terrifyingly effective against the ill-equipped Russian forces, driving the Russians out of Galicia, as well as Russian Poland, during the GorliceÿTarn܇w Offensive campaign. By the end of October 1916, Russia had lost between 1,600,000 and 1,800,000 soldiers, with an additional 2,000,000 prisoners of war and 1,000,000 missing, all making up a total of nearly 5,000,000 men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese staggering losses played a definite role in the mutinies and revolts that began to occur. In 1916, reports of fraternizing with the enemy started to circulate. Soldiers went hungry, and lacked shoes, munitions, and even weapons. Rampant discontent lowered morale, which was further undermined by a series of military defeats.\\r\\n\\r\\nCasualty rates were the most vivid sign of this disaster. Already, by the end of 1914, only five months into the war, around 390,000 Russian men had lost their lives and nearly 1,000,000 were injured. Far sooner than expected, barely trained recruits had to be called up for active duty, a process repeated throughout the war as staggering losses continued to mount. The officer class also saw remarkable changes, especially within the lower echelons, which were quickly filled with soldiers rising up through the ranks. These men, usually of peasant or working-class backgrounds, were to play a large role in the politicization of the troops in 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe huge losses on the battlefields were not limited to men. The army quickly ran short of rifles and ammunition (as well as uniforms and food), and, by mid-1915, men were being sent to the front bearing no arms. It was hoped that they could equip themselves with the arms that they recovered from fallen soldiers, of both sides, on the battlefields. The soldiers did not feel that they were being treated as valuable soldiers, or even as human beings, but rather as raw materials to be squandered for the purposes of the rich and powerful.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the spring of 1915, the army was in steady retreat, which was not always orderly; desertion, plunder and chaotic flight were not uncommon. By 1916, however, the situation had improved in many respects. Russian troops stopped retreating, and there were even some modest successes in the offensives that were staged that year, albeit at great loss of life. Also, the problem of shortages was largely solved by a major effort to increase domestic production. Nevertheless, by the end of 1916, morale among soldiers was even worse than it had been during the great retreat of 1915. The fortunes of war may have improved, but the fact of the war, still draining away strength and lives from the country and its many individuals and families, remained an oppressive inevitability. The crisis in morale (as was argued by Allan Wildman, a leading historian of the Russian army in war and revolution) \\"was rooted fundamentally in the feeling of utter despair that the slaughter would ever end and that anything resembling victory could be achieved.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe war devastated not only soldiers. By the end of 1915, there were manifold signs that the economy was breaking down under the heightened strain of wartime demand. The main problems were food shortages and rising prices. Inflation dragged incomes down at an alarmingly rapid rate, and shortages made it difficult to buy even what one could afford. These shortages were a problem especially in the capital, St. Petersburg, where distance from supplies and poor transportation networks made matters particularly bad. Shops closed early or entirely for lack of bread, sugar, meat and other provisions, and lines lengthened massively for what remained. It became increasingly difficult both to afford and actually buy food.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot surprisingly, strikes increased steadily from the middle of 1915, and so did crime; but, for the most part, people suffered and endured, scouring the city for food. Working class women in St. Petersburg reportedly spent about forty hours a week in food lines, begging, turning to prostitution or crime, tearing down wooden fences to keep stoves heated for warmth, grumbling about the rich, and wondering when and how this would all come to an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment officials responsible for public order worried about how long people's patience would last. A report by the St. Petersburg branch of the security police, the Okhrana, in October 1916, warned bluntly of \\"the possibility in the near future of riots by the lower classes of the empire enraged by the burdens of daily existence.\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nNicholas was blamed for all of these crises, and what little support he had left began to crumble. As discontent grew, the State Duma issued a warning to Nicholas in November 1916. It stated that, inevitably, a terrible disaster would grip the country unless a constitutional form of government was put in place. Nicholas ignored these warnings and Russia's Tsarist regime collapsed a few months later during the February Revolution of 1917. One year later, the Tsar and his entire family were executed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of February, Petrograd workers began several strikes and demonstrations.[citation needed] On 7 March [O.S. 22 February], workers at Putilov, Petrograd's largest industrial plant, announced a strike.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, a series of meetings and rallies were held for International Women's Day, which gradually turned into economic and political gatherings. Demonstrations were organised to demand bread, and these were supported by the industrial working force who considered them a reason for continuing the strikes. The women workers marched to nearby factories bringing out over 50,000 workers on strike.[15] By 10 March [O.S. 25 February], virtually every industrial enterprise in Petrograd had been shut down, together with many commercial and service enterprises. Students, white-collar workers and teachers joined the workers in the streets and at public meetings.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo quell the riots, the Tsar looked to the army. At least 180,000 troops were available in the capital, but most were either untrained or injured. Historian Ian Beckett suggests around 12,000 could be regarded as reliable, but even these proved reluctant to move in on the crowd, since it included so many women. It was for this reason that when, on 11 March [O.S. 26 February], the Tsar ordered the army to suppress the rioting by force, troops began to mutiny.[16] Although few actively joined the rioting, many officers were either shot or went into hiding; the ability of the garrison to hold back the protests was all but nullified, symbols of the Tsarist regime were rapidly torn down around the city, and governmental authority in the capital collapsed ÿ not helped by the fact that Nicholas had prorogued the Duma that morning, leaving it with no legal authority to act. The response of the Duma, urged on by the liberal bloc, was to establish a Temporary Committee to restore law and order; meanwhile, the socialist parties establish the Petrograd Soviet to represent workers and soldiers. The remaining loyal units switched allegiance the next day.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tsar directed the royal train back towards Petrograd, which was stopped  14 March [O.S. 1 March],[16] by a group of revolutionaries at Malaya Vishera. When the Tsar finally arrived at in Pskov, the Army Chief Nikolai Ruzsky, and the Duma deputees Guchkov and Vasily Shulgin  suggested in unison that he abdicate the throne. He did so on 15 March [O.S. 2 March], on behalf of himself, and then, having taken advice, on behalf of his son, the Tsarevich.[16] Nicholas nominated his brother, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, to succeed him. But the Grand Duke realised that he would have little support as ruler, so he declined the crown on 16 March [O.S. 3 March],[16] stating that he would take it only if that was the consensus of democratic action.[18] Six days later, Nicholas, no longer Tsar and addressed with contempt by the sentries as \\"Nicholas Romanov\\", was reunited with his family at the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo.[19] He was placed under house arrest with his family by the Provisional Government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immediate effect of the February Revolution was a widespread atmosphere of elation and excitement in Petrograd.[20] On 16 March [O.S. 3 March], a provisional government was announced. The center-left was well represented, and the government was initially chaired by a liberal aristocrat, Prince Georgy Yevgenievich Lvov, a member of the Constitutional Democratic party (KD).[21] The socialists had formed their rival body, the Petrograd Soviet (or workers' council) four days earlier. The Petrograd Soviet and the Provisional Government competed for power over Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effective power of the Provisional Government was challenged by the authority of an institution that claimed to represent the will of workers and soldiers and could, in fact, mobilize and control these groups during the early months of the revolution?ÿ the Petrograd Soviet [Council] of Workers' Deputies. The model for the soviet were workers' councils that had been established in scores of Russian cities during the 1905 Revolution. In February 1917, striking workers elected deputies to represent them and socialist activists began organizing a citywide council to unite these deputies with representatives of the socialist parties. On 27 February, socialist Duma deputies, mainly Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, took the lead in organizing a citywide council. The Petrograd Soviet met in the Tauride Palace, the same building where the new government was taking shape.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leaders of the Petrograd Soviet believed that they represented particular classes of the population, not the whole nation. They also believed Russia was not ready for socialism. So they saw their role as limited to pressuring hesitant \\"bourgeoisie\\" to rule and to introduce extensive democratic reforms in Russia (the replacement of the monarchy by a republic, guaranteed civil rights, a democratic police and army, abolition of religious and ethnic discrimination, preparation of elections to a constituent assembly, and so on).[22] They met in the same building as the emerging Provisional Government not to compete with the Duma Committee for state power but to best exert pressure on the new government, to act, in other words, as a popular democratic lobby.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between these two major powers was complex from the beginning and would shape the politics of 1917. The representatives of the Provisional Government agreed to \\"take into account the opinions of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies\\", though they were also determined to prevent \\"interference in the actions of the government\\", which would create \\"an unacceptable situation of dual power.\\"[23] In fact, this was precisely what was being created, though this \\"dual power\\" (dvoevlastie) was the result less of the actions or attitudes of the leaders of these two institutions than of actions outside their control, especially the ongoing social movement taking place on the streets of Russia's cities, in factories and shops, in barracks and in the trenches, and in the villages.\\r\\n\\r\\nA series of political crises?ÿ see the chronology below?ÿ in the relationship between population and government and between the Provisional Government and the soviets (which developed into a nationwide movement with a national leadership, The All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets (VTsIK)) undermined the authority of the Provisional Government but also of the moderate socialist leaders of the Soviet. Although the Soviet leadership initially refused to participate in the \\"bourgeois\\" Provisional Government, Alexander Kerensky, a young and popular lawyer and a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party (SRP), agreed to join the new cabinet, and became an increasingly central figure in the government, eventually taking leadership of the Provisional Government. As minister of war and later Prime Minister, Kerensky promoted freedom of speech, released thousands of political prisoners, did his very best to continue the war effort and even organised another offensive (which, however, was no more successful than its predecessors). Nevertheless, Kerensky still faced several great challenges, highlighted by the soldiers, urban workers and peasants, who claimed that they had gained nothing by the revolution:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe political group that proved most troublesome for Kerensky, and would eventually overthrow him, was the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin. Lenin had been living in exile in neutral Switzerland and, due to democratization of politics after the February Revolution, which legalized formerly banned political parties, he perceived the opportunity for his Marxist revolution. Although return to Russia had become a possibility, the war made it logistically difficult. Eventually, German officials arranged for Lenin to pass through their territory, hoping that his activities would weaken Russia or even?ÿ if the Bolsheviks came to power?ÿ led to Russia's withdrawal from the war. Lenin and his associates, however, had to agree to travel to Russia in a sealed train: Germany would not take the chance that he would foment revolution in Germany. After passing through the front, he arrived in Petrograd in April 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way to Russia, Lenin prepared the April Theses, which outlined central Bolshevik policies. These included that the soviets take power (as seen in the slogan \\"all power to the soviets\\") and denouncing the liberals and social revolutionaries in the Provisional Government, forbidding co-operation with it. Many Bolsheviks, however, had supported the Provisional Government, including Lev Kamenev.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Lenin's arrival, the popularity of the Bolsheviks increased steadily. Over the course of the spring, public dissatisfaction with the Provisional Government and the war, in particular among workers, soldiers and peasants, pushed these groups to radical parties. Despite growing support for the Bolsheviks, buoyed by maxims that called most famously for \\"all power to the Soviets,\\" the party held very little real power in the moderate-dominated Petrograd Soviet. In fact, historians such as Sheila Fitzpatrick have asserted that Lenin's exhortations for the Soviet Council to take power were intended to arouse indignation both with the Provisional Government, whose policies were viewed as conservative, and the Soviet itself, which was viewed as subservient to the conservative government. By some historians' accounts, Lenin and his followers were unprepared for how their groundswell of support, especially among influential worker and soldier groups, would translate into real power in the summer of 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 June, the Provisional Government launched an attack against Germany that failed miserably. Soon after, the government ordered soldiers to go to the front, reneging on a promise. The soldiers refused to follow the new orders. The arrival of radical Kronstadt sailors?ÿ who had tried and executed many officers, including one admiral?ÿ further fueled the growing revolutionary atmosphere. The sailors and soldiers, along with Petrograd workers, took to the streets in violent protest, calling for \\"all power to the Soviets.\\" The revolt, however, was disowned by Lenin[25] and the Bolshevik leaders and dissipated within a few days. In the aftermath, Lenin fled to Finland under threat of arrest while Trotsky, among other prominent Bolsheviks, was arrested. The July Days confirmed the popularity of the anti-war, radical Bolsheviks, but their unpreparedness at the moment of revolt was an embarrassing gaffe that lost them support among their main constituent groups: soldiers and workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bolshevik failure in the July Days proved temporary. The Bolsheviks had undergone a spectacular growth in membership. Whereas, in February 1917, the Bolsheviks were limited to only 24,000 members, by September 1917 there were 200,000 members of the Bolshevik faction.[26]  Previously, the Bolsheviks had been in the minority in the two leading cities of RussiaSt. Petersburg and Moscow behind the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries, by September the Bolsheviks were in the majority in both cities.[27]  Furthermore, the Bolshevik-controlled Moscow Regional Bureau of the Party also controlled the Party organizations of the thirteen (13) provinces around Moscow.  These thirteen provinces held 37% of Russia's population and 20% of the membership of the Bolshevik faction.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August, poor or misleading communication led General Lavr Kornilov, the recently appointed Supreme Commander of Russian military forces, to believe that the Petrograd government had already been captured by radicals, or was in serious danger thereof.[dubious  ÿ discuss] In response, he ordered troops to Petrograd to pacify the city.  To secure his position, Kerensky had to ask for Bolshevik assistance. He also sought help from the Petrograd Soviet, which called upon armed Red Guards to \\"defend the revolution\\". The Kornilov Affair failed largely due to the efforts of the Bolsheviks, whose influence over railroad and telegraph workers proved vital in stopping the movement of troops. With his coup failing, Kornilov surrendered and was relieved of his position. The Bolsheviks' role in stopping the attempted coup further strengthened their position.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early September, the Petrograd Soviet freed all jailed Bolsheviks and Trotsky became chairman of the Petrograd Soviet. Growing numbers of socialists and lower-class Russians viewed the government less and less as a force in support of their needs and interests. The Bolsheviks benefited as the only major organized opposition party that had refused to compromise with the Provisional Government, and they benefited from growing frustration and even disgust with other parties, such as the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, who stubbornly refused to break with the idea of national unity across all classes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Finland, Lenin had worked on his book State and Revolution[28] and continued to lead his party, writing newspaper articles and policy decrees. By October, he returned to Petrograd (St. Petersburg), aware that the increasingly radical city presented him no legal danger and a second opportunity for revolution. Recognising the strength of the Bolsheviks, Lenin began pressing for the immediate overthrow of the Kerensky government by the Bolsheviks. Lenin was of the opinion that taking power should occur in both St. Petersburg and Moscow simultaneously, parenthetically stating that it made no difference which city rose up first, but expressing his opinion that Moscow may well rise up first.[29]  The Bolshevik Central Committee drafted a resolution, calling for the dissolution of the Provisional Government in favor of the Petrograd Soviet.  The resolution was passed 10ÿ2 (Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev prominently dissenting) and the October Revolution began.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe October Revolution was led by Vladimir Lenin and was based upon Lenin's writing on the ideas of Karl Marx, a political ideology often known as MarxismÿLeninism. It marked the beginning of the spread of communism in the 20th century. It was far less sporadic than the revolution of February and came about as the result of deliberate planning and coordinated activity to that end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Lenin was the leader of the Bolshevik Party, it has been argued that since Lenin was not present during the actual takeover of the Winter Palace, it was really Trotsky's organization and direction that led the revolution, merely spurred by the motivation Lenin instigated within his party.[30] Critics on the Right have long argued that the financial and logistical assistance of German intelligence via their key agent, Alexander Parvus was a key component as well, though historians are divided, since there is little evidence supporting that claim.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 November 1917, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin led his leftist revolutionaries in a revolt against the ineffective Provisional Government (Russia was still using the Julian calendar at the time, so period references show a 25 October date). The October revolution ended the phase of the revolution instigated in February, replacing Russia's short-lived provisional parliamentary government with government by soviets, local councils elected by bodies of workers and peasants. Liberal and monarchist forces, loosely organized into the White Army, immediately went to war against the Bolsheviks' Red Army, in a series of battles that would become known as the Russian Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoviet membership was initially freely elected, but many members of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, anarchists, and other leftists created opposition to the Bolsheviks through the soviets themselves. The elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly took place in November 1917. The Bolsheviks gained 24% of the vote.[31] When it became clear that the Bolsheviks had little support outside of the industrialized areas of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, they simply barred non-Bolsheviks from membership in the soviets.[citation needed] The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.[31] Not surprisingly, this caused mass domestic tension with many individuals who called for another series of political reform, revolting, and calling for \\"a third Russian revolution,\\" a movement that received a significant amount of support. The most notable instances of this anti-Bolshevik mentality were expressed in the Tambov rebellion, 1919ÿ1921, and the Kronstadt rebellion in March 1921. These movements, which made a wide range of demands and lacked effective coordination, were eventually defeated along with the White Army during the Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian Civil War, which broke out in 1918 shortly after the October Revolution, brought death and suffering to millions of people regardless of their political orientation. The war was fought mainly between the Red Army (\\"Reds\\"), consisting of the uprising majority led by the Bolshevik minority, and the \\"Whites\\"?ÿ army officers and cossacks, the \\"bourgeoisie\\", and political groups ranging from the far Right to the Socialist Revolutionaries who opposed the drastic restructuring championed by the Bolsheviks following the collapse of the Provisional Government to the soviets (under clear Bolshevik dominance).[32][33] The Whites had backing from nations such as Great Britain, France, USA and Japan, while the Reds possessed internal support which proved to be much more effective. Though the Allied nations, using external interference, provided substantial military aid to the loosely knit anti-Bolshevik forces, they were ultimately defeated.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bolsheviks firstly assumed power in Petrograd, expanding their rule outwards. They eventually reached the Easterly Siberian Russian coast in Vladivostok, 4 years after the war began, an occupation that is believed to have ended all significant military campaigns in the nation. Less than one year later the last area controlled by the White Army, the Ayano-Maysky District, directly to the north of the Krai containing Vladivostok, was given up when General Anatoly Pepelyayev capitulated in 1923.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral revolts were initiated against the Bolsheviks and their army near the end of the war, notably the Kronstadt Rebellion. This was a naval mutiny engineered by Soviet Baltic sailors, former Red Army soldiers, and the people of Kronstadt. This armed uprising was fought against the antagonizing Bolshevik economic policies that farmers were subjected to, including seizures of grain crops by the Communists.[34] This all amounted to large-scale discontent. When delegates representing the Kronstadt sailors arrived at Petrograd for negotiations, they raised 15 demands primarily pertaining to the Russian right to freedom.[35] The Government firmly denounced the rebellions and labelled the requests as a reminder of the Social Revolutionaries, a political party that was popular among Soviets before Lenin, but refused to cooperate with the Bolshevik Army. The Government then responded with an armed suppression of these revolts and suffered 10 thousand casualties before entering the city of Kronstadt.[36] This ended the rebellions fairly quickly, causing many of the rebels to flee to political exile.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Civil War, Nestor Makhno led a Ukrainian anarchist movement, the Black Army allied to the Bolsheviks thrice, one of the powers ending the alliance each time. However, a Bolshevik force under Mikhail Frunze destroyed the Makhnovist movement, when the Makhnovists refused to merge into the Red Army. In addition, the so-called \\"Green Army\\" (peasants defending their property against the opposing forces) played a secondary role in the war, mainly in the Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bolsheviks executed the tsar and his family on 16 July 1918.[38] In early March, the Provisional Government placed Nicholas and his family under house arrest in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo, 24 kilometres (15?mi) south of Petrograd. In August 1917 the Kerensky government evacuated the Romanovs to Tobolsk in the Urals, to protect them from the rising tide of revolution. After the Bolsheviks came to power in October 1917, the conditions of their imprisonment grew stricter and talk of putting Nicholas on trial increased. As the counter revolutionary White movement gathered force, leading to full-scale civil war by the summer, the Romanovs were moved during April and May 1918 to Yekaterinburg, a militant Bolshevik stronghold.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the early morning of 16 July, Nicholas, Alexandra, their children, their physician, and several servants were taken into the basement and shot. According to Edvard Radzinsky and Dmitrii Volkogonov, the order came directly from Lenin and Sverdlov in Moscow. That the order came from the top has long been believed, although there is a lack of hard evidence. The execution may have been carried out on the initiative of local Bolshevik officials, or it may have been an option pre-approved in Moscow should White troops approach Yekaterinburg. Radzinsky noted that Lenin's bodyguard personally delivered the telegram ordering the execution and that he was ordered to destroy the evidence.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeon Trotsky said that the goal of socialism in Russia would not be realized without the success of the world revolution. Indeed, a revolutionary wave caused by the Russian Revolution lasted until 1923. Despite initial hopes for success in the German Revolution of 1918ÿ19, in the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic and others like it, no other Marxist movement at the time succeeded in keeping power in its hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis issue is subject to conflicting views on communist history by various Marxist groups and parties. Joseph Stalin later rejected this idea, stating that socialism was possible in one country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe confusion regarding Stalin's position on the issue stems from the fact that, after Lenin's death in 1924, he successfully used Lenin's argument?ÿ the argument that socialism's success needs the support of workers of other countries in order to happen?ÿ to defeat his competitors within the party by accusing them of betraying Lenin and, therefore, the ideals of the October Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew events in historical research have been as conditioned by political influences as the October Revolution.  The historiography of the Revolution generally divides into three camps: the Soviet-Marxist view, the Western-Totalitarian view, and the Revisionist view.[41] Since the fall of Communism in Russia in 1991, the Western-Totalitarian view has again become dominant and the Soviet-Marxist view has practically vanished.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nLenin's biographer Robert Service, says he, \\"laid the foundations of dictatorship and lawlessness. Lenin had consolidated the principle of state penetration of the whole society, its economy and its culture. Lenin had practised terror and advocated revolutionary amoralism.\\"[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nDates are correct for the Julian calendar, which was used in Russia until 1918. It was twelve days behind the Gregorian calendar during the 19th century and thirteen days behind it during the 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Orwell's classic novella Animal Farm is an allegory of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. It describes the dictator Stalin as a big Berkshire boar named, \\"Napoleon.\\" Trotsky is represented by a pig called Snowball who is a brilliant talker and makes magnificent speeches. However, Napoleon overthrows Snowball as Stalin overthrew Trotsky and Napoleon takes over the farm the animals live on. Napoleon becomes a tyrant and uses force and propaganda to oppress the animals.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian Revolution has been portrayed in or served as backdrop for many films. Among them, in order of release date:","input":"What tsar was overthrown in the russian revolution?"},{"output":"Slaves","context":"Colonial Brazil (Portuguese: Brasil Colonial) comprises the period from 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese, until 1815, when Brazil was elevated to a kingdom in union with Portugal as the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. During the early 300 years of Brazilian colonial history, the economic exploitation of the territory was based first on brazilwood (pau brazil) extraction (16th century), which gave the territory its name;[1] sugar production (16thÿ18th centuries); and finally on gold and diamond mining (18th century). Slaves, especially those brought from Africa, provided most of the work force of the Brazilian export economy after a brief period of Indian slavery to cut brazilwood.\\r\\nIn contrast to the neighboring Spanish possessions, which had several viceroyalties with jurisdiction initially over New Spain (Mexico) and Peru, and in the eighteenth century expanded to viceroyalties of Rio de la Plata and New Granada, the Portuguese colony of Brazil was settled mainly in the coastal area by the Portuguese and a large black slave population working sugar plantations and mines. The boom and bust economic cycles were linked to export products. Brazil's sugar age, with the development of plantation slavery, merchants serving as middle men between production sites, Brazilian ports, and Europe was undermined by the growth of the sugar industry in the Caribbean on islands that European powers seized from Spain. Gold and diamonds were discovered and mined in southern Brazil through the end of the colonial era. Brazilian cities were largely port cities and the colonial administrative capital was moved several times in response to the rise and fall of export products' importance. Unlike Spanish America that fragmented in many republics, Brazil remained as a single administrative unit with a monarch, giving rise to the largest country in Latin America. Like Spanish America with European Spanish, Brazil had linguistic integrity of Portuguese. Both Spanish America and Brazil were Roman Catholic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPortugal and Spain pioneered the European charting of sea routes that were the first and only channels of interaction between all of the world's continents, thus beginning the process of globalization. In addition to the imperial and economic undertaking of discovery and colonization of lands distant from Europe, these years were filled with pronounced advancements in cartography, shipbuilding and navigational instruments, of which the Portuguese and Spanish explorers took advantage.[2]\\r\\nIn 1494, the two kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula divided the New World between them (in the Treaty of Tordesillas), and in 1500 navigator Pedro lvares Cabral landed in what is now Brazil and laid claim to it in the name of King Manuel I of Portugal. The Portuguese identified brazilwood as a valuable red dye and an exploitable product, and attempted to force indigenous groups in Brazil to cut the trees.\\r\\nPortuguese seafarers in the early fifteenth century began to expand from a small area of the iberian Peninsula, to seizing the Muslim fortress of Ceuta in North Africa. Its maritime exploration then proceeded down the coast of West Africa and across the Indian Ocean to the south Asian subcontinent, as well as the Atlantic islands off the coast of Africa on the way. They sought sources of gold, ivory, and African slaves, high value goods in the African trade. The Portuguese set up fortified trading \\"factories\\" (feitorias), whereby permanent, fairly small commercial settlements anchored trade in a region. The initial costs of setting up these commercial posts was borne by private investors, who in turn received hereditary titles and commercial advantages. From the Portuguese Crown's point of view, its realm was expanded with relatively little cost to itself.[3] On the Atlantic islands of the Azores, Madeira, and So Tom, the Portuguese began plantation production of sugarcane using forced labor, a precedent for Brazil's sugar production in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.[4]\\r\\nThe Portuguese \\"discovery\\" of Brazil was preceded by a series of treaties between the kings of Portugal and Castile, following Portuguese sailings down the coast of Africa to India and the voyages to the Caribbean of the Genoese mariner sailing for Castile, Christopher Columbus. The most decisive of these treaties was the Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, which created the Tordesillas Meridian, dividing the world between the two kingdoms. All land discovered or to be discovered east of that meridian was to be the property of Portugal, and everything to the west of it went to Spain.\\r\\nThe Tordesillas Meridian divided South America into two parts, leaving a large chunk of land to be exploited by the Spaniards. The Treaty of Tordesillas was arguably the most decisive[peacock?term] event in all Brazilian history, since it determined that part of South America would be settled by Portugal instead of Spain. The present extent of Brazil's coastline is almost exactly that defined by the treaty of Madrid, which was approved in 1750.\\r\\nOn April 22, 1500, during the reign of King Manuel I, a fleet led by navigator Pedro lvares Cabral landed in Brazil and took possession of the land in the name of the king. Although it is debated whether previous Portuguese explorers had already been in Brazil, this date is widely and politically accepted as the day of the discovery of Brazil by Europeans. lvares Cabral was leading a large fleet of 13 ships and more than 1000 men following Vasco da Gama's way to India, around Africa. The place where lvares Cabral arrived is now known as Porto Seguro (\\"safe harbor\\"), in Northeastern Brazil.\\r\\nAfter the voyage of lvares Cabral, the Portuguese concentrated their efforts on the lucrative possessions in Africa and India and showed little interest in Brazil. Between 1500 and 1530, relatively few Portuguese expeditions came to the new land to chart the coast and to obtain brazilwood. In Europe, this wood was used to produce a valuable dye to give color to luxury textiles. To extract brazilwood from the tropical rainforest, the Portuguese and other Europeans relied on the work of the natives, who initially worked in exchange for European goods like mirrors, scissors, knives and axes.[5]\\r\\nIn this early stage of the colonization of Brazil, and also later, the Portuguese frequently relied on the help of Europeans who lived together with the indigenous people and knew their languages and culture. The most famous of these were the Portuguese Jo?o Ramalho, who lived among the Guaianaz tribe near today's S?o Paulo, and Diogo lvares Correia, nicknamed Caramuru, who lived among the Tupinamb natives near today's Salvador da Bahia.\\r\\nOver time, the Portuguese realized that some European countries, especially France, were also sending excursions to the land to extract brazilwood. Worried about foreign incursions and hoping to find mineral riches, the Portuguese crown decided to send large missions to take possession of the land and combat the French. In 1530, an expedition led by Martim Afonso de Sousa arrived in Brazil to patrol the entire coast, ban the French, and create the first colonial villages like S?o Vicente on the coast.\\r\\nAt first, Brazil was set up as fifteen private, hereditary captaincies. Pernambuco succeeded by growing sugarcane. S?o Vicente prospered by dealing in indigenous slaves. The other thirteen captaincies failed, leading the king to make colonization a royal effort rather than a private one.[citation needed] In 1549, Tom de Sousa sailed to Brazil to establish a central government. De Sousa brought along Jesuits, who set up missions, saved many natives from slavery, studied native languages, and converted many natives to Roman Catholicism. The Jesuits' work to pacify a hostile tribe helped the Portuguese expel the French from a colony they had established at present-day Rio de Janeiro.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first attempt to colonize Brazil followed the system of hereditary captaincies (Capitanias Hereditrias), which had previously been used successfully in the colonization of Madeira Island. The costs were transferred to private hands, saving the Portuguese crown from the high costs of colonization. Thus, between 1534 and 1536 King John III divided the land into 15 captaincy colonies, which were given to Portuguese noblemen who wanted and had the means to administer and explore them. The captains were granted ample powers to administer and profit from their possessions.\\r\\nFrom the 15 original captaincies, only two, Pernambuco and S?o Vicente, prospered. The failure of most captaincies was related to the resistance of the indigenous people, shipwrecks and internal disputes between the colonizers.[citation needed] Pernambuco, the most successful captaincy, belonged to Duarte Coelho, who founded the city of Olinda in 1536. His captaincy prospered with sugarcane mills installed after 1542 producing sugar. Sugar was a very valuable good in Europe, and its production became the main Brazilian colonial produce for the next 150 years.\\r\\nThe captaincy of S?o Vicente, owned by Martim Afonso de Sousa, also produced sugar but its main economic activity was the traffic of indigenous slaves.\\r\\nWith the failure of most captaincies and the menacing presence of French ships along the Brazilian coast, the government of King John III decided to turn the colonisation of Brazil back into a royal enterprise. In 1549, a large fleet led by Tom de Sousa set sail to Brazil to establish a central government in the colony. Tom de Sousa, the first Governor-General of Brazil, brought detailed instructions, prepared by the King's aides, about how to administer and foster the development of the colony. His first act was the foundation of the capital city, Salvador da Bahia, in Northeastern Brazil, in today's state of Bahia. The city was built on a slope by a bay (Todos-os-Santos Bay) and was divided into an upper administrative area and a lower commercial area with a harbour. Tom de Sousa also visited the captaincies to repair the villages and reorganise their economies. In 1551, the Diocese of S?o Salvador da Bahia was established in the colony, with its seat in Salvador.\\r\\nThe second Governor General, Duarte da Costa (1553ÿ1557), faced conflicts with the indigenous people and severe disputes with other colonizers and the bishop. Wars against the natives around Salvador consumed much of his government. The fact that the first bishop of Brazil, Pero Fernandes Sardinha, was killed and eaten by the Caet natives after a shipwreck in 1556 illustrates how strained the situation was between the Portuguese and many indigenous tribes.\\r\\nThe third Governor-General of Brazil was Mem de S (1557ÿ1573). He was an efficient administrator who managed to defeat the indigenous people and, with the help of the Jesuits, expel the French (Huguenots and some previous Catholic settlers) from their colony of France Antarctique. As part of this process his nephew, Estcio de S, founded the city of Rio de Janeiro there in 1565.\\r\\nThe huge size of Brazil led to the colony being divided in two after 1621 when King Philip II created the states of Brasil, with Salvador as capital, and Maranh?o, with its capital in S?o Lus. The state of Maranh?o was still further divided in 1737 into the Maranh?o e Piau and Gr?o-Par e Rio Negro, with its capital in Belm do Par. Each state had its own Governor.\\r\\nAfter 1640, the governors of Brazil coming from the high nobility started to use the title of Vice-rei (Viceroy). In 1763[citation needed] the capital of the Estado do Brazil was transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. In 1775 all Brazilian Estados (Brasil, Maranh?o and Gr?o-Par) were unified into the Viceroyalty of Brazil, with Rio de Janeiro as capital, and the title of the king's representative was officially changed to that of Viceroy of Brazil.\\r\\nAs in Portugal, each colonial village and city had a city council (camara municipal), whose members were prominent figures of colonial society (land owners, merchants, slave traders). Colonial city councils were responsible for regulating commerce, public infrastructure, professional artisans, prisons etc.\\r\\nTom de Sousa, first Governor General of Brazil, brought the first group of Jesuits to the colony.[6] More than any other religious order, the Jesuits represented the spiritual side of the enterprise and were destined to play a central role in the colonial history of Brazil. The spreading of the Catholic faith was an important justification for the Portuguese conquests, and the Jesuits were officially supported by the King, who instructed Tom de Sousa to give them all the support needed to Christianise the indigenous people.\\r\\nThe first Jesuits, guided by Father Manuel da N܇brega and including prominent figures like Juan de Azpilcueta Navarro, Leonardo Nunes and later Jos de Anchieta, established the first Jesuit missions in Salvador and in S?o Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, the settlement that gave rise to the city of S?o Paulo. N܇brega and Anchieta were instrumental in the defeat of the French colonists of France Antarctique by managing to pacify the Tamoio natives, who had previously fought the Portuguese. The Jesuits took part in the foundation of the city of Rio de Janeiro in 1565.\\r\\nThe success of the Jesuits in converting the indigenous people to Catholicism is linked to their capacity to understand the native culture, especially the language. The first grammar of the Tupi language was compiled by Jos de Anchieta and printed in Coimbra in 1595. The Jesuits often gathered the aborigines in communities (the Jesuit Reductions) where the natives worked for the community and were evangelised.\\r\\nThe Jesuits had frequent disputes with other colonists who wanted to enslave the natives. The action of the Jesuits saved many natives from slavery, but also disturbed their ancestral way of life and inadvertently helped spread infectious diseases against which the aborigines had no natural defences. Slave labour and trade were essential for the economy of Brazil and other American colonies, and the Jesuits usually did not object to the enslavement of African people.\\r\\nThe potential riches of tropical Brazil led the French, who did not recognize the Tordesillas Treaty that divided the world between the Spanish and the Portuguese, to attempt to colonize parts of Brazil. In 1555, the Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon founded a settlement within Guanabara Bay, in an island in front of today's Rio de Janeiro. The colony, named France Antarctique, led to conflict with Governor General Mem de S, who waged war against the colony in 1560. Estcio de S, nephew of the Governor, founded Rio de Janeiro in 1565 and managed to expel the last French settlers in 1567. Jesuit priests Manuel da N܇brega and Jos de Anchieta were instrumental in the Portuguese victory by pacifying the natives who supported the French.[7]\\r\\nAnother French colony, France quinoxiale, was founded in 1612 in present-day S?o Lus, in the North of Brazil. In 1614 the French were again expelled from S?o Lus by the Portuguese.\\r\\nSince the initial attempts to find gold and silver failed, the Portuguese colonists adopted an economy based on the production of agricultural goods that were to be exported to Europe. Tobacco and cotton and some other agricultural goods were produced, but sugar became by far the most important Brazilian colonial product until the early 18th century. The first sugarcane farms were established in the mid-16th century and were the key for the success of the captaincies of S?o Vicente and Pernambuco, leading sugarcane plantations to quickly spread to other coastal areas in colonial Brazil. Initially, the Portuguese attempted to utilize Indian slaves for sugar cultivation, but shifted to the use of black African slave labor.[8]\\r\\nThe period of sugar-based economy (1530 ÿ c. 1700) is known as the sugar age in Brazil.[9] The development of the sugar complex occurred over time, with a variety of models.[10] The dependencies of the farm included a casa-grande (big house) where the owner of the farm lived with his family, and the senzala, where the slaves were kept. A notable early study of this complex is by Brazilian sociologist Gilberto Freyre.[11] This arrangement was depicted in engravings and paintings by Frans Post as a feature of an apparently harmonious society.[12]\\r\\nInitially, the Portuguese relied on native slaves to work on sugarcane harvesting and processing, but they soon began importing black African slaves. Portugal owned several commercial facilities in Western Africa, where slaves were bought from African merchants. These slaves were then sent by ship to Brazil, chained and in crowded conditions. The idea of using African slaves in colonial farms based on monoculture was also adopted by other European colonial powers when colonizing tropical regions of America (Spain in Cuba, France in Haiti, the Netherlands in the Dutch Antilles and England in Jamaica).\\r\\nThe Portuguese attempted to severely restrict colonial trade, meaning that Brazil was only allowed to export and import goods from Portugal and other Portuguese colonies. Brazil exported sugar, tobacco, cotton and native products and imported from Portugal wine, olive oil, textiles and luxury goods ÿ the latter imported by Portugal from other European countries. Africa played an essential role as the supplier of slaves, and Brazilian slave traders in Africa frequently exchanged cacha?a, a distilled spirit derived from sugarcane, and shells, for slaves. This comprised what is now known as the Triangular trade between Europe, Africa and the Americas during the colonial period.\\r\\nMerchants during the sugar age were crucial to the economic development of the colony, the link between the sugar production areas, coastal Portuguese cities, and Europe.[13] Merchants in the early came from many nations, including Germans, Flemings, and Italians, but Portuguese merchants came to dominate the trade in Brazil. During the union of the Spanish and Portuguese crowns (1580-1640), to be active in Spanish America as well, especially trading African slaves.[14]\\r\\nEven though Brazilian sugar was reputed as being of high quality, the industry faced a crisis during the 17th and 18th centuries when the Dutch and the French started producing sugar in the Antilles, located much closer to Europe, causing sugar prices to fall.\\r\\nBrazil had coastal cities and towns, which have been considered far less important than colonial settlements in Spanish America, but like Spanish America, urban settlements were important as the sites of institutional life of church and state, as well as urban groups of merchants. Unlike many areas of Spanish America, there was no dense, sedentary indigenous population which had already created settlements, but cities and towns in Brazil were similar to those in Spanish Colonial Venezuela. Port cities allowed Portuguese trade goods to enter, including African slaves, and export goods of sugar and later gold and coffee to be exported to Portugal and beyond. Coastal cities of Olinda (founded 1537), Salvador da Bahia (1549), Santos (1545), Vit܇ria (1551), and Rio de Janeiro (1565) were also vital in the defense against pirates. Only S?o Paulo in Minas Gerais was an important inland city. Unlike the network of towns and cities that developed in most areas of Spanish America, the coastal cities and their hinterlands were oriented toward Portugal directly with little connection otherwise. With sugar as the major export commodity in the early period and the necessity to process cane into exportable refined sugar on-site, the sugar engenhos had resident artisans and barber-surgeons, and functioned in some ways as small towns. Also unlike most Spanish settlements, Brazilian cities and towns did not have a uniform lay-out of central plaza and a check board pattern of streets, often because the topography defeated such an orderly layout.[15]\\r\\nConverted Jews, so-called New Christians, many of whom were merchants, played a role in colonial Brazil. Their \\"importance in the colonial may be one explanation why the Inquisition was not permanently established in Brazil during the Iberian Union.\\" New Christians were well integrated into institutional life, serving in civil as well as ecclesiatical offices. The relative lack of persecution and abundance of opportunity allowed them to have a significant place in society. With the Iberian Union (1580-1640), many migrated to Spanish America.[16]\\r\\nIn 1580, a succession crisis led to the union of Portugal and Spain being ruled by the Habsburg King Philip II. The unification of the crowns of the two Iberian kingdoms, known as the Iberian Union, lasted until 1640 when the Portuguese revolted. During the union the institutions of both kingdoms remained separate. For Portuguese merchants, many of whom were Christian converts from Judaism (\\"New Christians\\") or their descendants, the union of crowns presented commercial opportunities in the slave trade to Spanish America.[17][18] The Netherlands (the Seventeen Provinces) obtained independence from Spain in 1581, leading Philip II to prohibit commerce with Dutch ships, including in Brazil. Since the Dutch had invested large sums in financing sugar production in the Brazilian Northeast and were important as shippers of sugar,[19] a conflict began with Dutch privateers plundering the coast: they sacked Salvador in 1604, from which they removed large amounts of gold and silver before a joint Spanish-Portuguese fleet recaptured the town.[citation needed]\\r\\nFrom 1630 to 1654, the Dutch set up more permanently in commercial Recife and aristocratic Olinda.[20] With the capture of Paraiba in 1635, the Dutch controlled a long stretch of the coast most accessible to Europe (Dutch Brazil), without, however, penetrating the interior. The large Dutch ships were unable to moor in the coastal inlets where lighter Portuguese shipping came and went. Ironically, the result of the Dutch capture of the sugar coast was a higher price of sugar in Amsterdam. During the Nieuw Holland episode, the colonists of the Dutch West India Company in Brazil were in a constant state of siege, in spite of the presence of the Count John Maurice of Nassau as governor (1637ÿ1644) in Recife. Nassau invited scientific commissions to research the local flora and fauna, resulting in added knowledge of the territory. Moreover, he set up a city project for Recife and Olinda, which was partially accomplished. Remnants survive into the modern era. After several years of open warfare, the Dutch finally withdrew in 1654; the Portuguese paid off a war debt in payments of salt. Few Dutch cultural and ethnic influences remain. but Albert Eckhout's paintings of indigenous and black Brazilians, as well as his still lifes are important works of baroque art.\\r\\nWork on the sugarcane plantations in Northeast Brazil and other areas relied heavily on slave labor, mostly of central African origin. One type of resistance to slavery was flight and, with the dense vegetation of the tropics, runaway slaves fled in numbers and for slave owners, this was an \\"endemic problem.\\"[21] Since the early 17th century there are indications of runaway slaves organizing themselves into settlements in the Brazilian hinterland. These settlements, called mocambos and quilombos, were usually small and relatively close to sugar fields, and attracted not only African slaves but also people of indigenous origin. The largest of the quilombos was the Quilombo dos Palmares, located in today's Alagoas state, which grew to many thousands during the disruption of Portuguese rule with the Dutch incursion.[22] Palmares was governed by leaders Ganga Zumba and his successor, Zumbi. The terminology for the settlements and leaders come directly from Angola, with quilombo an Angolan word for military villages of diverse settlers and the nganga a nzumbi \\"was the priest responsible for the spiritual defense of the community.\\"[23] The Dutch and later the Portuguese attempted several times to conquer Palmares, until an army led by famed S?o Paulo-born Domingos Jorge Velho managed to destroy the great quilombo and kill Zumbi in 1695. Brazilian feature film director Carlos Diegues made a film about Palmares called simply Quilombo. Of the many quilombos that once existed in Brazil, some have survived to this day as isolated rural communities.[citation needed]\\r\\nSince the 16th century the exploration of the Brazilian inland was attempted several times, mostly to try to find mineral riches like the silver mines found in 1546 by the Spanish in Potos (now in Bolivia). Since no riches were initially found, colonisation was restricted to the coast where the climate and soil were suitable for sugarcane plantations.\\r\\nThe expeditions to inland Brazil are divided into two types: the entradas and the bandeiras. The entradas were done in the name of the Portuguese crown and were financed by the colonial government. Its main objective was to find mineral riches, as well as to explore and chart unknown territory. The bandeiras, on the other hand, were private initiatives sponsored and carried out mostly by settlers of the S?o Paulo region (the Paulistas). The expeditions of the bandeirantes, as these adventurers were called, were aimed at obtaining native slaves for trade and finding mineral riches. The Paulistas, who at the time were mostly of mixed Portuguese and native ancestry, knew all the old indigenous pathways (the peabirus) through the Brazilian inland and were acclimated to the harsh conditions of these journeys.[24]\\r\\nAt the end of the 17th century, the bandeirantes expeditions discovered gold in central Brazil, in the region of Minas Gerais, which started a gold rush that led to a dramatic urban development of inland Brazil during the 18th century. Additionally, inland expeditions led to westward expansion of the frontiers of colonial Brazil, beyond the limits established by the Treaty of Tordesillas.\\r\\nThe discovery of gold was met with great enthusiasm by Portugal, which had an economy in disarray following years of wars against Spain and the Netherlands. A gold rush quickly ensued, with people from other parts of the colony and Portugal flooding the region in the first half of the 18th century. The large portion of the Brazilian inland where gold was extracted became known as the Minas Gerais (General Mines). Gold mining in this area became the main economic activity of colonial Brazil during the 18th century. In Portugal, the gold was mainly used to pay for industrialized goods (textiles, weapons) obtained from countries like England and, especially during the reign of King John V, to build magnificent Baroque monuments like the Convent of Mafra. Apart from gold, diamond deposits were also found in 1729 around the village of Tijuco, now Diamantina. A famous figure in Brazilian history of this era was Xica da Silva, a slave woman who had a long term relationship in Diamantina with a Portuguese official; the couple had thirteen children and she died a rich woman.[25] She has been the subject of a Brazilian feature film by Carlos Diegues, Xica and a telenovela Xica da Silva.\\r\\nIn the hilly landscape of Minas Gerais, gold was present in alluvial deposits around streams and was extracted using pans and other similar instruments that required little technology. Gold extraction was mostly done by slaves. The Portuguese Crown allowed particulars to extract the gold, requiring a fifth (20%) of the gold (the quinto) to be sent to the colonial government as tribute. To prevent smuggling and extract the quinto, in 1725 the government ordered all gold to be cast into bars in the Casas de Fundi??o (Casting Houses), and sent armies to the region to prevent disturbances and oversee the mining process. The Royal tribute was very unpopular in Minas Gerais, and gold was frequently hidden from colonial authorities. Eventually, the quinto contributed to rebellious movements like the Levante de Vila Rica, in 1720, and the Inconfidncia Mineira, in 1789 (see below).\\r\\nSome historians mention that the trade deficit of Portugal in relation to England while the Methuen Treaty was in force has also contributed to redirect much of the gold mined in Brazil during the 18th century to Britain. The Methuen Treaty was a trade treaty signed between England and Portugal, by where all woolen cloth imported from Britain would be tax free in Portugal, whereas Portuguese wine exported to Britain would be taxed at a third of the previous import tax on wines. Port wine became increasingly popular in Britain at that time, but cloth amounted to a larger share of the trade value than wines, hence Portugal eventually incurred in trade deficit with England.\\r\\nThe large number of adventurers coming to the Minas Gerais led to the foundation of several settlements, the first of which were created in 1711: Vila Rica de Ouro Preto, Sabar and Mariana, followed by S?o Jo?o del Rei (1713), Serro, Caet (1714), Pitangui (1715) and S?o Jos do Rio das Mortes (1717, now Tiradentes). In contrast to other regions of colonial Brazil, people coming to Minas Gerais settled mostly in villages instead of the countryside.\\r\\nIn 1763, the capital of colonial Brazil was transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro, which was located closer to the mining region and provided a harbor to ship the gold to Europe.\\r\\nAccording to the historian Leslie Bethell, \\"In 1700 Portugal had a population of about two million people. During the eighteenth century approximately 400,000 left for [the Portuguese colony of] Brazil, despite efforts by the crown to place severe restrictions on emigration.\\"[26]\\r\\nGold production declined towards the end of the 18th century, beginning a period of relative stagnation of the Brazilian hinterland.\\r\\nIn an attempt to expand the borders of colonial Brazil and profit from the silver mines of Potos, the Portuguese Overseas Council (the Conselho Ultramarino) ordered colonial governor Manuel Lobo to establish a settlement on the shore of the River Plate, in a region that legally belonged to Spain. In 1679, Manuel Lobo founded Colonia de Sacramento on the margin opposite to Buenos Aires. The fortified settlement quickly became an important point of illegal commerce between the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. Spain and Portugal fought over the enclave on several occasions (1681, 1704, 1735).\\r\\nIn addition to Colonia de Sacramento, several settlements were established in Southern Brazil in the late 17th and 18th century, some with peasants from the Azores Islands. The towns founded in this period include Curitiba (1668), Florian܇polis (1675), Rio Grande (1736), Porto Alegre (1742) and others, and helped keep southern Brazil firmly under Portuguese control.\\r\\nThe conflicts over the Southern colonial frontiers led to the signing of the Treaty of Madrid (1750), in which Spain and Portugal agreed to a considerable Southwestward expansion of colonial Brazil. According to the treaty, Colonia de Sacramento was to be given to Spain in exchange for the territories of S?o Miguel das Miss?es, a region occupied by Jesuit Missions dedicated to evangelizing the Guaran natives. Resistance by the Jesuits and the Guaran led to the Guaran War (1756), in which Portuguese and Spanish troops destroyed the Missions. Colonia de Sacramento kept changing hands until 1777, when it was definitively conquered by the colonial governor of Buenos Aires.\\r\\nIn 1788/89, Minas Gerais was the setting of the most important conspiracy against colonial authorities, the so-called Inconfidncia Mineira, inspired by the ideals of the French liberal philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment and the successful American Revolution of 1776. The conspirators largely belonged to the white upper class of Minas Gerais.[27] Many had studied in Europe, especially in the University of Coimbra, and some had large debts with the colonial government. In the context of declining gold production, the intention of the Portuguese government to impose the obligatory payment of all debts (the derrama) was a leading cause behind the conspiracy. The conspirators wanted to create a Republic in which the leader would be chosen through democratic elections. The capital would be S?o Jo?o del Rei, and Ouro Preto would become a university town. The structure of the society, including the right to property and the ownership of slaves, would be kept intact.\\r\\nThe conspiracy was discovered by the Portuguese colonial government in 1789, before the planned military rebellion could take place. Eleven of the conspirators were exiled to Portuguese colonial possessions in Angola, but Joaquim Jos da Silva Xavier, nicknamed Tiradentes, was sentenced to death. Tiradentes was hanged in Rio de Janeiro in 1792, drawn and quartered, and his body parts displayed in several towns. He later became a symbol of the struggle for Brazilian independence and liberty from Portuguese rule.\\r\\nThe Inconfidncia Mineira was not the only rebellious movement in colonial Brazil against the Portuguese. Later, in 1798, there was the Inconfidncia Baiana in Salvador. In this episode, which had more participation of common people, four people were hanged, and 41 were jailed. Members included slaves, middle-class people and even some landowners.\\r\\nThe Napoleonic invasion of the Iberian peninsula set off major changes there and in both Portugal's and Spain's overseas empires. In 1807 French troops of Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Britain's ally, Portugal. Prince Regent Jo?o (future King Jo?o VI), who had governed since 1792 on behalf of his mother, Queen Maria I, ordered the transfer of the Portuguese royal court to Brazil before he could be deposed by the invading army. In January 1808, Prince Jo?o and his court arrived in Salvador, where he signed a commercial regulation that opened commerce between Brazil and friendly nations (Britain). This important law broke the colonial pact that, until then, allowed Brazil to maintain direct commercial relations with only Portugal.[28][29]\\r\\nIn March 1808, the court arrived in Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, during the Congress of Vienna, Prince Jo?o created the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves (Reino Unido de Portugal, Brasil e Algarves), elevating Brazil to the rank of Portugal and increasing its administrative independence.\\r\\nIn 1816, with the death of Queen Maria, Prince Jo?o succeeded as monarch, and the ceremony of his acclamation was held in Rio de Janeiro in February 1818.\\r\\nAmong the important measures taken by Prince Jo?o in his years in Brazil were incentives to commerce and industry, the permission to print newspapers and books, the creation of two medicine schools, military academies, and the first Bank of Brazil (Banco do Brasil). In Rio de Janeiro he also created a powder factory, a Botanical Garden, an art academy (Escola Nacional de Belas Artes) and an opera house (Teatro S?o Jo?o). All these measures greatly advanced the independence of Brazil in relation to Portugal and made the later political separation between the two countries inevitable.\\r\\nDue to the absence of the King and the economic independence of Brazil, Portugal entered a severe crisis that obliged Jo?o VI and the royal family to return to Portugal in 1821: a Liberal Revolution had broken out in Portugal in 1820, and the royal governors who ruled Portugal in the King's name had been replaced by a revolutionary Council of Regency formed to govern the European portion of the kingdom until the King's return. Indeed, the King's immediate return to Lisbon was one of the main demands of the Revolution. Under the revolutionary Council of Regency, a constituent assembly, known as the Portuguese Constitutional Courts (Cortes Constitucionais Portuguesas), was elected to abolish the absolute monarchy and replace it with a constitutional one. King Jo?o VI, then, yielding to pressure, returned to Europe. Brazilian representatives were elected to join the deliberations of the Constitutional Cortes of the kingdom.\\r\\nThe heir of Jo?o VI, Prince Pedro, remained in Brazil. The Portuguese Cortes demanded that Brazil return to its former condition of colony and that the heir return to Portugal. Prince Pedro, influenced by the Rio de Janeiro Municipal Senate (Senado da Camara), refused to return to Portugal in the famous Dia do Fico (January 9, 1822). Political independence came on September 7, 1822, and the prince was crowned emperor in Rio de Janeiro as Dom Pedro I, ending 322 years of dominance of Portugal over Brazil.\\r\\n1534\\r\\nCapitanias hereditrias\\r\\n1573\\r\\nTwo states\\r\\n1709\\r\\nInland expansion\\r\\n1750\\r\\nTreaty of Madrid\\r\\n1817\\r\\nAt the time of the Pernambucan revolt\\r\\n1822\\r\\nAt date of Independence\\r\\nColonial entities, ordered by the date of establishment, earlier to later:\\r\\nThe detailed history of the administrative changes in the administration of colonial Brazil is as follows:\\r\\nFrom 1534 (immediately after the start the Portuguese attempts to effectively colonize Brazil) until 1549, Brazil was divided by the Portuguese Crown in private and autonomous colonies known as hereditary captaincies (capitanias hereditrias), or captaincy colonies (col܇nias capitanias).\\r\\nIn 1549, Portuguese King John III abolished the system of private colonies, and the fifteen existing hereditary captaincies were incorporated into a single Crown colony, the Governorate General of Brazil.\\r\\nThe individual captaincies, now under the administration of the Portuguese Crown (and no longer called colonies or hereditary captaincies, but simply captaincies of Brazil), continued to exist as provinces or districts within the colony until the end of the colonial era in 1815.\\r\\nThe unified Governorate General of Brazil, with its capital city in Salvador, existed during three periods: from 1549 to 1572, from 1578 to 1607 and from 1613 to 1621. Between 1572 and 1578 and again between 1607 and 1613, the colony was split in two, and during those periods the Governorate General of Brazil did not exist, being replaced by two separate Governorates: the Governorate General of Bahia, in the North, with its seat in the city of Salvador, and the Governorate General of Rio de Janeiro, in the South, with its seat in the city of Rio de Janeiro.\\r\\nIn 1621, an administrative reorganization took place, and the Governorate General of Brazil became known as the State of Brazil (Estado do Brasil), keeping Salvador as its capital city. With this administrative remodeling, the unity of the colony was once again interrupted, as a portion of territory in the northern part of modern Brazil became an autonomous colony, separate from the State of Brazil: the State of Maranh?o, with its capital city in S?o Luiz.\\r\\nIn 1652, the State of Maranh?o was extinguished, and its territory was briefly added to the State of Brazil, reunifying the colonial administration once more.\\r\\nHowever, in 1654, the territories of the former State of Maranh?o were again separated from the State of Brazil, and the Captaincy of Gr?o-Par was also split from Brazil. In this restructuring, the territories of Gr?o-Par and Maranh?o, severed from Brazil, were united in a single State, initially named as State of Maranh?o and Gr?o-Par, having S?o Luiz as its capital city. This newly created State incorporated territories recently acquired by the Portuguese west of the Tordesillas line.\\r\\nIn 1751, the State of Maranh?o and Gr?o-Par was renamed as the State of Gr?o-Par and Maranh?o, and its capital city as transferred from S?o Luiz (in Maranh?o) to Belm (in the part of the State that was then known as Gr?o-Par).\\r\\nIn 1763 the capital city of the State of Brazil was transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. At the same time, the title of the King's representative heading the government of the State of Brazil was officially changed from Governor General to Viceroy (Governors coming from the high nobility had been using the title of Viceroy since about 1640). However, the name of Brazil was never changed to Viceroyalty of Brazil. That title, although sometimes used by modern writers, is not proper, as the colony continued to be titled State of Brazil.\\r\\nIn 1772, in a short-lived territorial reorganization, the State of Gr?o-Par and Maranh?o was split in two: the State of Gr?o-Par and Rio Negro (better known simply as the State of Gr?o-Par), with the city of Belm as its capital, and the State of Maranh?o and Piau (better known simply as the State of Maranh?o), with its seat in the city of S?o Luiz.\\r\\nThus from 1772 until another territorial reorganization in 1775 there were three distinct Portuguese States in South America: the State of Brazil, the State of Gr?o-Par and Rio Negro, and the State of Maranh?o and Piau.\\r\\nIn 1775, in a final territorial reorganization, the colony was once again reunified: the State of Maranh?o and Piau and the State of Gr?o-Par and Rio Negro were both abolished, and their territories were incorporated into the territory of the State of Brazil. The State of Brazil was thus expanded; it became the sole Portuguese State in South America; and it now included in its territory the whole of the Portuguese possessions in the American Continent. Indeed, with the reorganization of 1775, for the first time since 1654, all the Portuguese territories in the New World were once again united under a single colonial government. Rio de Janeiro, that had become the capital of the State of Brazil in 1763, continued to be the capital, now of the unified colony.\\r\\nIn 1808, the Portuguese Court was transferred to Brazil as direct consequence of the invasion of Portugal during the Napoleonic Wars. The office of Viceroy of Brazil ceased to exist upon the arrival of the Royal Family in Rio de Janeiro, since the Prince Regent, the future King Jonh VI, assumed personal control of the government of the colony, that became the provisional seat of the whole Portuguese Empire.\\r\\nIn 1815, Brazil ceased to be a colony, upon the elevation of the State of Brazil to the rank of a kingdom, the Kingdom of Brazil, and the simultaneous political union of that kingdom with the Kingdoms of Portugal and the Algarves, forming a single sovereign State, the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. That political union would last until 1822, when Brazil declared its independence from the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves and became the Empire of Brazil, a sovereign nation in the territory of the former Kingdom of Brazil. The separation was recognized by Portugal with the signing of the 1825 Treaty of Rio de Janeiro.\\r\\nWith the creation of the Kingdom of Brazil in 1815, the former captaincies of the State of Brazil became provinces within the new Kingdom, and after independence they became the provinces of the Empire of Brazil.\\r\\nColonization\\r\\nGeneral history\\r\\n15th century\\r\\n16th century\\r\\n15th century\\r\\n16th century\\r\\n17th century\\r\\n18th century\\r\\n19th century\\r\\n16th century\\r\\n17th century\\r\\n15th century\\r\\n16th century\\r\\nPortuguese India\\r\\n17th century\\r\\nPortuguese India\\r\\n18th century\\r\\nPortuguese India\\r\\n16th century\\r\\n17th century\\r\\n19th century\\r\\nPortuguese Macau\\r\\n20th century\\r\\nPortuguese Macau\\r\\n15th century [Atlantic islands]\\r\\n16th century [Canada]\\r\\n16th century\\r\\n17th century\\r\\n18th century\\r\\n19th century","input":"What was the main source of labor in the portuguese colony?"},{"output":"Gr?f & Stift","context":"Front-wheel drive (FWD) is a form of engine and transmission layout used in motor vehicles, where the engine drives the front wheels only. Most modern front-wheel-drive vehicles feature a transverse engine, rather than the conventional longitudinal engine arrangement generally found in rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel drive vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost FWD layouts are front-engined. Rear-engined layouts are possible, but rare. Historically they fall into three categories:\\r\\nExperiments with front-wheel-drive cars date to the early days of the automobile. According to various sources, sometime between 1895 and 1898 Gr?f & Stift built a voiturette with a one-cylinder De Dion-Bouton engine fitted in the front of the vehicle, powering the front axle. It was thus arguably the world's first front-wheel-drive automobile, but it never saw mass production, with only one copy ever made. In 1898, Latil, in France, devised a front-wheel-drive system for motorising horse-drawn carts.\\r\\nIn 1898/9 the French manufacturer Socit Parisienne patented their front-wheel drive articulated vehicle concept which they manufactured as a Victoria Combination. It was variously powered by 1.75 or 2.5 horsepower (1.30 or 1.86?kW) De Dion-Bouton engine or a water cooled 3.5 horsepower (2.6?kW) Aster engine. The engine was mounted on the front axle and so was rotated by the tiller steering.[1][2][3][4] The name Victoria Combination described the lightweight, two-seater trailer commonly known as a Victoria, combined with the rear axle and drive mechanism from a motor tricycle that was placed in front to achieve front wheel drive.[2][3][4] It also known as the Eureka.\\r\\nBy 1899 Victoria Combinations were participating in motoring events such as the 371?km Paris-St Malo race, finishing 23rd overall and second(last) in the class.[5] In October a Victoria Combination won its class in the Paris-Rambouillet-Paris event, covering the 100 kilometre course at 26?km/h (16?mph).[3][4] In 1900 it completed 240 kilometres (150?mi) non-stop at 29?km/h (18?mph).[1]\\r\\nWhen production ceased in mid-1901, over 400 copies had been sold for 3,000 Francs (circa $600) each.[3][4]\\r\\nJ. Walter Christie of the United States patented a design for a front-wheel-drive car, the first prototype of which he built in 1904.[6] He promoted and demonstrated the vehicle by racing at various speedways in the United States, and even competed in the 1906 Vanderbilt Cup[7] and the French Grand Prix. In 1912 he began manufacturing a line of wheeled fire engine tractors which used his front-wheel-drive system, but due to lack of sales this venture failed.\\r\\nThe next successful application of front-wheel drive was the supercharged Alvis 12/50 racing car designed by George Thomas Smith-Clarke and William M. Dunn of Alvis Cars of the United Kingdom. This vehicle was entered in the 1925 Kop Hill Climb in Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire on March 28, 1925. Harry Arminius Miller of Menomonie, Wisconsin designed the Miller 122 front-wheel-drive racecar that was entered in the 1925 Indianapolis 500, which was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Saturday, May 30, 1925.[8]\\r\\nHowever, the idea of front-wheel drive languished outside the motor racing arena as no major auto manufacturer attempted the same for production automobiles. Market experiments in the United States were left to small endeavors such as the Ruxton (200 cars in 1929), and the Cord L-29 of 1929. Neither automobile maker was particularly successful on the open market. Alvis Cars introduced a front-wheel-drive commercial model of the Alvis 12/50 in 1928, but it was not a success either.[9]\\r\\nThe first successful consumer application came in 1929. The BSA (Birmingham Small Arms Company) produced the unique front-wheel-drive BSA three-wheeler. Production continued until 1936 during which time sports and touring models were available. In 1931 the DKW F1 from Germany made its debut. Buckminster Fuller adopted rear-engine, front wheel drive for his three Dymaxion Car prototypes. Other German car producers followed: Stoewer offered a car with front-wheel drive in 1931, Adler in 1932 and Audi in 1933. In 1934, the very successful Traction Avant cars were introduced by Citro?n of France. The Cord 810 of the United States managed a bit better in the late 1930s than its predecessor one decade earlier. These vehicles featured a layout that places the engine behind the transmission, running \\"backwards,\\" (save for the Cord, which drove the transmission from the front of the engine). The basic front-wheel-drive layout provides sharp turning, and better weight distribution creates \\"positive handling characteristics\\" due to its low polar inertia and relatively favourable weight distribution.[10] (The heaviest component is near the centre of the car, making the main component of its moment of inertia relatively low). Another result of this design is a lengthened chassis.\\r\\nFront-wheel drive continued with the 1948 Citro?n 2CV, where the air-cooled lightweight aluminium flat twin engine was mounted ahead of the front wheels, but used Hooke type universal joint driveshaft joints, and 1955 Citro?n DS, featuring the mid-engine layout. Panhard of France, DKW of Germany and Saab of Sweden offered exclusively front-wheel-drive cars, starting with the 1948 Saab 92.\\r\\nIn 1946, Lloyd Cars, the English car company, had produced the front-wheel-drive roadster, Lloyd 650. The two-stroke, two-cylinder motor was mounted transversely in the front and connected to the front wheels through four-speed synchronised gearbox. The high price and lacklustre performance had doomed its production. Only 600 units were produced from 1946 to 1950.\\r\\nIn 1954, Alfa-Romeo had experimented with its first front-wheel-drive compact car named \\"33\\" (not related or referred to sports car similarly named \\"33\\"). It had the same transverse-mounted, forward-motor layout as the modern front-wheel-drive automobiles. It even resembled the smaller version of its popular Alfa Romeo Giulia. However, due to the financial difficulties in post-war Italy, the 33 never saw the production. Had Alfa-Romeo succeed in producing 33, it would precede the Mini as the first \\"modern\\" European front-wheel-drive compact car.\\r\\nIn 1955, one of the first Japanese manufacturers to utilize front-wheel drive with a transversely installed engine was the Suzuki Suzulight, which was a small \\"city\\" car, called a kei car in Japanese.\\r\\nIn 1959 Austin Mini was launched by the British Motor Corporation, designed by Alec Issigonis as a response to the first 'oil crisis', the 1956 Suez Crisis, and the boom in bubble cars that followed. It was the first production front-wheel-drive car with a watercooled inline four-cylinder engine mounted transversely. This allowed eighty percent of the floor plan for the use of passengers and luggage. The majority of modern cars use this configuration. Its progressive rate rubber sprung independent suspension, low centre of gravity, and wheel at each corner with radial tyres, gave a massive increase in grip and handling over all but the most expensive cars on the market. It used GKN designed Constant-velocity joint drive shaft universal joints.\\r\\nThe transversely mounted engine combined with front-wheel drive was popularized by the 1959 Mini; there the transmission was built into the sump of the engine, and drive was transferred to it via a set of primary gears. Another variant transmission concept was used by Simca in the 1960s keeping the engine and transmission in line, but transverse mounted and with unequal length driveshafts. This has proven itself to be the model on which almost all modern FWD vehicles are now based. Peugeot and Renault on their jointly developed small car engine of the 1970s where the 4-cylinder block was canted over to reduce the overall height of the engine with the transmission underneath (PSA X engine). The tendency of this layout to generate unwanted transmission \\"whine\\" has seen it fall out of favour. Also, clutch changes required engine removal.\\r\\nThe 1965 Triumph 1300 was designed around a longitudinal engine with the transmission underneath. Audi has also used a longitudinally mounted engine overhung over the front wheels since the 1970s. Audi is one of the few manufacturers which still uses this particular configuration. It allows the use of equal-length half shafts and the easy addition of all-wheel drive, but has the disadvantage that it makes it difficult to achieve 50/50 weight distribution (although they remedy this in four-wheel-drive models by mounting the gearbox at the rear of the transaxle.) The Subaru 1000 appeared in 1966 utilizing front-wheel drive mated to a flat-4 engine, with the driveshafts of equal length extending from the transmission, which addressed some of the issues of the powertrain being somewhat complex and unbalanced in the engine compartment - the Alfa Romeo Alfasud (and its replacement, the 1983 Alfa 33) also used the same layout.\\r\\nHonda also introduced several small front wheel drive vehiches, with the N360 and N600, the Z360 and Z600 in 1967, the Honda 1300 in 1969, followed by the Honda Civic in 1972 and the Honda Accord in 1976.\\r\\nAlso in the 1970s and 1980s, the Douvrin engines used in the larger Renaults (20, 21, 25 and 30) used this longitudinal \\"forward\\" layout. The first generation Saab 900, launched in 1978, also used a longitudinal engine with a transmission underneath with helical gears. The 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado was the first U.S. front-wheel-drive car since the Cord 810. It used a longitudinal engine placement for its V8, coupled with an unusual \\"split\\" transmission, which turned the engine power 180 degrees. Power then went to a differential mounted to the transmission case, from which half-shafts took it to the wheels. The driveline was set fairly at centre-point of the wheels for better weight distribution, though this raised the engine, requiring lowered intake systems.\\r\\nLittle known outside of Italy, the Primula is today primarily known for innovating the modern economy-car layout.\\r\\nÿ Hemmings Motor News,[11]\\r\\nThis Active Tourer MPV wants to be more stable than a BMW M3, and using the Dante Giacosa-pattern front-wheel-drive layout compacts the mechanicals and saves space for people in the reduced overall length of what will surely become a production 1-series tall-sedan crossover.\\r\\nÿ Robert Cumberford, Automobile Magazine, March, 2013[12]\\r\\nFront-wheel drive layout had been highly impacted by the success of small, inexpensive cars, especially the British Mini. As engineered by Alec Issigonis, the compact arrangement located the transmission and engine sharing a single oil sump  despite disparate lubricating requirements  and had the engine's radiator mounted to the side of the engine, away from the flow of fresh air and drawing heated rather than cool air over the engine. The layout often required the engine be removed to service the clutch.[13]\\r\\nAs engineered by Dante Giacosa, the Fiat 128 featured a transverse-mounted engine with unequal length drive shafts and an innovative clutch release mechanism  an arrangement which Fiat had strategically tested on a previous production model, the Primula, from its less market-critical subsidiary, Autobianchi.\\r\\nReady for production in 1964, the Primula featured a gear train offset from the differential and final drive with unequal length drive shafts. The layout enabled the engine and gearbox to be located side by side without sharing lubricating fluid while orienting the cooling fan toward fresh air flow. By using the Primula as a test-bed, Fiat was able to sufficiently resolve the layout's disadvantages, including uneven side-to-side power transmission, uneven tire wear and potential torque steer, the tendency for the power of the engine alone to steer the car under heavy acceleration.\\r\\nAfter the 128, Fiat further demonstrated the layout's flexibility, re-configurating the 128 drive-train as a mid-engined layout for the Fiat X1/9. The compact, efficient Giacosa layout  a transversely-mounted engine with transmission mounted beside the engine driving the front wheels through an offset final-drive and unequal-length driveshafts, combined with MacPherson struts and an independently located radiator  subsequently became common with competitors[14] and arguably an industry standard.[15]\\r\\nThe Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard drove a mass changeover of cars in the U.S. to front-wheel drive. The change began in 1978, with the introduction of the first American-built transverse-engined cars, the Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni (based on the European designed Simca Horizon),[16] followed by the 1980 Chevrolet Citation and numerous other vehicles. Meanwhile, European car makers, that had moved to front-wheel drive decades before, began to homogenize their engine arrangement only in this decade, leaving Audi (and Volkswagen) alone with the Audi front drive-longitudinal engine layout. Years before this was the most common layout in Europe, with examples like Citroen DS, Renault 12, Renault 5, Renault 25 (a Chrysler LH ancestor) Alfa Romeo 33, Volkswagen Passat, etc. This transition can be exemplified in the Renault 21 that was offered with disparate engine configurations. The 1.7-litre version featured an 'east-west' (transversely) mounted engine, but Renault had no gearbox suitable for a more powerful transverse engine: accordingly, faster versions featured longitudinally mounted (north south) engines.\\r\\nBy reducing drivetrain weight and space needs, vehicles could be made smaller and more efficient without sacrificing acceleration. Integrating the powertrain with a transverse as opposed to a longitudinal layout, along with unibody construction and the use of constant velocity jointed drive axles, along with front wheel drive has evolved into the modern-day mass market automobile. Some suggest that the introduction of the modern Volkswagen Golf in 1974, from a traditional U.S. competitor, and the introduction of the 1973 Honda Civic, and the 1976 Honda Accord served as a wake-up call for the \\"Big Three\\" (only Chrysler already produced front-wheel-drive vehicles in their operations outside North America). Ford's 1976 Ford Fiesta was its first front-wheel-drive car in Europe, GM was even later with the 1979 Vauxhall Astra/Opel Kadett. Captive imports were the US car makers initial response to the increased demand for economy cars. The popularity of front-wheel drive began to gain momentum, with the 1981 Ford Escort, the 1982 Nissan Sentra, and the 1983 Toyota Corolla. Front-wheel drive became the norm for mid-sized cars starting with the 1982 Chevrolet Celebrity, 1982 Toyota Camry, 1983 Dodge 600, 1985 Nissan Maxima, 1986 Honda Legend, and the 1986 Ford Taurus. By the mid-1980s, most formerly rear-wheel-drive Japanese models were front-wheel drive, and by the mid-1990s, most American brands only sold a handful of rear-wheel-drive models.\\r\\nThe vast majority of front-wheel-drive vehicles today use a transversely mounted engine with \\"end-on\\" mounted transmission, driving the front wheels via driveshafts linked via constant velocity (CV) joints, and a flexibly located electronically controlled cooling fan. This configuration was pioneered by Dante Giacosa in the 1964 Autobianchi Primula and popularized with the Fiat 128.[17] Fiat promoted in its advertising that mechanical features consumed only 20% of the vehicle's volume and that Enzo Ferrari drove a 128 as his personal vehicle.[14] The 1959 Mini, while a pioneering transverse front-wheel-drive vehicle[citation needed], used a substantially different arrangement with the transmission in the sump, and the cooling fan drawing hot air from its side-facing location.\\r\\nVolvo Cars has switched its entire lineup after the 900 series to front-wheel drive. Swedish engineers at the company have said that transversely mounted engines allow for more crumple zone area in a head-on collision. American auto manufacturers are now shifting larger models (such as the Chrysler 300 and most of the Cadillac lineup) back to rear-wheel drive.[18][19] There were relatively few rear-wheel-drive cars marketed in North America by the early 1990s; Chrysler's car line-up was entirely front-wheel drive by 1990. GM followed suit in 1996 where its B-body line was phased out, where its sports cars (Camaro, Firebird, Corvette) were the only RWDs marketed; by the early 2000s, the Chevrolet Corvette and Cadillac Catera were the only RWD cars offered by General Motors until the introduction of the Sigma platform. After the phaseout of the Ford Panther platform (except for the Mustang), Ford automobiles (including the Transit Connect van) manufactured for the 2012 model year to present are front wheel drive; its D3 platform (based on a Volvo platform) has optional all wheel drive.","input":"Who invented the first front wheel drive car?"},{"output":"New York Minute","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen (born June 13, 1986), also known as the Olsen twins collectively, are American fashion designers and former child actresses. The dizygotic twins made their acting debut as infants playing Michelle Tanner on the television series Full House. At the age of six, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen began starring together in TV, film, and video projects, which continued to their teenage years. Through their company Dualstar, the Olsens joined the ranks of the wealthiest women in the entertainment industry at a young age.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe twins were born in Sherman Oaks, California, to David \\"Dave\\" Olsen[1] (b. 1953) and Jarnette \\"Jarnie\\" (ne Jones;[2] b. 1954). They are dizygotic twins.[3] They have an elder brother, Trent, and a younger sister, actress Elizabeth, as well as a half-sister, Courtney Taylor, and a half-brother, Jake.[4] The twins' parents divorced in 1995; Taylor and Jake are from their father's second marriage to McKenzie.[5] The Olsen twins have English and Norwegian ancestry.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1987, at the age of six months, the twins were cast in the role of Michelle Tanner on the ABC sitcom Full House. They began filming at nine months old. In order to comply with child labor laws that set strict limits on how long a child actor may work, the sisters took turns playing the role. The Olsens continued to portray Michelle throughout the show's run, which concluded in 1995.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, Mary-Kate and Ashley shared the role of Michelle Tanner when they guest-starred on the Full House crossover episode of Hangin' with Mr. Cooper. While starring on Full House, the Olsens also began appearing (as separate characters) in films for video and television. The first such film, To Grandmother's House We Go, debuted in 1992 and featured cameos from several other Full House actors. In 1993, the Olsens established the company Dualstar, which would produce the twins' subsequent films and videos, including 1993's Double, Double, Toil and Trouble and 1994's How the West Was Fun. A series of musical mystery videos called The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley premiered in 1994 and continued through 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, following the end of Full House, the Olsens made their feature film debut in It Takes Two, co-starring Steve Guttenberg and Kirstie Alley. In the same year, they introduced a second video series, You're Invited to Mary-Kate & Ashley's..., which continued to release new entries until 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following year, the Olsens appeared in an episode of All My Children.[7] In 1997, they appeared once again as guest stars in an episode of Sister Sister. Also, in 1998, the twins returned to series television with another ABC sitcom, Two of a Kind, co-starring Christopher Sieber as their characters' widowed father. The series lasted only one season but aired in reruns on cable for several years afterward. 1998 also saw the release of Billboard Dad, the first of a new string of direct-to-video films starring the Olsens. The final such film, The Challenge, debuted in 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, the Olsens appeared in an episode of 7th Heaven as bad girls Sue and Carol Murphy.[8] The following year, the sisters starred in two new series: So Little Time, a live-action sitcom on Fox Family (later ABC Family); and Mary-Kate and Ashley in Action!, an animated series airing Saturday mornings on ABC. Both shows were canceled after one season, although Mary-Kate received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for her performance on So Little Time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2004, Mary-Kate and Ashley had a cameo voice role in an episode of The Simpsons as the readers of Marge's book-on-tape, The Harpooned Heart.[9] Also in 2004, the twins starred in a second feature film, New York Minute. It would be their last film together, as well as Ashley's last acting role. Mary-Kate has continued to appear in film and television.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary-Kate and Ashley had a fan club until 2000, \\"Mary-Kate & Ashley's Fun Club\\", where fans would pay to receive Mary-Kate and Ashley collectibles and photos. Each subscription included an issue of Our Funzine, Mary-Kate and Ashley's fan club magazine, exclusively available through the club, and a collectibles catalog, where one could purchase T-shirts, posters, baseball caps, key rings, school folders, postcards, and various other items. Subscribers would also receive \\"surprise gifts\\" (usually key rings, book excerpts, or back issues of the Funzine), lyric sheets to Mary-Kate and Ashley's songs, a school folder, a membership card, a full-sized poster, two black and white photos (one of each girl), and a color photo with reprint autographs. The club was advertised at the beginning of Mary-Kate and Ashley movies until 1998.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary-Kate and Ashley were popular figures in the preteen market during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Their names and likenesses extended, not only to movies and videos, but to clothes, shoes, purses, hats, books, CDs and cassette tapes, fragrances and makeup, magazines, video and board games, dolls, posters, calendars, and even telephones and CD playerswith a market share made up mostly of the tween demographic. Mattel produced various sets of Mary-Kate and Ashley fashion dolls from 2000 to 2005, along with separate outfits and accessory packs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sisters became co-presidents of Dualstar on their 18th birthday in 2004. Upon taking control of the company, Mary-Kate and Ashley made moves to secure the future of the company by releasing products that appealed to the teen market, including home decoration and fragrances.[11]  The Dualstar brand has been sold in more than 3,000 stores in the United States and over 5,300 stores worldwide.[12] The Olsens have appeared on the Forbes \\"Celebrity 100\\" list since 2002; in 2007, Forbes ranked them (collectively) as the eleventh-richest women in entertainment, with an estimated net worth of US $100 million.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the sisters have matured, they expressed greater interest in their fashion choices, with The New York Times declaring Mary-Kate a fashion icon for pioneering her signature (and now popular among celebrities and fans alike) \\"homeless\\" look.[14] The style sometimes referred to by fashion journalists as \\"ashcan\\" or \\"bohemian-bourgeois\\",[15] is similar to the boho-chic style popularized in Britain by Kate Moss and Sienna Miller. The look consists of oversized sunglasses, boots, loose sweaters, and flowing skirts, with an aesthetic of mixing high-end and low-end pieces.[15] The twins were tapped as the faces of upscale fashion line Badgley Mischka in 2006.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Olsens had a clothing line for girls ages 4ÿ14 in Wal-Mart stores across North America, as well as a beauty line called \\"Mary-Kate and Ashley: Real fashion for real girls\\". In 2004, they made news by signing a pledge to allow full maternity leave to all the workers that sew their line of clothing in Bangladesh. The National Labor Committee, which organized the pledge, praised the twins for their commitment to worker rights.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n The Olsens have also launched their own couture fashion label, The Row, named after Savile Row in London.[18] In 2007, they launched Elizabeth & James, a contemporary collection inspired by many of their unique vintage finds and pieces in their personal wardrobes. They have also released a women's clothing line for J.C. Penney, called Olsenboye, and a T-shirt line called \\"StyleMint\\".[19] In 2008, the sisters published the book Influence, a compilation of interviews with many of the most prominent people in the field of fashion. In August 2013, the twins launched a new fashion line in Oslo, Norway.[20] The Olsens were first named Womenswear Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) for The Row in 2012. They received the award again in 2015.[21][22] The CFDA also named the Olsens Accessories Designer of the Year in 2014 for their work with The Row.[23]","input":"What was the last mary kate and ashley movie?"},{"output":"Skamania County, in the State of Washington","context":"On May 18, 1980, a major volcanic eruption occurred at Mount St. Helens, a volcano located in Skamania County, in the State of Washington. The eruption (a VEI 5 event) was the most significant volcanic eruption to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California.[1] It has often been declared as the most disastrous volcanic eruption in U.S. history. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes, caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain's north slope.\\r\\nAn earthquake at 8:32:17?a.m. PDT (UTC?7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly molten, high-pressure gas- and steam-rich rock in the volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward Spirit Lake in a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face.\\r\\nAn eruption column rose 80,000 feet (24?km; 15?mi) into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states.[2] At the same time, snow, ice and several entire glaciers on the volcano melted, forming a series of large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that reached as far as the Columbia River, nearly 50 miles (80?km) to the southwest. Less severe outbursts continued into the next day, only to be followed by other large, but not as destructive, eruptions later that year. Thermal energy released during the eruption was equal to 26 megatons.[3]\\r\\nApproximately 57 people were killed directly, including innkeeper Harry R. Truman, photographers Reid Blackburn and Robert Landsburg, and geologist David A. Johnston.[4] Hundreds of square miles were reduced to wasteland, causing over a billion U.S. dollars in damage ($3.03 billion in 2017 dollars[5]), thousands of animals were killed, and Mount St. Helens was left with a crater on its north side. At the time of the eruption, the summit of the volcano was owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad, but afterward the land passed to the United States Forest Service.[6] The area was later preserved, as it was, in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMount St. Helens remained dormant from its last period of activity in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980.[7] Several small earthquakes, apparently beginning on March 15, indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano.[8] On March 20, at 3:45?p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake (the initial reading was 4.1), centered below the volcano's north flank,[8] signaled the volcano's violent return from 123?years of hibernation.[9] A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale.[10] A total of 174 shocks of magnitude?2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days.[11]\\r\\nShocks of magnitude?3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude?4 or above per day in early April, and eight?per?day the week before May 18.[9] Initially there was no direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations.\\r\\nAt 12:36?p.m. on March 27, phreatic eruptions (explosions of steam caused by magma suddenly heating groundwater) ejected and smashed rock from within the old summit crater, excavating a new crater 250 feet (75?m) wide[9] and sending an ash column about 7,000 feet (2.1?km) into the air.[11] By this date a 16,000-foot-long (3.0?mi; 4.9?km) eastward-trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area.[12] This was followed by more earthquake swarms and a series of steam explosions that sent ash 10,000 to 11,000 feet (3,000 to 3,400?m) above their vent.[9] Most of this ash fell between 3 and 12 miles (5 and 19?km) from its vent, but some was carried 150 miles (240?km) south to Bend, Oregon, or 285 miles (460?km) east to Spokane, Washington.[13]\\r\\nA second, new crater and a blue flame were observed on March 29.[13][14] The flame was visibly emitted from both craters and was probably created by burning gases. Static electricity generated from ash clouds rolling down the volcano sent out lightning bolts that were up to 2 miles (3?km) long.[13] Ninety-three separate outbursts were reported on March 30,[13] and increasingly strong harmonic tremors were first detected on April 1, alarming geologists and prompting Governor Dixy Lee Ray to declare a state of emergency on April 3.[14] Governor Ray issued an executive order on April 30 creating a \\"red zone\\" around the volcano; anyone caught in this zone without a pass faced a $500 fine or six months in jail.[15][16] This precluded many cabin owners from visiting their property.[17]\\r\\nBy April 7, the combined crater was 1,700 by 1,200 feet (520 by 370?m) and 500 feet (150?m) deep.[18] A USGS team determined in the last week of April that a 1.5-mile-diameter (2.4?km) section of St. Helens' north face was displaced outward by at least 270 feet (82?m).[12] For the rest of April and early May this bulge grew by 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8?m) per day, and by mid-May it extended more than 400 feet (120?m) north.[12] As the bulge moved northward, the summit area behind it progressively sank, forming a complex, down-dropped block called a graben. Geologists announced on April 30 that sliding of the bulge area was the greatest immediate danger and that such a landslide might spark an eruption.[16][19] These changes in the volcano's shape were related to the overall deformation that increased the volume of the volcano by 0.03 cubic miles (0.13?km3) by mid-May.[20] This volume increase presumably corresponded to the volume of magma that pushed into the volcano and deformed its surface. Because the intruded magma remained below ground and was not directly visible, it was called a cryptodome, in contrast to a true lava dome exposed at the surface.\\r\\nOn May 7, eruptions similar to those in March and April resumed, and over the next days the bulge approached its maximum size.[21] All activity had been confined to the 350-year-old summit dome and did not involve any new magma. A total of about 10,000 earthquakes were recorded prior to the May 18 event, with most concentrated in a small zone less than 1.6 miles (2.6?km) directly below the bulge.[20] Visible eruptions ceased on May 16, reducing public interest and consequently the number of spectators in the area.[22] Mounting public pressure then forced officials to allow 50 carloads of property owners to enter the danger zone on Saturday, May 17, to gather whatever property they could carry.[22][23] Another trip was scheduled for 10?a.m. the next day,[22][23] and because that was Sunday, more than 300 loggers were not working in the area. By the time of the climactic eruption, dacite magma intruding into the volcano had forced the north flank outward nearly 500 feet (150?m) and heated the volcano's groundwater system, causing many steam-driven explosions (phreatic eruptions).\\r\\nAs May 18 dawned, Mount St. Helens' activity did not show any change from the pattern of the preceding month. The rate of bulge movement, sulfur dioxide emission, and ground temperature readings did not reveal any changes indicating a catastrophic eruption. USGS volcanologist David A. Johnston was on duty at an observation post approximately 6 miles (10?km) north of the volcano: as of 6?a.m., Johnston's measurements did not indicate any unusual activity.[6]\\r\\nSuddenly, at 8:32?a.m., a magnitude?5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide,[24] approximately 7ÿ20?seconds (about 10?seconds seems most reasonable) after the shock.[6] The landslide, the largest in recorded history, travelled at 110 to 155 miles per hour (177 to 249?km/h) and moved across Spirit Lake's west arm. Part of it hit a 1,150-foot-high (350?m) ridge about 6 miles (10?km) north.[6] Some of the slide spilled over the ridge, but most of it moved 13 miles (21?km) down the North Fork Toutle River, filling its valley up to 600 feet (180?m) deep with avalanche debris.[24] An area of about 24 square miles (62?km2) was covered, and the total volume of the deposit was about 0.7 cubic miles (2.9?km3).[6]\\r\\nScientists were able to reconstruct the motion of the landslide from a series of rapid photographs by Gary Rosenquist, who was camping 11 miles (18?km) away from the blast.[6] Rosenquist, his party and his photographs survived because the blast was deflected by local topography 1 mile (1.6?km) short of his location.[25]\\r\\nMost of St. Helens' former north side became a rubble deposit 17 miles (27?km) long, averaging 150 feet (46?m) thick; the slide was thickest at 1 mile (1.6?km) below Spirit Lake and thinnest at its western margin.[6] The landslide temporarily displaced the waters of Spirit lake to the ridge north of the lake, in a giant wave approximately 600 feet (180?m) high.[26] This in turn created a 295 feet (90?m) avalanche of debris consisting of the returning waters and thousands of uprooted trees and stumps, some of which remained intact with roots but most of which had been sheared off at the stump seconds earlier by the blast of super-heated volcanic gas and ash that had immediately followed and overtook the initial landslide. The debris transported as the water returned to its basin raised the surface level of Spirit Lake by about 200 feet.[6] More than three decades after the eruption, floating log mats persist on Spirit Lake and nearby St. Helens Lake, changing position with the wind. The rest of the trees, especially those that were not completely detached from their roots, turned upright by their own weight and became waterlogged, sinking into the muddy sediments at the bottom where they have become petrified in the anaerobic and mineral-rich waters. This provides insight into other sites with a similar fossil record.[27]\\r\\nThe landslide exposed the dacite magma in St. Helens' neck to much lower pressure, causing the gas-charged, partially molten rock and high-pressure steam above it to explode a few seconds after the landslide started. Explosions burst through the trailing part of the landslide, blasting rock debris northward. The resulting blast laterally directed the pyroclastic flow of very hot volcanic gases, ash and pumice formed from new lava, while the pulverized old rock hugged the ground, initially moving at 220 miles per hour (350?km/h) but quickly accelerating to 670?mph (1,080?km/h), and it might have briefly passed the speed of sound.[6][24]\\r\\nPyroclastic flow material passed over the moving avalanche and spread outward, devastating a fan-shaped area 23 miles across by 19 miles long (37?km?G 31?km).[24] In total about 230 square miles (600?km2) of forest was knocked down,[24] and extreme heat killed trees miles beyond the blow-down zone. At its vent the lateral blast probably did not last longer than about 30?seconds, but the northward-radiating and expanding blast cloud continued for about another minute.\\r\\nSuperheated flow material flashed water in Spirit Lake and North Fork Toutle River to steam, creating a larger, secondary explosion that was heard as far away as British Columbia,[28] Montana, Idaho, and Northern California. Yet many areas closer to the eruption (Portland, Oregon, for example) did not hear the blast. This so-called \\"quiet zone\\" extended radially a few tens of miles from the volcano and was created by the complex response of the eruption's sound waves to differences in temperature and air motion of the atmospheric layers and, to a lesser extent, local topography.[6]\\r\\nLater studies indicated that one-third of the 0.045 cubic miles (0.19?km3) of material in the flow was new lava, and the rest was fragmented, older rock.[28]\\r\\nThe huge ensuing ash cloud sent skyward from St. Helens' northern foot was visible throughout the quiet zone. The near-supersonic lateral blast, loaded with volcanic debris, caused devastation as far as 19 miles (31?km) from the volcano. The area affected by the blast can be subdivided into three roughly concentric zones:[6]\\r\\nBy the time this pyroclastic flow hit its first human victims, it was still as hot as 360?C (680?F) and filled with suffocating gas and flying debris.[28] Most of the 57 people known to have died in that day's eruption succumbed to asphyxiation while several died from burns.[6] Lodge owner Harry R. Truman was buried under hundreds of feet of avalanche material. Volcanologist David A. Johnston was one of those killed, as was Reid Blackburn, a National Geographic photographer. Robert Landsburg, another photographer, was killed by the ash cloud. He was able to protect his film with his body, and the surviving photos provided geologists with valuable documentation of the historic eruption.[29]\\r\\nSubsequent outpourings of pyroclastic material from the breach left by the landslide consisted mainly of new magmatic debris rather than fragments of preexisting volcanic rocks. The resulting deposits formed a fan-like pattern of overlapping sheets, tongues and lobes. At least 17 separate pyroclastic flows occurred during the May 18 eruption, and their aggregate volume was about 0.05 cubic miles (210,000,000?m3).[6]\\r\\nThe flow deposits were still at about 300 to 420?C (572 to 788?F) two weeks after they erupted.[6] Secondary steam-blast eruptions fed by this heat created pits on the northern margin of the pyroclastic-flow deposits, at the south shore of Spirit Lake, and along the upper part of the North Fork Toutle River. These steam-blast explosions continued sporadically for weeks or months after the emplacement of pyroclastic flows, and at least one occurred a year later, on May 16, 1981.[6]\\r\\nAs the avalanche and initial pyroclastic flow were still advancing, a huge ash column grew to a height of 12 miles (19?km) above the expanding crater in less than 10?minutes and spread tephra into the stratosphere for 10 straight hours.[28] Near the volcano, the swirling ash particles in the atmosphere generated lightning, which in turn started many forest fires. During this time, parts of the mushroom-shaped ash-cloud column collapsed, and fell back upon the earth. This fallout, mixed with magma, mud and steam, sent additional pyroclastic flows speeding down St. Helens' flanks. Later, slower flows came directly from the new north-facing crater and consisted of glowing pumice bombs and very hot pumiceous ash. Some of these hot flows covered ice or water which flashed to steam, creating craters up to 65 feet (20?m) in diameter and sending ash as much as 6,500 feet (2,000?m) into the air.[30]\\r\\nStrong high-altitude wind carried much of this material east-northeasterly from the volcano at an average speed of about 60 miles per hour (97?km/h). By 9:45?a.m. it had reached Yakima, Washington, 90 miles (140?km) away, and by 11:45?a.m. it was over Spokane, Washington.[6] A total of 4 to 5 inches (100 to 130?mm) of ash fell on Yakima, and areas as far east as Spokane were plunged into darkness by noon where visibility was reduced to 10 feet (3.0?m) and 0.5 inches (13?mm) of ash fell.[28] Continuing eastward, St. Helens' ash fell in the western part of Yellowstone National Park by 10:15?p.m. and was seen on the ground in Denver, Colorado, the next day.[28] In time, ash fall from this eruption was reported as far away as Minnesota and Oklahoma, and some of the ash drifted around the globe within about 2?weeks.\\r\\nDuring the nine hours of vigorous eruptive activity, about 540,000,000 tons of ash fell over an area of more than 22,000 square miles (57,000?km2).[6] The total volume of the ash before its compaction by rainfall was about 0.3 cubic miles (1.3?km3).[6] The volume of the uncompacted ash is equivalent to about 0.05 cubic miles (210,000,000?m3) of solid rock, or about 7% of the amount of material that slid off in the debris avalanche.[6] By around 5:30?p.m. on May 18, the vertical ash column declined in stature, but less severe outbursts continued through the next several days.[31]\\r\\nGenerally, given that the way airborne ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of the ash type will occur, as a function of distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception, and hence the ash properties have large variations.[32]\\r\\nThe bulk chemical composition of the ash has been found to be approximately 65% silicon dioxide, 18% aluminium oxide, 5% ferric oxide, 4% each calcium oxide and sodium oxide and 2% magnesium oxide. Trace chemicals were also detected, their concentrations varying as shown: 0.05ÿ0.09% chlorine, 0.02ÿ0.03% fluorine, and 0.09ÿ0.3% sulfur.[32]\\r\\nThe index of refraction, a number used in physics to describe how light propagates through a particular substance, is an important property of volcanic ash. This number is complex having both real and imaginary parts, the real part indicating how light disperses and the imaginary part indicating how light is absorbed by the substance.\\r\\nIt is known that the silicate particles have a real index of refraction ranging between 1.5 and 1.6 for visible light. However, there is a spectrum of colors associated with samples of volcanic ash, from very light to dark gray. This makes for variations in the measured imaginary refractive index under visible light.[33]\\r\\nIn the case of Mount St. Helens, the ash settled in three main layers on the ground:[32]\\r\\nFor example, when comparing the imaginary part of the refractive index k of stratospheric ash from 15?km and 18?km from the volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values around 700?nm (around 0.009), while they differ significantly around 300?nm. Here, the 18?km (k was found to be around 0.009) sample was much more absorbent than the 15?km sample (k was found to be around 0.002).[33]\\r\\nThe hot, exploding material also broke apart and melted nearly all of the mountain's glaciers along with most of the overlying snow. As in many previous St. Helens' eruptions, this created huge lahars (volcanic mudflows) and muddy floods that affected three of the four stream drainage systems on the mountain,[30] and which started to move as early as 8:50?a.m.[26] Lahars travelled as fast as 90 miles per hour (140?km/h) while still high on the volcano but progressively slowed to about 3 miles per hour (4.8?km/h) on the flatter and wider parts of rivers.[6] Mudflows from the southern and eastern flanks had the consistency of wet concrete as they raced down Muddy River, Pine Creek and Smith Creek to their confluence at the Lewis River. Bridges were taken out at the mouth of Pine Creek and the head of Swift Reservoir, which rose 2.6 feet (0.79?m)[30] by noon to accommodate the nearly 18,000,000 cubic yards (14,000,000?m3) of additional water, mud and debris.[6]\\r\\nGlacier and snow melt mixed with tephra on the volcano's northeast slope to create much larger lahars. These mudflows traveled down the north and south forks of the Toutle River and joined at the confluence of the Toutle forks and the Cowlitz River near Castle Rock, Washington, at 1:00?p.m. Ninety minutes after the eruption, the first mudflow had moved 27 miles (43?km) upstream where observers at Weyerhaeuser's Camp Baker saw a 12-foot-high (4?m) wall of muddy water and debris pass.[26] Near the confluence of the Toutle's north and south forks at Silver Lake, a record flood stage of 23.5 feet (7.2?m) was recorded.[26]\\r\\nA large but slower-moving mudflow with a mortar-like consistency was mobilized in early afternoon at the head of the Toutle River north fork. By 2:30?p.m. the massive mudflow had destroyed Camp Baker,[26] and in the following hours seven bridges were carried away. Part of the flow backed up for 2.5 miles (4.0?km) soon after entering the Cowlitz River, but most continued downstream. After traveling 17 miles (27?km) further, an estimated 3,900,000 cubic yards (3,000,000?m3) of material were injected into the Columbia River, reducing the river's depth by 25 feet (8?m) for a 4-mile (6?km) stretch.[26] The resulting 13-foot (4.0?m) river depth temporarily closed the busy channel to ocean-going freighters, costing Portland, Oregon an estimated five million US dollars.[31] Ultimately more than 65?million cubic yards (50?million cubic metres) of sediment were dumped along the lower Cowlitz and Columbia Rivers.[6]\\r\\nThe May 18, 1980, event was the most deadly and economically destructive volcanic eruption in the history of the contiguous United States.[6] Approximately fifty-seven people were killed directly from the blast and 200 houses, 47 bridges, 15 miles (24?km) of railways and 185 miles (298?km) of highway were destroyed; two people were killed indirectly in accidents that resulted from poor visibility, and two more suffered fatal heart attacks from shoveling ash.[34] U.S. President Jimmy Carter surveyed the damage and said it looked more desolate than a moonscape.[35][36] A film crew was dropped by helicopter on Mount St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction. However, their compasses spun in circles and they quickly became lost.[37] A second eruption occurred the next day (see below), but the crew survived and were rescued two days after that. The eruption ejected more than 1 cubic mile (4.2?km3) of material.[38] A quarter of that volume was fresh lava in the form of ash, pumice and volcanic bombs while the rest was fragmented, older rock.[38] The removal of the north side of the mountain (13% of the cone's volume) reduced Mount St. Helens' height by about 1,280 feet (390?m) and left a crater 1 to 2 miles (2 to 3?km) wide and 2,100 feet (640?m) deep with its north end open in a huge breach.[38]\\r\\nMore than 4,000,000,000 board feet (9,400,000?m3) of timber was damaged or destroyed, mainly by the lateral blast.[6] At least 25% of the destroyed timber was salvaged after September 1980. Downwind of the volcano, in areas of thick ash accumulation, many agricultural crops, such as wheat, apples, potatoes and alfalfa, were destroyed. As many as 1,500 elk and 5,000 deer were killed, and an estimated 12 million[6] Chinook and Coho salmon fingerlings died when their hatcheries were destroyed. Another estimated 40,000 young salmon were lost when they swam through turbine blades of hydroelectric generators after reservoir levels were lowered along the Lewis River to accommodate possible mudflows and flood waters.[6]\\r\\nIn total Mount St. Helens released 24 megatons of thermal energy, 7 of which were a direct result of the blast. This is equivalent to 1,600 times the size of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.[39]\\r\\nThere is a minor controversy in regard to the exact death toll. The figure most commonly cited is fifty-seven. However, there are two points of dispute.\\r\\nThe first point regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were reported missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, investigators were able to locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, they were unable to determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.[40][41]\\r\\nThe second point regards three missing people who are not officially listed as victims: Robert Ruffle, Steven Whitsett and Mark Melanson. Cowlitz County Emergency Services Management lists them as \\"Possibly Missing  Not on [the official] List\\". According to Melanson's brother, in October 1983, Cowlitz County officials told his family that Melanson \\"is believed [...] a victim of the May 18, 1980, eruption\\" and that after years of searching, the family eventually decided \\"he's buried in the ash\\".[41]\\r\\nTaking these two points of dispute into consideration, the direct death toll could be as low as fifty-five or as high as sixty. When combined with the four indirect victims mentioned earlier, those numbers range from fifty-nine to sixty-four.\\r\\nThe ash fall created some temporary major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane was closed for a week and a half.[6] Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures.[6] Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.\\r\\nRemoving and disposing of the ash was a monumental task for some Eastern Washington communities. State and federal agencies estimated that over 2,400,000 cubic yards (1,800,000?m3) of ash, equivalent to about 900,000 tons in weight, were removed from highways and airports in Washington.[6] The ash removal cost $2.2 million and took 10 weeks in Yakima.[6] The need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated the selection of some disposal sites. Some cities used old quarries and existing sanitary landfills; others created dump sites wherever expedient. To minimize wind reworking of ash dumps, the surfaces of some disposal sites were covered with topsoil and seeded with grass. In Portland, the mayor eventually threatened businesses with fines if they failed to remove the ash from their parking lots.[42]\\r\\nA refined estimate of $1.1?billion ($2.74 billion in 2007 dollars[43]) was determined in a study by the International Trade Commission at the request of the United States Congress.[6] A supplemental appropriation of $951?million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the Small Business Administration, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.[6]\\r\\nThere were also indirect and intangible costs of the eruption. Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, and then returned to near-normal levels once timber-salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption.[6] Several months after May 18, a few residents reported suffering stress and emotional problems, even though they had coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental health programs to assist such people.[6]\\r\\nInitial public reaction to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. HelensÿGifford Pinchot National Forest area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The United States Forest Service and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.[6]\\r\\nSt. Helens produced an additional five explosive eruptions between May and October 1980. Through early 1990 at least 21 periods of eruptive activity had occurred. The volcano remains active, with smaller, dome-building eruptions continuing into 2008.\\r\\nAn eruption occurred on May 25, 1980, at 2:30?a.m. that sent an ash column 9 miles (14?km) into the atmosphere.[38] The eruption was preceded by a sudden increase in earthquake activity and occurred during a rainstorm. Erratic wind from the storm carried ash from the eruption to the south and west, lightly dusting large parts of western Washington and Oregon. Pyroclastic flows exited the northern breach and covered avalanche debris, lahars and other pyroclastic flows deposited by the May 18 eruption.[38]\\r\\nAt 7:05?p.m. on June 12, a plume of ash billowed 2.5 miles (4.0?km) above the volcano. At 9:09?p.m. a much stronger explosion sent an ash column about 10 miles (16?km) skyward.[44] This event caused the Portland area, previously spared by wind direction, to be thinly coated with ash in the middle of the annual Rose Festival.[45] A dacite dome then oozed into existence on the crater floor, growing to a height of 200 feet (61?m) and a width of 1,200 feet (370?m) within a week.[44]\\r\\nA series of large explosions on July 22 broke more than a month of relative quiet. The July eruptive episode was preceded by several days of measurable expansion of the summit area, heightened earthquake activity, and changed emission rates of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. The first hit at 5:14?p.m. as an ash column shot 10 miles (16?km) and was followed by a faster blast at 6:25?p.m. that pushed the ash column above its previous maximum height in just 7.5?minutes.[44] The final explosion started at 7:01?p.m. and continued for over two hours.[44] When the relatively small amount of ash settled over eastern Washington, the dome built in June was gone.[46]\\r\\nSeismic activity and gas emission steadily increased in early August, and on August 7 at 4:26?p.m., an ash cloud slowly expanded 8 miles (13?km) into the sky.[46] Small pyroclastic flows came through the northern breach and a weaker outpouring of ash rose from the crater. This continued until 10:32?p.m. when a second large blast sent ash high into the air, proceeding due north.[46] A second dacite dome filled this vent a few days later.\\r\\nTwo months of repose were ended by an eruption lasting from October 16 to 18. This event obliterated the second dome, sent ash 10 miles (16?km) in the air and created small, red-hot pyroclastic flows.[46] A third dome began to form within 30?minutes after the final explosion on October 18, and within a few days, it was about 900 feet (270?m) wide and 130 feet (40?m) high. In spite of the dome growth next to it, a new glacier formed rapidly inside the crater.\\r\\nAll of the post-1980 eruptions were quiet dome-building events, beginning with the December 27, 1980, to January 3, 1981, episode. By 1987 the third dome had grown to be more than 3,000 feet (910?m) wide and 800 feet (240?m) high.[46]\\r\\nFurther eruptions occurred over a few months between 1989 and 1991.\\r\\nThe 2004ÿ08 volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens has been documented as a continuous eruption with a gradual extrusion of magma at the Mount St. Helens volcano. Starting in October 2004, there was a gradual building of a new lava dome. The new dome did not rise above the caldera created by the 1980 eruption. This activity lasted until January 2008.\\r\\nMay 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens\\r\\n?This article incorporates public domain material?from the?United States Geological Survey document:?\\"Eruptions of Mount St. Helens: Past, Present, and Future\\".

For these reasons, it is the Majority Leader who, in practice, manages the Senate. This is in contrast to the House of Representatives where the elected Speaker of the House has a great deal of discretionary power and generally presides over votes on bills.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Democratic Party first selected a leader in 1920.

He played college football at LSU.\\r\\nAt 5'5\\", Holliday is one of the shortest players in NFL history.[1] He has also played for the Denver Broncos, New York Giants, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, San Francisco 49ers, and Oakland Raiders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHolliday was a two-way star at Northeast High. Because of his short stature, Holliday did not start on the football team until his junior year. In his first season starting, he rushed for 1,870 yards and scored 26 touchdowns. In his senior year, Holliday put up even better statistics by rushing for 2,210 yards, scoring 34 touchdowns, and averaging 27.6 yards per punt return.[2]\\r\\nHolliday was also a track runner in high school. In 2005, Holliday posted the nations fastest indoor time in the 55 and 60-meter dashes. He led his team into the 2A state title by winning the 100 meters and 200 meters and was second in the long jump.[3] Holliday was a four-time state champion in the 200 meters and a three-time 100 meters champion.\\r\\nHolliday was a top-ranked American sprinter competing for the LSU Tigers track and field team and is regarded as one of the fastest players in football.[2] He demonstrated his sprinting ability in the 100-meter dash at the 2007 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, where he recorded 10.07?seconds in the final ÿ ahead of Walter Dix and second only to Tyson Gay.[4] This qualified him for the 2007 World Championships in Athletics but he opted to not compete, preferring to begin the football season with the LSU Tigers.[5] He continued to race, however, and reached the semi-finals in the 100?m at the 2008 United States Olympic Trials the following year.[6]\\r\\nIn his first year at LSU in 2007, he broke Xavier Carter's school record and became the Southeastern Conference 100?m champion. At the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championship later that year he set a personal record in the semifinals and finished runner-up in the final to Walter Dix. The following year, he took third in the 100?m NCAA final and anchored the 4G100-meter relay team to victory in 38.42?seconds ÿ the fastest collegiate time that year.[5][7]\\r\\nTrack and Field News has Holliday recorded at 6.19 over 55 meters indoors in 2005, leading the nation.[8]\\r\\nLeading up to the 2010 NFL Scouting Combine, Trindon Holliday had hoped to break Chris Johnson's record mark of 4.24 in the 40-yard dash.[10] Holliday had self-reported running times as fast as 4.21,[10] which seemed plausible given his extensive track background, and the fastest 100?m dash time of any football player in NCAA history.[2][11] At the combine, reports of Holliday's 40-yard dash time ranged from between 4.18 seconds and 4.34 seconds. Adam Schefter, an ESPN reporter on hand at the event, had reported on Twitter that NFL scouts had clocked Holliday in as low as 4.21 during the workout.[12] However, the NFL Network broadcast team record Holliday's two tries at unofficial times of 4.27 and 4.32,[13] respectively, and ultimately published it as 4.34 seconds officially.[14]\\r\\nHolliday was drafted by the Houston Texans in the 6th round of the 2010 draft. Despite his speed, Holliday struggled on kickoff returns in the preseason. He was placed on IR because of a fracture in his thumb. On September 3, 2011, he was cut and then placed on the practice squad. On October 5, his practice squad contract was terminated and he was later added to the active roster, but was waived on October 25. He was later resigned and in Week 1 of the 2012 preseason versus the Carolina Panthers, he returned a kickoff return for a touchdown. The next week versus the San Francisco 49ers, he returned a punt for a touchdown. In the final preseason game versus the Minnesota Vikings, Holliday recorded his third touchdown in four games; this touchdown was a 76-yard punt return. Following the 2012 preseason, Holliday made the Houston Texans 53-man roster and was the starting punt and kick returner. Holliday was waived from the Texans on October 10, 2012, in a move to bolster an injury-depleted defense. Part of the reason Holliday was released was due to his fumbling problems. Trindon fumbled the ball 6 times in 2012, however losing only one of them.[15]\\r\\nOn October 11, 2012, Holliday was claimed off of waivers by the Denver Broncos.[16] On October 15, in his first game as a Bronco, Holliday fumbled and lost the ball on a punt return in the first quarter of the game. He returned a kickoff 105 yards for a touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals on November 4, 2012, breaking the Broncos record for the longest play. On November 11, 2012, he returned a Carolina Panthers punt for 76 yards. The play was ruled a touchdown despite his fumbling of the ball on the 1 yard line.[17] In 2012, Holliday's teams went undefeated during the regular season. He started the season with the Texans who were 5-0 when they cut him. He was then acquired by the Broncos who finished the regular season 13-3 with an 11-game win streak.[18]\\r\\nOn January 12, 2013, Holliday returned a punt in the first quarter of the game versus the Baltimore Ravens for a 90-yard touchdown, the longest punt return in postseason history.[19] During the third quarter of that game, he returned a kickoff for a 104-yard touchdown. He became the first player in NFL history with a punt return touchdown and a kick return touchdown in the same postseason game. He had 256 total punt and kick return yards but the Broncos lost, 38-35 in double overtime.[20]\\r\\nIn the 2013 season, Holliday returned a punt 81 yards for a touchdown in week 2 against the New York Giants. He also returned a kick-off 105 yards for a touchdown in week 4 against the Philadelphia Eagles.\\r\\nAs of 2017[update]'s NFL off-season, Trindon Holliday held at least 11 Broncos franchise records, including:\\r\\nOn March 17, 2014, Holliday signed a one-year contract with the New York Giants.[21][22] He was released on October 6, 2014.[23]\\r\\nHolliday signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on October 21, 2014.

His mother held him out of football until 7th grade, because she was afraid he would be injured. After several years of performing at a high level, his high school coaches finally let him start as a running back during his junior year. In his senior year he accumulated over 2,000 yards and over 30 touchdowns, leading Northeast High to back-to-back State Semi-Final appearances.\\r\\nFearing that college recruiters would not believe Holliday's actual running times, his high school coaches added to his recorded times before sending them in.[citation needed] Despite his speed records, several schools, including Duke and Louisiana-Lafayette, rejected Holliday due to his small size.\\r\\nHolliday was never scheduled to appear at LSU's camp. So David Masterson, Holliday's high school coach, took Holliday along also. After initial workouts, Holliday ran the 40 in 4.28 seconds wearing high top basketball shoes. The time was so outrageous that the LSU coaches began arguing if they had started their stopwatches on time. \\"They asked me if Trindon could run it again,\\" Masterson said. \\"He didn't even get in a track stance. He ran the second 40 in 4.27. He's one of those little freaks of nature.\\" Despite this, LSU coach Les Miles still considered canceling Holliday's scholarship offer until holdover offensive coordinator Jimbo Fisher convinced Miles that Holliday could play at a college level.[28]","input":"What is the shortest player in the nfl?"},{"output":"two prefix letters, six digits, and one suffix letter","context":"\\r\\nThe National Insurance number is a number used in the United Kingdom in the administration of the National Insurance or social security system.

The last two digits determine the day of the week on which various social security benefits are payable and when unemployed claimants need to attend their Jobcentre to sign on (renew their claims): 00 to 19 for Monday, 20 to 39 for Tuesday, 40 to 59 for Wednesday, 60 to 79 for Thursday and 80 to 99 for Friday.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe suffix letter is either A, B, C, or D.[7] (although F, M, and P have been used for temporary numbers in the past). The NI number is unique without the suffix letter, so, for example, if AB 12 34 56 C exists, then there will be no other numbers beginning with AB 12 34 56 (although temporary numbers were not necessarily unique, because two people with the same date of birth would have had the same number). In official electronic submissions, the final letter may be represented by a space if not known.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 1975, the suffixes A, B, C and D at the end of the NI number signified the period of validity of the National Insurance cards originally used to collect National Insurance contributions (NICs). Cards were exchanged every twelve months and because of the very large numbers of cards issued the exchange was staggered. Suffix A cards ran from March of one year until March of the next when they were exchanged for a new one. Stagger B suffix cards ran from June until the following June, stagger C from September until the following September and stagger D from December until the following December. For example, a B stagger card issued in 1955 might have run from the first Monday in June that year until the first Sunday in June the following year. This staggered system operated from 5 July 1948 until 1975, at which time the A stagger cards were extended to run an extra five weeks, until 5 April 1975, in line with the end of the tax year. The B, C and D stagger NI Cards had a shorter period of validity in their final year, and ran from June, September and December respectively in 1974 until 6 April 1975. From 6 April 1975 onwards, a computerised National Insurance Recording System (NIRS) was used to allocate all NICs by tax years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Great Britain, expired NI cards were sorted into one hundred separate groups corresponding to the final two numbers of the NI number and were posted to the individual insured person's NI account (the RF1) by the corresponding one hundred ledger sections at the Records Branch of the Central Office of the Ministry of Labour and its successorsthe Ministry of National Insurance (from 1945), Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance (1953), the Department of Health and Social Security (1968), Department of Social Security (1988), and Department for Work and Pensions (since 2001). These 100 sections dealt not only with the recording of NI contributions but with requests for information about qualifying contributions necessary to pay sickness, unemployment, widows, and other benefits and also with any correspondence arising from those NI accounts and NI cards. Within each of the 100 sections, NI numbers were allocated among 16 splits with one clerk administering each split. To trace unknown NI numbers, a general index contained millions of small RF2 index slips, filed in order of surname and listing the name(s), date of birth, and NI number for every person within the National Insurance scheme.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Northern Ireland National Insurance scheme is funded and administered separately from the scheme in Great Britain but operates identically so that, in practice, the same rules apply throughout the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil April 2001, employers sometimes allocated their employees a temporary insurance number, which followed the format \\"TN dd mm yy x\\", where 'TN' stands for temporary number and is static and x is M for male, F for female, or P for pensioner and the numbers in the midsection were the employee's date of birth.[8] In the case of a woman born on 31 December 1958, for example, the temporary NI number would have been TN 31 12 58 F. Temporary NI numbers could not be used to trace back any NI credits or personal details. Since 2001 the National Insurance number must be obtained ÿ the temporary code must not now be used.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother type of temporary NI number is the Revenue-issued \\"temporary reference\\" used when HMRC is unable to trace a taxpayer's original NI number. It follows the format 63T12345.\\r\\n\\r\\nReference numbers similar in format to NI numbers are sometimes allocated for tax or benefit purposes with special prefix letters.  Special prefixes used in the past include the letters OO (for Tax Credit claims), CR (for investigations), FY (formerly for Attendance Allowance claims, named after the Fylde social security office where claims were processed), MW (used from 1980 to 1987 for migrant workers), NC (formerly for Stakeholder Pensions, PP (for use by pension schemes as PP999999P), and PY or PZ (both used for tax-only accounts created prior to 2003).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1984 until 2011, when a person was allocated an NI number they also received a plastic 'numbercard' of similar proportions to a credit card with the number raised on the front. Prior to 1984, a manila notification card was issued instead.  The card is only used as a reminder of the number and the card itself is not needed to start work, and is not considered a valid identity card.  Numbercards were phased out from September 2010, and the issue of numbercards ceased completely in October 2011.  NI numbers are now notified by letter.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Insurance numbers issued in the Isle of Man hold the prefix MA.[16] Similarly, those issued in Jersey start with JY, and those issued in Guernsey hold the prefix GY. Only Channel Island NINOs issued prior to 1975 are validated, and recognised for UK use by HMRC.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Insurance number is used as a reference number in the Pay As You Earn system, and also by the self-employed.  It is also used in applications for Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), to check that an individual has opened only one ISA in a tax year.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the NI number is not used universally as a tax identification number.  Taxpayers who need to file a tax return are given a different number, a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR), which is used as a reference number in the self-assessment tax system.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nNI numbers are sometimes used for identification purposes in other contexts which have nothing to do with their original National Insurance purpose ÿ such as forming part of evidence of right to work in the UK.[19] The NI card, however, is not proof of identity.","input":"How many digits is a uk national insurance number?"},{"output":"25 July 1978","context":"Louise Joy Brown (born 25 July 1978) is an English woman known for being the first human to have been born after conception by in vitro fertilisation, or IVF.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLouise Joy Brown was born at Oldham General Hospital, Oldham, by planned Caesarean section delivered by registrar John Webster.[1] She weighed 5 pounds, 12 ounces (2.608?kg) at birth.[2] Her parents, Lesley and John Brown, had been trying to conceive for nine years. Lesley faced complications of blocked fallopian tubes.[2]\\r\\nOn 10 November 1977, Lesley Brown underwent a procedure, later to become known as IVF (in vitro fertilisation), developed by Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards. Edwards was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Medicine for this work.[3] Although the media referred to Brown as a \\"test tube baby\\",[4] her conception actually took place in a Petri dish. Her younger sister, Natalie Brown, was also conceived through IVF four years later, and became the world's fortieth child after conception by IVF. In May 1999, Natalie was the first human born after conception by IVF to give birth herselfwithout IVFto daughter Casey.[2] Natalie has subsequently had three additional children; sons Christopher, Daniel, and Aeron, the last of whom was born in August 2013.\\r\\nIn 2004, Brown married nightclub doorman (bouncer) Wesley Mullinder.

They are respectively voiced by Mr. Lawrence and Jill Talley. Their first appearance was in the episode \\"Plankton!\\" that premiered on July 31, 1999. They were created and designed by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg, the creator of the program, with additional character development by Lawrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlankton is an intellectual planktonic copepod who runs the unsuccessful Chum Bucket restaurant alongside Karen, who is a talking supercomputer. Plankton is the arch-rival of Mr. Krabs, who owns the far more profitable Krusty Krab restaurant and sells a fictional burger called the Krabby Patty. Plankton and Karen often devise schemes to steal the secret Krabby Patty recipe, but their efforts are always thwarted by Krabs and his employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nCritical reception for Plankton and Karen has been positive, with praise directed toward their voices and dialogue together. They began as minor characters, but Lawrence developed their personalities throughout the show's early seasons and they eventually became the franchise's main antagonists. The Planktons play central roles in the 2004 theatrical film, which promoted them both to main cast members in its credits, and the 2015 sequel. They have also been featured in a variety of spin-off media, including tie-in publications, playsets and other merchandise.\\r\\n\\r\\n Mr. Lawrence on the character of Plankton[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlankton is the nemesis and the former best friend of Mr. Krabs.[3] He operates the Chum Bucket, located directly across the street from Krabs' restaurant, the Krusty Krab.[4] The Chum Bucket primarily sells chum (bait consisting of fish parts), which is considered mostly inedible by the other characters. As a result, his restaurant is a commercial failure. Plankton's primary goal in the series is to put Krabs out of business and secure a monopoly on the fast food industry. His villainous efforts to do this are widely known within the show; fellow character Squidward Tentacles refers to Plankton as \\"the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA running gag throughout the series is the fact that Plankton is smaller than the other regular characters; he is easily stepped on and sent flying back to the Chum Bucket with a mere flick of the finger.[6] His small size has led him to develop a Napoleon complex, which is occasionally manifested as a desire for global domination.[7] He is a skillful inventor and regularly builds machines, both to help him in his plots, and for his own personal gain. Although he uses his intellect for evil, Plankton did not start out as a villainous scientist; he built Karen, his first invention, when he was friends with Mr. Krabs in grade school.[3] Prominent in his earliest appearances, Plankton's catchphrase is \\"I went to college!\\", uttered to illustrate the character's intelligence.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlankton's roles are not exclusively antagonistic. In The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, Plankton discards his enmity for SpongeBob and works with him towards a common goal. The movie has been described by The Guardian as a \\"buddy film\\" between Plankton and SpongeBob.[9] Series creator Stephen Hillenburg considers Plankton \\"more of a caricature of a villain\\" than a truly evil character.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen SpongeBob SquarePants premiered, Plankton was not part of the series' main cast. Plankton's voice actor, Mr. Lawrence, has stated that after producing Plankton's debut episode in the late 1990s, creator Stephen Hillenburg was unsure if he would continue to use the character. After recording it, Hillenburg was noncommittal, telling Lawrence: \\"We'll probably do another [Plankton episode] next year,\\" [11] Lawrence summarized Plankton's origins in 2015, saying that he \\"was only supposed to be in one or two episodes, but I was a writer on the show and I really liked this character\\".[12] Following his first voice recording as Plankton, Lawrence drafted some of his own ideas for the character and passed them to Hillenburg. From then on, Plankton began to appear more often. Lawrence considers the third season the first in which Plankton is a main character.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring production on SpongeBob's early seasons, Lawrence was the only staff member writing premises and outlines involving Plankton. At the time, he felt he \\"had to prove Plankton could survive as more than a one-note character\\".[2] Since then, multiple writers have written for Plankton without Lawrence's involvement, including the teams of writers responsible for Plankton's starring roles in both SpongeBob films. Lawrence continues to write Plankton episodes, having said in 2015, \\"I'm not just his voice. I get to create how the character is written and how he evolves over time.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreliminary design sketches for Plankton depict him in a robotic suit, with Karen's system built into it; that suit does not appear in the series.[13] The suit functioned as a way to increase Plankton's presence, as one of Hillenburg's original intentions was for the character to be too small to see without a magnifying glass.[14] As the series progressed, the animators enlarged Plankton's size, feeling that being microscopic was \\"not conducive to him interacting with other characters\\".[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlankton's voice is provided by American actor Doug Lawrence, normally credited as \\"Mr. Lawrence.\\" The voice originated as an imitation of one of his deep-voiced high school friends.[12] On television, Lawrence first used this voice for incidental characters on Rocko's Modern Life. Fellow voice actor Tom Kenny found it amusing, leading to Lawrence's decision to use it when auditioning for roles on SpongeBob.[2] Lawrence initially tried out for the role of SpongeBob during the series' pre-production, but Stephen Hillenburg wanted a more innocent voice for the character and turned him down.[12] Lawrence continued to work on the show, voicing minor characters, eventually leading to him being offered the role of Plankton for the \\"Plankton!\\" episode.[12] He describes Plankton's voice as a \\"combination of Gregory Peck and Tony the Tiger.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the \\"Plankton!\\" episode was pitched to Nickelodeon, Hillenburg had already decided that he wanted Lawrence to play Plankton. However, network executives wanted a guest star to provide his voice since he was set to appear in only one episode.[15] Lawrence mentioned in an interview with fellow SpongeBob actor Thomas F. Wilson that the studio said, in his words, \\"'we could stunt-cast this. You know, we could have Bruce Willis do this voice.' And Steve [Hillenburg] was just like, 'it's Doug, don't you hear it? This is the character! This is the guy!'\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plankton character has garnered a generally positive reception over the run of SpongeBob SquarePants. In his review of the fourth season, Paul Mavis of DVD Talk stated that adult viewers would likely find Plankton more amusing than others, praising his \\"hilariously stentorian\\" voice.[16] In his review of the season six episode \\"Clash of Triton,\\" Mavis called Plankton \\"the only secondary SpongeBob character who can [successfully] anchor his own short\\".[17] Bettijane Levine of The Los Angeles Times wrote positively of Plankton's portrayal calling it poignant rather than genuinely immoral, describing him as a \\"town meanie?... but mean is different than evil. There is no evil, not even a sense of menace, in SpongeBob's soggy, safe world.\\"[18] Ann Hagman Cardinal of Blogcritics praised the character, rhetorically asking in a 2007 review, \\"who isn't tickled by the tight-jawed, Kirk Douglas-voiced Plankton with his silent moviesque evil plans to steal the secret recipe for the Krabby Patty?\\"[19] Boston.com writer Jamie Loftus had mixed feelings about Plankton in a 2015 article, asserting that while \\"almost every episode featuring tiny supervillain Plankton is highly formulaic,\\" he never \\"gets old\\".[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Poniewozik of Time magazine commented on Plankton in a 2001 article. He noted that \\"no one thinks it's strange that the town villain, the megalomaniacal Plankton, is a one-celled organism\\" as part of the \\"colorful, goofy\\" atmosphere of the program.[21] In an article for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen stated that \\"the humor of Plankton comes from how his operative ambitions are constantly thwarted by a na?ve, trusting kid\\".[22] In 2015, Entertainment Weekly's Hillary Busis named Plankton one of the most devious characters on television, adding in her commentary that he is \\"voiced to wicked perfection by Doug Lawrence\\".[23] Jos Antonio G܇mez Marn[es] of El Mundo favorably compared Plankton's plans to the stories of Georges Simenon in a 2013 article.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his 2011 book SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy, political scientist Joseph J. Foy argues that \\"Plankton may actually be the unsung hero of the series, and SpongeBob the true villain.\\" He compares the character to the Nietzschean bermensch, taking note of his mental superiority compared to the other characters in the show, and questions how Plankton is only \\"judged as bad because, no matter how many great things he accomplishes, his intentions are deemed ignoble\\". Foy concludes his analysis by criticizing the fact that \\"SpongeBob is praised as noble for trying to hold Plankton back.\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nSheldon Plankton is married to a supercomputer named Karen Plankton, who is also his sidekick and best friend.[26] Karen is Plankton's own invention, assembled from a calculator and a mass of wires.[4] She was Plankton's first invention when he was in grade school, and they dated before he became evil.[3] Her system is built into most of Plankton's machines (including the Chum Bucket itself) so that she and Plankton can communicate while the latter is on a mission. She is a Mark II Surplus UNIVAC with 256 gigabytes of random-access memory.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nKaren assumes various jobs at the Chum Bucket, including busser, chef and cashier; she rarely has to fulfill them because of the restaurant's unpopularity. She also tends to stay more focused than Plankton on the core mission of stealing Krabs' formula. Karen often reminds him to stay on task[5] and encourages him to keep going when he loses confidence.[6] Since she lacks a heart, Karen is usually unable to feel empathy for the people around her.[3] Her interactions are not limited to helping Plankton, however; she is a friend of Sandy Cheeks, who is also intelligent and interested in science.[28] Karen has a habit of addressing SpongeBob as \\"the SpongeBob.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nKaren is more competent than Plankton in formulating plots to steal the Krabby Patty recipe. Most of his effective plans have come from Karen, including \\"Plan Z\\"the only scheme to result in Plankton successfully stealing the formula and using it to his advantagein The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. Nonetheless, he tends to take credit for them, much to her dismay. Karen has effortlessly stolen Krabs' formula without Plankton's help on many occasions, but her husband always inadvertently gets in the way.[27] Because of their contrasting behaviors, Plankton and Karen have a tendency to argue. Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, has called their marriage \\"Honeymooners-like,\\" comparing them to the bickering couple from the sitcom The Honeymooners.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a computer on the ocean floor, Karen's ability to operate underwater has not been explained in any of the series' episodes. Tom Kenny addressed this in a 2004 interview with the Associated Press, stating that Karen's functionality is a \\"don't-ask-why\\" aspect of SpongeBob and that \\"logic doesn't have a place\\" in the series' universe.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nKaren was also created by Stephen Hillenburg, who named the character after his wife. Hillenburg initially designed a laboratory for Plankton to convey the character's technological abilities, leading to Karen's development as his lab's central computer system.[13] Like Plankton, she was not initially intended to be a main character; her role in the series grew as Lawrence wrote ideas to give the Planktons more personality. Throughout the series' first and second seasons, Karen is not defined as Plankton's wife; Plankton's official biography from 2000 simply states that he works \\"with the help of his computer, Karen\\".[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the series' third season opener, 2002's \\"The Algae's Always Greener,\\" Plankton refers to Karen as his wife for the first time.[32] Aspects of their marriage, such as their anniversary and their honeymoon, have become the frequent focus of episodes since then.[33] In early episodes, Karen is always supportive and friendly toward her husband. But, as the series progresses, she becomes more cynical and sarcastic because of Plankton's relentless obsession with the Krabby Patty formula.[34] However, she remains loving and affectionate toward him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany episodes written by Lawrence develop and explore the relationship between Karen and her husband. Lawrence has stated that he feels Karen makes Plankton-focused episodes more humorous and that her presence helps portray him as a multidimensional character. In a 2009 interview with Andy Goodman, he said, \\"I want more Karen on the show?... The married life of an evil genius is the funniest thing to me, so in that regard [Karen] definitely enhances Plankton's stories, making him more than just your typical bad guy.\\"[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of Karen's appearances in the first four seasons depict her as a large, blue monitor in the Chum Bucket's laboratory;[36] at other times, only her voice is heard from within Plankton's robotic creations.[37] In The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, a mobile unit is introduced to allow Karen to interact more easily with others.[38] Showrunner Vincent Waller stated that the mobile unit was introduced because having Karen able to move was more convenient for storytelling purposes.[39] Karen alternates between her multiple forms in most episodes produced after the film. As of the tenth season, her wall monitor is no longer used and her mobile form is always equipped with a pair of robotic arms.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nKaren is voiced by American actress Jill Talley, who is also the wife of SpongeBob's voice actor, Tom Kenny. Talley uses a Midwestern accent for the character.[41] Whenever Karen talks, her voice is mixed over electronic sound effects by the series' audio engineers to create a robotic sound.[42] Her voice, which was more monotonous in earlier episodes, has been described as \\"deadpan\\" by the Associated Press.[30] Some of Karen's conversations with Plankton are improvised between Talley and Lawrence. The latter described this improvisation as one of his \\"favorite part[s] of the voice over\\" in 2009.[35] He elaborated in a 2012 interview, saying, \\"I always enjoy the back-and-forth. [Talley and I] start to actually overlap so much talking to each other that [the voice directors] have to tell us, 'hey, stop doing that, separate what you're saying!'\\"[15] Lawrence also feels that voicing the characters for so long has built a close relationship between the two actors. On the topic, he said, \\"This on-TV marriage we have, the whole world knows us being married?... We start becoming a married couple [when recording].\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nKaren has received generally positive reactions from critics. In a 2010 review of SpongeBob's Last Stand, DVD Talk's Paul Mavis wrote highly of Karen and Plankton's dialogue, stating that the two \\"could have their own sitcom\\".[43] Sandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media praised the amount of screen time given to Karen in Sponge Out of Water, calling her \\"hilarious\\".[44] In 2015, Boston.com's Jamie Loftus cited Karen as her reason for naming 2002's \\"Welcome to the Chum Bucket\\" one of the sixteen greatest SpongeBob episodes.[20] Gizmodo's Ryan Lufkin wrote in 2016 that SpongeBob's \\"90s-level weirdness\\" is proven by characters like Plankton and Karen.[45] The About Group's Nancy Basile commended Jill Talley's portrayal of the character, saying that it is \\"no surprise she plays [the role] so well\\" due to her earlier work with Second City and Mr. Show.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an analysis of how the show has changed throughout its run, Channel Frederator argued that the main characters of SpongeBobÿspecifically Sandy, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Squidward and Karenÿhave been reduced from multidimensional to reliant on single traits. According to this view, \\"Karen is now a full-blown nag\\" in newer episodes.[46] This aspect of Karen's character has also been criticized by author Joseph J. Foy, in his book SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy. He considers this trope one of several harmful stereotypes present on the program, writing that \\"the motif of the nagging wife is certainly an issue worthy of dissection in dealing with a young audience, along with the spoiled teen daughter [Pearl] and the stupid best friend [Patrick]\\".[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nLampooning a controversy surrounding SpongeBob's sexuality, essayist Dennis Hans wrote a 2005 satirical piece for the National Catholic Reporter focusing on the marriage of Plankton and Karen. He remarked, in jest, that SpongeBob's sexual orientation was a lesser issue compared to the positive representation of Plankton's \\"technosexuality\\". Hans identified instances where both Planktons were portrayed as a loving couple and joked: \\"the subliminal message from SpongeBob's insidious creators?... [is that] the technosexual lifestyle means bonding forever with your one true love\\".[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlankton and Karen have been featured in various forms of SpongeBob SquarePants merchandise, including video games and action figures.[48] In 2006, Ty Inc.'s Beanie Babies introduced a plush toy based on Plankton.[49] A Lego building set based on the Chum Bucket, including a Plankton minifigure and his laboratory with Karen, was released in 2007.[50] The fourteenth issue of SpongeBob Comics, titled \\"Plankton Comics,\\" is centered around the Planktons and includes six original stories set at the Chum Bucket.[51] The 2013 video game Plankton's Robotic Revenge is Plankton-themed and features Lawrence and Jill Talley reprising their voice roles from the show as Plankton and Karen.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlankton and Karen appear in several Nickelodeon crossover works, including 2005's Nicktoons Unite! game[53] and one of its sequels, Nicktoons: Globs of Doom.[54] Both games feature the Chum Bucket as a playing location and in the latter, Plankton is a player character.[55] Additionally, Plankton and Karen are both mentioned by Eric Lange (as his character Sikowitz) in \\"Tori Goes Platinum,\\" an episode of Nickelodeon's sitcom Victorious.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nSea World Australia's \\"SpongeBob ParadePants\\" event, which opened in December 2011, included a float featuring Karen and a talking Plankton.[57] In 2015, a recreation of Plankton's laboratory was constructed for a SpongeBob event at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Zhongzheng District, Taipei.[58] It included a replica of Karen's monitor, functioning as a television, screening episodes of SpongeBob, and a miniature Plankton statue.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flaming Lips' song \\"SpongeBob and Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy,\\" recorded for The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, closes with several lines focusing on Plankton and Karen. The song characterizes Plankton as a confused faultfinder who would be much happier if he stopped focusing on his failures and complaining to Karen.[60][61] Plankton sings a track on the novelty album The Best Day Ever titled \\"You Will Obey,\\" on which Elvis Presley's former guitarist James Burton played guitar.[62] Of the album, Tom Kenny said \\"one of our hidden Easter eggs that hopefully more than three people in the world will get is during the guitar solo when Plankton says 'Take it, James', which was what Elvis said in every one of those concert movies\\".[62] Film composer John Debney produced Plankton's theme music for the second SpongeBob movie, using low brass and trombones.[63] The film's score includes several tracks named after Plankton, including \\"Plankton Rescues Karen,\\" which is used during a scene highlighting Plankton's cooperation with hero SpongeBob.[64][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlankton and Karen are the central antagonists in the Broadway production The SpongeBob Musical.[66] In it they are portrayed by Nick Blaemire and Stephanie Hsu. In addition to wearing costumes inspired by the characters, Blaemire and Hsu sing a musical number (titled \\"When the Going Gets Tough,\\" composed by T.I.)[66] along with a Plankton puppet and a replica of Karen's mobile form. The plot features them attempting to hypnotize the residents of Bikini Bottom into liking the food they serve at the Chum Bucket. In 2009, actor Andy Peart portrayed Plankton in the musical adaptation of the third-season episode \\"The Sponge Who Could Fly\\".[67] Viv Hardwick of The Northern Echo positively reviewed the production and noted that Peart had very similar mannerisms to the cartoon Plankton.[68]","input":"What type of animal is plankton from spongebob?"},{"output":"1,034,070","context":"Mecklenburg County is a county located on the border in the southwestern part of the state of North Carolina, in the United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 919,628. It increased to 1,034,070 as of the 2015 estimate, making it the most populous county in North Carolina and the first county in the Carolinas to surpass 1 million in population.[1] Its county seat and largest city is Charlotte.[2]\\r\\nNOTE: To see information about the political body, the 'Mecklenburg County Commission' see this link: Mecklenburg County Commission.\\r\\nMecklenburg County is included in the Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-SC Metropolitan Statistical Area.\\r\\nOn September 12, 2013, the county welcomed its one millionth resident.[3]\\r\\nLike its capital Charlotte (capital of NC is Raleigh), the county is named after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, queen of the United Kingdom, whose name is derived from the region of Mecklenburg in Germany, itself deriving its name from Mecklenburg Castle in the village of Dorf Mecklenburg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMecklenburg County was formed in 1762 from the western part of Anson County, both in the Piedmont section of the state. It was named in commemoration of the marriage of King George III to Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz,[4] for whom the county seat Charlotte is named. Due to unsure boundaries, a large part of south and western Mecklenburg County extended into areas that would later form part of the state of South Carolina. In 1768, most of this area (the part of Mecklenburg County west of the Catawba River) was designated Tryon County, North Carolina.\\r\\nDetermining the final boundaries of these \\"western\\" areas between North and South Carolina was a decades-long process. As population increased in the area following the American Revolutionary War, in 1792 the northeastern part of Mecklenburg County was taken by the North Carolina legislature for Cabarrus County. Finally, in 1842 the southeastern part of Mecklenburg County was combined with the western part of Anson County to become Union County.\\r\\nThe Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence was allegedly signed on May 20, 1775; if the document is genuine, Mecklenburg County was the first part of the Thirteen Colonies to declare independence from Great Britain.[5] The \\"Mecklenburg Resolves\\" were adopted on May 31, 1775. http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-revolution/4263 Mecklenburg continues to celebrate the Meck Dec each year in May.[6] The Date of the Meck Dec is also listed on the Flag of North Carolina, represented by the date of May 20, 1775 as one of two dates on the flag of the old North State.\\r\\nFrom 1945 to 1972, Mecklenburg County sterilized 403 people who were in the care of county facilities, far more than any other county in North Carolina. This was the result of a so-called \\"science\\" of genetic engineering called eugenics, based on mistaken ideas about the transmission of favorable characteristics through reproduction. Preventing certain populations from reproducing - those (generally poor and minority) then classified as feeble-minded, criminal, etc. was seen as beneficial for society. By this time, the eugenics movement had been discredited in most other parts of the United States.[7]\\r\\nIn 1971, Mecklenburg County was the site of an important case in the American civil rights movement. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (CMS) was a suit filed to force the integration of the public schools in Charlotte..[8]\\r\\nIn 1999, the Federal Courts effectively over-ruled the Swann decision and declared that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education was 'Unitary' and were then prohibited by then US Federal Judge Robert Potter from using race to assign students to schools. In a case initially brought by William Capacchione, on behalf of his minor daughter,[9] CMS was sued for not allowing his daughter into a nearby (or neighborhood) school. Later in the case, additional plaintiffs, referred to as 'Grant intervenors' joined the Capacchione suit. On September 10, 1999[10] the US District Court for Western North Carolina rejected busing for desegregation purposes claiming that Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools had removed 'all vestiges of intentional discrimination'. While the Court had imposed busing as a temporary remedy in 1971 in the Swann case, it reversed the School Board's usage of it after all evidence of intentional discrimination were determined to be eliminated. This led the School Board to take the unusual position of petitioning the Court claiming that they were still discriminating and therefore should be allowed to continue to bus. The Court rejected the School Board's claim and CMS moved to a neighborhood schools model using magnets to entice voluntary diversity.\\r\\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 546 square miles (1,410?km2), of which 524 square miles (1,360?km2) is land and 22 square miles (57?km2) (4.0%) is water.[11]\\r\\nAs of the census[17] of 2000, there were 695,454 people, 273,416 households, and 174,986 families residing in the county. The population density was 1,322 people per square mile (510/km2). There were 292,780 housing units at an average density of 556 per square?mile (215/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 64.02% White, 27.87% Black or African American, 0.35% Native American, 3.15% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 3.01% from other races, and 1.55% from two or more races. 6.45% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race .\\r\\nThere were 273,416 households out of which 32.10% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.70% were married couples living together, 12.40% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.00% were non-families. 27.60% of all households were made up of individuals and 5.90% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 3.06.\\r\\nIn the county, the population was spread out with 25.10% under the age of 18, 9.70% from 18 to 24, 36.40% from 25 to 44, 20.30% from 45 to 64, and 8.60% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females there were 96.50 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.60 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the county was $50,579, and the median income for a family was $60,608. Males had a median income of $40,934 versus $30,100 for females. The per capita income for the county was $27,352. About 6.60% of families and 9.20% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.50% of those under age 18 and 9.30% of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nMecklenburg County voted for Obama/Biden in the 2012 United States presidential election by 60.65 percent to Romney/Ryan 38.24 percent.[18]\\r\\nMecklenburg County is a member of the regional Centralina Council of Governments.\\r\\nThe County is governed by the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners (BOCC). The BOCC is a nine-member board made up of representatives from each of the six county districts and three at-large representatives elected by the entire county. This electoral structure favors candidates in the at-large positions who will be elected by the majority population of the county. Each District has a population of approximately 165,000 individuals. All seats are partisan and are for 2-year terms (elections occur in even years). The current chairman of the Mecklenburg BOCC is Ella B. Scarborough (D, At-large). The Current Vice-Chair is Jim Puckett(R, District 1).\\r\\nMembers of the Mecklenburg County Commission are required by North Carolina State law to choose a Chair and Vice-Chair once a year (at the first meeting of December). Historically, the individual elected was the 'top-vote-getter' which was one of thee (3) at-large members. In 2014 this unofficial rule was changed by the Board to allow any member to serve as Chair or Vice-chair as long as they received support from 4 members plus their own vote.\\r\\nThe nine (9) members of the Board of County Commissioners are:\\r\\nThe current Chairman of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School board is Mary T. McCray (At-Large). The Vice Chair is Ericka Ellis-Stewart (At-Large). The members of the Board of Education are:\\r\\nThe Charlotte-Mecklenburg School board is non-partisan, and staggered elections are held every two years (in odd years).\\r\\nThe residents of Mecklenburg County are provided emergency medical service by MEDIC, the Mecklenburg EMS Agency. All emergency ambulance service is provided by MEDIC. No other emergency transport companies are allowed to operate within Mecklenburg County. While MEDIC is a division of Mecklenburg County Government, a board guides and directs MEDIC that consists of members affiliated with Carolinas Medical Center (CMC), Novant Presbyterian Hospital and a swing vote provided by the Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners. CMC and Novant are the two major medical institutions in Charlotte, North Carolina.\\r\\nThe major industries of Mecklenburg County are banking, manufacturing, and professional services, especially those supporting banking and medicine. Mecklenburg County is home to six Fortune 500 companies,[20] including 21st-ranked Bank of America.\\r\\nFortune 500 Companies with headquarters in Mecklenburg County\\r\\nWachovia, a former Fortune 500 Company had its headquarters in Charlotte until it was acquired by Wells Fargo for $15.1 billion. Wells Fargo maintains the majority of the former company's operations in Charlotte. The Federal Reserve approved the merger on October 12, 2008.[27]\\r\\nGoodrich Corporation, a former Fortune 500 Company, had its headquarters in Charlotte until it was acquired by United Technologies Corporation for $18.4 billion. Charlotte is now the headquarters for UTC Aerospace Systems.[28]\\r\\nMecklenburg County's largest employer is Carolinas Healthcare System, with 26,283 employees. This is followed closely by Wells Fargo (20,000) and Bank of America (13,960).[29]\\r\\nThe Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) serves the entire county; however, the State of North Carolina also has approved a number of charter schools in Mecklenburg County (independently operated schools financed with tax dollars).\\r\\nThe Public Library of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County serves residents of Mecklenburg County. Library cards from any branch can be used at all 20 locations. The library has an extensive collection (over 1.5 million items) of reference and popular materials including DVDs, books on CD, best sellers, downloadable media, and books.\\r\\nThe Billy Graham Library contains the papers and memorabilia related to the career of the well-known 20th century evangelist, Billy Graham.\\r\\nThe county's primary commercial aviation airport is Charlotte Douglas International Airport in Charlotte.\\r\\nWith twenty-five freight trains a day, Mecklenburg is a freight railroad transportation center, largely due to its place on the NS main line between Washington and Atlanta and the large volumes of freight moving in and out of the county via truck.\\r\\nMecklenburg County is served daily by three Amtrak routes.\\r\\nThe Crescent train connects Charlotte with New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Charlottesville, and Greensboro to the north, and Atlanta, Birmingham and New Orleans to the south.\\r\\nThe Carolinian train connects Charlotte with New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, Raleigh, Durham and Greensboro.\\r\\nThe Piedmont train connects Charlotte with Raleigh, Durham and Greensboro.\\r\\nThe Amtrak station is located at 1914 North Tryon Street. A new centralized multimodal train station, Gateway Station, has been planned for the city. It is expected to house the future LYNX Purple Line, the new Greyhound bus station, and the Crescent line that passes through Uptown Charlotte.\\r\\nMecklenburg County is the proposed southern terminus for the initial segment of the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor operating between Charlotte and Washington, D.C. Currently in conceptual design, the SEHSR would eventually run from Washington, D.C. to Macon, Georgia.\\r\\nLight rail service in Mecklenburg County is provided by LYNX Rapid Transit Services. Currently a 9.6-mile (15.4?km) line running from Uptown to Pineville; build-out is expected to be complete by 2034.\\r\\nCharlotte Area Transit System (CATS) bus service serves all of Mecklenburg County, including Charlotte, and the municipalities of Davidson, Huntersville, Cornelius, Matthews, Pineville, and Mint Hill.\\r\\nThe vintage Charlotte Trolley also operates in partnership with CATS. On July 14, 2015, the Goldrush Streetcar was revived to operate in Uptown after several decades of absence. The line runs from Trade Street, near Charlotte Transportation and Convention Center, to Elizabeth Avenue. In addition to several restaurants, this line also serves Central Piedmont Community College and Novant Health Presbyterian Hospital. The city is applying for a $50,000,000 Federal Transportation Grant, to gain funding to construct expansion of a line to serve Johnson C. Smith University to the West and East along Central Avenue.\\r\\nMecklenburg's manufacturing base, its central location on the Eastern Seaboard, and the intersection of two major interstates in the county have made it a hub for the trucking industry.\\r\\nMecklenburg County contains seven municipalities including the City of Charlotte and the towns of Cornelius, Davidson, and Huntersville (north of Charlotte); and the towns of Matthews, Mint Hill, and Pineville (south and southeast of Charlotte). Small portions of Stallings and Weddington are also in Mecklenburg County, though most of those towns are in Union County. Extraterritorial jurisdictions within the county are annexed by municipalities as soon as they reach sufficient concentrations.\\r\\nCoordinates: 3515N 8050W? / ?35.25N 80.83W? / 35.25; -80.83","input":"What is the population of mecklenburg county nc?"},{"output":"2.5 times as large as it appears from Earth","context":"In astronomy, an extraterrestrial sky is a view of outer space from the surface of a world other than Earth.\\r\\nThe only extraterrestrial sky that has been directly observed and photographed by astronauts is that of the Moon. The skies of Titan, Mars, and Venus have been observed by space probes designed to land on the surface and transmit images back to Earth.\\r\\nCharacteristics of extraterrestrial skies appear to vary substantially due to a number of factors. An extraterrestrial atmosphere, if present, has a large bearing on visible characteristics. The atmosphere's density and chemical composition can contribute to differences in colour, opacity (including haze) and the presence of clouds. Astronomical objects may also be visible and can include natural satellites, rings, star systems and nebulas and other planetary system bodies.\\r\\nFor skies that have not been directly or indirectly observed, their appearance can be simulated based on known parameters such as the position of astronomical objects relative to the surface and atmospheric composition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sun's apparent magnitude changes according to the inverse square law, therefore, the difference in magnitude as a result of greater or lesser distances from different celestial bodies can be predicted by the following formula:\\r\\nWhere \\"distance\\" can be in km, AU or any other appropiate unit.\\r\\nTo illustrate, since Pluto is 40 AU away from the Sun on average, it follows that the parent star would appear to be 1600 times dimmer than it is on Earth.\\r\\nThough a terrestrial observer would find a dramatic decrease in available sunlight in these environments, the Sun would still be bright enough to cast shadows even as far as the hypothetical Planet Nine, possibly located 1200 AU away, and would still outshine the full Moon.\\r\\nFurthermore, the angular diameter of the sun varies according to the following formula:\\r\\nThe angular diameter of a circle whose plane is perpendicular to the displacement vector between the point of view and the centre of said circle can be calculated using the formula[1]\\r\\nin which \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nѴ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\delta }\\r\\n\\r\\n is the angular diameter, and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle d}\\r\\n\\r\\n and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle D}\\r\\n\\r\\n are the actual diameter of and the distance to the object.

For practical use, the distinction is only significant for spherical objects that are relatively close, since the small-angle approximation holds for \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n?\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle x\\\\ll 1}\\r\\n\\r\\n:[2]\\r\\nDifferences in how the sun appears can be visualized with this chart:\\r\\nOn terrestrial planets and other solid celestial bodies with negligible atmospheric effects, the distance to the horizon for a \\"standard observer\\" varies as the square root of the planet's radius. Thus, the horizon on Mercury is 62% as far away from the observer as it is on Earth, on Mars the figure is 73%, on the Moon the figure is 52%, on Mimas the figure is 18%, and so on. For smaller, non-spherical objects, the observer's height must be taken into account when calculating the distance to the horizon.\\r\\nBecause Mercury has little or no atmosphere, a view of the planet's skies would be no different from viewing space from orbit. Mercury has a southern pole star, ϫ Pictoris, a magnitude 3.2 star. It is fainter than Earth's Polaris (ϫ Ursae Minoris).[3]\\r\\nOn average, the visible diameter of the Sun on Mercury is 2.5 times as large as it appears from Earth, and its total brightness is more than 6 times as great. Because of the planet's eccentric orbit, the Sun's apparent size in the sky would vary from 2.2 times that from Earth at aphelion (with total brightness 4.8 times as great), to 3.2 times at perihelion (with total brightness 10.2 times as great).\\r\\nMercury has a 3:2 spinÿorbit resonance. This means that although a sidereal day (the period of rotation) lasts around 58.7 Earth days, a solar day (the length between two meridian transits of the Sun) lasts around 176 Earth days. (In contrast, the difference between Earth's sidereal and solar days is only 4 minutes.)\\r\\nThe large eccentricity of Mercury's orbit coupled with the long length of a Mercurian day results in an unusual effect in which the Sun appears to briefly reverse its usual east-to-west motion once every Mercurian year. The on-sky distance over which the Sun appears to be travelling in this reversed (west-to-east) direction is slightly larger than the apparent size of the Sun itself. Thus, while the effect is visible wherever one happens to be on Mercury, there are certain points on Mercury's surface where an observer would be able to see the Sun rise, reverse and set, and then rise again, all within the same Mercurian day.[4]\\r\\nThe apparent motion reverses because approximately four (Earth) days prior to perihelion, the angular speed of Mercury's orbit exactly equals its rotational velocity, so that the Sun's apparent motion ceases. At perihelion, Mercury's orbital angular velocity slightly exceeds the rotational velocity, so the Sun appears to be retrograde. Four days after perihelion, the Sun's normal apparent motion resumes. Because of its spinÿorbit resonance, Mercury presents one of two spots of its surface to the Sun on alternate perihelia. One of these subsolar points is Caloris Planitia (\\"hot basin\\"), appropriately named because an observer near its centre would see the Sun loop around the zenith once per Mercurian day, and hence experience a very hot day indeed.\\r\\nAfter the Sun, the second-brightest object in the Mercurian sky is Venus, which is much brighter than for terrestrial observers. The reason for this is that when Venus is closest to Earth, it is between the Earth and the Sun, so we see only its night side. Indeed, even when Venus is brightest in the Earth's sky, we are actually seeing only a narrow crescent. For a Mercurian observer, on the other hand, Venus is closest when it is in opposition to the Sun and is showing its full disk. The apparent magnitude of Venus is as bright as ?7.7.[5]\\r\\nThe Earth and the Moon are also very prominent, their apparent magnitudes being about ?5[5] and ?1.2, respectively. The maximum apparent distance between the Earth and the Moon is about 15. All other planets are visible just as they are on Earth, but somewhat less bright at opposition.\\r\\nThe zodiacal light is probably more prominent than it is from Earth.\\r\\nThe atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the Sun is not distinguishable in the daytime sky, and the stars are not visible at night. Color images taken by the Soviet Venera probes suggest that the sky on Venus is orange.[6] If the Sun could be seen from Venus's surface, the time from one sunrise to the next (a solar day) would be 116.75 Earth days. Because of Venus's retrograde rotation, the Sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east.[7]\\r\\nAn observer aloft in Venus's cloud tops, on the other hand, would whip around the planet in about four (Earth) days and be treated to a sky in which Earth and the Moon shine brightly (about magnitudes ?6.6[5] and ?2.7, respectively) because their maximum approach occurs at opposition. Mercury would also be easy to spot, because it is closer and brighter, at up to magnitude ?2.7,[5] and because its maximum elongation from the Sun is considerably larger (40.5) than when observed from Earth (28.3).\\r\\nThe Moon has no atmosphere, so its sky is always black, as in the case of Mercury. However, the Sun is so bright that it is impossible to see stars during the daytime, unless the observer is well shielded from sunlight (direct or reflected from the ground). The Moon has a southern polar star, Ѵ Doradus, a magnitude 4.34 star. It is better aligned than Earth's Polaris (ϫ Ursae Minoris), but much fainter.\\r\\nThe Sun looks the same from the Moon as it does from Earth's orbit, somewhat brighter than it does from the Earth's surface, and colored pure white, due to the lack of atmospheric scattering and absorption.\\r\\nSince the Moon's axial tilt relative to its orbit around the Sun is nearly zero, the Sun traces out almost exactly the same path through the Moon's sky over the course of a year. As a result, there are craters and valleys near the Moon's poles that never receive direct sunlight, and there may exist mountains and hilltops that are never in shadow (see Lunar south pole and Peak of eternal light).\\r\\nAmong the most prominent features of the Moon's sky is Earth. Earth's angular diameter (1.9) is four times the Moon's as seen from Earth, although because the Moon's orbit is eccentric, Earth's apparent size in the sky varies by about 5% either way (ranging between 1.8 and 2.0 in diameter). Earth shows phases, just like the Moon does for terrestrial observers. The phases, however, are opposite; when the terrestrial observer sees the full Moon, the lunar observer sees a \\"new Earth\\", and vice versa. Earth's albedo is three times as high as that of the Moon (due in part to its whitish cloud cover), and coupled with the wider area, the full Earth glows over 50 times brighter than the full Moon at zenith does for the terrestrial observer. This Earth light reflected on the Moon's un-sunlit half is bright enough to be visible from Earth, even to the unaided eye ÿ a phenomenon known as earthshine.\\r\\nAs a result of the Moon's synchronous rotation, one side of the Moon (the \\"near side\\") is permanently turned towards Earth, and the other side, the \\"far side\\", mostly cannot be seen from Earth. This means, conversely, that Earth can only be seen from the near side of the Moon and would always be invisible from the far side. If the Moon's rotation were purely synchronous, Earth would not have any noticeable movement in the Moon's sky. However, due to the Moon's libration, Earth does perform a slow and complex wobbling movement. Once a month, as seen from the Moon, Earth traces out an approximate oval 18 in diameter. The exact shape and orientation of this oval depend on one's location on the Moon. As a result, near the boundary of the near and far sides of the Moon, Earth is sometimes below the horizon and sometimes above it.\\r\\nEarth and the Sun sometimes meet in the lunar sky, causing an eclipse. On Earth, one would see a lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow; meanwhile on the Moon, one would see a solar eclipse, when the Sun goes behind the Earth. Since the apparent diameter of the Earth is four times as large as that of the Sun, the Sun would be hidden behind the Earth for hours. Earth's atmosphere would be visible as a reddish ring. During the Apollo 15 mission, an attempt was made to use the Lunar Roving Vehicle's TV camera to view such an eclipse, but the camera or its power source failed after the astronauts left for Earth.[8]\\r\\nTerrestrial solar eclipses, on the other hand, would not be as spectacular for lunar observers because the Moon's umbra nearly tapers out at the Earth's surface. A blurry dark patch would barely be visible. The effect would be comparable to the shadow of a golf ball cast by sunlight on an object 4.572?m (15?ft) away. Lunar observers with telescopes might be able to discern the umbral shadow as a black spot at the center of a less dark region (penumbra) traveling across the full Earth's disk.\\r\\nIn summary, whenever an eclipse of some sort is occurring on Earth, an eclipse of another sort is occurring on the Moon. Eclipses occur for observers on both Earth and the Moon whenever the two bodies and the Sun align in a straight line, or syzygy.\\r\\nMars has only a thin atmosphere; however, it is extremely dusty and there is much light that is scattered about. The sky is thus rather bright during the daytime and stars are not visible. The Martian northern pole star is Deneb[9] (although the actual pole is somewhat offset in the direction of Alpha Cephei).\\r\\nGenerating accurate true-color images from Mars's surface is surprisingly complicated.[10] To give but one aspect to consider, there is the Purkinje effect: the human eye's response to color depends on the level of ambient light; red objects appear to darken faster than blue objects as the level of illumination goes down. There is much variation in the color of the sky as reproduced in published images, since many of those images have used filters to maximize their scientific value and are not trying to show true color. For many years, the sky on Mars was thought to be more pinkish than it is now believed to be.\\r\\nIt is now known that during the Martian day, the sky is a butterscotch color.[11] Around sunset and sunrise, the sky is rose in color, but in the vicinity of the setting Sun it is blue. This is the opposite of the situation on Earth. Twilight lasts a long time after the Sun has set and before it rises because of the dust high in Mars's atmosphere.\\r\\nOn Mars, Rayleigh scattering is usually a very weak effect; the red color of the sky is caused by the presence of iron(III) oxide in the airborne dust particles. These particles are larger in size than gas molecules, so most of the light is scattered by Mie scattering. Dust absorbs blue light and scatters longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow).\\r\\nThe Sun as seen from Mars appears to be ?5?8 the size as seen from Earth (0.35), and sends 40% of the light, approximately the brightness of a slightly cloudy afternoon on Earth.\\r\\nOn June 3, 2014, the Curiosity rover on Mars observed the planet Mercury transiting the Sun, marking the first time a planetary transit has been observed from a celestial body besides Earth.[12]\\r\\nMars has two small moons: Phobos and Deimos. From the Martian surface, Phobos has one-third to one-half the angular diameter of the Sun while Deimos is barely more than a dot (only 2 angular diameter). The orbital period of Phobos is so much shorter than the Martian day that the apparent motion of Phobos is in reverse: it rises in the west and sets in the east. Phobos orbits so close (in a low-inclination equatorial orbit) that it cannot be seen north of 70.4N or south of 70.4S latitude; high-latitude observers would also notice a decrease in Phobos's apparent size, the additional distance being non-negligible. Phobos's apparent size varies by up to 45% as it passes overhead, due to its proximity to Mars's surface. For an equatorial observer, for example, Phobos is about 0.14 upon rising and swells to 0.20 by the time it reaches the zenith. It crosses the sky swiftly, in about 4.24 hours, every 11.11 hours. Deimos rises in the east and sets in the west, like a \\"normal\\" moon, although its appearance to the naked eye would be starlike (angular diameter between 1.8 and 2.1). Its brightness would vary between that of Venus and of the star Vega (as seen from Earth). Being relatively close to Mars, Deimos cannot be seen from Martian latitudes greater than 82.7. Finally, Deimos's orbital period of about 30.3 hours exceeds the Martian rotation period (of about 24.6 hours) by such a small amount that it rises every 5.5 days and takes 2.5 days between rising and setting for an equatorial observer. Thus Phobos crosses the Martian sky nearly 12 times in the time it takes Deimos to cross it just once.\\r\\nPhobos and Deimos can both eclipse the Sun as seen from Mars, although neither can completely cover its disk and so the event is in fact a transit, rather than an eclipse. For a detailed description of such events see the articles Transit of Phobos from Mars and Transit of Deimos from Mars.\\r\\nThe Earth is visible from Mars as a double star; the Moon would be visible alongside it as a fainter companion. The maximum visible distance between the Earth and the Moon would be about 25, at inferior conjunction of the Earth and the Sun (for the terrestrial observer, this is the opposition of Mars and the Sun). Near maximum elongation (47.4), the Earth and Moon would shine at apparent magnitudes ?2.5 and +0.9, respectively.[5][13]\\r\\nVenus as seen from Mars (when near the maximum elongation from the Sun of 31.7) would have an apparent magnitude of about ?3.2.[5]\\r\\nFrom Phobos, Mars appears 6,400 times larger and 2,500 times brighter than the full Moon as seen from Earth, and appears as a sphere of angular diameter roughly 42taking up a quarter of the width of a celestial hemisphere\\r\\nFrom Deimos, Mars appears 1,000 times larger and 400 times brighter than the full Moon as seen from Earth, and appears as a sphere of angular diameter roughly 16.5taking up an eleventh of the width of a celestial hemisphere.\\r\\nThe asteroid belt is sparsely populated and most asteroids are very small, so that an observer situated on one asteroid would be unlikely to be able to see another without the aid of a telescope. Occasional \\"close approaches\\" do occur, but these are spread out over eons.\\r\\nSome asteroids that cross the orbits of planets may occasionally get close enough to a planet or asteroid so that an observer from that asteroid can make out the disc of the nearby object without the aid of binoculars or a telescope. For example, in September 2004, 4179 Toutatis came about four times the distance from the Earth that the Moon does. At the closest point in its encounter, the Earth would have appeared about the same size as the Moon appears from Earth. The Moon would also be easily visible as a small shape in Toutatis's sky at that time.\\r\\nAsteroids with unusual orbits also offer a lot to the imagination. For instance, the asteroid (or more likely, extinct comet) 3200 Phaethon has one of the most eccentric orbits: its distance from the Sun varies between 0.14 and 2.4 AU. At perihelion, the Sun would loom over 7 times larger than it does in our sky, and blast the surface with over 50 times as much energy; at aphelion, the Sun would shrink to less than half its apparent diameter on Earth, and give little more than a sixth as much illumination.\\r\\nThe asteroid 87 Sylvia is one of the largest main-belt asteroids and the first asteroid observed to have two moons. These moons, Romulus and Remus, would appear roughly the same size. Romulus, the farther one, would be about 0.89 across, slightly bigger than the closer but smaller Remus, which would be about 0.78 across. Because Sylvia is far from spherical, these values can vary by about a little more than 10%, depending on where the observer is on Sylvia's surface. Since the two asteroidal moons appear to orbit (as best we can tell) in the same plane, they would occult each other once every 2.2 days. When the season is right, twice during Sylvia's 6.52 year orbital period, they would eclipse the Sun, which, at 0.15 across, is much smaller than when seen from Earth (0.53). From Remus, the inner moon, Sylvia is huge, roughly 30G18 across, while its view of Romulus varies between 1.59 and 0.50 across. From Romulus, Sylvia measures 16G10 across, while Remus varies between 0.62 and 0.19.\\r\\nThe asteroid 243 Ida was visited by the Galileo spacecraft on its way to Jupiter. It discovered a small moon named Dactyl. Although the exact orbital characteristics of Dactyl are not fully known, it was 90 kilometers from Ida when Galileo passed by. This would mean that from Ida, Dactyl would appear as large as 1.76 degrees across, which is huge for such a small moon (1.4?km).\\r\\nAlthough no images from within Jupiter's atmosphere have ever been taken, artistic representations typically assume that the planet's sky is blue, though dimmer than Earth's, because the sunlight there is on average 27 times fainter, at least in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. The planet's narrow rings might be faintly visible from latitudes above the equator. Further down into the atmosphere, the Sun would be obscured by clouds and haze of various colors, most commonly blue, brown, and red. Although theories abound on the cause of the colors, there is currently no unambiguous answer.[16]\\r\\nFrom Jupiter, the Sun appears to cover only 5 arcminutes, less than a quarter of its size as seen from Earth.\\r\\nAside from the Sun, the most prominent objects in Jupiter's sky are the four Galilean moons. Io, the nearest to the planet, would be slightly larger than the full moon in Earth's sky, though less bright, and would be the largest moon in the Solar System as seen from its parent planet. The higher albedo of Europa would not overcome its greater distance from Jupiter, so it would not outshine Io. In fact, the low solar constant at Jupiter's distance (3.7% Earth's) ensures that none of the Galilean satellites would be as bright as the full moon is on Earth; from Io to Callisto their apparent magnitudes would be: ?11.2, ?9.7, ?9.4, and ?7.0.[citation needed]\\r\\nGanymede, the largest moon and third from Jupiter, is almost as bright as Io and Europa, but appears only half the size of Io. However, its great size means that it appears about 2 larger than Europa. Also, a triple conjunction of Io, Europa and Ganymede would be impossible, because the Laplace resonance that they share prevents this. When two of the Galilean moons are aligned, the third is never less than 90 degrees to the left or right of these moons in its orbit. Callisto, still further out, would appear only a quarter the size of Io.\\r\\nNone of the surface features on Jupiter's moons would appear as prominent as the lunar maria do when the Moon is viewed from Earth. Dark and light patches would be visible on Io's surface due to the coloration of sulfur that covers Io, and the largest volcanoes would be designated by dark points, but the lack of large, contrasting features results in a poor view of it. Europa, however, would appear as a completely featureless white disc. Even when viewed from nearby, most spacecraft images use contrast enhancements to clearly show the cracks in the Europan ice, which are only about 10ÿ15 percent darker than the rest of the surface. Vague dark and light patches would be visible on Ganymede, whereas Callisto is much too distant for any features to be made out.\\r\\nAll four Galilean moons stand out because of the swiftness of their motion, compared to the Moon. They are all also large enough to fully eclipse the Sun.[19] Because Jupiter's axial tilt is minimal, and the Galilean moons all orbit in the plane of Jupiter's equator, solar eclipses are quite common.\\r\\nJupiter's small inner moons appear only as starlike points except Amalthea, which can occasionally appear as large as Callisto. However, they would all be brighter than any star, ranging from magnitudes ?1.5 to ?4.9. The outer moons would be invisible except for Himalia, which would appear as a dim, starlike point to the naked eye (magnitude +5.5) only under favorable circumstances (if its periapsis happens to coincide exactly with its full phase).\\r\\nNone of Jupiter's moons have more than traces of atmosphere, so their skies are black or very nearly so. For an observer on one of the moons, the most prominent feature of the sky by far would be Jupiter. For an observer on Io, the closest large moon to the planet, Jupiter's apparent diameter would be about 20 (38 times the visible diameter of the Moon, covering 1% of Io's sky). An observer on Metis, the innermost moon, would see Jupiter's apparent diameter increased to 68 (130 times the visible diameter of the Moon, covering 18% of Metis's sky). A \\"full Jupiter\\" over Metis shines with about 4% of the Sun's brightness (light on Earth from a full moon is 400 thousand times dimmer than sunlight).\\r\\nBecause the inner moons of Jupiter are in synchronous rotation around Jupiter, the planet always appears in nearly the same spot in their skies (Jupiter would wiggle a bit because of the non-zero eccentricities). Observers on the sides of the Galilean satellites facing away from the planet would never see Jupiter, for instance.\\r\\nFrom the moons of Jupiter, solar eclipses caused by the Galilean satellites would be spectacular, because an observer would see the circular shadow of the eclipsing moon travel across Jupiter's face.[20]\\r\\nThe sky in the upper reaches of Saturn's atmosphere is blue (from imagery of the Cassini mission at the time of its September 2017 demise), but the predominant color of its cloud decks suggests that it may be yellowish further down. Observations from spacecraft show that seasonal smog develops in Saturn's southern hemisphere at its perihelion due to its axial tilt. This could cause the sky to become yellowish at times. As the northern hemisphere is pointed towards the sun only at aphelion, the sky there would likely remain blue. The rings of Saturn are almost certainly visible from the upper reaches of its atmosphere. The rings are so thin that from a position on Saturn's equator, they would be almost invisible. However, from anywhere else on the planet, they could be seen as a spectacular arc stretching across half the celestial hemisphere.[16]\\r\\nSaturn's moons would not look particularly impressive in its sky, as most are fairly small, and the largest are a long way from the planet. Even Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, appears only half the size of Earth's moon, and only grows as bright as ?7. In fact, Titan is the dimmest of Saturn's moons due to its great distance and low albedo; Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea are all brighter, at magnitudes ?7.8, ?7.9, ?8.8, ?8, and ?7.8, respectively. Here are the approximate angular diameters of the main moons (for comparison, Earth's moon has an average angular diameter of 31): Mimas: 7ÿ11, Enceladus: 7ÿ9, Tethys: 12ÿ15, Dione: 10ÿ12, Rhea: 8ÿ11, Titan: 14ÿ15, Iapetus: 1. Most of the inner moons would appear as bright, starlike points (with the exception of Janus, which would appear 7 arcseconds across at its zenith), although most would shine brighter than any star; for example, Janus and Epimetheus would both shine as bright as magnitude ?6. Meanwhile, none of the outer moons would be visible except Phoebe, which nears the naked eye limit (6.2ÿ6.6) even at full phase.\\r\\nSaturn has a southern polar star, Ѵ Octantis, a magnitude 4.3 star. It is much fainter than Earth's Polaris (ϫ Ursae Minoris).\\r\\nSince the inner moons of Saturn are all in synchronous rotation, the planet always appears in the same spot in their skies. Observers on the sides of those satellites facing away from the planet would never see Saturn.\\r\\nIn the skies of Saturn's inner moons, Saturn is an enormous object. For instance, Saturn seen from Pan has an apparent diameter of ~50, 104 times larger than our Moon and occupying 11% of Pan's sky. Because Pan orbits along the Encke division within Saturn's rings, they are visible from anywhere on Pan, even on its side facing away from Saturn.\\r\\nSaturn's rings would not be prominent from most of the moons. This is because the rings, though wide, are not very thick, and most of the moons orbit almost exactly (within 1.5) in the planet's ring plane. Thus, the rings are edge-on and practically invisible from the inner moons. From the outer moons, starting with Iapetus, a more oblique view of the rings would be available, although the greater distance would make Saturn appear smaller in the sky; from Phoebe, the largest of Saturn's outermost moons, Saturn would appear only as big as the full Moon does from Earth. The play of distance and angle is quite sensitive to the values used, but calculations show the best view of the rings would be achieved from the inner moon Mimas, which lies a full 1.5 off Saturn's equatorial plane and is fairly near the rings. At their widest opening, when Mimas is at its maximum distance from Saturn's equatorial plane, the edges of the rings (from B to A) would be separated by 2.7 degrees. The co-orbitals Epimetheus and Janus would also get a good view, with maximum opening angles ranging between 1.5 and 2.9. Tethys gets the next best view, with nearly half a degree. Iapetus achieves 0.20, which is more than any of the outer moons can claim.\\r\\nTitan is the only moon in the solar system to have a thick atmosphere. Images from the Huygens probe show that the Titanean sky is a light tangerine color. However, an astronaut standing on the surface of Titan would see a hazy brownish/dark orange color. As a consequence of its greater distance from the Sun and the opacity of its atmosphere, the surface of Titan receives only about ?1?3000 of the sunlight Earth does ÿ daytime on Titan is thus only as bright as twilight on the Earth. It seems likely that Saturn is permanently invisible behind orange smog, and even the Sun would only be a lighter patch in the haze, barely illuminating the surface of ice and methane lakes. However, in the upper atmosphere, the sky would have a blue color and Saturn would be visible.[21] With its thick atmosphere and methane rain, Titan is the only celestial body other than Earth upon which rainbows could form. However, given the extreme opacity of the atmosphere in visible light, the vast majority would be in the infrared.[22]\\r\\nSeen from Enceladus, Saturn would have a visible diameter of almost 30, sixty times more than the Moon visible from Earth. Moreover, since Enceladus rotates synchronously with its orbital period and therefore keeps one face pointed toward Saturn, the planet never moves in Enceladus's sky (albeit with slight variations coming from the orbit's eccentricity), and cannot be seen from the far side of the satellite.\\r\\nSaturn's rings would be seen from an angle of only 0.019 and be almost invisible, but their shadow on Saturn's disk would be clearly distinguishable. Like our own Moon from Earth, Saturn itself would show regular phases. From Enceladus, the Sun would have a diameter of only 3.5 minutes of arc, one-ninth that of the Moon as seen from Earth.\\r\\nAn observer located on Enceladus could also observe Mimas (the biggest satellite located inside Enceladus's orbit) transit in front of Saturn every 72 hours, on average. Its apparent size would be at most 26 minutes of arc, about the same size as the Moon seen from Earth. Pallene and Methone would appear nearly star-like (maximum 30 seconds of arc). Tethys, visible from Enceladus's anti-Saturnian side, would reach a maximum apparent size of about 64 minutes of arc, about twice that of the Moon as seen from the Earth.\\r\\nJudging by the color of its atmosphere, the sky of Uranus is probably a light blue, i.e. cyan color. It is unlikely that the planet's rings can be seen from its surface, as they are very thin and dark. Uranus has a northern polar star, Sabik ( Ophiuchi), a magnitude 2.4 star. Uranus also has a southern polar star, 15 Orionis, an unremarkable magnitude 4.8 star. Both are fainter than Earth's Polaris (ϫ Ursae Minoris), although Sabik only slightly.[16]\\r\\nUranus is unusual in that the obliquity of its ecliptic is 82 (angle between the orbital and rotational poles). The North Pole of Uranus points to somewhere near  Ophiuchi (in Earth's southern celestial hemisphere), about 15 northeast of Antares, and its South Pole halfway between Betelgeuse and Aldebaran. Uranus's \\"tropics\\" lie at 82 latitude and its \\"Arctic circles\\" at 8 latitude. On December 17, 2007, the Sun passed the Uranian celestial equator to the North and in 2029 the North Pole of Uranus will be nearly pointed at the Sun.\\r\\nNone of Uranus's moons would appear as large as a full moon on Earth from the surface of their parent planet, but the large number of them would present an interesting sight for observers hovering above the cloudtops. The angular diameters of the five large moons are as follows (for comparison, Earth's moon measures on average 31 for terrestrial observers): Miranda, 11ÿ15; Ariel, 20ÿ23; Umbriel, 15ÿ17; Titania, 11ÿ13; Oberon, 8ÿ9. Unlike on the other gas giants, many of the inner moons can be seen as disks rather than starlike points; the moons Portia and Juliet can appear around the size of Miranda at times, and a number of other inner moons appear larger than Oberon. Several others range from 6 to 8. The outer irregular moons would not be visible to the naked eye.\\r\\nHowever, the low light levels at such a great distance from the sun ensure that the moons appear very dim; the brightest, Ariel, would only shine at magnitude -7.4, more than 100 times dimmer than the moon as seen from Earth. Meanwhile, the outer large moon Oberon would only be as bright as magnitude -4.9, about the same as Venus despite its proximity.\\r\\nJudging by the color of its atmosphere, the sky of Neptune is probably an azure or sky blue, similar to Uranus'. As in the case of Uranus, it is unlikely that the planet's rings can be seen from its surface, as they are very thin and dark.\\r\\nAside from the Sun, the most impressive object in Neptune's sky is its large moon Triton, which would appear slightly smaller than a full Moon on Earth. It moves more swiftly than our Moon, because of its shorter period (5.8 days) compounded by its retrograde orbit. The smaller moon Proteus would show a disk about half the size of the full Moon. Surprisingly, Neptune's small inner moons all cover, at some point in their orbits, more than 10 in Neptune's sky. At some points, Despina's angular diameter rivals that of Ariel from Uranus and Ganymede from Jupiter. Here are the angular diameters for Neptune's moons (for comparison, Earth's moon measures on average 31 for terrestrial observers): Naiad, 7ÿ13; Thalassa, 8ÿ14; Despina, 14ÿ22; Galatea, 13ÿ18; Larissa, 10ÿ14; Proteus, 12ÿ16; Triton, 26ÿ28. An alignment of the inner moons would likely produce a spectacular sight. Neptune's large outer satellite, Nereid, is not large enough to appear as a disk from Neptune, and is not noticeable in the sky, as its brightness at full phase varies from magnitude 2.2ÿ6.4, depending on which point in its eccentric orbit it happens to be. The other irregular outer moons would not be visible to the naked eye, although a dedicated telescopic observer could potentially spot some at full phase.\\r\\nAs with Uranus, the low light levels cause the major moons to appear very dim. The brightness of Triton at full phase is only ?7.11, despite the fact that Triton is more than 4 times as intrinsically bright as our moon and orbits much closer to Neptune.\\r\\nTriton, Neptune's largest moon, has an atmosphere, but it is so thin that its sky is still black, possibly with some pale haze at the horizon. Because Triton orbits with synchronous rotation, Neptune always appears in the same position in its sky. Triton's rotation axis is inclined 130 to Neptune's orbital plane and thus points within 40 of the Sun twice per Neptunian year, much like Uranus's. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun for 82 years at a stretch, resulting in radical seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight.\\r\\nNeptune itself would span 8 degrees in Triton's sky, though with a maximum brightness roughly comparable to that of the full moon on Earth it would appear only about ?1?256 as bright as the full moon, per unit area. Due to its eccentric orbit, Nereid would vary considerably in brightness, from fifth to first magnitude; its disk would be far too small to see with the naked eye. Proteus would also be difficult to resolve at just 5ÿ6 arcminutes across, but it would never be fainter than first magnitude, and at its closest would rival Canopus.\\r\\nA trans-Neptunian object is any minor planet in the Solar System that orbits the Sun at a greater average distance (semi-major axis) than Neptune, 30 astronomical units (AU).\\r\\nPluto, accompanied by its largest moon Charon, orbits the Sun at a distance usually outside the orbit of Neptune except for a twenty-year period in each orbit.\\r\\nFrom Pluto, the Sun is point-like to human eyes, but still very bright, giving roughly 150 to 450 times the light of the full Moon from Earth (the variability being due to the fact that Pluto's orbit is highly elliptical, stretching from just 4.4 billion km to over 7.3 billion km from the Sun).[23] Nonetheless, human observers would find a large decrease in available light.\\r\\nPluto's atmosphere consists of a thin envelope of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide gases, which are derived from the ices of these substances on its surface. When Pluto is closer to the Sun, the temperature of Pluto's solid surface increases, causing ices to sublimate into gas. This atmosphere also produces a noticeable blue haze which is visible at sunset, and possibly other times of the Plutonian day [24]\\r\\nPluto and Charon are tidally locked to each other. This means that Charon always presents the same face to Pluto, and Pluto also always presents the same face to Charon. Observers on the far side of Charon from Pluto would never see the dwarf planet; observers on the far side of Pluto from Charon would never see the moon. Every 124 years, for several years it is mutual-eclipse season, when Pluto and Charon each eclipse the Sun for the other, at intervals of 3.2 days.\\r\\nView from Hydra. Pluto and Charon (right); Nix (left) (artist concept).\\r\\nView from Pluto. Sun (right-top); Charon (left) (artist concept).\\r\\nView from Pluto of Charon and the Sun (artist concept).\\r\\nPluto by moonlight (artist concept).\\r\\nThe asteroid Quaoar is a Kuiper belt object with a circular orbit and moderate inclination. From its surface and at the average distance between its perihelion and aphelion the Sun would have an angular diameter of 44.2 (arcseconds) comparable to the maximum diameter of Venus of 63.0; the human eye has a resolution of 72, so the Sun from Quaoar's surface would appear as a point. The Sun's apparent magnitude would be -18.56, in comparison the magnitude of the Moon at full phase is ?12.74, so the Sun would appear on Quaoar as a point of light 212 times brighter than a full Moon on Earth. The amount of light depends on the atmosphere: if present the amount of light received at noon would be similar to the light at dusk or dawn on Earth.\\r\\nQuaoar's moon Weywot has an angular diameter of 15.9 (arcminutes) at apoapsis and 21.4 at periapsis, in comparison the Moon's angular diameter varies between 29.4 and 33.5. In comparison to the size of the Sun from Quaoar's surface Weywot would appear much bigger: 15.9 is equal to 954 or 21.6 times the diameter of the Sun as seen from Quaoar. Most solar eclipses would be total and a partial eclipse would be extremely rare. At full phase Weywot's visual magnitude is -3.24 somewhere between Jupiter's maximum magnitude (-2.94) and Venus's minimum magnitude (-3.82), in comparison the Moon at full phase is 6,301 times brighter than Weywot.\\r\\nQuaoar's umbra extends 5,180,390?km and at the distance of Weywot's apoapsis it would have a diameter of 1,106.5?km or 15 times Weywot's diameter. In comparison Earth's umbra at the Moon's position is 2.65 times wider. Weywot's inclination is not determined yet, it's either 14 or 30, if we assume the smaller value then Weywot's center at apoapsis can be up to 4,121?km above or below Quaoar's equatorial plane, this mean for most of the time Weywot is outside of the umbra completely.\\r\\nThe sky of a comet changes dramatically as it nears the Sun. During perihelion, a comet's ices begin to sublime from its surface, forming tails of gas and dust, and a coma. An observer on a comet nearing the Sun might see the stars slightly obscured by a milky haze, which could create halo effects around the Sun and other bright objects.\\r\\nFor observers on extrasolar planets, the constellations would differ depending on the distances involved. The view of outer space of exoplanets can be extrapolated from open source software such as Celestia or Stellarium, and it appears that due to parallax, distant stars change their position less than nearby ones. For alien observers, the Sun would be visible to the naked human eye only at distances below 20[25] ÿ 27[26] parsec (60 - 90 ly)[nb 1]. Whenever the sun is observed from another star, it always appears on the opposite coordinates in the sky. Thus an observer located near a star with RA at 4 hr and declination -10 would see the sun located at RA: 16 hr, dec: +10. A consequence of observing the universe from other stars is that stars that may appear bright in our own sky may appear dimmer in other skies and vice versa.\\r\\nIf the Sun were to be observed from the Alpha Centauri system, the nearest star system to ours, it would appear to be a 0.46 magnitude star in the constellation Cassiopeia, and would create a \\"/W\\" shape instead of the \\"W\\" as seen from Earth. Due to the proximity of the Alpha Centauri system, the constellations would, for the most part, appear similar. However, there are some notable differences with the position of other nearby stars; for example, Sirius would appear about one degree from the star Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion. Also, Procyon would appear in the constellation Gemini, about 13 degrees below Pollux.\\r\\nA planet around either ϫ Centauri A or B would see the other star as a very bright secondary. For example, an Earth-like planet at 1.25 astronomical units from ϫ Cen A (with a revolution period of 1.34 years) would get Sun-like illumination from its primary, and ϫ Cen B would appear 5.7 to 8.6 magnitudes dimmer (?21.0 to ?18.2), 190 to 2,700 times dimmer than ϫ Cen A but still 150 to 2,100 times brighter than the full Moon. Conversely, an Earth-like planet at 0.71 AU from ϫ Cen B (with a revolution period of 0.63 years) would get Sun-like illumination from its primary, and ϫ Cen A would appear 4.6 to 7.3 magnitudes dimmer (?22.1 to ?19.4), 70 to 840 times dimmer than ϫ Cen B but still 470 to 5,700 times brighter than the full Moon. In both cases the secondary sun would, in the course of the planet's year, appear to circle the sky. It would start off right beside the primary and end up, half a period later, opposite it in the sky (at \\"full\\"). After another half period, it would complete the cycle. Other planets orbiting one member of a binary system would enjoy similar skies. The angular separation between the two stars would not be exactly the same after one orbit of the planet however, because during that time the parent star will have completed part of its orbit around the other star in the system.\\r\\nFrom 40 Eridani, 16 light years away, the Sun would be an average looking star of about apparent magnitude 3.3 in the constellation Serpens Caput. At this distance most of the stars nearest to us would be in different locations to those in our sky, including Alpha Centauri, Sirius, and Procyon.\\r\\nFrom a planet orbiting Aldebaran, 65 light years away, our Sun would be seen as an insignificant 6.4 magnitude star between Ophiuchus and Scorpius (more specifically, it would in the vicinity of Phi Ophiuchi and 24 Scorpii). Constellations made of bright, distant stars would look somewhat similar (such as Orion and Scorpius) but much of the night sky would seem unfamiliar to someone from Earth. Even Orion would appear somewhat different; viewed from this position, Alnilam and Mintaka would appear to be on top of each other, only 15 arcminutes apart, thus reducing the belt to two stars. Also Bellatrix would be much closer to the belt, making the \\"chest\\" somewhat smaller.\\r\\nIn May 2017, glints of light from Earth, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.[27][28] The technology used to determine this may be useful in studying the atmospheres of distant worlds, including those of exoplanets.","input":"How big is the sun in mercury's sky?"},{"output":"Memphis, Tennessee","context":"St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, founded in 1962, is a pediatric treatment and research facility focused on children's catastrophic diseases. The hospital costs about $2.4 million a day to run, and there is no cost to be treated.[1] It is located in Memphis, Tennessee, and is a nonprofit medical corporation designated as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization by the Internal Revenue Service.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Jude was founded by entertainer Danny Thomas in 1962, with help from Lemuel Diggs and close friend, Miami, Florida, automobile dealer Anthony Abraham, on the premise that \\"no child should die in the dawn of life\\".[3] This idea resulted from a promise that Thomas, a Maronite Catholic, had made to a saint years before the hospital was founded. Thomas was a comedian who was struggling to get a break in his career and living paycheck to paycheck. When his first child was about to be born, he attended Mass in Detroit and put his last $7.00 in the offering bin. He prayed to St. Jude Thaddeus for a means to provide for his family, and about a week later, he obtained a gig that paid 10 times what he had put in the offering bin. After that time, Thomas believed in the power of prayer. He promised St. Jude Thaddeus that if he made him successful, he would one day build him a shrine. Years later, Thomas became an extremely successful comedian and built St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital as a shrine to St. Jude Thaddeus to honor his promise.[4]\\r\\nIn 1957, Thomas founded the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC), which helped him realize his dream. ALSAC is also the fundraising organization of St. Jude. Since St. Jude opened its doors in 1962, ALSAC has had the responsibility of raising the necessary funds to keep the hospital open. Memphis was chosen at the suggestion of Roman Catholic Cardinal Samuel Stritch, a Tennessee native who had been a spiritual advisor to Thomas since he presided at Thomas's confirmation in Thomas's boyhood home of Toledo, Ohio.[5][6]\\r\\nAlthough it was named after Thomas's patron saint, St. Jude is not a Catholic hospital and is not affiliated with any religious organization.[7]\\r\\nIn late 2007, the Chili's Care Center opened on the St. Jude campus. Chili's restaurant chain has pledged to provide $50 million to fund the construction of the center. The seven-story Chili's Care Center will house 340,000 square feet (32,000?m2) and will add 24 labs and 16 beds to the campus. It will house the department of radiological services, The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, two floors of outpatient clinics, one floor of inpatient clinics and rooms, two floors of laboratory space, an office floor and an unfinished level for future expansion.\\r\\nIn June 2008, Sterling Jewelers and St. Jude officially opened the new Kay Kafe (named after one of Sterling's jewelery chains), featuring a spacious lounge area, a significantly larger dining area and a variety of new dining options. More than ever, the cafeteria is the focal point of the campus where families and staff can escape and relax away from the treatment areas. The grand opening ceremony featured Marlo Thomas, national outreach director for St. Jude; Tony Thomas, member of the ALSAC/St. Jude Boards of Directors and Governors; Terry Burman, chairman of Sterling; Mark Light, CEO and president of Sterling; John P. Moses, CEO of ALSAC, the fundraising organization for St. Jude; Dr. William E. Evans, CEO of St. Jude; Joyce Aboussie, chair of the ALSAC Board of Directors, and Robert Breit, chair of the St. Jude Board of Governors.[8]\\r\\nIn 2014, the Marlo Thomas Center for Global Education and Collaboration was opened as part of the hospital.[9]\\r\\nDiscoveries at St. Jude have completely changed how doctors treat children with cancer and other catastrophic illnesses.[10][11] Since St. Jude was established, the survival rate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common type of childhood cancer, has increased from 4 percent in 1962 to 94 percent today.[11] During this time, the overall survival rate for childhood cancers has risen from 20 percent to 80 percent.[12] St. Jude has treated children from across the United States and from more than 70 countries. Doctors across the world consult with St. Jude on their toughest cases.[13] Also, St. Jude has an International Outreach Program to improve the survival rates of children with catastrophic illnesses worldwide through the transfer of knowledge, technology and organizational skills.[14]\\r\\nSt. Jude and over 46 of its staff members have been the recipients of numerous exemplary awards and achievements. For example, in 2010 St. Jude Children's Research Hospital was named the number one children's cancer hospital in the U.S by U.S. News & World Report.[15] It has also been named one of the top 10 companies to work for in academia by The Scientist for 7 successive years.[16] Most notably, Peter C. Doherty, Ph.D., of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital was co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for work related to how the immune system kills virus-infected cells.\\r\\nSt. Jude is associated with several affiliated hospitals around the nation to further its efforts beyond its own physical walls. The hospital uses its Domestic Affiliates Program to form this partnership with the other pediatric programs. This program is a network of hematology clinics, hospitals, and universities that are united under the mission of St. Jude.\\r\\nThese sites are used as a means of referring eligible patients to St. Jude as well as a location to administer some care. Through the Domestic Affiliates Program staff at St. Jude work together and collaborate with those at the other institutions. Affiliated sites are expected to comply with standards set by St. Jude and are audited to ensure proper and quality care.[17]\\r\\nCurrently the Domestic Affiliate Clinic sites include:\\r\\nSt. Jude also works closely with Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center, also located in downtown Memphis. St. Jude patients needing certain procedures, such as brain surgery, may undergo procedures at LeBonheur Hospital. Both St. Jude and Le Bonheur are teaching hospitals affiliated with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. University of Tennessee physicians training in pediatrics, surgery, radiology, and other specialties undergo service rotations at St. Jude Hospital.\\r\\nThe Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon was established in Beirut on April 12, 2002. The center is an affiliate of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and works in association with the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC).[19]\\r\\nFunding for St. Jude comes from many sources, including government grants and insurance recoveries, but the principal source of funding (64% average over the past seven years) is from the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC) - a semi-independent entity that raises funds using the name of St. Jude.[20] Of a dollar donated to the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, about $0.52 makes its way through to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (averaged over seven years). [20]\\r\\nAll medically eligible patients who are accepted for treatment at St. Jude are treated without regard to the family's ability to pay. St. Jude is one of a few pediatric research organizations in the United States where families never pay for treatments that are not covered by insurance, and families without insurance are never asked to pay. In addition to providing medical services to eligible patients, St. Jude also assists families with transportation, lodging, and meals. Three separate specially-designed patient housing facilities Tri Delta Place for short-term (up to one week), Ronald McDonald House for medium-term (one week to 3 months), and Target House for long-term (3 months or more)provide housing for patients and up to three family members, with no cost to the patient. These policies, along with research expenses and other costs, cause the hospital to incur more than $2.4 million in operating costs each day.[21]\\r\\nFrom 2000 to 2005, 83.7% of every dollar received by St. Jude went to the current or future needs of St. Jude. In 2002 to 2004, 47% of program expenses went to patient care and 41% to research.[22] As of 2012, 81 cents of every dollar donated to St. Jude goes directly to its research and treatment.[12]\\r\\nTo cover operating costs, ALSAC conducts many fund-raising events and activities. The FedEx St. Jude Classic, a PGA Tour event, is one of the most visible fund-raising events for the hospital. Other fund-raising programs include the St. Jude Math-A-Thon, Up 'til Dawn, direct mailings, radiothons and television marketing.\\r\\nSt. Jude also has a merchandise catalog called the Hope Catalog. The catalog contains everything from shirts to office items, and from patient art to \\"Give Thanks\\" wristbands.\\r\\nIn November 2004, St. Jude launched its inaugural Thanks and Giving campaign which encourages consumers to help raise funds at participating retailers by adding a donation at checkout or by purchasing specialty items to benefit St. Jude. The campaign is supported by network television spots, advertisements in major publications, interactive marketing on Yahoo! and a movie trailer that runs on 20,000 screens nationwide, runs from Thanksgiving until the New Year. The campaign was created by St. Jude National Outreach Director Marlo Thomas and her siblings Terre Thomas and Tony Thomas, children of hospital founder Danny Thomas. Customers nationwide are asked to help raise funds at participating retailers by adding a donation at check out or by purchasing specialty items to benefit St. Jude.\\r\\nCorporations such as Target, Best Buy, Domino's Pizza, the Williams-Sonoma family of brands, CVS/pharmacy, Kmart, Kay Jewelers, New York & Company, 7-Eleven, Inc., American Airlines, American Kiosk Management, AutoZone, Brooks Brothers, Busch Gardens, Casual Male XL, Catherines, Diane von Frstenberg, Dollar General, Easy Spirit, General Nutrition Centers, Gymboree, HSN, J. P. Morgan Chase, Marshall's, Alor, The Melting Pot, Memphis Grizzlies (NBA), Nine West, Rochester, Sag Harbor, Saks Fifth Avenue, SeaWorld, St. Louis Rams (NFL), West Elm, Westfield Shoppingtowns, and Yahoo! give customers a host of opportunities to support St. Jude.[23] The ultimate goal is to increase awareness with the hope that people will come to identify Thanksgiving with St. Jude, said Joyce Aboussie, vice chairwoman of the nonprofits board.[24] The official kick-off event for the Thanks and Giving campaign is the Give Thanks Walk. This event is a noncompetitive 5K that is now held in 75 cities across the country. Those participating in the race are encouraged to form teams, invite family and friends, and raise money for St. Jude. These walks have raised over $11 million to date.[25]\\r\\nOne of the hospital's most recent and successful fund-raising efforts has been the Dream Home Giveaway.\\"About St. Jude Dream Home Giveaway\\". St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Retrieved 2008-01-29.? The giveaway allows contest entrants to reserve tickets for $100 each to qualify to win homes valued between $300,000 and $600,000. The Dream Home Giveaway, one of the largest national fund-raising programs, is conducted in cities across the United States.\\r\\nMany high schools around the country are creating student-led and student-run organizations called Team Up for St. Jude. These programs consist of high school students putting on events that raise funds and awareness for St. Jude while showing their school spirit. One of the main events is a letter writing campaign in which the students are sent pre-written letters that include stories of a patient and ask for donations. The high school students often have a \\"letter writing party\\" to address and send the letters to their family and friends asking them to support St. Jude.[26] Hoover High School (Hoover, AL) has a program that has brought in many fundraising ideas including \\"Team Up Week\\" which consists of prize wheels, inflatables, karaoke, cake walk, etc. to raise funds and awareness for the hospital.[27] Though this program is done on a much a smaller scale than the college program Up 'til Dawn, it has the potential to grow and increase awareness.\\r\\nAt various college campuses, some student organizations, fraternities and sororities raise funds in a program called Up 'til Dawn[28] Phi Mu Delta National Fraternity is partnered with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The fraternity's second core belief, \\"I Believe in Service... service to the college; service to every group organized for the common good; service to the individual. I believe in service defined in the terms of voluntary sacrifice for the welfare of those with whom I come in contact.\\" has helped shape many young men of admirable quality and exceptional character towards a dedication to St. Jude and other equally important causes.[29] Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) Fraternity partnered with St. Jude in the 1970s and 1980s to help raise money to fight childhood cancer. The fraternity renewed its link to St. Jude as its philanthropy of emphasis in 2008.[30][31] Saint Jude Founder Danny Thomas was a TKE in the Gamma-Nu chapter at the University of Toledo. \\"Tau Kappa Epsilon\\". stjude.org. Retrieved 2013-12-05.?\\r\\nSt. Jude is an International Philanthropic Project of Epsilon Sigma Alpha International, a co-ed service sorority. As of April 2013, ESA has raised more than $160 million in cash and pledges for St. Jude.[32][33]\\r\\nIn 1999, the Delta Delta Delta collegiate sorority formed a philanthropic partnership with St. Jude.[34] Tri Delta supports St. Jude nationally and supports cancer charities at a local level.[35] At the hospital in Memphis, the sorority donated the Teen Room for teenage patients to relax and spend time with each other. In July 2010, Tri Delta completed its \\"10 by 10\\" goal, raising over $10 million in less than four years, six years short of the original goal. Those funds were used to sponsor the Tri Delta Patient Care Floor in the Chilis Care Center. Upon completion of the \\"10 by 10\\" campaign, the sorority announced a new fundraising goal of $15 million in 5 years to name the Specialty Clinic located in the Patient Care Center.[36] Three and a half years later, Delta Delta Delta had raised $15 million and completed its goal ahead of schedule.[37] In July 2014, the on-campus residence center was renamed Tri Delta Place as a result of Tri Delta's pledge of $60 Million in 10 years.[38]\\r\\nIn July 2005, Kappa Alpha Psi (ʽ) fraternity announced St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital as its national philanthropic partner. Since that time, members across the country have joined in the fight against pediatric cancer, sickle cell disease, and other catastrophic illnesses. Kappa Alpha Psi has answered the call to service by raising more than $400,000representing the largest contribution that Kappa Alpha Psi has donated to any charity. Members of Kappa Alpha Psi have committed to raise $500,000 in support of the hospitals sickle cell program. St. Jude has one of the largest pediatric sickle cell research and treatment programs in the world. St. Jude is the first known hospital in the world to cure sickle cell disease through bone marrow transplantation. Today, bone marrow transplantation still offers the only cure for sickle cell disease. Members of Kappa Alpha Psi reach out to churches in their local communities to host a Sunday of Hope each January in support of St. Jude. January was selected because this is the month of Kappas founding. During the Sunday of Hope, churches will take up a special offering in honor of the patients and families of St. Jude. At the 2008 ALSAC/St. Jude Board and Awards Dinner, Kappa Alpha Psi received the Volunteer Group of the Year Award for their efforts in the inaugural year of the Sunday of Hope program which secured more than 130 churches to participate and raised more than $280,000.[39]\\r\\nLambda Theta Alpha sorority serves thousands of hours each year to a variety of philanthropic causes and needs. In the effort to create a more united and bigger impact nationally, Lambda Theta Alpha selected a national philanthropy. In January 2010, LTA became an official collegiate partner to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, becoming the first individual Latino Greek organization to commit fully to the hospital's efforts. With this partnership, LTA provides our resources of community service and activism and more importantly, another direct link to the Hispanic community for St. Jude. LTA has pledged to raise awareness about childhood cancer and St. Jude in the Latin community, as well as fundraise for the hospital through a variety of events and programs.[40][41]\\r\\nPast events have included: sporting tournaments, charity galas, informational meetings, and much more.[41]\\r\\nAnother successful event is the Country Cares for St. Jude Kids radio-thon. During these events, country radio stations around the country allow those touched by St. Jude to share stories with listeners, highlighting patient stories, and having exciting promotions. Listeners are encouraged to call in and become a Partner In Hope by making either a one-time or monthly donation to the hospital. The 200 stations involved have helped raise over $400 million since 1989. Country artists have also supported St. Jude through concerts, hospital visits, call-ins, and other forms of support.[42]\\r\\nIn 1995, St. Jude received an anonymous letter postmarked in Dallas, Texas, containing a $1 million winning McDonald's Monopoly game piece. McDonald's officials came to the hospital, accompanied by a representative from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, and verified it as a winner.[43] Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, McDonald's waived the rule and has made the annual $50,000 annuity payments, even after learning that the piece was sent by an individual involved in an embezzlement scheme intended to defraud McDonald's.[44]\\r\\nSt. Jude Childrens Research celebrity visitors are individuals that are in the entertainment industry who visit the children in the hospital. Over the years, many celebrities such as musicians, political figures, actors and others have become involved with this foundation. Hollywood actors visit the hospital to meet some of the kids and try to get involved. Other celebrities have filmed commercials to encourage individuals to donate to St. Jude. Some of the most recognized celebrities that have visited St. Jude to see the effort going on daily in order to combat catastrophic illnesses are:[45]","input":"Where is st. jude children's hospital located?"},{"output":"October 21, 1972","context":"The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) was the first act of the United States Congress to call specifically for an ecosystem approach to wildlife management. It was signed into law on October 21, 1972 by President Richard Nixon and took effect 60 days later on December 21, 1972. MMPA prohibits the \\"taking\\" of marine mammals, and enacts a moratorium on the import, export, and sale of any marine mammal, along with any marine mammal part or product within the United States.  The Act defines \\"take\\" as \\"the act of hunting, killing, capture, and/or harassment of any marine mammal; or, the attempt at such.\\" The MMPA defines harassment as \\"any act of pursuit, torment or annoyance which has the potential to either: a. injure a marine mammal in the wild, or b. disturb a marine mammal by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, which includes, but is not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering.\\" The MMPA provides for enforcement of its prohibitions, and for the issuance of regulations to implement its legislative goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthority to manage the MMPA was divided between the Secretary of the Interior through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), and the Secretary of Commerce, which is delegated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Subsequently, a third Federal agency, the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC), was established to review existing policies and make recommendations to the Service and the NOAA better implement the MMPA.  Coordination between these three Federal agencies is necessary in order to provide the best management practices for marine mammals.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the MMPA, the Service is responsible for ensuring the protection of sea otters and marine otters, walruses, polar bears, three species of manatees, and dugongs.  NOAA was given responsibility to conserve and manage pinnipeds including seals and sea lions and cetaceans such as whales and dolphins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MMPA prohibits the take and exploitation of any marine mammal without appropriate authorization, which may only be given by the Service.  Permits may be issued for scientific research, public display, and the importation/exportation of marine mammal parts and products upon determination by the Service that the issuance is consistent with the MMPAs regulations. The two types of permits issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service's Office of Protected Resources are incidental and directed. Incidental permits, which allow for some unintentional taking of small numbers of marine mammal, are granted to U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity other than commercial fishing in a specified geographic area. Directed permits are required for any proposed marine mammal scientific research activity that involves taking marine mammals.\\r\\n\\r\\nApplications for such permits are reviewed and issued the Service's Division of Management Authority, through the International Affairs office.  This office also houses the Division of International Conservation, which is directly responsible for coordinating international activities for marine mammal species found in both U.S. and International waters, or are absent from U.S. waters.  Marine mammal species inhabiting both U.S. and International waters include the West Indian manatee, sea otter, polar bear, and Pacific walrus.  Species not present in U.S. waters include the West African and Amazonian manatee, dugong, Atlantic walrus, and marine otter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn efforts to conserve and manage marine mammal species, the Service has appointed field staff dedicated to working with partners to conduct population censuses, assess population health, develop and implement conservation plans, promulgate regulations, and create cooperative relationships internationally.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious Marine Mammal Management offices are located on either coast.  The Service's Marine Mammal Management office in Anchorage, Alaska is responsible for the management and conservation of polar bears, Pacific walruses, and northern sea otters in Alaska.  Northern sea otters present in Washington State are managed by the Western Washington Field Office, while southern sea otters residing in California are managed by the Ventura Field Office.  West Indian manatee populations extend from Texas to Rhode Island, and are also present in the Caribbean Sea; however, this species is most prevalent near Florida (the Florida subspecies) and Puerto Rico (the Antillean subspecies).  The Services Jacksonville Field Office manages the Florida manatee, while the Boqueron Field Office manages the Antillean manatee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe polar bear, southern sea otter, marine otter, all three species of manatees, and the dugong are also concurrently listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).\\r\\n\\r\\nAmendments enacted in 1981 established conditions for permits to be granted to take marine mammals \\"incidentally\\" in the course of commercial fishing.

Congress declared that marine mammals are resources of great international significance (aesthetic, recreational and economic), and should be protected and encouraged to develop to the greatest extent feasible commensurate with sound policies of resource management. The primary management objective should be to maintain the health and stability of the marine ecosystem.

Federal and state authorities are currently constructing a replacement bridge, the New Tappan Zee Bridge, that will cost at least $4 billion.[4]\\r\\nThe bridge is part of the New York State Thruway mainline and carries the highway concurrency of Interstate 87 and Interstate 287. The span carries seven lanes of motor traffic. The center lane can be switched between eastbound and westbound traffic depending on the prevalent commuter direction; on weekdays the center lane is eastbound in the morning and westbound in the evening. The switch is accomplished via a movable center barrier which is moved by a pair of barrier transfer machines. Even with the switchable lane, traffic is frequently very slow. The bridge is one of the primary crossings of the Hudson River north of New York City; it carries much of the traffic between southern New England and points west of the Hudson. It is the longest bridge in the State of New York.[5] The total length of the bridge approaches is 16,013 feet (4,881?m). The cantilever span is 1,212 feet (369?m) providing a maximum clearance of 138 feet (42?m) over the water. The bridge is about 25 miles (40?km) north of Midtown Manhattan, the skyline of which can be seen from the bridge on a clear day.\\r\\nAs of April 2016[update], each eastbound passenger vehicle that drives under a gantry is charged a toll of $4.75 via E-ZPass, $5.00 by mail, or $3.00 if on the Commuter Plan (which charges a minimum of $60 a month, requiring a minimum of 13 crossings to attain an average cost below the normal E-Z pass rate).[6][2] Westbound crossings are toll-free.[7] As of January 2017, the E-ZPass discount only applies to New York issued E-ZPasses. Customers using E-ZPass accounts issued by other states are charged the full cash rate of $5.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the increasing demands for commuter travel taxing the existing bridges and tunnels, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had plans in 1950 to construct a bridge across the Hudson near Dobbs Ferry, New York. The proposal was overridden by New York State Governor Thomas E. Dewey, who wanted to construct a bridge to connect the New York State Thruway across Westchester to the New England Thruway. The Port Authority promised its bondholders that it would not allow any other entity to construct a river crossing within its jurisdiction, which reached to a point one mile (1.6?km) south of Nyack on the western shore of the Hudson River and across to Tarrytown[9] on the eastern shore. The bridge was built on a very tight budget of $81 million (1950 dollars), or $796 million in 2014 dollars.[10]\\r\\nA May 10, 1950 editorial in The New York Times suggested that a site in southern Dobbs Ferry or northern Hastings-on-Hudson, where the Hudson narrowed considerably from its three-mile (5?km) width at Tappan Zee, would be a more appropriate site, and suggested that Governor Dewey work with his counterpart, Governor of New Jersey Alfred E. Driscoll, to craft a compromise that would offer Thruway customers a discounted bridge fare at a more southerly crossing.[11] Two days later, Governor Dewey announced that the Port Authority had dropped its plans to construct a bridge of its own, and that the bridge's location would be close to the Tarrytown-Nyack line, just outside the Port Authority's jurisdiction. Dewey stated that World War II military technology would be used in the bridge's construction.[12]\\r\\nThe site of the bridge, at the Hudson River's second-widest point, added to construction costs. The site was chosen to be as close as possible to New York City, while staying out of the 25-mile (40?km) range of the Port Authority's influence, thus ensuring that revenue from collected tolls would go to the newly created New York State Thruway Authority, and not the Port Authority.[13][14][15] A unique aspect of the design of the bridge is that the main span is supported by eight hollow concrete caissons. Their buoyancy supports some of the loads and helps reduce costs.[16]\\r\\nThe bridge was designed by Emil Praeger of the Madigan-Hyland engineering firm. Captain Praeger helped develop floating caissons during World War II when the Allied forces needed to create and protect portable harbors for the 1944 invasion of Normandy.[17]\\r\\nConstruction started in March 1952 and the bridge opened to traffic on December 15, 1955, along with a 27-mile (43?km) long section of the New York State Thruway from Suffern to Yonkers.[18][19] New York State Governor W. Averell Harriman signed a bill on February 28, 1956, to officially name the structure the Tappan Zee Bridge.[20] In 1994, the name of Malcolm Wilson was added to the bridge's name upon the 20th?anniversary of his leaving the governor's office in December 1974, though it is almost never used when the bridge is spoken about colloquially.[21]\\r\\nThe bridge is expected to be decommissioned in October 2017.[22]\\r\\nThe deteriorating current structure bears an average of 138,000 vehicles per day, substantially more traffic than its designed capacity. Unlike other major bridges in metropolitan New York, the Tappan Zee was designed to last only 50 years due to material shortages during the Korean War at the time of its construction.[23] The new bridge is intended to last at least 100 years.[24]\\r\\nThe collapse of Minnesota's I-35W Mississippi River bridge in 2007 raised worries about the Tappan Zee's structural integrity.[25] These concerns, together with traffic overcapacity and increased maintenance costs, escalated the serious discussions already ongoing about replacing the Tappan Zee with a tunnel or a new bridge.[26][27] Six options were identified and submitted for project study and environmental review.[28]\\r\\nIn 2009, the Tappan Zee Bridge was featured on The History Channel \\"The Crumbling of America\\" showing the infrastructure crisis in the United States.[29] Many factors contribute to the precarious infrastructure of the bridge, which has been called \\"one of the most decrepit and potentially dangerous bridges\\" in the U.S.[30] Engineering assessments have determined that \\"everything from steel corrosion to earthquakes to maritime accidents could cause major, perhaps catastrophic, damage to the span,\\" prompting one of the top aides in the New York state governor's office to refer to the Tappan Zee as the hold-your-breath bridge.[30] A 2009 state report noted that the bridge was not built with a plan that was \\"conducive to long-term durability and that the Tappan Zees engineers designed it to be nonredundant, meaning that one \\"critical fracture could make the bridge fail completely because its supports couldnt transfer the structures load to other supports.\\"[31]\\r\\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) studied the feasibility of either including a rail line across the new bridge or building the new bridge so a new rail line can be installed at a future date. Commuter rail service west of the bridge in Rockland County is limited, and the MTA studied expansion possibilities in Rockland County that would use the new bridge to connect with Metro-North's Hudson Line on the east side of the bridge along the Hudson River for direct service into Manhattan. On September 26, 2008, New York state officials announced their plan to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge with a new bridge that included commuter-train tracks and lanes for high-speed buses. The bridge was estimated to cost $6.4 billion, while adding bus lanes from Suffern to Port Chester was estimated to cost an additional $2.9 billion. Adding a rail line from the Suffern Metro-North station and across the bridge, connecting with Metro-Norths Hudson Line south of Tarrytown, would have added another $6.7 billion. The plan was reviewed for its environmental impacts.[32]\\r\\nIn 2013, the New York State Thruway Authority began building the new Tappan Zee Bridge to the north of the old bridge, which will be a double-span bridge (four lanes per span in opposite directions) with designated bus lanes.[33] Construction began as scheduled during 2013, with completion targeted for 2017.[34]\\r\\nThe northbound/westbound span opened on August 25, 2017.[35][36] Southbound/eastbound traffic will remain on the old span until fall 2017, when it will be shifted to its respective span.[37] After some delays, the project is currently expected to be completed by June 15, 2018[38] at a cost of $3.98 billion.[39]\\r\\nFrom 1998 to 2008, more than 25 people committed suicide on the Tappan Zee Bridge, according to the New York State Thruway Authority.[40] On August 31, 2007, NYSTA officials added four phones?ÿ two each on the Rockland and Westchester sides?ÿ that connect callers via the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline crisis hotline to counselors at LifeNet or Covenant House.[41] Signs reading \\"Life is Worth Living\\" and \\"When it seems like there is no hope, there is help\\" have been placed on the bridge.[42] Suicide fencing and traffic cameras have also been installed along the bridge, and bridge staff have been trained in suicide prevention.[43] On October 14, 2012, Newsday reported that the Tappan Zee Bridge was called the Golden Gate Bridge of the East, and \\"The new Tappan Zee, which is in the works, will include fencing designed to thwart jumpers.\\"[44]\\r\\nThe most famous and notorious suicides on the Tappan Zee Bridge are those of Scott Douglas on January 1, 1994, after murdering his wife, Anne Scripps; and on September 24, 2009, of his stepdaughter Annie Morrell Petrillo, who jumped from that same bridge to her death.[45] A US military employee jumped from the bridge to her death in 2010.[46]","input":"Who is the tappan zee bridge named after?"},{"output":"Jawaharlal Nehru","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nExecutive:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n Legislature:\\r\\n\\r\\nJudiciary:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nPolitical parties\\r\\n\\r\\nNational coalitions:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nState governments\\r\\n\\r\\nLegislatures:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLocal governments:\\r\\nRural bodies:\\r\\n\\r\\nUrban bodies:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prime Minister of India is the leader of the executive of the Government of India.

A prime minister is expected to work with other central ministers to ensure the passage of bills by the parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1947, there have been 14 different prime ministers.[a] The first few decades after 1947 saw the Indian National Congress' (INC) almost complete domination over the political map of India. India's first prime minister  Jawaharlal Nehru  took oath on 15 August 1947. Nehru went on to serve as prime minister for 17 consecutive years, winning four general elections in the process. His tenure ended in May 1964, on his death.[2][3] After the death of Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri  a former home minister and a leader of the Congress party  ascended to the position of prime minister. Shastri's tenure saw the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Shashtri subsequently died of a reported heart attack in Tashkent, after signing the Tashkent Declaration.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Shastri, Indira Gandhi  Nehru's daughter  was elected as the country's first woman prime minister. Indira's first term in office lasted 11 years, in which she took steps such as nationalization of banks;[5] end of allowances and political posts, which were received by members of the royal families of the erstwhile princely states of British India.[6] In addition, events such as the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971;[7] the establishment of a sovereign Bangladesh;[8] accession of Sikkim to India, through a referendum in 1975;[9] and India's first nuclear test in Pokhran occurred during Indira's first term. In 1975, President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed  on Indira's advice  imposed a state of emergency, therefore, bestowing the government with the power to rule by decree, the period is known for human right violations.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter widespread protests, the emergency was lifted in 1977, and a general election was to be held. All of the political parties of the opposition  after the conclusion of the emergency  fought together against the Congress, under the umbrella of the Janata Party, in the general election of 1977, and were successful in defeating the Congress. Subsequently, Morarji Desai  a former deputy prime minister  became the first non-Congress prime minister of the country. The government of Prime Minister Desai was composed of groups with opposite ideologies, in which unity and coordination were difficult to maintain. Ultimately, after two and a half years as PM; on 28 July 1979, Morarji tendered his resignation to the president; and his government fell. Thereafter, Charan Singh  a deputy prime minister in Desai's cabinet  with outside, conditional support from Congress, proved a majority in Lok Sabha and took oath as prime minister.[12][13] However, Congress pulled its support shortly after, and Charan Singh had to resign; he had a tenure of 5 months, the shortest in the history of the office.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1980, after a three-year absence, the Congress returned to power with an absolute majority. Indira Gandhi was elected prime minister a second time.[14] During her second tenure, Operation Blue Star  an Indian Army operation inside the Golden Temple, the most sacred site in Sikhism  was conducted, resulting in reportedly thousands of deaths.[15] Subsequently, on 31 October 1984, Indira was shot dead by Satwant Singh and Beant Singh  two of her bodyguards  in the garden of her residence at 1, Safdarjung Road, New Delhi.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Indira, the Rajiv Gandhi  her eldest son and 40 years old at the time  was sworn in on the evening of 31 October 1984, becoming the youngest person ever to hold the office of prime minister. Rajiv immediately called for a general election. In the subsequent general election, the Congress secured an absolute majority, winning 401 of 552 seats in the Lok Sabha, the maximum number received by any party in the history of India.[17][18] Vishwanath Pratap Singh  first finance minister and then later defence minister in Rajiv's cabinet  uncovered irregularities, in what became to be known as the Bofors scandal, during his stint at the Ministry of Defence; V.

Singh was subsequently expelled from Congress and formed the Janata Dal and  with the help of several anti-Congress parties  also formed the National Front, a coalition of many political parties.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the general election of 1989, the National Front  with outside support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Left Front  came to power.[20] V. P. Singh was elected prime minister.[20] During a tenure of less than a year, V. P. Singh and his government accepted the Mandal Commission's recommendations.[21] V. P. Singh's tenure came to an end after he ordered the arrest of BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani,[22] as a result, BJP withdrew its outside support to the government, V. P. Singh lost the subsequent vote-of-no-confidence 146-320 and had to resign.[23] After V. P. Singh's resignation, Chandra Shekhar  home minister in V. P. Singh's cabinet  along with 64 members of parliament (MPs) floated the Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya) (SJP(R)),[24] and proved a majority in the Lok Sabha with support from Congress.[25] But his premiership did not last long, Congress proceeded to withdraw its support; Chandra Shekhar's government fell as a result, and new elections were announced.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the general election of 1991, Congress  under the leadership of P. V. Narasimha Rao  formed a minority government; Rao became the first PM of South Indian origin.[27] After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, India was on the brink of bankruptcy, so, Rao took steps to liberalise the economy, and appointed Manmohan Singh  an economist and a former governor of the Reserve Bank of India  as finance minister.[27] Rao and Manmohan then took various steps to liberalise the economy,[27] these resulted in an unprecedented economic growth in India.[28] His premiership, however, was also a witness to the demolition of the Babri Masjid, which resulted in the death of about 2,000 people.[29] Rao, however, did complete five continuous years in office, becoming the first prime minister outside of the NehruGandhi family to do so.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the end of Rao's tenure in May 1996, the nation saw four prime ministers in a span of three years, viz., two tenures of Atal Bihari Vajpayee; one tenure of H. D. Deve Gowda from 1 June 1996 to 21 April 1997; and one tenure of I. K. Gujral from 21 April 1997 to 19 March 1998. The government of Prime Minister Vajpayee  elected in 1998  took some concrete steps. In May 1998  after a month in power  the government announced the conduct of five underground nuclear explosions in Pokhran.[30] In response to these tests, many western countries, including the United States, imposed economic sanctions on India,[31] but, due to the support received from Russia, France, the Gulf countries and some other nations, the sanctions  were largely  not considered successful.[32][33] A few months later in response to the Indian nuclear tests, Pakistan also conducted nuclear tests.[34] Given the deteriorating situation between the two countries, the governments tried to improve bilateral relations. In February 1999, the India and Pakistan signed the Lahore Declaration, in which the two countries announced their intention to annul mutual enmity, increase trade and use their nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes.[35] In May 1999, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) withdrew from the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition;[36] Vajpayee's government  hence  became a caretaker one after losing a motion-of-no-confidence 269-270, this coincided with the Kargil War with Pakistan.[37] In the subsequent October 1999 election, the BJP-led NDA and its affiliated parties secured a comfortable majority in the Lok Sabha, winning 299 of 543 seats in the lower house.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nVajpayee continued the process of economic liberalization during his reign, resulting in economic growth.[39] In addition to the development of infrastructure and basic facilities, the government took several steps to improve the infrastructure of the country, such as, the National Highways Development Project (NHDP) and the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY; IAST: Pradhnama?trؐ Grma Sa?a?ka Yojan; lit. Prime Minister Rural Road Scheme),[40] for the development of roads. But during his reign, the 2002 Gujarat communal riots in the state of Gujarat took place; resulting in the death of about 2,000 deaths.[41] Prime Minister Vajpayee's tenure as prime minister came to an end in May 2004, making him the first non-Congress PM to complete a full five-year tenure.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2004 election, the Congress emerged as the largest party in a hung parliament; Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA)  with outside support from the Left Front, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) among others  proved a majority in the Lok Sabha,[42] and Manmohan Singh was elected prime minister; becoming the first Sikh prime minister of the nation.[42] During his tenure, the country retained the economic momentum gained during Prime Minister Vajpayee's tenure.[43] Apart from this, the government succeeded in getting the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, and the Right to Information Act, 2005 passed in the parliament.[44][45] Further, the government strengthened India's relations with nations like Afghanistan;[46][47] Russia;[48] and the United States, culminating with the ratification of IndiaÿUnited States Civil Nuclear Agreement near the end of Manmohan's first term.[49][50][51] At the same time, the November 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks also happened during Manmohan's first term in office.[52][53] In the general election of 2009, the mandate of UPA increased.[54][55] Prime Minister Manmohan's second term, however, was surrounded by accusations of high-level scandals and corruption.[56][57] Manmohan resigned as prime minister on 17 May 2014, after Congress' defeat in the 2014 general election.[58][59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the general election of 2014, the BJP-led NDA got an absolute majority, winning 336 out of 543 Lok Sabha seats; the BJP itself became the first party since 1984 to get a majority in the Lok Sabha. Narendra Modi  the Chief Minister of Gujarat  was elected prime minister; becoming the first prime minister to have been born in an independent India.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution envisions a scheme of affairs in which the President of India is the head of state; in terms of Article 53 with office of the prime minister being the head of Council of Ministers to assist and advise the president in the discharge of his/her constitutional functions. To quote, Article 53, 74 and 75 provide as under;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe executive powers of the Union shall be vested in the president and shall be exercised either directly or through subordinate officers, in accordance with the Constitution.\\r\\nThere shall be a Council of Ministers with the prime minister at the head to aid and advise the president who shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice.\\r\\nThe Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President and the other Ministers shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.\\r\\nLike most parliamentary democracies, the president's duties are mostly ceremonial as long as the constitution and the rule of law is obeyed by the cabinet and the legislature. The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and has the responsibility for executive power. The president's constitutional duty is to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law per article 60. In the constitution of India, the prime minister is mentioned in only four of its articles (articles 74, 75, 78 and 366), however he/she plays a crucial role in the Government of India by enjoying majority in the Lok Sabha.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Article 84 of the Constitution of India, which sets the principle qualification for member of Parliament, and Article 75 of the Constitution of India, which sets the qualifications for the minister in the Union Council of Minister, and the argument that the position of prime minister has been described as primus inter pares (the first among equals),[62] A prime minister must:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf however a candidate is elected as the prime minister they must vacate their post from any private or government company and may take up the post only on completion of their term.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prime minister is required to make and subscribe in the presence of President of India before entering office, the oath of office and secrecy, as per the Third Schedule of the Constitution of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nOath of office:\\r\\n\\r\\nI, <name>, do swear in the name of God/solemnly affirm that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, that I will faithfully and conscientiously discharge my duties as prime minister for the Union and that I will do right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.\\r\\nOath of secrecy:\\r\\n\\r\\nI, <name>, do swear in the name of God/solemnly affirm that I will not directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person or persons any matter which shall be brought under my consideration or shall become known to me as prime minister for the Union except as may be required for the due discharge of my duties as such Minister.\\r\\nThe prime minister serves on 'the pleasure of the president', hence, a prime minister may remain in office indefinitely, so long as the president has confidence in him/her. However, a prime minister must have the confidence of Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the term of a prime minister can end before the end of a Lok Sabha's term, if a simple majority of its members no longer have confidence in him/her, this is called a vote-of-no-confidence.[63] Three prime ministers, I. K. Gujral ,[23] H. D. Deve Gowda and Atal Bihari Vajpayee have been voted out from office this way. In addition, a prime minister can also resign from office; Morarji Desai was the first prime minister to resign while in office.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon ceasing to possess the requisite qualifications to be a member of Parliament subject to the Representation of the People Act, 1951.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prime minister leads the functioning and exercise of authority of the Government of India. The President of India  subject to eligibility  invites a person who is commanding support of majority members of Lok Sabha to form the Government of India  also known as the central government or Union government  at the national level and exercise its powers.[65] In practice the prime minister nominates the members of their council of ministers to the president.[66][67][68] They also work upon to decide a core group of ministers (known as the cabinet),[66] as in charge of the important functions and ministries of the Government of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prime minister is responsible for aiding and advising the president in distribution of work of the government to various ministries and offices and in terms of the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961.[69] The coordinating work is generally allocated to the Cabinet Secretariat.[70] While the work of the government is generally divided into various Ministries, the prime minister may retain certain portfolios if they are not allocated to any member of the cabinet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prime minister  in consultation with the cabinet  schedules and attends the sessions of the houses of parliament and is required to answer the question from the Members of Parliament to them as the in-charge of the portfolios in the capacity as Prime Minister of India.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome specific ministries/department are not allocated to anyone in the cabinet but the prime minister themself. The prime minister is usually always in charge/head of:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prime minister represents the country in various delegations, high level meetings and international organisations that require the attendance of the highest government office,[72] and also addresses to the nation on various issues of national or other importance.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nPer Article 78 of the constitution, the official communication between the union cabinet and the president are through the prime minister. Other wise constitution recognises the prime minister as a member of the union cabinet only outside the sphere of union cabinet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prime minister recommends to the president  among others  names for the appointment of:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the chairperson of Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), the prime minister  on the non-binding advice of the Cabinet Secretary of India led-Senior Selection Board (SSB)  decides the postings of top civil servants, such as, secretaries, additional secretaries and joint secretaries in the Government of India.[74][75][76] Further, in the same capacity, the PM decides the assignments of top military personnel such as the Chief of the Army Staff, Chief of the Air Staff, Chief of the Naval Staff and commanders of operational and training commands.[77] In addition, the ACC also decides the posting of Indian Police Service officers  the All India Service for policing, which staffs most of the higher level law enforcement positions at federal and state level  in the Government of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, as the Minister of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, the PM also exercises control over the Indian Administrative Service (IAS),[78] the country's premier civil service,[79][80] which staffs most of the senior civil service positions;[79][80] the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB);[81][82] and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI),[81][82] except for the selection of its director, who is chosen by a committee of: (a) the prime minister, as chairperson; (b) the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha; (c) and the chief justice.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike most other countries, the prime minister does not have much influence over the selection of judges, that is done by a collegium of judges consisting of the Chief Justice of India, four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court of India and the chief justice  or the senior-most judge  of the concerned state high court.[84][85] The executive as a whole, however, has the right to send back a recommended name to the collegium for reconsideration,[86] this, however, is not a full veto power, and the collegium can still put forward rejected name.[87][88]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prime minister acts as the leader of the house of the chamber of parliament  generally the Lok Sabha  he/she belongs to. In this role, the prime minister is tasked with representing the executive in the legislature, he/she is also expected to announce important legislation, and is further expected to respond to the opposition's concerns.[89] Article 85 of the Indian constitution confers the president with the power to convene and end extraordinary sessions of the parliament, this power, however, is exercised only on the advise of prime minister and his/her council, so, in practice, the prime minister does exercise some control over affairs of the parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle 75 of the Constitution of India confers the parliament with the power to decide the remuneration and other benefits of the prime minister and other ministers are to be decided by the Parliament.[90] and is renewed from time to time. The original remuneration for prime minister and other ministers were specified in the Part B of the second schedule of the constitution, which was later removed by an amendment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the prime minister's office reported that he/she does not receive a formal salary, but was only entitled to monthly allowances.[91] That same year The Economist reported that, on a purchasing power parity basis, the prime minister received an equivalent of $4106 per year. As a percentage of the country's per-capita GDP (Gross Domestic Product), this is the lowest of all countries The Economist surveyed.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 7, Lok Kalyan Marg  previously called the 7, Race Course Road  in New Delhi, serves as the official place of residence for the Prime Minister of India. For ground travel, the prime minister uses a highly modified, armoured version of a Range Rover,[93] while for air travel, Boeing 777-300ERs  designated by the call sign Air India One (AI-1 or AIC001), and maintained by the Indian Air Force  are used.[94][95] The Special Protection Group (SPG) is charged with protecting the sitting prime minister and his/her family.[96][97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prime Minister's Office (PMO) acts as the principal workplace of the prime minister. The office is located at South Block, and is a 20-room complex, and has the Cabinet Secretariat, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of External Affairs adjacent to it. The office is headed by the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, generally a former civil servant either from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) or the Indian Foreign Service (IFS).\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer prime ministers are entitled to a bungalow,[98][99] former prime ministers are also entitled the same facilities as those given to a serving cabinet minister,[98] this includes a fourteen-member secretarial staff, for a period of five years; reimbursement of office expenses; six domestic executive-class air tickets each year and; and security cover from the Special Protection Group.[98][99] In addition, former prime ministers rank seventh on the Indian order of precedence, equivalent to chief ministers of states (within their respective states) and cabinet ministers[100][101][102] As a former member of the parliament, the prime minister receives a minimum pension of ?20,000 (US$300) per month, plus  if he/she served as an MP for more than five years  ?15,000 (US$220) for every year served.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prime minister acts as the presides over various funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Defence Fund (NDF) was set up the Indian government in 1962, in the aftermath of 1962 Sino-Indian War. The prime minister acts as chairperson of the fund's executive committee, while, the ministers of defence, finance and home act as the members of the executive committee, the finance minister also acts the treasurer of the committee. The secretary of the fund's executive committee is a joint secretary in the Prime Minister's Office, dealing with the subject of NDF.[103] The fund  according to its website  is entirely dependent on voluntary contributions from the public and does not get any budgetary support.. Donations to the fund are 100% tax-deductible under section 80G of the Income Tax Act, 1961.[104][105]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prime Minister's National Relief Fund (PMNRF) was set up by the first Prime Minister of India  Jawaharlal Nehru  in 1948, to assist displaced people from Pakistan. The fund, now, is primarily used to assist the families of those who are killed during natural disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones and flood and secondarily to reimburse medical expenses of people with chronic and deadly diseases.[106] Donations to the PMNRF are 100% tax-deductible under section 80G of the Income Tax Act, 1961.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe post of Deputy Prime Minister of India is not technically a constitutional post, nor is there any mention of it in an Act of the parliament.[107] But historically, on various occasions, different governments have assigned one of their senior ministers as the 'deputy prime minister'. There is neither constitutional requirement for filling the post of deputy PM, nor does the post provide any kind of special powers.[107] Typically, senior cabinet ministers like the finance minister or the home minister are appointed as deputy prime minister. The post is considered to be the senior most in the cabinet after the prime minister and represents the government in his/her absence. Generally, deputy prime ministers have been appointed to strengthen the coalition governments. The first holder of this post was Vallabhbhai Patel, who was also the home minister in Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet.","input":"Who was the first prime minester of india?"},{"output":"an intern at New York's Uptown Records","context":"Sean John Combs (born November 4, 1969),[5] also known by his stage names Puff Daddy, Puffy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, actor, record producer, and entrepreneur. He was born in Harlem and was raised in Mount Vernon, New York. He worked as a talent director at Uptown Records before founding his label Bad Boy Entertainment in 1993. His debut album No Way Out (1997) has been certified seven times platinum and was followed by successful albums such as Forever (1999), The Saga Continues... (2001), and Press Play (2006). In 2009 Combs formed the musical group Diddy?ÿ Dirty Money and released the critically well-reviewed and commercially successful album Last Train to Paris (2010).\\r\\nCombs has won three Grammy Awards and two MTV Video Music Awards, and is the producer of MTV's Making the Band. In 2017 Forbes estimated his net worth at $820 million.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSean John Combs was born on November 4, 1969 in Harlem in Manhattan, New York City,[6] and was raised in Mount Vernon, New York.[7] His mother, Janice (Smalls), was a model and teacher's assistant,[6] and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas.[7][8] At age 33, Melvin was shot to death while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was 2 years old.[9]\\r\\nCombs graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy in 1987. He played football for the academy, and his team won a division title in 1986.[10] Combs said that he was given the nickname \\"Puff\\" as a child, because he would \\"huff and puff\\" when he was angry.[11]\\r\\nCombs was a business major at Howard University but left after his sophomore year.[12] In 2014, he returned to Howard University to receive an Honorary Doctorate in Humanities and deliver the Universitys 146th Commencement Address.[13]\\r\\nCombs became an intern at New York's Uptown Records.[14] While talent director at Uptown, he helped develop Jodeci and Mary J. Blige.[15] In his college days Combs had a reputation for throwing parties, some of which attracted up to a thousand participants.[16] In 1991, Combs promoted an AIDS fundraiser with Heavy D held at the City College of New York (CCNY) gymnasium, following a charity basketball game. The event was oversold, and a stampede occurred in which nine people died.[17]\\r\\nIn 1993, after being fired from Uptown, Combs established his new label Bad Boy Entertainment as a joint venture with Arista Records, taking then-newcomer The Notorious B.I.G. with him.[18][19] Both The Notorious B.I.G. and Craig Mack quickly released hit singles, followed by successful LPs, particularly Notorious B.I.G.'s Ready to Die.[18] Combs signed more acts to Bad Boy, including Carl Thomas, Faith Evans, 112, Total,[20] and Father MC.[21] The Hitmen, his in-house production team, worked with Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, Usher, Lil' Kim, TLC, Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men, SWV, Aretha Franklin, and others.[22] Mase and the Lox joined Bad Boy just as a widely publicized rivalry with the West Coast's Death Row Records was beginning. Combs and Notorious B.I.G. were criticized and parodied by Tupac Shakur and Suge Knight in songs and interviews during the mid-1990s.[23] During 1994ÿ1995, Combs produced several songs for TLC's CrazySexyCool, which finished the decade as number 25 on Billboard's list of top pop albums of the decade.[24][25]\\r\\nIn 1997, under the name Puff Daddy, Combs recorded his first commercial vocal work as a rapper. His debut single, \\"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down\\", spent 28 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number one.[26] His debut album, No Way Out, was released on July 1, 1997, through Bad Boy Records. Originally titled Hell up in Harlem, the album underwent several changes after The Notorious B.I.G. was killed on March 9, 1997.[27] Several of the label's artists made guest appearances on the album. No Way Out was a significant success, particularly in the United States, where it reached number one on the Billboard 200 in its first week of release, selling 561,000 copies.[28] The album produced five singles: \\"I'll Be Missing You\\", a tribute to The Notorious B.I.G., was the first rap song to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100; it remained at the top of the chart for eleven consecutive weeks and topped several other charts worldwide.[29] Four other singles; \\"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down\\", \\"It's All About the Benjamins\\", \\"Been Around the World\\", and \\"Victory\\", were also released. Combs collaborated with Jimmy Page on the song \\"Come with Me\\" for the 1998 film Godzilla.[30]\\r\\nThe album earned Combs five nominations at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998, winning the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.[31][32] On September 7, 2000, the album was certified septuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over 7 million copies.[33] In 1997, Combs was sued for landlord neglect by Inge Bongo. Combs denied the charges.[34] By the late 1990s, he was being criticized for watering down and overly commercializing hip hop, and for using too many guest appearances, samples, and interpolations of past hits in his new songs.[28]\\r\\nIn April 1999 Combs was charged with assault as a result of an incident with Steve Stoute of Interscope Records. Stoute was the manager for Nas, with whom Combs had filmed a video earlier that year for the song \\"Hate Me Now\\". Combs was concerned that the video, which featured a shot of Nas and Combs being crucified, was blasphemous. He asked for his scenes on the cross to be pulled, but after it aired unedited on MTV on April 15, Combs visited Stoute's offices and injured Stoute. Combs was charged with second-degree assault and criminal mischief,[35][36] and was sentenced to attend a one-day anger management class.[37]\\r\\nForever, Combs' debut solo studio album, was released by Bad Boy Records on August 24, 1999, in North America, and in the UK on the following day. It reached number two on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart,[38] where it remained for one week before being knocked off by Mary J. Blige's fourth album, Mary. The album received positive to mixed reviews from music critics and spawned three singles that have charted on the Billboard charts. It peaked at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart, Combs' highest-charting album in that country.[38]\\r\\nOn December 27, 1999, Combs and his then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez were at Club New York in Manhattan when gunfire broke out. After a police investigation, Combs and fellow rapper Shyne were arrested for weapons violations and other charges.[39] Combs was charged with four weapons-related charges and bribing his driver, Wardel Fenderson, to claim ownership of his gun.[40]\\r\\nWith a gag order in place, the highly publicized trial began.[40] Combs' attorneys were Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and Benjamin Brafman.[41] Combs was found not guilty on all charges; Shyne was convicted on five of his eight charges[41] and sentenced to ten years in prison. Combs and Lopez broke up shortly after. A lawsuit filed by Fenderson, who said he suffered emotional damage after the shooting, was settled in February 2004. Lawyers for both sides, having agreed to keep the settlement terms secret, said that the matter was \\"resolved to the satisfaction of all parties\\".[42]\\r\\nCombs changed his stage name from \\"Puff Daddy\\" to \\"P.?Diddy\\" in 2001.[43] The gospel album, Thank You, which had been completed just before the beginning of the weapons trial, was released that March.[44] He appeared as a drug dealer in the film Made and starred with Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton in Monster's Ball (both in 2001). He was arrested for driving on a suspended license in Florida.[45] Combs began working with a series of unusual (for him) artists. For a short period of time, he was the manager of Kelis; they have a collaboration titled \\"Let's Get Ill\\".[46] He was an opening act for 'N Sync on their Spring 2002 Celebrity Tour,[47] and he signed California-based pop girl group Dream to his record label.[48] Combs was a producer of the soundtrack album for the film Training Day (2001).[49]\\r\\nIn June 2001, Combs ended Bad Boy Entertainment's joint venture with Arista Records, gaining full control of Bad Boy, its catalogue, and its roster of artists.[19] The Saga Continues..., released on July 10 in North America, was the last studio album released by the joint venture. The album reached number 2 on the Billboard 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts,[50] and was eventually certified Platinum.[20] It is the only studio album under the P. Diddy name, and the first album by Sean Combs not to feature any guest appearances by Jay-Z or Lil Kim. Combs was executive producer of the reality TV show Making the Band, which appeared on MTV from 2002 to 2009.[51] The show involved interviewing candidates and creating musical acts that would then enter the music business. Acts that got their start this way include Da Band,[52] Danity Kane,[51] Day26,[53] and Donnie Klang.[54]\\r\\nIn 2003 Combs ran in the New York City Marathon, raising $2?million for the educational system of the city of New York.[55] On March 10, 2004 he appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss the marathon, which he finished in four hours and eighteen minutes.[56] In 2004 Combs headed the campaign \\"Vote or Die\\" for the 2004 presidential election.[57] On February 1, 2004, Combs (as P. Diddy) performed at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.[58]\\r\\nOn August 16, 2005, Combs announced on Today that he was altering his stage name yet again; he would be calling himself \\"Diddy\\". Combs said that fans didn't know how to address him, which led to confusion.[59] In November 2005, London-based musical artist and DJ Richard Dearlove, who had been performing under the name \\"Diddy\\" since 1992?ÿ nine years before Combs started using even \\"P. Diddy\\"?ÿ sought an injunction in the High Court of Justice in London. He accepted an out-of-court settlement of S10,000 in damages and more than S100,000 in costs. Combs can no longer use the name Diddy in the UK, where he is still known as P. Diddy.[60][61] An assault charge against Combs filed by Michigan television host Rogelio Mills was resolved in Combs' favor in 2005.[62]\\r\\nCombs starred in the 2005 film Carlito's Way: Rise to Power. He played Walter Lee Younger in the 2004 Broadway revival of A Raisin in the Sun[63] and the television adaptation that aired in February 2008. In 2005 Combs sold half of his record company to the Warner Music Group.[64] He hosted the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards and was named one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2005 by Time magazine.[65] He was mentioned in the country song \\"Play Something Country\\" by Brooks & Dunn: the lyricist says he \\"didn't come to hear P.

The lyrics imply that Combs knew the identity of The Notorious B.I.G.'s murderer.[67] The two later resolved the feud.[68]\\r\\nCombs released his first album in four years, Press Play, on October 17, 2006, on the Bad Boy Records label.[69] The album, featuring guest appearances by many popular artists, debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart[70] with sales of over 173,009. Its singles \\"Come to Me\\" and \\"Last Night\\" both reached the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100.[71][72] The album became available to preview on MTV's The Leak on October 10, 2006, a week before being sold in stores.[73] Press Play received mixed to positive reviews from critics,[74] and was certified Gold on the RIAA ratings.[20] On September 18, 2007, Combs teamed up with 50 Cent and Jay-Z for the \\"Forbes I Get Money Billion Dollar Remix\\".[75]\\r\\nIn March 2008 the Los Angeles Times claimed that The Notorious B.I.G. and Combs orchestrated the 1994 robbery and shooting of Tupac, substantiating the claim with supposed FBI documents; the newspaper later retracted the story, acknowledging that the documents had been fabricated.[76] Dexter Isaac, an associate of record management executive Jimmy Henchman, confessed in 2012 that he shot Tupac on Henchman's orders.[77][78]\\r\\nIn June 2008 Combs' representative denied rumors of another name change.[79] Combs ventured into reality television in August 2008 with the premiere of his VH1 series I Want to Work for Diddy.[80] After the season finale of Making The Band 4, Combs said he would be heading back into the studio to record his next album. In an interview with The Daily Mail, he said, \\"I had Christina Aguilera on my last album, but it's all about Leona Lewis on my next.\\"[81] He appearedcredited under his real namein two episodes of Season 7 of CSI: Miami: \\"Presumed Guilty\\" and \\"Sink or Swim\\", in the role of lawyer Derek Powell.[82]\\r\\nCombs created a rap supergroup in 2010 known as the Dream Team. The group consists of Combs, Rick Ross, DJ Khaled, Fat Joe, Busta Rhymes, Red Caf, and Fabolous.[83] Combs made an appearance at comedian Chris Gethard's live show in January 2010 at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City.[84] In June 2010 Combs played a role (credited as Sean Combs) in the comedy film Get Him to the Greek, as Sergio Roma, a record company executive. An Entourage series representative announced that Combs would guest star on an episode during the 2010 season.[85]\\r\\nLast Train to Paris was released by Combs' group Diddy?ÿ Dirty Money on December 13, 2010. The release was preceded by four singles \\"Angels\\", \\"Hello Good Morning\\", \\"Loving You No More\\", and \\"Coming Home\\", which experienced mixed success on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Coming Home\\" was the most successful of the songs, peaking at number twelve on the U.S. Hot 100, number four in the UK, and number seven in Canada.[86] On March 10, 2011 Diddy?ÿ Dirty Money performed \\"Coming Home\\" live on American Idol.[87]\\r\\nOn April 18, 2011, Combs appeared in season one of Hawaii Five-0, guest starring as an undercover NYPD detective.[88] In November 2012 Combs appeared in an episode of the eighth season of the American sitcom It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.[89]\\r\\nOn February 26, 2014, Combs premiered \\"Big Homie\\", featuring Rick Ross and French Montana, as the first single from his mixtape MMM (Money Making Mitch), which was originally scheduled to be released that year.[90] The song was released for digital download on March 24,[91] and two days later the trailer for the music video was released. The full version of the music video was released on March 31. Combs used his former stage name Puff Daddy for the album.[92] MMM was released as a free mixtape album of 12 tracks on November 4, 2015.[93] In 2014 Combs and Guy Gerber announced that their joint album 11 11 would be available for free download.[94] A new single called \\"Finna Get Loose\\" featuring Combs and Pharrell Williams was released on June 29, 2015.[95]\\r\\nIn July 2015, Bad Boy Entertainment artist Gizzle told the press that she is collaborating with Combs on what she describes as his last album, titled No Way Out 2, a sequel to his 1997 debut. She describes the music as unique: \\"The mindset is to just be classic and to be epic. And to really live up to that?... we know it's a tall order, but we welcome the challenge.\\"[96] In April 2016, Combs announced that after this last album and tour, he plans to retire from the music industry to focus on acting.[97]\\r\\nOn May 20 and 21, 2016, Combs launched a tour of Bad Boy Records' biggest names to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the label.[98] The documentary Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story, covering the two shows at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn as well as behind-the-scenes events, was released on June 23, 2017.[99] The show toured to an additional twenty venues across the United States and Canada.[100][101]\\r\\nFortune magazine listed Combs at number twelve on their top 40 of entrepreneurs under 40 in 2002.[102] Forbes Magazine estimates that for the year ending May 2017, Combs earned $130?million, ranking him number one among entertainers.[2] In 2017 his estimated net worth was $820?million.[3]\\r\\nIn 1998, Combs started a clothing line, Sean John. It was nominated for the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award for Menswear Designer of the Year in 2000,[103] and won in 2004.[104] California billionaire Ronald Burkle invested $100 million into the company in 2003.[105]\\r\\nAlso in 2003, the National Labor Committee revealed that factories producing the clothing in Honduras were violating Honduran labor laws.[106] Among the accusations were that workers were subjected to body searches and involuntary pregnancy tests. Bathrooms were locked and access tightly controlled. Employees were forced to work overtime and were paid sweatshop wages.[107] Charles Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee told The New York Times that \\"Sean Puff Daddy obviously has a lot of clout, he can literally do a lot overnight to help these workers.\\"[106]\\r\\nCombs responded with an extensive investigation, telling reporters \\"I'm as pro-worker as they get\\".[108] On February 14, 2004, Kernaghan announced that improvements had been implemented at the factory, including adding air conditioning and water purification systems, firing the most abusive supervisors, and allowing the formation of a labor union.[109] In late 2006, the department store Macy's removed Sean John jackets from their shelves when they discovered that the clothing was made using raccoon dog fur. Combs had not known the jackets were made with dog fur, but as soon as he was alerted, he had production stopped.[110]\\r\\nIn November 2008, Combs added a men's perfume called \\"I Am King\\" to the Sean John brand. The fragrance, dedicated to Barack Obama, Muhammad Ali, and Martin Luther King, featured model Bar Refaeli in its advertisements.[111] In early 2016, Sean John introduced the brands GIRLS collection.[112]\\r\\nCombs is the head of Combs Enterprises, an umbrella company for his portfolio of businesses.[113] In addition to his clothing line, Combs owned two restaurants called Justin's, named after his son. The original New York location closed in September 2007;[114] the Atlanta location closed in June 2012.[115] He is the designer of the Dallas Mavericks alternate jersey.[116] In October 2007 Combs agreed to help develop the C?roc vodka brand for a 50 percent share of the profits.[111] Combs acquired the Enyce clothing line from Liz Claiborne for $20 million on October 21, 2008.[117] Combs has a major equity stake in Revolt TV, a television network that also has a film production branch.[118] It began broadcasting in 2014.[119][120] In February 2015, Combs teamed up with actor Mark Wahlberg and businessman Ronald Burkle of Yucaipa Companies to purchase a majority holding in Aquahydrate, a calorie-free beverage for athletes.[121][122] John Cochran, former president of Fiji Water, is CEO of the company.[123]\\r\\nCombs is the father of six children. His first child, Justin, was born in 1993 to his high-school sweetheart, designer Misa Hylton-Brim. Justin attends UCLA on a football scholarship.[124] Combs had an on-again, off-again relationship with Kimberly Porter, which lasted from 1994 to July 2007.[125][126] He adopted and raised Quincy (born 1991),[127] Porter's son from a previous relationship with singer/producer Al B. Sure. Together they had a son, Christian (born 1998) and twin daughters D'Lila Star and Jessie James (born December 21, 2006).[128] Five months before the birth of his twins,[128] his daughter Chance was born to Sarah Chapman. He took legal responsibility for Chance in October 2007.[126]\\r\\nCombs' sons Quincy and Justin both appeared on MTV's My Super Sweet 16. Combs threw Quincy a celebrity-studded party and gave him two cars as his 16th birthday present.[129][130] For Justin's sixteenth birthday, Combs presented him with a $360,000 Maybach car, complete with chauffeur.[124][131]\\r\\nCombs owns a home in Alpine, New Jersey, which he purchased for a reported $7?million.[132]\\r\\nCombs founded Daddy's House Social Programs, an organization to help inner city youth, in 1995. Programs include tutoring, life skills classes, and an annual summer camp. Along with Jay-Z, he pledged $1 million to help support victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and donated clothing from his Sean John line to victims. He has donated computers and books to New York schools.[133]\\r\\nChicago Mayor Richard M. Daley named October 13, 2006, as \\"Diddy Day\\" in honor of Combs' charity work.[134] In 2008 Combs was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[135]\\r\\nIn 2014, Combs received an honorary doctorate from Howard University, where he served as the keynote speaker for its 146th commencement ceremony. In his speech, Combs acknowledged that his experiences as a Howard student positively influenced his life.[136]\\r\\nCombs describes his wardrobe style as \\"swagger, timeless, diverse\\".[137] On September 2, 2007, Combs held his ninth annual \\"White Party\\", at which guests are limited to an all-white dress code. The White Party, which has also been held in St. Tropez, was held in his home in East Hampton, Long Island. Combs stated, \\"This party is up there with the top three that I've thrown. It's a party that has legendary status. It's hard to throw a party that lives up to its legend.\\"[138]","input":"How did p diddy began his career in the music industry?"},{"output":"Woodrow Wilson","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of the Panama canal dates back to 1513, when Vasco N~?ez de Balboa first crossed the isthmus. The narrow land bridge between North and South America houses the Panama Canal, a water passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The earliest European colonists recognized this potential, and several proposals for a canal were made.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the late nineteenth century, technological advances and commercial pressure allowed construction to begin in earnest. Noted canal engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps led an initial attempt by France to build a sea-level canal.  Beset by cost overruns due to the severe underestimation of the difficulties in excavating the rugged Panama land, heavy personnel losses in Panama due to tropical diseases, and political corruption in France surrounding the financing of the massive project, the project succeeded in only partially completing the canal. \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest in a U.S.-led canal effort picked up as soon as France abandoned the project.  Initially, the Panama site was politically unfavorable in the U.S. for a variety of reasons, including the taint of the failed French efforts and the Colombian government's unfriendly attitude towards the U.S. continuing the project.  The U.S. first sought to construct a completely new canal through Nicaragua instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench engineer and financier Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla played a key role in changing U.S. attitudes.  Bunau-Varilla had a large stake in the failed French canal company, and stood to make money on his investment only if the Panama Canal was completed.  Extensive lobbying of U.S. lawmakers coupled with his support of a nascent independence movement among the Panamanian people led to a simultaneous revolution in Panama and the negotiation of the HayÿBunau-Varilla Treaty which secured both independence for Panama and the right for the U.S. to lead a renewed effort to construct the canal.  Colombia's response to the Panamanian independence movement was tempered by U.S. military presence; the move is often cited as a classic example of the era of gunboat diplomacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. success hinged on two factors.  First was converting the original French sea-level plan to a more realistic lock-controlled canal.  The second was controlling disease which decimated workers and management alike under the original French attempt.  Initial chief engineer John Frank Stevens built much of the infrastructure necessary for later construction; slow progress on the canal itself led to his replacement by George Washington Goethals.  Goethals oversaw the bulk of the excavation of the canal, including appointing Major David du Bose Gaillard to oversee the most daunting project, the Culebra Cut through the roughest terrain on the route.  Almost as important as the engineering advances was the healthcare advances made during the construction, led by William C. Gorgas, an expert in controlling tropical diseases such as yellow fever and malaria.  Gorgas was one of the first to recognize the role of mosquitoes in the spread of these diseases, and by focusing on controlling the mosquitoes greatly improved worker conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 January 1914 the French crane boat Alexandre La Valley became the first to make the traverse, and on 1 April 1914 the construction was officially completed with the hand-over of the project from the construction company to the Canal Zone government.  The outbreak of World War I caused the cancellation of any official \\"grand opening\\" celebration, and the canal officially opened to commercial traffic on 15 August 1914 with the transit of the SS Ancon.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, the canal proved a vital part of the U.S. military strategy, allowing ships to transfer easily between the Atlantic and Pacific.  Politically, the Canal remained a territory of the United States until 1977, when the TorrijosÿCarter Treaties began the process of transferring territorial control of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama, a process completed on 31 December 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Panama Canal continues to be a viable commercial venture and a vital link in world shipping, and continues to be periodically updated and maintained.  The Panama Canal expansion project started construction in 2007 and began commercial operation on 26 June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger Post-Panamax and New Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the original locks could accommodate.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of a canal across Central America was revived during the early 19th century. In 1819, the Spanish government authorized the construction of a canal and the creation of a company to build it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the project stalled for some time, a number of surveys were made between 1850 and 1875. They indicated that the two most-favorable routes were across Panama (then part of Colombia) and Nicaragua, with a third route across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico another option. The Nicaraguan route was surveyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 1869 completion of the Suez Canal, France thought that an apparently-similar project to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans could be carried out with little difficulty. In 1876 an international company, La Socit internationale du Canal interocanique, was created to undertake its construction; two years later, it obtained a concession from the Colombian government (since Panama was a Colombian province) to dig a canal across the isthmus.\\r\\n\\r\\nFerdinand de Lesseps, who was in charge of the Suez Canal construction, headed the project. His enthusiastic leadership and his reputation as the man who had built the Suez Canal persuaded speculators and ordinary citizens to invest nearly $400?million in the project.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, despite his previous success de Lesseps was not an engineer. The Suez Canal, essentially a ditch dug through a flat, sandy desert, presented few challenges. Although Central America's mountainous spine has a low point in Panama, it is still 110 meters (360.9?ft) above sea level at its lowest crossing point. The sea-level canal proposed by de Lesseps would require a great deal of excavation through a variety of rock, rather than Suez' sand.\\r\\n\\r\\nLess-obvious barriers were the rivers crossing the canal, particularly the Chagres (which flows strongly during the rainy season). Since the water would be a hazard to shipping if it drained into the canal, a sea-level canal would require the river's diversion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most serious problem was tropical disease, particularly malaria and yellow fever, whose methods of transmission were unknown at the time. The legs of hospital beds were placed in cans of water to keep insects from crawling up them, but the stagnant water was an ideal breeding place for mosquitoes (carriers of the diseases).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project was plagued by a lack of engineering expertise. In May 1879, an international engineering congress led by de Lesseps convened in Paris. Of its 136 delegates, only 42 were engineers; the others were speculators, politicians and friends of de Lesseps.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was convinced that a sea-level canal, dug through the mountainous spine of Central America, could be completed at least as easily as the Suez Canal. The engineering congress estimated the project's cost at $214 million; on February 14, 1880, an engineering commission revised the estimate to $168.6 million. De Lesseps reduced this estimate twice, with no apparent justification: on February 20 to $131.6 million and on March 1 to $120 million. The congress estimated seven or eight years as the time required to complete the canal; de Lesseps reduced this estimate to six years (the Suez Canal required ten).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposed sea-level canal would have a uniform depth of 9 meters (29.5?ft), a bottom width of 22 meters (72.2?ft) and a width at water level of about 27.5 meters (90.2?ft); the excavation estimate was 120,000,000?m3 (157,000,000?cu?yd). A dam was proposed at Gamboa to control flooding of the Chagres River, with channels to drain water away from the canal. However, the Gamboa dam was later found impracticable and the Chagres River problem was left unsolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction of the canal began on January 1, 1881, with digging at Culebra beginning on January 22.[1] A large labor force was assembled, numbering about 40,000 in 1888 (nine-tenths of whom were afro-Caribbean workers from the West Indies). Although the project attracted good, well-paid French engineers, retaining them was difficult due to disease. The death toll from 1881 to 1889 was estimated at over 22,000, of whom as many as 5,000 were French citizens.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1885 it had become clear to many that a sea-level canal was impractical, and an elevated canal with locks was preferable; de Lesseps resisted, and a lock canal plan was not adopted until October 1887. By this time increasing mortality rates, as well as financial and engineering problems coupled with frequent floods and mudslides, indicated that the project was in serious trouble. Work continued under the new plan until May 15, 1889, when the company went bankrupt and the project was suspended. After eight years the canal was about two-fifths completed, and about $234.8 million had been spent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company's collapse was a scandal in France, and the antisemitic Edouard Drumont exploited the role of two Jewish speculators in the affair. One hundred and four legislators were found to have been involved in the corruption, and Jean Jaurs was commissioned by the French parliament to conduct an inquiry which was completed in 1893.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt soon became clear that the only way to recoup expenses for the stockholders was to continue the project. A new concession was obtained from Colombia, and in 1894 the Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama was created to finish the canal. To comply with the terms of the contract, work began immediately on the Culebra excavation while a team of engineers began a comprehensive study of the project. They eventually settled on a plan for a two-level, lock-based canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new effort never gained traction, mainly because of US speculation that a canal through Nicaragua would render one through Panama useless. The most men employed on the new project was 3,600 (in 1896), primarily to comply with the terms of the concession and to maintain the existing excavation and equipment in saleable condition. The company had already begun looking for a buyer, with an asking price of $109 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the US, a congressional Isthmian Canal Commission was established in 1899 to examine possibilities for a Central American canal and recommend a route. In November 1901, the commission reported that a US canal should be built through Nicaragua unless the French were willing to sell their holdings for $40 million. The recommendation became law on June 28, 1902, and the New Panama Canal Company was compelled to sell at that price.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the French effort was, to a large extent, doomed to failure from the beginning due to disease and a lack of understanding of the engineering difficulties, it was not entirely futile. The old and new companies excavated 59,747,638?m3 (78,146,960?cu?yd) of material, of which 14,255,890?m3 (18,646,000?cu?yd) was taken from the Culebra Cut. The old company dredged a channel from Panama Bay to the port at Balboa, and the channel dredged on the Atlantic side (known as the French canal) was useful for bringing in sand and stone for the locks and spillway concrete at Gat~n.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetailed surveys and studies (particularly those carried out by the new canal company) and machinery, including railroad equipment and vehicles, aided the later American effort. The French lowered the summit of the Culebra Cut along the canal route by five meters (17?ft), from 64 to 59 metres (210 to 194?ft). An estimated 22,713,396?m3 (29,708,000?cu?yd) of excavation, valued at about $25.4 million, and equipment and surveys valued at about $17.4 million were usable by the Americans.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1848 discovery of gold in California and the rush of would-be miners stimulated US interest in building a canal between the oceans. In 1887, a United States Army Corps of Engineers regiment surveyed canal possibilities in Nicaragua. Two years later, the Maritime Canal Company was asked to begin a canal in the area and chose Nicaragua. The company lost money in the panic of 1893, and its work in Nicaragua ceased. In 1897 and 1899, the United States Congress charged a canal commission with researching possible construction; Nicaragua was chosen as the location both times.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Nicaraguan canal proposal was made redundant by the American takeover of the French Panama Canal project, increases in shipping volume and ship sizes have revived interest in the project. A canal across Nicaragua accommodating post-Panamax ships or a rail link carrying containers between ports on either coast have been proposed.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheodore Roosevelt believed that a US-controlled canal across Central America was a vital strategic interest of the country. This idea gained wide circulation after the destruction of the USS Maine in Cuba on February 15, 1898. Reversing a Walker Commission decision in favor of a Nicaraguan canal, Roosevelt encouraged the acquisition of the French Panama Canal effort. George S. Morison was the only commission member who argued for the Panama location. The purchase of the French-held land for $40?million was authorized by the June 28, 1902 Spooner Act. Since Panama was then part of Colombia, Roosevelt began negotiating with that country to obtain the necessary rights. In early 1903 the HayÿHerrn Treaty was signed by both nations, but the Senate of Colombia failed to ratify the treaty.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoosevelt implied to Panamanian rebels that if they revolted, the US Navy would assist their fight for independence. Panama declared its independence on November 3, 1903, and the USS Nashville impeded Colombian interference. The victorious Panamanians gave the United States control of the Panama Canal Zone on February 23, 1904, for $10?million in accordance with the November 18, 1903 HayÿBunau-Varilla Treaty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States took control of the French property connected to the canal on May 4, 1904, when Lieutenant Jatara Oneel of the United States Army was presented with the keys during a small ceremony.[citation needed] The new Panama Canal Zone Control was overseen by the Isthmian Canal Commission (ICC) during construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first step taken by the US government was to place all the canal workers under the new administration. The operation was maintained at minimum strength to comply with the canal concession and keep the machinery in working order. The US inherited a small workforce and an assortment of buildings, infrastructure and equipment, much of which had been neglected for fifteen years in the humid jungle environment. There were no facilities in place for a large workforce, and the infrastructure was crumbling.\\r\\n\\r\\nCataloguing assets was a large job; it took many weeks to card-index available equipment. About 2,150 buildings had been acquired,[4] many of which were uninhabitable; housing was an early problem, and the Panama Railway was in a state of decay. However, much equipment (such as locomotives, dredges and other floating equipment) was still serviceable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough chief engineer John Findley Wallace was pressured to resume construction, red tape from Washington stifled his efforts to obtain heavy equipment and caused friction between Wallace and the ICC. He and chief sanitary officer William C. Gorgas were frustrated by delay, and Wallace resigned in 1905. He was replaced by John Frank Stevens, who arrived on July 26, 1905. Stevens quickly realized that serious investment in infrastructure was necessary and determined to upgrade the railway, improve sanitation in Panama City and Col܇n, renovate the old French buildings and build hundreds of new ones for housing. He then began the difficult task of recruiting the large labor force required for construction. Stevens' approach was to press ahead first and obtain approval later. He improved drilling and dirt-removal equipment at the Culebra Cut for greater efficiency, revising the inadequate provisions in place for soil disposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo decision had been made about whether the canal should be a lock or a sea-level one; the ongoing excavation would be useful in either case. In late 1905, President Roosevelt sent a team of engineers to Panama to investigate the relative merits of both types in cost and time. Although the engineers voted eight to five in favor of a sea-level canal, Stevens and the ICC opposed the plan; Stevens' report to Roosevelt was instrumental in convincing the president of the merits of a lock canal and Congress concurred. In November 1906 Roosevelt visited Panama to inspect the canal's progress, the first trip outside the United States by a sitting president.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether contract employees or government workers would build the canal was controversial. Bids for the canal's construction were opened in January 1907, and Knoxville, Tennessee-based contractor William J. Oliver was the low bidder.  Stevens disliked Oliver, and vehemently opposed his choice. Although Roosevelt initially favored the use of a contractor, he eventually decided that army engineers should carry out the work[4] and appointed Major George Washington Goethals as chief engineer (under Stevens' direction) in February 1907. Stevens, frustrated by government inaction and the army involvement, resigned and was replaced by Goethals.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US relied on a stratified workforce to build the canal. High-level engineering jobs, clerical positions, skilled labor and jobs in supporting industries were generally reserved for white Americans, with manual labor primarily by cheap immigrant labor. These jobs were initially filled by Europeans, primarily from Spain, Italy and Greece, many of whom were radical and militant due to political turmoil in Europe. The US then decided to recruit primarily from the British and French West Indies, and these workers provided most of the manual labor on the canal.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canal Zone originally had minimal facilities for entertainment and relaxation for the canal workers apart from saloons; as a result, alcohol abuse was a great problem. The inhospitable conditions resulted in many American workers returning home each year.\\r\\n\\r\\nA program of improvements was implemented. Clubhouses were built, managed by the YMCA, with billiard, assembly and reading rooms, bowling alleys, darkrooms for camera clubs, gymnastic equipment, ice cream parlors, soda fountains and a circulating library. Member dues were ten dollars a year, with the remaining upkeep (about $7,000 at the larger clubhouses) paid by the ICC. The commission built baseball fields and arranged rail transportation to games; a competitive league soon developed. Semimonthly Saturday-night dances were held at the Hotel Tivoli, which had a spacious ballroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese measures influenced life in the Canal Zone; alcohol abuse fell, with saloon business declining by 60 percent.[citation needed] The number of workers leaving the project each year dropped significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work done thus far was preparation, rather than construction. By the time Goethals took over, the construction infrastructure had been created or overhauled and expanded from the French effort and he was soon able to begin construction in earnest.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoethals divided the project into three divisions: Atlantic, Central and Pacific. The Atlantic Division, under Major William L. Sibert, was responsible for construction of the breakwater at the entrance to Limon Bay, the Gat~n locks and their 5.6?km (3.5?mi) approach channel, and the Gatun Dam. The Pacific Division (under Sydney B. Williamson, the only civilian division head) was responsible for the Pacific entrance to the canal, including a 4.8?km (3.0?mi) breakwater in Panama Bay, the approach channel, and the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks and their associated dams. The Central Division, under Major David du Bose Gaillard, was responsible for everything in between. It had arguably the project's greatest challenge: excavating the Culebra Cut (known as the Gaillard Cut from 1915 to 2000), which involved cutting 8 miles (13?km) through the continental divide down to 12 meters (40?ft) above sea level.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy August 1907, 765,000 m3 (1,000,000 cubic yards) per month was being excavated; this set a record for the rainy season; soon afterwards this doubled, before increasing again. At the peak of production, 2,300,000 m3 (3,000,000 cubic yards) were being excavated per month (the equivalent of digging a Channel Tunnel every 3? months).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the greatest barriers to a canal was the continental divide, which originally rose to 110 metres (360.9?ft) above sea level at its highest point. The effort to cut through this barrier of rock was one of the greatest challenges faced by the project.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoethals arrived at the canal with Major David du Bose Gaillard of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Gaillard was placed in charge of the canal's Central Division, which stretched from the Pedro Miguel locks to the Gatun Dam, and dedicated himself to getting the Culebra Cut (as it was then known) excavated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scale of the work was massive. Six thousand men worked in the cut, drilling holes in which a total of 27,000?t (60,000,000?lb) of dynamite were placed to break up the rock (which was then removed by as many as 160 trains per day). Landslides were frequent, due to the oxidation and weakening of the rock's underlying iron strata. Although the scale of the job and the frequent, unpredictable slides generated chaos, Gaillard provided quiet, clear-sighted leadership.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 20, 1913, Bucyrus steam shovels made a passage through the Culebra Cut at the level of the canal bottom. The French effort had reduced the summit to  59 metres (193.6?ft) over a relatively narrow width; the Americans had lowered this to  12 metres (39.4?ft) above sea level over a greater width, and had excavated over 76,000,000?m3 (99,000,000?cu?yd) of material. About 23,000,000?m3 (30,000,000?cu?yd) of this material in addition to the planned excavation, in the form of landslides. Dry excavation ended on September 10, 1913; a January slide had added 1,500,000?m3 (2,000,000?cu?yd) of earth, but it was decided that this loose material would be removed by dredging when the cut was flooded.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo artificial lakes are key parts of the canal: Gatun and Miraflores Lakes. Four dams were constructed to create them. Two small dams at Miraflores impound Miraflores Lake, and a dam at Pedro Miguel encloses the south end of the Culebra Cut (essentially an arm of Lake Gatun). The Gatun Dam is the main dam blocking the original course of the Chagres River, creating Gatun Lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Miraflores dams are an 825-metre (2,707?ft) earth dam connecting the Miraflores Locks in the west and a 150-metre (492?ft) concrete spillway dam east of the locks. The concrete dam has eight floodgates, similar to those on the Gatun spillway. The earthen, 430-metre (1,411?ft) Pedro Miguel dam extends from a hill in the west to the lock. Its face is protected by rock riprap at the water level. The largest and most challenging of the dams is the Gatun Dam. This earthen dam, 640 metres (2,100?ft) thick at the base and 2,300 metres (7,546?ft) long along the top, was the largest of its kind in the world when the canal opened.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilding the locks began with the first concrete laid at Gatun on August 24, 1909. The Gatun locks are built into a cutting into a hill bordering the lake, requiring the excavation of 3,800,000?m3 (4,970,212?cu?yd) of material (mostly rock). The locks were made of 1,564,400?m3 (2,046,158?cu?yd) of concrete, with an extensive system of electric railways and cable cars transporting concrete to the lock-construction sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pacific-side locks were finished first: the single flight at Pedro Miguel in 1911, and Miraflores in May 1913. The seagoing tugboat Gatun, an Atlantic-entrance tug used to haul barges, traversed the Gatun locks on September 26, 1913. The trip was successful, although the valves were controlled manually; the central control board was not yet ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 10, 1913, the dike at Gamboa which had kept the Culebra Cut isolated from Gatun Lake was demolished; the detonation was made telegraphically by President Woodrow Wilson in Washington. On January 7, 1914, the Alexandre La Valley, an old French crane boat, became the first ship to make a complete transit of the Panama Canal under its own steam after working its way across during the final stages of construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs construction wound down, the canal team began to disperse. Thousands of workers were laid off, and entire towns were disassembled or demolished. Chief sanitary officer William C. Gorgas, who left to fight pneumonia in the South African gold mines, became surgeon general of the Army. On April 1, 1914 the Isthmian Canal Commission disbanded, and the zone was governed by a Canal Zone Governor; the first governor was George Washington Goethals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough a large celebration was planned for the canal's opening, the outbreak of World War I forced the cancellation of the main festivities and it became a modest local affair. The Panama Railway steamship SS?Ancon, piloted by Captain John A. Constantine (the canal's first pilot), made the first official transit on August 15, 1914. With no international dignitaries in attendance, Goethals followed the Ancon's progress by railroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe canal was a technological marvel and an important strategic and economic asset to the US. It changed world shipping patterns, removing the need for ships to navigate the Drake Passage and Cape Horn. The canal saves a total of about 7,800 miles (12,600?km) on a sea trip from New York to San Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts anticipated military significance of the canal was proven during World War II, when the canal helped restore the devastated United States Pacific Fleet.[7] Some of the largest ships the United States had to send through the canal were aircraft carriers, particularly Essex class; they were so large that although the locks could accommodate them, the lampposts along the canal had to be removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Panama Canal cost the United States about $375 million, including $10 million paid to Panama and $40 million paid to the French company. Although it was the most expensive construction project in US history to that time, it cost about $23 million less than the 1907 estimate despite landslides and an increase in the canal's width. An additional $12 million was spent on fortifications.\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of over 75,000 people worked on the project; at the peak of construction, there were 40,000 workers. According to hospital records, 5,609 workers died from disease and accidents during the American construction era.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 182,610,550?m3 (238,845,582?cu?yd) of material was excavated in the American effort, including the approach channels at the canal ends. Adding the work by the French, the total excavation was about 204,900,000?m3 (268,000,000?cu?yd) (over 25 times the volume excavated in the Channel Tunnel project).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the three presidents whose terms spanned the construction period, Theodore Roosevelt is most associated with the canal and Woodrow Wilson presided over its opening. However, William Howard Taft may have given the canal its greatest impetus for the longest time. Taft visited Panama five times as Roosevelt's secretary of war and twice as president. He hired John Stevens and later recommended Goethals as Stevens' replacement. Taft became president in 1909, when the canal was half finished, and was in office for most of the remainder of the work. However, Goethals later wrote: \\"The real builder of the Panama Canal was Theodore Roosevelt\\".[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following words by Roosevelt are displayed in the rotunda of the canal's administration building in Balboa:[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.\\r\\nDavid du Bose Gaillard died of a brain tumor in Baltimore on December 5, 1913, at age 54. Promoted to colonel only a month earlier, Gaillard never saw the opening of the canal whose creation he directed. The Culebra Cut (as it was originally known) was renamed the Gaillard Cut on April 27, 1915, in his honor. A plaque commemorating Gaillard's work stood over the cut for many years; in 1998 it was moved to the administration building, near a memorial to Goethals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the situation in Europe deteriorated during the late 1930s, the US again became concerned about its ability to move warships between the oceans. The largest US battleships already had problems with the canal locks, and there were concerns about the locks being incapacitated by bombing.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese concerns led Congress to pass a resolution on May 1, 1936, authorizing a study of improving the canal's defenses against attack and expanding its capacity to handle large vessels. A special engineering section was created on July 3, 1937, to carry out the study.\\r\\nThe section reported to Congress on February 24, 1939, recommending work to protect the existing locks and the construction of a new set of locks capable of carrying larger vessels than the existing locks could accommodate. On August 11, Congress authorized the work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree new locks were planned, at Gat~n, Pedro Miguel and Miraflores, parallel to the existing locks with new approach channels. The new locks would add a traffic lane to the canal, with each chamber 1,200?ft (365.76?m) long, 140?ft (42.67?m) wide and 45?ft (13.72?m) deep. They would be 1?2?mi (805?m) east of the existing Gat~n locks and 1?4?mi (402?m) west of the Pedro Miguel and Miraflores locks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first excavations for the new approach channels at Miraflores began on July 1, 1940, following the passage by Congress of an appropriations bill on June 24, 1940. The first dry excavation at Gat~n began on February 19, 1941. Considerable material was excavated before the project was abandoned, and the approach channels can still be seen paralleling the original channels at Gat~n and Miraflores.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the Autoridad del Canal de Panam (the Panama Canal Authority, or ACP) proposed a plan creating a third lane of locks using part of the abandoned 1940s approach canals. Following a referendum, work began in 2007 and the expanded canal began commercial operations on June 26, 2016. After a two-year delay, the new locks allow the transit of Panamax ships (which have a greater cargo capacity than the original locks can handle). The first ship to cross the canal through the third set of locks was a Panamax container ship, the Chinese-owned Cosco Shipping Panama. The cost of the expansion was estimated at $5.25 billion.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter construction, the canal and the Canal Zone surrounding it were administered by the United States. On September 7, 1977, US President Jimmy Carter signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaty setting in motion the process of transferring control of the canal to Panama. The treaty became effective on October 1, 1979, providing for a 20-year period in which Panama would have increasing responsibility for canal operations before complete US withdrawal on December 31, 1999. Since then, the canal has been administered by the Panama Canal Authority (Autoridad de Canal de Panama, or ACP).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe treaty was controversial in the US, and its passage was difficult. The controversy was largely generated by contracts to manage two ports, at either end of the canal, which were awarded by Panama to Hong Kong-based conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa. According to US Republicans, the company has close ties to the Chinese government and the Chinese military.[10] However, the United States Department of State said that it found no evidence of connections between Hutchison Whampoa and Beijing.[11] Some Americans were wary of placing the strategic waterway under the protection of Panamanian security forces.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough concerns existed in the US and the shipping industry about the canal after the transfer, Panama has exercised good stewardship.[13] According to ACP figures, canal income increased from $769?million in 2000 (the first year under Panamanian control) to $1.4?billion in 2006.[citation needed] Traffic through the canal increased from 230 million tons in 2000 to nearly 300?million tons in 2006. The number of accidents has decreased from an average of 28 per year in the late 1990s to 12 in 2005. Transit time through the canal averages about 30 hours, about the same as during the late 1990s. Canal expenses have increased less than revenue, from $427?million in 2000 to $497?million in 2006. On October 22, 2006, Panamanian citizens approved a referendum to expand the canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer US Ambassador to Panama Linda Watt, who served from 2002 to 2005, said that the canal operation in Panamanian hands has been \\"outstanding\\". \\"The international shipping community is quite pleased\\", Watt added.[14]","input":"Who was president when the panama canal opened?"},{"output":"the northwestern regions of South Asia, extending from what today is northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and northwest India","context":"","input":"When did the indus river valley civilization exist?"},{"output":"Kourtney Mary Kardashian","context":"Kourtney Mary Kardashian (born April 18, 1979) is an American television personality, socialite, businesswoman and model.[citation needed] In 2007, she and her family were picked to star in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

Flemish giants are a utility breed, and are most commonly bred for fur and meat, although the breed is also known for its docile nature and patience in being handled, meaning examples are commonly kept as pets as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flemish Giant originated in Flanders. It was bred as early as the 16th century near the city of Ghent, Belgium. It is believed to have descended from a number of meat and fur breeds, possibly including the Steenkonijn (Stone Rabbitreferring to the old Belgian weight size of one stone or about 3.76?kg (8?lb 5?oz)) and the European \\"Patagonian\\" breed (now extinct).[1] This \\"Patagonian\\" rabbit, a large breed that was once bred in Belgium and France, was not the same as the Patagonian rabbit of Argentina (Sylvilagus brasiliensis), a wild species of a different genus weighing less than two pounds[2] (about 1?kg), nor the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum), sometimes called the Patagonian hare, a species in the cavy family of rodents that cannot interbreed with rabbits.[3] Thomas Coatoam, in his Origins of the Flemish Giants, tells us, \\"The earliest authentic record of the Flemish Giant Rabbit occurred about the year 1860.\\"[4]\\r\\nThe first standards for the breed were written in 1893. The Flemish Giant is an ancestor of many rabbit breeds all over the world, one of which is the Belgian Hare,[1] imported into England in the mid 19th century. The Flemish Giant was exported from England and Belgium to America in the early 1890s to help improve the size of meat rabbits during the great \\"rabbit boom\\".[5]\\r\\nIt received little attention until about 1910 where it started appearing at small livestock shows throughout the country. Today, it is one of the more popular breeds at rabbit shows because of its unusually large size and its varying colors. It is promoted by the National Federation of Flemish Giant Rabbit Breeders, which was formed in 1915. The Flemish Giant has many nicknames, first and foremost the \\"Gentle Giant\\" for its uniquely docile personality and also the \\"universal rabbit\\" for its varied purposes as pet, show, breeding, meat and fur animal.[6]\\r\\nAs one of the largest breeds of domestic rabbit, the Flemish Giant is a semi-arch type rabbit with its back arch starting behind the shoulders and carrying through to the base of the tail giving a \\"mandolin\\" shape. The body of a Flemish Giant Rabbit is long and powerful, with relatively broad hindquarters. The fur of the Flemish Giant is known to be glossy and dense. When stroked from the hindquarters to the head, the fur will roll back to its original position.\\r\\nBucks have a broad, massive head in comparison to does, and can take 1.5 years to reach full maturity. Does may have a large, full, evenly carried dewlap (the fold of skin under their chins), and can take 1 year to reach their full maturity.\\r\\nFlemish Giant Rabbits weigh 15 pounds on average, though the biggest ones can weigh up to 22?lb, and the longest one on record (in fact, holding the record for the longest rabbit in the world of any kind), measured about 4 feet 3 inches long.[7]\\r\\nThe American Rabbit Breed Association (ARBA) standard recognized seven different colors for this breed: black, blue, fawn, sandy, light gray, steel gray, and white.[8] The show standard minimum weight for a senior doe is 14?lb (about 6.4?kg), and the show standard minimum weight of a Senior buck is 13?lb (about 5.9?kg).\\r\\nFlemish Giants can be docile and tolerant of handling; frequent interaction with humans is a requirement for this to occur. Flemish Giants, like all rabbits, can become fearful, and sometimes aggressive, if handled incorrectly or irresponsibly. Their larger frame requires special attention paid to the spine alignment when handling a Flemish Giant, or any rabbit for that matter. Consequently, potential owners should consider these factors in addition to their size, level of food consumption, and substantial waste production before buying.\\r\\nDue to its large size, the Flemish Giant needs substantial living quarters that provide ample opportunity for physical movement. The House Rabbit Society recommends keeping rabbits inside the home in a very large pen or room(s) in the home. Larger dog crates are often more appropriate than traditional rabbit and small-pet cages, which tend to be smaller and shorter. In the United States Department of Agriculture's standards for animal housing, rabbits over 12 pounds must have at least five square feet of floor space.[9] The size of appropriate living quarters increases with size of the rabbit.\\r\\nCages with incorrectly sized wire gauge bottoms (as opposed to small gauge wire or solid bottoms) can harm the feet of a Flemish Giant more so than smaller house rabbits due to their increased weight. A resting board may be required to prevent sore hocks for a larger breed rabbit.[6] The Flemish Giant will require larger quantities of food compared to smaller breeds of domestic rabbits. Like some other short hair breeds of rabbits, the Flemish Giant will usually require mild attention to grooming due to its shorter hair. Shedding during the spring and fall transition periods tend to be the most dramatic, with smaller sheds often occurring in between.\\r\\nFlemish Giants can be fed like other rabbits, with the amount of food increased to match their larger size.[10] ARBA recommendations include hay and occasional treats.\\r\\nA high protein diet of 16% or more is needed for them to gain bone mass while growing and later when muscle mass develops. Apples, cabbage or broccoli in small amounts can be given as treats and slowly increased. A quarter apple per rabbit every other day for 3 weeks can be increased to a half apple after that. Do not feed the core or seeds to the rabbit. Since Flemish Giants do not reach full size until they are 1.5 years old, they need to be fed a lot until then. When females have babies and during winter, they need to be fed as much as they can eat, and given plenty of water.\\r\\nIn supplementing a commercial diet, care must be taken to avoid excess protein, calories, and minerals such as salt and calcium, which in excess can cause kidney stones. Overfeeding leading to obesity is a major health concern for both commercial and pet rabbits.[11]\\r\\nThe House Rabbit Society recommends 2 cups of chopped leafy vegetables per 6 pounds (3?kg) of body weight and no more than 2 tablespoons of fruit or carrots per 6 pounds of body weight daily.[12]\\r\\nThe American Rabbit Breeders' Association (ARBA) recommends delaying breeding of female rabbits until they reach the senior weight range. For Flemish Giants, this is 14 pounds, and a typical rabbit will reach this weight when they are about 9 months to one year.[11] A Flemish Giant can take up to 1.5 years to reach their maximum weight and a breeder should wait until the rabbit is slightly over a year old before breeding. Females and males can become sexually mature at 4 months and 8 days. Once the rabbits are 3 months old they should be keep in separate cages or put females with females and males with males. If fighting occurs then they must be separated. The breeding lifespan of a rabbit is variable. Some breeders prefer not to have any more litters after the age of three years [13] while others continue to produce quality litters for five to eight years. The gestation period is between 28ÿ31 days. On average they give birth at 30ÿ32 days. The Flemish Giant rabbit can produce large litters, usually between 5 and 12 in a litter.\\r\\nA nesting box filled with hay is given to the female as she prepares for birth. After birth, clean out the hay, replace with some new hay, and check to see if babies are all alive. Check box every day in case babies die and take them out.\\r\\nApart from being kept as a pet, the Flemish Giant is used for meat, fur, show, pet assisted therapy and education.\\r\\nFlemish Giants, due to their uncomplicated grooming requirements and docile personalities, are used by 4-H programs throughout the United States as a starter rabbit for teaching children responsibility and care of farm animals and pets.[14] Another very popular youth program outside of 4-H that promotes responsible show breeding is the National Federation of Flemish Giant Breeders Youth Program.[15] Flemish Giants are the second oldest domesticated rabbit breed in the United States, following behind the now rare Belgian Hare.[citation needed]\\r\\nFlemish Giants make excellent pets as they are calm, but too heavy for most children to handle. They require a lot of space. Outdoor cages should be 5 feet by 3 feet (1.5 meters by 1 meter). Cages must be in the shade so the rabbits do not overheat. Cages should be protected from wind using painter drop cloth. Cages should have plywood roofs to protect rabbits from rain and snow. They eat 0.5?kg or more food a day of dried rabbit pellets. They expel a lot of waste. Flemish Giants are not typically regarded as \\"meat\\" rabbits because much of the commercial rabbit market focuses on young rabbits, usually around 70 days of age. At this time, Flemish Giants are developing bone mass rather than muscle. However, when raised to roasting (under 6 months) and stewing (over 6 months) age, the size of the Flemish makes them desirable. They are also often bred with other meat rabbit breeds, such as the New Zealand, to increase both meat-to-bone ratio and litter size.\\r\\nDue to the large amount of high protein food they consume and the cost of this food, the selling of the Flemish Giants for meat is not profitable, as buyers want to give just a few dollars per rabbit.","input":"What is the average weight of a flemish giant rabbit?"},{"output":"Eiffel Tower","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlackpool Tower is a tourist attraction in Blackpool, Lancashire, England, which was opened to the public on 14 May 1894. Inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, it is 518 feet (158 metres) tall and is the 120th tallest freestanding tower in the world.[1] Blackpool Tower is also the common name for Tower buildings, an entertainment complex in a red-brick three-storey block comprising the tower, the ground floor aquarium and cafeteria, Tower Circus, the Tower Ballroom and roof gardens that was designated a Grade I listed building in 1973.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blackpool Tower Company was founded by London-based Standard Contract & Debenture Corporation in 1890, when it bought an aquarium on Central Promenade with the intention of building a replica Eiffel Tower on the site. John Bickerstaffe, a former Mayor of Blackpool, was asked to become chairman of the new company and its shares went on sale in July 1891. The Standard Corporation kept 30,000 S1 shares and offered S150,000 worth of shares to the public, although initially only two-thirds were taken up forcing the company to ask for more cash contributions from its existing shareholders, but the poor financial situation of the company, exacerbated by the falling share price, rendered it unable to pay. Bickerstaffe, to avoid the potential collapse of the venture bought any available shares until his original holding of S500 amounted to S20,000. He also released the Standard Corporation from its share commitments. When the tower opened in 1894 its success justified the investment of nearly S300,000, and the company made a S30,000 profit in 1896.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo Lancashire architects, James Maxwell and Charles Tuke, designed the tower and oversaw the laying of its foundation stone[4] on 29 September 1891.[5] By the time the Tower finally opened on 14 May 1894, both men had died.[4] Heenan & Froude of Worcester were appointed structural engineers, supplying and constructing both the tower, the electric lighting and the steel front pieces for the aquariums. A new system of hydraulic riveting was used, based on the technology of Fielding & Platt of Gloucester.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total cost for the design and construction of the tower and buildings was about S290,000.[7] Five million Accrington bricks, 2,500 tonnes (2,800 tons) of iron and 93 tonnes (103 tons) of cast steel were used to construct the tower.[8] Unlike the Eiffel Tower, Blackpool Tower is not free-standing. Its base is hidden by the building which houses Blackpool Tower Circus. The building occupies a total of 5,050 square metres (54,400?sq?ft).[2] At the summit of the tower there is a flagpole;[9][10] A time capsule is buried beneath the foundation.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower's design was ahead of its time.  As a writer for the BBC noted: \\"In heavy winds the building will gently sway, what a magnificent Victorian engineering masterpiece.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the tower opened, 3,000 customers took the first rides to the top.[4] Tourists paid sixpence for admission, sixpence more for a ride in the lifts to the top, and a further sixpence for the circus.[7] The first members of the public to ascend the tower had been local journalists in September 1893 using constructors' ladders.[11] In 1897 the top of the tower caught fire, and the platform was seen on fire from up to fifty miles away.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower was not painted properly during the first thirty years and became corroded, leading to discussions about demolishing it. However, it was decided to rebuild it instead, and between 1921 and 1924 all the steelwork in the structure was replaced and renewed.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 22 December 1894 Norwegian ship Abana was sailing from Liverpool to Savannah, Georgia but was caught up in a storm, and mistook the recently built Blackpool Tower for a lighthouse. Abana was first seen off North Pier, and later drifted to Little Bispham where she was wrecked, and can still be seen at low tide. The ship's bell still hangs in St Andrews Church in Cleveleys.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1940, during the Second World War, the crow's-nest was removed to allow the structure to be used as a Royal Air Force radar station known as RAF Tower,[9] which proved unsuccessful.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1949 a post box was opened at the top of the tower.[11] The hydraulic lifts to the top of the tower were replaced in 1956ÿ57 and the winding-gear replaced by electric.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe top of the tower was painted silver in 1977 as part of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee celebrations.[2] A giant model of King Kong was placed on the side of the tower in 1984.[2] In 1985 escapologist Karl Bartoni and his bride were married suspended in a cage from the tower.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lifts and winding gear were again replaced in 1992.[2] The same year the tower complex was renamed Tower World and was opened by Diana, Princess of Wales.[13] The tower is usually painted in dark red, except for its centenary year in 1994 when it was painted gold by abseiling painters.[2][9] In 1998 a \\"Walk of Faith\\" glass floor panel was opened at the top of the tower. Made up of two sheets of laminated glass, it weighs half a tonne and is two inches thick.[11] In October 2007 a laser beam installed on the tower for the duration of the annual Illuminations was criticised by astronomer Sir Patrick Moore, presenter of The Sky at Night television programme, who said, \\"Light pollution is a huge problem. I am not saying we should turn all the lights out, that is not practical, but there are some things which are very unnecessary. The Blackpool Tower light is certainly something I do not think we should be doing. I very much oppose it.\\" The beam could be seen 30 miles (48?km) away; Moore called for it to be stopped. The Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston said the laser has added to a spiralling problem affecting astronomy.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower has transmitters for local FM station Radio Wave 96.5 and some non-broadcast services.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower continued to be owned by the Bickerstaffe family until 1964, when the Blackpool Tower Company was sold to EMI.[15] Since then it has been owned by Trust House Forte, First Leisure and Leisure Parcs Ltd, owned by Trevor Hemmings.[16] In March 2010 it was announced that Blackpool Council had bought Blackpool Tower and the Merlin Entertainment Group would manage it and add various attractions including a new Dungeon attraction[17] and a new observation deck called Blackpool Tower Eye will operate at the top of the tower.[18] The company will also manage the Blackpool Louis Tussauds waxwork museum to be rebranded as Madame Tussauds.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe top of the tower is currently known as the Blackpool Tower Eye. At a height of 380 feet (120?m), the Eye is the highest observation deck in North West England. It was previously known simply as the Tower Top, until it reopened on September 2011. Reopening after major renovation, new owner Blackpool Council brought in Merlin Entertainments to manage the attractions, with Merlin deciding to incorporate the tower into its range of \\"Eye\\" branded attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the lift, guests watch a 4-D film about Blackpool and the local area. The film shows a young boy who is inspired with the tower and goes to the ballroom and circus of the tower. Then, with his goggles he is wearing, makes the tower blast off like a rocket. The film also shows the history of the tower. The film is accompanied by the song \\"All the Lovers\\" by Kylie Minogue, a song commonly used to promote Blackpool. The visitors then go into the refurbished waiting area, where memorabilia and newspaper pages about Blackpool Tower are on display, before being taken to the Eye itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are four levels in the Blackpool Tower Eye:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original ballroom, the Tower Pavilion, opened in August 1894. It was smaller than the present ballroom and occupied the front of the tower complex.[20] The Tower Ballroom was built between 1897 and 1898 to the designs of Frank Matcham, who also designed Blackpool Grand Theatre, and it opened in 1899. It was commissioned by the Tower company in response to the opening of the Empress Ballroom in the Winter Gardens. The ballroom floor is 120?ft G?120?ft (37?m G?37?m) and is made up of 30,602 blocks of mahogany, oak and walnut.[20] Above the stage is the inscription, \\"Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear\\" from the poem Venus and Adonis by William Shakespeare. Each crystal chandelier in the ballroom can be lowered to the floor to be cleaned which takes over a week.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1930 until his retirement in 1970 the resident organist was Reginald Dixon, known affectionately worldwide as \\"Mr. Blackpool\\". The first Wurlitzer organ was installed in 1929, but it was replaced in 1935 by one designed by Reginald Dixon. Ernest Broadbent took over as resident organist in 1970 until he retired due to ill health in 1977. The current resident organist is Phil Kelsall who has been playing the organ at the Tower since 1975 when he started in the circus. Kelsall became resident in the ballroom in 1977, he was awarded an MBE like Dixon in 2010 for services to music. Wurlitzer organs such as this one were manufactured in Buffalo New York in the United States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ballroom was damaged by fire in December 1956, and the dance floor was destroyed along with the restaurant underneath the ballroom. Restoration took two years and cost S500,000, with many of the former designers and builders coming out of retirement to assist, the restaurant then became the Tower Lounge.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BBC series Come Dancing was televised from the Tower Ballroom for many years[22] and it has also hosted shows from Strictly Come Dancing, including the grand finals of the second and ninth series, on 11 December 2004, and 17 December 2011 respectively.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blackpool Junior Dance Festival (\\"Open to the World\\") has been held each year in the ballroom since 1964.[20]\\r\\nAlso the World Modern Jive Championships are held annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nDancing was not originally allowed on Sundays; instead, sacred music was played. The ballroom also originally had very strict rules including:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ballroom has had a number of resident dance bands including Bertini and his band, and Charlie Barlow.[24][25] Other smaller dance bands have also appeared as residents including the Eric Delaney Band[26] and the Mike James Band.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the management of Leisure Parcs, and the direction of bandleader Greg Francis, the Blackpool Tower Big Band was reformed in 2001 after an absence of 25 years. The New Squadronaires, The Memphis Belle Swing Orchestra and The Glenn Miller Tribute Orchestra also performed.[28] Themed nights were also introduced along with the sixteen piece orchestra, with resident singers, including Tony Benedict, Lynn Kennedy, and Mark Porter.[citation needed] In 2005 the Empress Orchestra became resident in the ballroom alongside the specially created and smaller Empress Dance Band.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tower's orchestrion is now in the collection of Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum.[30] The ballroom, together with the Tower, Circus and Roof Garden, were designated a Grade I listed building in 1973.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tower Circus is positioned at the base of the tower, between its four legs. The circus first opened to the public on 14 May 1894 and has not missed a season since.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present interior was designed by Frank Matcham and was completed in 1900.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe circus ring can be lowered into a pool of water and holds 42,000 imperial gallons (190,000?L) at a depth of up to 4?ft 6?in (1.37?m), which allows for Grand Finales with Dancing Fountains. The Tower Circus is one of four left in the world that can do this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clown Charlie Cairoli appeared at the tower for 39 years. Britain's best-known ringmaster Norman Barrett worked the ring for 25 years. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnimals appeared in the circus until 1990. It was planned to close the circus at the end of the 1990 season and replace it with an animatronic attraction. Public opinion and the fact the animatronics were not ready meant that the circus continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the circus is produced and directed by Hungarian Laci Endresz, who is married to Maureen, one of the Roberts family who have a long association with the Tower Circus. A live band (sometimes accompanied by Mooky the Clown) provides all the music for the show, often dynamically syncing with the performers' movements. The circus band play a variety of different songs, usually Latin for the acts. In the winter the circus stages a pantomime instead of the regular show.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Cocker's Aquarium, Aviary and Menagerie had existed on the site since 1873.[32] It was kept open to earn revenue while the tower building went up around it, and then became one of the tower's major attractions. The aquarium was modelled on the limestone caverns in Derbyshire. It housed 57 different species of fresh water and salt water fish and the largest tank held 32,000 litres (7,000?imp?gal; 8,500?US?gal) of salt water.[33]\\r\\nThe menagerie and aviary were regarded as one of the finest collections in the country and included lions, tigers, and polar bears.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe menagerie continued until 1973,[32] when it was closed following the opening of Blackpool Zoo near Stanley Park. Due to the tower being run By Merlin Entertainments who also run the nearby Sea Life Centre, The aquarium closed in 2010 and was remodelled to make way for a new \\"Dungeons\\" attraction.[35][36].\\r\\n\\r\\nJungle Jim's Children's Indoor Play is a large indoor children's adventure playground situated within the tower. It is a S3 million interactive play scheme covering over 2,500 square metres (27,000?sq?ft). Based on a lost city, children can tackle a series of adventures in search of hidden treasure.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tower Lounge Bar was a large pub with a capacity of 1,700, but staff usually limited occupancy to 1,400 for a more relaxed atmosphere. It closed down in 2014 and has since reopened as a Harry Ramsden's fish and chip restaurant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blackpool Tower Dungeon is part of an international chain of Dungeon experiences operated by Merlin Entertainments. Opened in 2011, it incorporates elements of history with fear and gallows humour based shows. It also features \\"Drop Dead\\", a 26?ft (7.9?m) drop tower that simulates being executed by hanging. As an addition to the Dungeon brand Merlin introduced the first ever Dungeon themed Escape Room in  2017. [38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2018 Merlin Entertainments launched Dino Mini Golf, an indoor crazy golf course with \\"9 holes of prehistoric fun\\". It has been described by Aaron Edgar, the Blackpool Tower Operations manager as \\"65 years in the making\\".[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nPainting the tower structure takes seven years to complete,[10][16] and the workers who maintain the structure are known as \\"Stick Men\\". There are 563 steps from the roof of the tower building to the top of the tower which the maintenance teams use for the structure's upkeep. If the wind speed exceeds 72?km/h (45?mph; 39?kn; 20?m/s), the top of the tower is closed as a safety precaution.[40] There are 8 kilometres (5?mi) of cables to feed the 10,000 light bulbs which are used to illuminate the tower.[16] In April 2002 the Tower maintenance team was featured in the BBC One programme, Britains Toughest Jobs.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlackpool is a popular seaside resort, and the beach-front tower is still a major attraction. It is lit during the annual Illuminations, when the town and seafront are decorated with colourful illuminated displays for 6 miles (10?km) along the promenade.","input":"What was built first the eiffel tower or blackpool tower?"},{"output":"Elias Howe Jr.","context":"Elias Howe Jr. (/ha?/; July 9, 1819 ÿ October 3, 1867) was an American inventor best known for his creation of the modern lockstitch sewing machine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElias Howe Jr. was born on July 9, 1819 to Dr. Elias Howe Sr. and Polly (Bemis) Howe in Spencer, Massachusetts. Howe spent his childhood and early adult years in Massachusetts where he apprenticed in a textile factory in Lowell beginning in 1835. After mill closings due to the Panic of 1837, he moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to work as a mechanic with carding machinery, apprenticing along with his cousin Nathaniel P. Banks. Beginning in 1838, he apprenticed in the shop of Ari Davis, a master mechanic in Cambridge who specialized in the manufacture and repair of chronometers and other precision instruments.[1] It was in the employ of Davis that Howe seized upon the idea of the sewing machine.\\r\\nHe married Elizabeth Jennings Ames, daughter of Simon Ames and Jane B. Ames, on March 3, 1841 in Cambridge.[2] They had three children: Jane Robinson Howe (1842-1912), Simon Ames Howe (1844-1883), and Julia Maria Howe (1846-1869).\\r\\nContrary to popular belief, Howe was not the first to conceive of the idea of a sewing machine. Many other people had formulated the idea of such a machine before him, one as early as 1790, and some had even patented their designs and produced working machines, in one case at least 80 of them.[3] However, Howe originated significant refinements to the design concepts of his predecessors, and on September 10, 1846, he was awarded the first United States patent (U.S. Patent 4,750) for a sewing machine using a lockstitch design. His machine contained the three essential features common to most modern machines:\\r\\nA possibly apocryphal account of how he came up with the idea for placing the eye of the needle at the point is recorded in a family history of his mother's family:\\r\\nHe almost beggared himself before he discovered where the eye of the needle of the sewing machine should be located. It is probable that there are very few people who know how it came about. His original idea was to follow the model of the ordinary needle, and have the eye at the heel. It never occurred to him that it should be placed near the point, and he might have failed altogether if he had not dreamed he was building a sewing machine for a savage king in a strange country. Just as in his actual working experience, he was perplexed about the needle's eye. He thought the king gave him twenty-four hours in which to complete the machine and make it sew. If not finished in that time death was to be the punishment. Howe worked and worked, and puzzled, and finally gave it up. Then he thought he was taken out to be executed. He noticed that the warriors carried spears that were pierced near the head. Instantly came the solution of the difficulty, and while the inventor was begging for time, he awoke. It was 4 o'clock in the morning. He jumped out of bed, ran to his workshop, and by 9, a needle with an eye at the point had been rudely modeled. After that it was easy. That is the true story of an important incident in the invention of the sewing machine.[4]\\r\\nElias Howe's Sewing Machine U.S. Patent #4,750 issued 10 September 1846\\r\\nElias Howe Sewing Machine September 10, 1846\\r\\nDespite securing his patent, Howe had considerable difficulty finding investors in the United States to finance production of his invention, so his elder brother Amasa Bemis Howe traveled to England in October 1846 to seek financing. Amasa was able to sell his first machine for S250 to William Thomas of Cheapside, London, who owned a factory for the manufacture of corsets, umbrellas and valises. Elias and his family joined Amasa in London in 1848, but after business disputes with Thomas and failing health of his wife, Howe returned nearly penniless to the United States. His wife Elizabeth, who preceded Elias back to the United States, died in Cambridge, Massachusetts shortly after his return in 1849.[5]\\r\\nDespite his efforts to sell his machine, other entrepreneurs began manufacturing sewing machines. Howe was forced to defend his patent in a court case that lasted from 1849 to 1854 because he found that Isaac Singer with cooperation from Walter Hunt had perfected a facsimile of his machine and was selling it with the same lockstitch that Howe had invented and patented. He won the dispute and earned considerable royalties from Singer and others for sales of his invention.\\r\\nHowe contributed much of the money he earned to providing equipment for the 17th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry of the Union Army during the Civil War, in which Howe served as a Private in Company D. Due to his faltering health he performed light duty, often seen walking with the aid of his shillelagh, and took on the position of Regimental Postmaster, serving out his time riding to and from Baltimore with war news. He'd enlisted August 14, 1862, and then mustered out July 19, 1865.[6][7]\\r\\nElias Howe Jr's Shillelagh he used during the Civil War (R. Andre Stevens Civil War Collection)\\r\\nAn engraved Silver ID plaque\\r\\nHowe received a patent in 1851 for an \\"Automatic, Continuous Clothing Closure\\". Perhaps because of the success of his sewing machine, he did not try to seriously market it, missing recognition he might otherwise have received.[8]\\r\\nBetween 1865/67, Elias established The Howe Machine Co. in Bridgeport, Connecticut that was operated by Elias's sons-in-law, the Stockwell Brothers until about 1886. Between 1854 and 1871/72, Elias's older brother, Amasa Bemis Howe, and later his son Benjamin Porter Howe, as Amasa died in 1868, owned and operated a factory in New York City manufacturing sewing machines under the name of The Howe Sewing Machine Co., which had won a gold medal at the London Exhibition of 1862. Then in 1873, B. P. Howe sold The Howe Sewing Machine Co. factory and name to The Howe Machine Co. which merged the two companies together. Elias's sewing machine won a gold medal at the Paris Exhibition of 1867,[1] and that same year he was awarded the Lgion d'honneur by Napoleon III for his invention.[9]\\r\\nHowe died at age 48, on October 3, 1867, of gout and a massive blood clot. He was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. His second wife, Rose Halladay, who died on October 10, 1890, is buried with him. Both Singer and Howe ended their days as multi-millionaires.[10]\\r\\nHowe was commemorated with a 5-cent stamp in the Famous American Inventors series issued October 14, 1940.[11] In 2004 he was inducted into the United States National Inventors Hall of Fame.[1]\\r\\nHowe was a direct descendant of John Howe (1602-1680) who arrived in Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630 from Brinklow, Warwickshire, England and settled in Sudbury, Massachusetts. Howe was also a descendant of Edmund Rice another early immigrant to Massachusetts Bay Colony as follows:[2][12]\\r\\nHowe was a direct descendant of Richard Warren (1580-1628) who arrived in Massachusetts Bay Colony at Plymouth Rock in November 1620 on the \\"Mayflower\\" from Great Amwell, Hertfordshire, England and settled in Marshfield, Massachusetts.\\r\\nElias Howe was also 6th cousin 2 times removed of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882 - 1945) from FDR's mother's line.","input":"Who is responsible for inventing the sewing machine?"},{"output":"The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium).","context":"","input":"Which region was part of the eastern roman empire?"},{"output":"pitcher can commit a number of illegal motions or actions","context":"In baseball, a pitcher can commit a number of illegal motions or actions that constitute a balk. Most of these violations involve a pitcher pretending to pitch when he has no intention of doing so. In games played under the Official Baseball Rules, a balk results in a dead ball or delayed dead ball. In certain other circumstances, a balk may be wholly or partially disregarded. Under other rule sets, notably in the United States under the National Federation of High Schools (Fed or Federation) Baseball Rules, a balk results in an immediate dead ball. In the event a balk is enforced, the pitch is generally (but not always) nullified, each runner is awarded one base, and the batter (generally) remains at bat, and with the previous count. The balk rule in Major League Baseball was introduced in 1898.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA pitcher is restricted to a certain set of motions and one of two basic pitching positions before and during a pitch; if these regulations are violated with one or more runners on base, an umpire may call a balk. The batter at home plate does not advance on a balk.\\r\\nWith a runner on base and the pitcher on or astride (with one leg on each side of) the rubber, under Official Baseball Rules, it is a balk[2] when the pitcher:\\r\\nBalk rules under other rule sets vary.\\r\\nThe pitcher's acts of spitting on the ball, defacing or altering the ball, rubbing the ball on the clothing or body, or applying a foreign substance to the ball are not balks; however, it will result in the pitcher's ejection from the game if caught.\\r\\nA pitcher was allowed to feint toward third (or second) base, and then turn and throw or feint to first base if his pivot foot disengages the rubber after his initial feint. This is called the \\"fake to third, throw to first\\" play. However, Major League Baseball classified this as a balk beginning with the 2013 season.[3]\\r\\nIf no runners are on base and the pitcher commits an otherwise balkable action, there generally is no penalty. However, delivering a quick return or pitching while off the rubber (which constitute balks when runners are on base) results in a ball being called with the bases empty. If the pitcher should commit an act confusing to the batter with nobody on, or if he stops his delivery or otherwise violates because the batter steps out or otherwise acts confusingly, time is called and the play restarted without penalty (whether or not runners are on base). If a pitcher repeatedly commits illegal actions without runners on base, he may be subject to ejection for persistently violating the rules.\\r\\nIf, during an attempt to execute the \\"hidden ball trick\\" (where the defensive team deceives the runner(s) as to the ball's location while the play is live), the pitcher stands on the rubber prior to the fielder revealing the ball and applying the tag, the runner is not out. Instead, it is a balk, with all runners on base being awarded their next base.\\r\\nA \\"catcher's balk\\" occurs when the catcher does not stay in the catcher's box until the pitcher delivers the ball. The rule is rarely enforced, though.[4] However, a catcher's balk is still charged to the pitcher. This is because the pitcher is deemed to have illegally delivered a pitch while the catcher was out of position.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile the purpose of the balk rule is to prevent the pitcher from deliberately befuddling the base runner (per comment to Rule 8.05, OBR), or occasionally the batter, there are many legal ways for pitchers to deceive runners: pickoff attempts, look-backs, and speeding up the pitching motion all are efforts at deception. Only actions that violate the balk rules, however, may be penalized with a balk.\\r\\nAnother misconception occurs when in the set position, a pitcher must step off the rubber before attempting a pick-off or appeal play. Rule 8.01(c) allows a pitcher to pitch, throw to an occupied base, or step off while in contact with the rubber. The pitcher may also throw to an unoccupied base if appealing that a runner missed a base or left too early on a fly ball.\\r\\nAdditionally, there is no \\"fielder's balk\\" for a player other than the catcher being in foul territory during a pitch. It is also not a balk for a pitcher to take a sign from a catcher while not in contact with the rubber. These are listed in the rule book as infractions without penalties. The umpire shall call \\"time\\" and correct the issue without penalty.","input":"What is a balk in major league baseball?"},{"output":"Spanish","context":"Puerto Rican Spanish (espa?ol puertorrique?o [espa??ol pwe?tori?ke?o]) is the Spanish language as characteristically spoken in Puerto Rico and by millions of people of Puerto Rican descent living in the United States and elsewhere.[2] It belongs to the group of Caribbean Spanish variants and, as such, is largely derived from Canarian Spanish and Andalusian Spanish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince most of the original farmers and commoners of Puerto Rico between the 15th and 18th centuries came from Andalusia, the basis for most of Puerto Rican Spanish is Andalusian Spanish (particularly that of Seville). For example, the endings -ado, -ido, -edo often drop intervocalic /d/ in both Seville and San Juan: hablado > hablao, vendido > vendo, dedo > deo (intervocalic /d/ dropping is quite widespread in coastal American dialects).\\r\\nAnother Andalusian trait is the tendency to weaken postvocalic consonants, particularly /-s/: 'los dos > lo(h) do(h), 'buscar' > buhc(l) (aspiration or elimination of syllable-final /s/ is quite widespread in coastal American dialects).\\r\\nPronouncing \\"l\\" instead of \\"r\\" in syllable-final position is also a trait of Puerto Rican Spanish that has similarities in Spain: - Andalusians sometimes do the opposite, replacing the letter \\"l\\" at the end of a syllable with \\"r\\" (e.g. saying \\"Huerva\\" instead of \\"Huelva\\". People from working class areas of Seville can sometimes sound almost indistinguishable from Puerto Ricans (Zatu, the singer of the band SFDK from the Pino Montano district of Seville being an example). This distinction is the main way of distinguishing between the two accents when examples in the \\"transition zone\\" exist.\\r\\nNevertheless, Canarian Spanish (from Spain's Canary Islands) made the major contribution to Puerto Rican Spanish, and can be considered the basis of the dialect and accent. Many Canarians came in hopes of establishing a better life in the Americas. Most Puerto Rican immigration in the early 19th century included people from the Canary Islands, who, like Puerto Ricans, had inherited most of their linguistic traits from Andalusia.\\r\\nCanarian influence is most present in the language of those Puerto Ricans who live in the central mountain region, who blended it with the remnant vocabulary of the Tano. Canarian and Caribbean dialects share a similar intonation which, in general terms, means that stressed vowels are usually quite long. Puerto Rican and Canarian Spanish accents are strikingly similar. When visiting Tenerife or Las Palmas, Puerto Ricans are usually taken at first hearing for fellow-Canarians from a distant part of the Canary archipelago.\\r\\nLater in the 19th century other Spanish immigrants from Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, Asturias and Galicia plus other European settlersmostly from France (including Corsica), Italy, Ireland, Scotland, Germany, and even some overseas Chinesesettled in Puerto Rico. Words from these regions and countries joined the linguistic stew.\\r\\nWhen the Spanish settlers colonized Puerto Rico in the early 16th century, thousands of Tano people lived on the island, but almost immediately fell victim to European diseases (chicken pox, measles, smallpox, influenza and the common cold) to which they had no natural immunity. This caused the rapid decline and almost complete destruction of the indigenous Tanos within the first fifty years of exposure to the European explorers and colonists.\\r\\nA great number of Tano words like hamaca (hammock), hurakn (hurricane), and tabaco (tobacco) came into general Spanish usage, similar to the employment of indigenous words on the North American mainland by the English-speaking colonists, i.e., maize (corn), moccasin (moccasin), moose (moose). Tano names and/or Hispanicized Tano names for geographic locations such as Arecibo, Bayam܇n, Caguas, Can܇vanas, Guaynabo, Gurabo, Jayuya, Luquillo, Mayagez, Moca, Naguabo and Vieques are to be found throughout Puerto Rico, again similar to the use of Native American words in respect to geographic locations on the North American mainland (Alabama, Connecticut, Dakota, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Utah).\\r\\nThe first African slaves were brought to the island in the 16th century. Although several African tribes have been recorded in Puerto Rico, it is the Kongo from Central Africa that is considered to have had the most influence on Puerto Rican Spanish.[3] In the early colonial period many African slaves in Puerto Rico spoke Bozal Spanish. Words like gandul (pigeon pea), fuf~ (a spell), and malanga (a root vegetable), are commonly used and are of African origin. There also is the Afro-Caribbean/West Indian influence, for example many words and expressions come from patois and creolized languages from the neighboring islands.\\r\\nIn 1898, during the armed conflicts of the Puerto Rican Campaign, Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States as part of a peace treaty that brought the SpanishÿAmerican War to a sudden conclusion. The United States Army and the early colonial administration tried to impose the English language on island residents. Between 1902 and 1948, the main language of instruction in public schools (used for all subjects except Spanish language courses) was English.\\r\\nConsequently, many American English words are now found in the Puerto Rican vocabulary. English has had a fluctuating status as a second official language of the Island, depending on the political party in power at the moment. The majority of Puerto Ricans today do not speak English at home, and Spanish remains the mother tongue of Puerto Ricans, regardless of their political views.\\r\\nMany third and fourth generation Puerto Ricans who live in the United States borrow English words or phrases in mid-sentence in a phenomenon called code-switching, sometimes characterized as Spanglish. Puerto Rican writer Giannina Braschi published the first Spanglish novel, Yo-Yo Boing!, in 1998, a book that represents the code-switching linguistic style of some Latino immigrants in the United States. However, this mixture of Spanish and English is simply an informal blending of languages, not a separate language or dialect, and is not a fundamental characteristic of Spanish or Puerto Rican culture. It is merely an occasional convenience used by speakers who are very fluent in the two languages.\\r\\nPuerto Rico has representation in the Royal Spanish Academy (Real Academia Espa?ola) and has its own national academy along with the other Spanish-speaking countries of Hispanic America.\\r\\nPuerto Rican accents, both in Spanish and English, could be described as a reflection of Puerto Rico's historical European ethnic cultures.\\r\\nTo understand the concept of the Puerto Rican accent in Spanish, one must remember that every country in Hispanic America has different accents in this language, many of which are very similar. The accents of Argentina and Uruguay, for example, were heavily influenced by the presence of Italians in those countries.\\r\\nIn Puerto Rico's case, Spaniards arrived from many regions within Spain and brought with them their own regional dialects/accents. However, a many European immigrants to Puerto Rico came throughout its history from a region of the south of Spain, Andaluca. Many others arrived from Spain's islands off the coast of North Africa, known as the Canary Islands. When visiting Tenerife or Las Palmas (Islas Canarias, Spain), Puerto Ricans are usually taken at first hearing for fellow Canarians from a distant part of the Canary archipelago. It is the accents of those regions that were as the basis of the accent of Spanish that is spoken in Puerto Rico.\\r\\nThe indigenous population of Tanos left a great many words in the names of geographical areas of the Island (Jayuya, Mayagez, etc.), and others are used to name everyday items such as \\"hamaca\\" (hammock) or to describe natural phenomena such as \\"huracn\\" (hurricane).\\r\\nAfricans in Puerto Rico were brought in as slave labor, mostly to work on coastal or lowland sugar plantations. They contributed a large number of words to colloquialisms and island cuisine, introduced words, and influenced the speech rhythms. That can be noticed by visiting the parts of the island where they have historically been present (almost exclusively along the coasts). Also, the Afro-Caribbean/West Indian patois/Creole linguistic presence is very strong and has influenced Puerto Rican culture, as is reflected in music (such as reggae) and culinary dishes.\\r\\nChinese Puerto Ricans and other Asians who have established themselves in Puerto Rico also adopt the accent, but with a tinge of an East Asian.\\r\\nThe Puerto Rican accent is somewhat similar to the accents used by those from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean basin, including Cuba and the Dominican Republic, and those from the Caribbean/coastal regions of Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Honduras, and Nicaragua (particularly to a non-Puerto Rican). However, any similarity will depend on the level of education of the Puerto Rican speaker and their immediate geographic location. It also continues to be extremely similar to the accent of the Canary Islanders and Andalusians in southern Spain. Overall, most Puerto Ricans make an emphatic distinction between their accent and other Caribbean Spanish accents.\\r\\nU.S.-resident Puerto Ricans, descended from the large number of migrants who left the island throughout the 20th Century, can be found today en masse along the Eastern coast of the United States. In addition to major metropolitan areas such as New York, many Puerto Ricans also migrated to areas such as Connecticut, Chicago, New Jersey, Florida, Massachusetts, and even California. Because of their high-rates of military enlistment, large Puerto Rican populations are also found in isolated spots across the U.S. near military installations.\\r\\nThe accent of post-first generation Puerto Rican migrants to the U.S. is heavily influenced by their predominantly English-speaking surroundings. While still sounding Puerto Rican, their accents are tinged by the area of the United States where they grew up. Their grammatical composition is sometimes influenced by American English rather than Spanish.\\r\\nFirst-generation Americans who grew up in Puerto Rico, whether born there or not, speak Spanish with an accent of the origin of their parents.\\r\\nDuring the time of the SpanishÿAmerican War, the United States Army and the early colonial administration imposed the English language on island residents. Consequently, many American words are now found in Puerto Rican vocabularies.\\r\\nAs with any other case of a non-native learning a language, many Puerto Ricans learn a particular accent of English. If learned in the US, they may speak English as it is spoken in their region. Some Puerto Ricans still residing in the island acquire a distinctly American accent. Others will develop different variations of the accent depending on who or what the main influence was during the learning process. Not only English is taught from the first grade in most schools but also most English teachers (particularly private school teachers) are very fluent in the language.","input":"What language do they speak in puerto rico?"},{"output":"28 December 1895","context":"","input":"When was the first film shown in a cinema?"},{"output":"4,574,351","context":"The Phoenix Metropolitan Area ÿ often referred to as the Valley of the Sun, the Salt River Valley or Metro Phoenix ÿ is a metropolitan area, centered on the city of Phoenix, that includes much of the central part of the U.S. State of Arizona. The United States Census Bureau designates the area as the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), defining it as Maricopa and Pinal counties. As of the Census Bureau's 2015 population estimates, Metro Phoenix had 4,574,351 residents, making it the 12th largest Metropolitan Area in the nation by population. The gross domestic product of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area was $215 billion in 2014, 15th largest amongst metro areas in the United States.\\r\\nIt is also one of the fastest growing major metropolitan areas, gaining nearly 400,000 residents from 2010 to 2015, and more than 1.3 million since 2000. The population of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area increased by 45.3% from 1990 through 2000, compared to the average United States rate of 13.2%, helping to make Arizona the second fastest growing state in the nation in the 1990s (the fastest was Nevada).[4] The 2000 Census reported the population of the metropolitan area to be 3,251,876.\\r\\nAs for the 2010 Census, the two-county metropolitan area was reported to have a population of 4,192,887. Metro Phoenix grew by 941,011 people from April 2000 to April 2010, making it one of the fastest growing metro areas in the country. This also contributed to the entire state's exceptional growth, as the area is home to just over two-thirds of Arizona's population.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 4,192,887 people, 1,537,137 households, and 1,024,971 families residing within the MSA. The racial makeup of the MSA was 73.0% White (58.7% White Non-Hispanic), 5.0% Black, 3.3% Asian, 2.4% Native American or Alaska Native (virtually all Native American) and 16.2% of other or mixed race. 29.5% were Hispanic of any race.[5]\\r\\nIn 2010 the median income for a household in the MSA was $50,385 and the median income for a family was $58,497. The per capita income was $24,809.[6]\\r\\nWhat follows is a list of places in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area (populations as of 2014). The Office of Management and Budget defines a metropolitan area as the core city plus its county and any nearby counties that are economically dependent on the core city. However, Arizona has relatively large counties and a harsh, rugged desert landscape. For these reasons, much of the land that is part of the Metropolitan Statistical Area is rural or completely uninhabited. The core part of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area is the PhoenixÿMesa, Arizona Urban Area, which is far smaller than the Metropolitan Statistical Area.[7]\\r\\nPlaces that fall completely or partially within the boundaries of the Phoenix-Mesa, AZ UA are in bold below.[7]\\r\\nPrincipal city\\r\\nPlaces with 250,000+ inhabitants\\r\\nPlaces with 150,000ÿ249,999 inhabitants\\r\\nPlaces with 75,000 to 149,999 inhabitants\\r\\nPlaces with 30,000 to 74,999 inhabitants\\r\\nPlaces with 10,000ÿ29,999 inhabitants\\r\\nFewer than 10,000 inhabitants\\r\\nOver 10,000 inhabitants\\r\\nUnder 10,000 inhabitants\\r\\nAs of 2010, the Phoenix Metropolitan area consists of Maricopa and Pinal counties, comprising a total area of about 14,600 square miles. Because of the size of counties in Arizona, even though Maricopa and Pinal counties together contain nearly 4.5 million people, most of the area is uninhabited, which gives the MSA an extremely low density compared to other major MSAs in the nation.\\r\\nThe average elevation is about 2,000 feet (610?m), with the highest point being 2,704 feet (824?m).\\r\\nThe Phoenix Metropolitan area is notable for its warm, desert climate. On average, the area receives about 9 inches of rain annually, with less than 1 inch of snow every decade. In total, the region will see about 32 days of measurable precipitation each year. The MSA is one of the sunniest major metropolitan areas, receiving 295 days of sunshine, compared to the national average of 205. The average July high is about 104?F (40?C), with the average January low being about 37?F (3?C), still above freezing. Bestplaces gives the Phoenix Metropolitan Area a comfort index[a] of 44/100, which is also the national average.[8]\\r\\nBelow is a chart showing climate data collected from Sky Harbor Airport. Note that due to the vast area covered by the MSA, climates may differ depending on where in the valley you are located.\\r\\nThe Phoenix Metropolitan area has historically been the center of the state's economy. As with the state of Arizona, the area relied on the 5 C's (copper, cattle, climate, citrus, and cotton) for its economic growth and expansion. However, after World War II, the area entered the manufacturing industry, which spurred the growth of what would eventually be one of the largest urban areas in the nation. Currently, the two largest industries are manufacturing and tourism. About 10 million people visit from other States and Canada each year, due to the area's mild winters and long, sunny days. The technology and service industries currently account for almost 77% of total employment in the region.[13] As well as a strong tourism industry, the Phoenix area has a significant business sector. Several Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies have their international headquarters in the area, including Avnet, PetSmart, Insight Technologies, Apollo Education Group, and Sprouts Farmers Market. Other Fortune 500 companies with significant presence include Banner Health, the state's largest private employer, American Airlines, which merged with Tempe-based US Airways, and Intel, which has a large regional campus in Chandler.[14]\\r\\nThe Metropolitan Area ranks 5th in the nation in economic growth, which is a major comeback from the recession.[15] The unemployment rate of the area is 5.3%, lower than the national rate of 6.3%. It also has slightly higher recent job growth (1.99% compared to 1.18%) and higher projected job growth (38.7% compared to 36.1%). Although the area has significantly higher sales tax rates compared with the nation as a whole (8.3% to 6%), income tax rates are lower than the national average (3.36% to 4.72%). The largest occupation by population is in the office/administrative sector, comprising more than a quarter of all jobs in the region.[16]\\r\\nThe Phoenix Metropolitan Area is served by several controlled-access freeways, including:\\r\\nMany new freeways are planned to be built in the future, either through upgrades of existing roads such as SR 74, SR 85, and Northern Parkway; or through the construction of new freeways where no road existed before such as SR 24, SR 30, I-11, and the South Mountain Freeway portion of Loop 202.\\r\\nMost of the arterial roads in the Phoenix metropolitan area are laid out on a regular grid, following the section lines established in the Public Land Survey System. As a result, arterial roads in cities that had once been geographically separate may have been given different names while occupying the same section line. When these roads were extended to accommodate the growth in the area they eventually merged into a single road while the previous segments retained their existing names. This results in several cases of a road abruptly changing names; for example, Dunlap Avenue in Phoenix becomes Olive Avenue west of 43rd Avenue, in Glendale.\\r\\nAnother quirk of a grid system based upon the Public Land Survey System is due to the occasional corrections in the grid caused by the curvature of the earth. This results in arterial roadways deviating slightly from a straight line, as can be seen in many locations where roads abruptly curve either just north or just south of Baseline Road to follow a new section line.\\r\\nThe majority of the cities in the metropolitan area, as well as unincorporated areas in Maricopa County, observe the addressing system employed by the City of Phoenix. A number of cities, however, retain their own addressing systems with differing reference points, creating the potential for multiple instances of a house number being found on the same named road.\\r\\nIn terms of numbering systems, some roads that continue through multiple cities will switch numbering conventions several times. A drive eastward along Broadway Road, for example, will pass through Goodyear, Avondale, Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa, and Apache Junction, each with their own reference point for address numbering. Though the street does not curve, the direction changes from west to east in each city and back again when moving from one city to the next, causing considerable overlap in numbers.\\r\\n[17][18] Most communities in Maricopa County use the Phoenix-County numbering system, with the point of origin at Central Avenue and Washington Street. In the Phoenix-County system, north-south numbered roads labeled \\"avenue\\", \\"drive\\", and \\"lane\\" are located West of Central Avenue, while those labeled \\"street\\", \\"place\\" and \\"way\\" are located east of Central Avenue. Starting with 579th Avenue[19] in the west near Tonopah the avenues count down with approximately 8 numbers per mile to 19th Avenue and count up again to from 16th Street to 228th Street[20] near Queen Creek in the east. They go, in order from west to east (although not all necessarily exist):\\r\\nThis has been a source of confusion for some newcomers, who might end up, for example, at 91st Avenue and Thunderbird Road, when in fact they intended to go to 91st Street and Thunderbird Road, between 30?minutes and an hour away from one another depending on traffic.\\r\\nOne beneficial quality of this arrangement for unfamiliar travelers is that the major north-south arterial roads are rarely similarly named; the \\"avenue\\" arterials in the West Valley are all odd-numbered and the \\"street\\" arterials in the East Valley are even-numbered, with the exception of 7th Ave. & 7th St., both being major roadways running parallel and each one-half mile from Central Ave.\\r\\nCommunities in Maricopa County that have their own street numbering systems include:\\r\\nAdditional confusion can be encountered in Mesa in its urban core, with east-west numbered avenues and drives counting down from 11th Avenue north towards Main Street),[21] and numbered streets and places counting down from 11th Place south towards Main Street.[22] Then, in the eastern part of the city, north-south streets and places count up from 22nd St east of Gilbert Rd,[23] to 112th Street on the Apache Junction border.[24] Also, numerous trailer parks inside the city limits run their own contradictory variations of the numbered street system.[25]\\r\\nMost communities in Pinal County use the Pinal County street numbering system, whose point of origin is at SR 287 and 11?Mile Corner Road (the intersection of which is known as \\"11 Mile Corner\\"). Exceptions include:\\r\\nNote that Apache Junction continues Mesa's convention of numbered street names by having the north-south sequence continue up from 112th St while simultaneously having east-west numbered avenues south of Apache Trail and east-west numbered streets north of Apache Trail.[26]\\r\\nAmtrak's Los Angeles-New Orleans Sunset Limited served Phoenix from 1971 until it was rerouted on June 2, 1996, to a more southerly route between Tucson and Yuma, Arizona, in order to accommodate the Union Pacific Railroad's desire to abandon a portion of its Phoenix-to-Yuma \\"West Line.\\" This made Phoenix one of the largest cities in the nation without direct passenger service. The designated Phoenix-area stop is in Maricopa, about 40 miles south of downtown Phoenix.\\r\\nA light rail system (dubbed the \\"METRO Light Rail,\\" or \\"Worm\\") runs more than 20?miles from suburban Mesa, through Tempe and into Phoenix, traveling through the downtown area, offering access to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and linking two of the four metro area campuses of Arizona State University. The light rail began public operation on December 27, 2008, and it was projected to initially accommodate 26,000 boardings a day, or more than 8?million boardings in its first year. The Valley Metro Rail boardings has experienced constant growth since the beginning. In the year 2012, the light rail boarded just over 14 million people.\\r\\nMany expansions to the METRO system are currently in the early planning stages, and two are under construction. The Central Mesa extension project, which extends the Main Street line 2? miles from its current terminus at Sycamore to Mesa Drive in Downtown Mesa, has finished construction and opened on August 22, 2015.[27] The Northwest rail project opened March 2016. The project extended the 19th Avenue track from its former terminus at Montebello Ave to Dunlap Avenue, 3 miles north.[28] Many more extensions are funded, with further projects being studied for feasibility.\\r\\nIn 2010, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport was the 24th busiest passenger facility in the world and the 10th busiest in the United States, with more than 38?million passengers using the facility. With three terminal buildings encompassing 120 gates, more than 20 airlines offer daily non-stop flights to destinations throughout the world.\\r\\nThe Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport started commercial passenger flights in 2004. The airport currently provides service to 39 destinations.\\r\\nThere are several municipal and regional airports in the metropolitan area; however, none of them are currently used by commercial airlines for passenger flights. They include, but are not limited to, Glendale Airport, Phoenix Deer Valley Airport, Phoenix Goodyear Airport, Scottsdale Airport, Falcon Field, Chandler Airport, Buckeye Airport, Phoenix Regional Airport, Pleasant Valley Airport, Estrella Sailport, Stellar Airpark, Skyranch at Carefree, Gila River Memorial Airport, Pegasus Airpark.\\r\\nChanges in house prices for the area are publicly tracked on a regular basis using the CaseÿShiller index; the statistic is published by Standard & Poor's and is also a component of S&P's 20-city composite index of the value of the U.S. residential real estate market.\\r\\nCoordinates: 3310N 11202W? / ?33.17N 112.04W? / 33.17; -112.04","input":"What is the population of phoenix metro area?"},{"output":"Melisandre","context":"Jon Snow is a fictional character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. He is a prominent point of view character in the novels, and has been called one of the author's \\"finest creations\\" and most popular characters by The New York Times.[1][2] Jon is a main character in the TV series, and his storyline in the 2015 season 5 finale generated a strong reaction among viewers. Speculation about the character's parentage has also been a popular topic of discussion among fans of both the books and the TV series.\\r\\nJon is introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones as the illegitimate son of Ned Stark, the honorable lord of Winterfell, an ancient fortress in the North of the fictional continent of Westeros. Knowing his prospects are limited by his status, Jon joins the Night's Watch, who guard the far northern borders from the wildlings who live beyond The Wall. As the rest of the Starks face grave adversity, Jon finds himself honor bound to remain with the Watch. In A Clash of Kings (1998), he joins a scouting party investigating the growing threat from the otherworldly \\"Others\\" beyond the Wall, and manages to infiltrate the wildlings. Jon learns of their plans to invade Westeros in A Storm of Swords (2000), and begins to fall in love with the fierce wildling woman Ygritte. He betrays themand Ygrittebefore they can attack, but the Night Watch's victory comes at a heavy price for Jon. Now the Lord Commander of the Watch, he appears briefly in 2005's A Feast for Crows. Jon returns as a prominent character in a A Dance with Dragons (2011), working to negotiate an alliance between the Night's Watch and the wildlings. The growing animosity he has attracted from among the Watch finally catches up with him, and he is forced to face the dire consequences.\\r\\nJon is portrayed by Kit Harington on the HBO series Game of Thrones. His storyline follows the character's plot arc from the novel series, though season 6 and season 7 of the TV adaptation continue on from the events of Martin's latest published installment. Harington was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the role in 2016. He was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television in 2012, 2016 and 2017.\\r\\nIn A Game of Thrones, Jon Snow is introduced as the 14-year-old bastard son of Eddard \\"Ned\\" Stark, Lord of Winterfell,[3][4] and half-brother to Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Jon is described as having strong Stark features with a lean build, long face, dark brown hair and grey eyes.[5] Jon has the surname \\"Snow\\" (customarily used for illegitimate children in the North) and is resented by Ned's wife Catelyn, who views him as a constant reminder of Ned's infidelity.[4] Jon is the same age as Robb and enjoys a warm relationship with his siblings, particularly the tomboy Arya (who resembles Jon and like him does not feel like she fits in). Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow. Still, as somewhat of an outsider, Jon has learned to be independent and to fend for himself when necessary.[3] Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned's refusal to tell him about his mother.[6] At the beginning of the story, Jon adopts the albino direwolf that he names Ghost. He later finds that at times he can \\"inhabit\\" the wolf and share its experiences.[4][5][6]\\r\\nDavid Orr of The New York Times describes Jon as \\"a complex, thoughtful and basically good character\\".[1] David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, the creators and executive producers of the television adaptation of the series, explain that Jon is one of several characters in the series who must \\"face hard truths about the world they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths\\" because \\"The struggle many of them face is how to do that without losing their grip on who they are.\\"[7] Ned Stark teaches all his children about leadership, selflessness, duty and honor. Following his father's example becomes more difficult as Jon faces challenges to his identity as a man, a Stark, and a brother of the Night's Watch.[3][4] Benioff and Weiss note that \\"Jon Snow tries to live with honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered.\\"[7] Writing for Variety about the season 6 episode \\"Battle of the Bastards\\", Laura Prudom suggests that Jon \\"has the same shortcomings\\" as his father: \\"he fights with honor against opponents who are all too willing to use that predictable morality against him\\".[8]\\r\\nJon is a prominent point of view character in the novels, and has been called one of Martin's \\"finest creations\\".[1] Jon is introduced as the illegitimate son of a Northern lord who, realizing he is an outsider in his own family, follows his uncle to the far north and accepts the honorable duty of serving in the Night's Watch. But as much as he is a second-class Stark at home, initially his fellow recruits and brothers of the Watch set him apart as privileged and aloof. Jon adapts, soon proving himself to be wise, compassionate, and a natural leader. Over the course of the series, Jon's loyalty to the Watch and its vows, his family, and even Westeros itself are tested as he becomes embroiled in the efforts of the wildlings from Beyond the Wall to force their way back into the Seven Kingdoms. He lives among them as a spy for the Watch, sympathetic to their cause and becoming romantically involved with the tenacious Ygritte. However he ultimately betrays them to defend The Wall. Later, as the newest Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he pursues an alliance with the wildlings.[3][4][5][9]\\r\\nSeveral reviews of 2011's A Dance with Dragons noted the return to the narrative of Jon, Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister, the three popular characters whom fans had missed most from the previous volume, A Feast for Crows.[2][10][11] These \\"favorites\\" had last been featured 11 years before in Martin's A Storm of Swords.[12] In A Dance with Dragons, Jon's leadership of the Night's Watch is complicated by several unprecedented challenges, including a wildling alliance, the demands of would-be-king Stannis Baratheon and the conflicting factions developing within the Watch itself.[12][13][14] The New York Times notes that \\"Jons leadership is the best hope of Westeros, so naturally hes in imminent danger throughout A Dance With Dragons.\\"[1] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly called Jon's final chapter in A Dance with Dragons \\"a harsh chapter in terms of fan expectations. You go from this total high of Jon giving this rousing speech about going after the evil Ramsay Bolton, to this utter low of his men turning against him.\\"[15] Jon's presence in the forthcoming volume The Winds of Winter is uncertain.[15]\\r\\nAsked what he thought was Jons biggest \\"mistake\\", Martin replied:\\r\\nWere they mistakes? I guess they were mistakes in some ways since they led to him losing control of part of his group. But it might have been wise and necessary decisions in terms of protecting the realm and dealing with the threat of the White Walkers. Im a huge student of history, and all through history theres always this question of whats the right decision. You look back with benefit of hindsight at a battle that was lost and say, The losing general was such an idiot. Was Napoleon a genius for all the battles he won? Or an idiot for losing at Waterloo? Partly Im reacting to a lot of the fantasy that has come before this. Ruling is difficult whether youre a Lord Commander of the Nights Watch or the King of England. These are hard decisions and each have consequences. Were looking at Jon trying to take control of Nights Watch and deal with the wildlings and the threat beyond The Wall.[16]\\r\\nThe identity of Jon's mother has created much speculation among readers of the series, and guessing her identity was the test Martin gave Benioff and Weiss when they approached him in March 2006 about adapting his novels into a TV series.[17][18][19] In the novels, Martin hints that she could be a servant named Wylla, or the noblewoman Ashara Dayne.[20][21][22] The popular fan theorycalled \\"R+L=J\\", an abbreviation of \\"Rhaegar + Lyanna = Jon\\"proposes that Jon is not the son of Ned at all, but is actually the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Ned's younger sister Lyanna Stark.[17][23][24]\\r\\nThough the character is presented as the illegitimate son of Ned Stark,[1][2][25] David Orr voiced the doubt of some readers when he wrote in The New York Times in 2011, \\"Jon Snow is presented as the illegitimate son of the Stark patriarch, although it's uncertain whether Stark is indeed his father.\\"[1] Actor Sean Bean, who portrays Ned in the HBO television series, said when asked in a 2014 interview about returning to the series to appear in flashbacks, \\"I've definitely got some unfinished business that needs to be resolved there. I'm obviously not Jon Snow's dad. And you need that to be revealed at some point, don't you?\\"[26] The uncertainty arises from anecdotal evidence in the texts interpreted by readers to connect the mysterious maternity of Ned's son with the vague backstory of his sister Lyanna.[17][24][27]\\r\\nAs recounted by Ned in A Game of Thrones, at a tourney years before the events of the novel, Rhaegar had shown public favor to Lyanna in the presence of his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell.[28] When Rhaegar and Lyanna disappeared a year later, her father Rickard and eldest brother Brandon confronted Rhaegar's father, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen, demanding that his son return the abducted Lyanna. Aerys had Rickard and Brandon brutally executed for their insolence, inciting Ned and his friend Robert Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End and Lyanna's betrothed, to rebel against Aerys.[29][30] In what later became known as Robert's Rebellion, Aerys was overthrown and Rhaegar was killed by Robert in single combat.[29] After a bloody battle against three of Aerys' Kingsguard protecting the Tower of Joy in Dorne, Ned found Lyanna inside, in a \\"bed of blood.\\" She died shortly after eliciting a promise from Ned.[28][29] Once the war was won, he returned to Winterfell with his illegitimate son Jon.[25]\\r\\nThe R+L=J theory posits that rather than Rhaegar kidnapping Lyanna, they fell in love and ran away together. Living for a year in the Tower of Joy, they conceived a childJon. Rhaegar was killed in battle by Robert, and Lyanna died in childbirth.[31][32] Ned claimed the baby as his own to protect him from Robert, who sought to exterminate all Targaryens out of hatred and to secure his claim to the throne.[32]\\r\\nHBO's Game of Thrones has included in its adaptation many of the \\"hints\\" identified by this theory.[33] In the season 6 finale, \\"The Winds of Winter\\", Bran Stark has a vision of the past which shows Ned reuniting with a dying Lyanna in the Tower of Joy. Lyanna makes him promise to protect her sonJon.[33][34][35] An infographic subsequently posted on the HBO-controlled website MakingGameofThrones.com confirmed Rhaegar as Jon's father.[36][37][38] Journalists later commented on the significance of two plot points in the season 7 episode \\"Eastwatch\\". One of Daenerys Targaryen's dragons, Drogon, approaches Jon calmly and allows the King in the North to pet him, seemingly recognizing him as a Targaryen.[39][40][41] Later, Gilly learns from a book at the Citadel that a High Septon annulled Rhaegar's marriage, and married him to someone else in Dorne, suggesting the possibility that Jon is the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna.[42][43][44] The season 7 finale episode \\"The Dragon and the Wolf\\" confirmed that Jon is indeed the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, and that his birth name is Aegon Targaryen.[45][46]\\r\\nJon Snow is first introduced in A Game of Thrones (1996), as he and his five siblings adopt six orphaned direwolf cubs. As Ned Stark's illegitimate son and with Ned's wife Catelyn despising him, Jon has always felt removed from the rest of the Stark family. He resolves to join the Night's Watch, as his status as a bastard prevents him from holding lands or marrying into a good family. At The Wall, the other recruits resent Jon's aura of superiority, but he makes amends by helping them master swordplay. He also befriends Samwell Tarly, a cowardly lordling who, despite being helpless with weapons, displays an aptitude for book learning. Jon's independence and his compassion for the recruits invite the ire of the harsh master-at-arms Alliser Thorne, who sees Jon as a threat to his authority. Jon gains the notice of the Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont, who names Jon his personal squire and grooms Jon for command. After learning of his father's execution, Jon resolves to desert the Night's Watch and join his half brother Robb, but the other recruits convince Jon to remain loyal to his Night's Watch vows. The next night, Jon saves Mormont's life by killing an undead wight. Mormont then orders a Great Ranging beyond the Wall to learn more of this new threat.[3][6]\\r\\nIn 1998's A Clash of Kings, Mormont leads a party of Night's Watch rangers beyond the Wall to investigate the disappearance of Jon's uncle Benjen, assess the intentions of the wildling leader Mance Rayder and learn more of the threat posed by the Others. Jon is sent out with a scouting party led by Qhorin Halfhand. On the journey, Jon comes upon a wildling lookout and takes the warrior girl Ygritte captive; though told to kill her, Jon lets her escape. Jon and Qhorin are subsequently captured by the wildlings. Qhorin, who faces certain execution at Mance's hands, commands Jon to infiltrate the wildlings and learn their plans, at any cost. Jon pretends to disavow the Night's Watch, and the wildlings force him to fight Qhorin to the death to earn their trust. With Qhorin's silent consent, Jon kills him with the aid of Ghost.[4][47]\\r\\nAs A Storm of Swords (2000) begins, Jon has gained the trust of the wildlings by killing Qhorin, and marches with their host. He learns that Mance intends to breach the Wall and march south to escape the Others, crushing the Night's Watch if necessary. Jon finds himself torn between his growing love for Ygritte and his vows of celibacy. After climbing over The Wall with Ygritte and Tormund Giantsbane, Jon deserts them to warn the Watch of the impending attack. He helps defend Castle Black against the wildlings' initial attacks despite his lack of men and weapons. Ygritte is killed in the fighting, leaving Jon stricken. When the battle is won, Jon is arrested for desertion by Thorne and Janos Slynt, but is freed after convincing the judges of his loyalty. Still suspicious, Thorne orders that Jon be sent to kill Mance under the pretense of parley, but Jon's task is interrupted by the arrival of Stannis Baratheon's army. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and declare him Lord of Winterfell if he will align the North with Stannis. Though greatly tempted at the prospect of becoming a true Stark, Jon again chooses to remain loyal to his Night's Watch vows. With Sam's help, Jon is elected to the position of Lord Commander by acclamation.[2][9][13][48]\\r\\nJon is not a POV character in 2005's A Feast for Crows, but appears briefly from Sam's perspective as he sends Sam away from Castle Black with the Watch's Maester Aemon and Mance's newborn son to protect them from sacrifice by the Red Priestess Melisandre. Jon also gives Sam the specific mission of traveling to the Citadel in Oldtown to become a maester, so that he may better understand the threat of the Others and eventually succeed Maester Aemon.[49]\\r\\nIn A Dance with Dragons (2011), after sending Sam away to the Citadel to become a Maester, Jon successfully negotiates the peaceful surrender of the remains of Mance's army. He promises to settle the wildlings in sparsely populated regions of the North, and allows some of them to join the Watch to garrison the many abandoned Night's Watch fortresses. Many members of the Watch dislike the idea of allowing their ancient enemies through the Wall and welcoming them into their ranks. Jon attempts to juggle the integration of the wildlings, growing unrest within the Night's Watch, and Stannis' attempts to use the Watch in his war for the Iron Throne, while trying to maintain the Watch's strict political neutrality. Already agitated by these unprecedented developments, a group of officers led by Slynt openly defies Jon's orders. When Slynt refuses to submit, Jon executes the man himself. Stannis explains to Jon his plan to attack the Dreadfort, but Jon advises him to instead rally the Mountain Clans and attack Deepwood Motte, the fortress of House Glover recently captured by the Ironborn. Stannis does so, winning the support of the Glovers and the Mormonts. Jon learns that his sister Arya is being married to Ramsay Bolton so that the Boltons may claim Winterfell. Unaware that the bride is actually Jeyne Poole, Jon sends Mance to rescue her while Stannis marches on Winterfell. Jon later receives a letter from Ramsay claiming that Stannis has been defeated and Mance is a prisoner. Ramsay demands hostages, else he will march on the Wall and kill Jon.[1][2][13][12][14] Jon decides to seek out and kill Ramsay himself, but he is stabbed by his Night's Watch brothers seeking to uphold the Watch's neutrality before he can leave Castle Black.[50][51]\\r\\nJon's presence in the forthcoming volume The Winds of Winter is uncertain; when asked in 2011 by Entertainment Weekly \\"Why did you kill Jon Snow?\\", author Martin responded \\"Oh, you think hes dead, do you?\\"[15] Asked later whether Jon was killed or will survive, Martin responded with a laugh, \\"I will not comment on that.\\"[52]\\r\\nMartin told Rolling Stone in 2014 that some early inquiries he received about adapting A Song of Ice and Fire suggested identifying the story's \\"important character\\" and focusing on that individual plot line: Jon and Daenerys Targaryen being the two most popular choices.[53] Martin was not interested in sacrificing so much of the overall story.[53] When the pilot for the HBO adaptation went into production years later, one of the first parts cast was Jon, with Kit Harington announced in the role in July 2009.[54][55] Alfie Allen and Iwan Rheon had also auditioned for the role, and were brought into the show to play Theon Greyjoy and Ramsay Snow instead, respectively.[56][57][58] In October 2014, Harington and several other key cast members, all contracted for six seasons of the series, renegotiated their deals to include a potential seventh season and salary increases for seasons five, six, and seven.[59][60] The Hollywood Reporter called the raises \\"huge\\", noting that the deal would make the performers \\"among the highest-paid actors on cable TV\\".[59] Deadline.com put the number for season five at \\"close to $300,000 an episode\\" for each actor,[60] and The Hollywood Reporter wrote in June 2016 that the performers would each be paid \\"upward of $500,000 per episode\\" for seasons seven and the potential eight.[61] In 2017, Harington became one of the highest paid actors on television and will earn S2?million per episode for the show.[62][63][dubious ÿ discuss]\\r\\nAs the series premiered, TV Guide called Harington a \\"soulful heartthrob\\" whose Jon is idolized by his younger siblings and who \\"seeks purpose\\" by joining the Night's Watch.[64] Creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss later noted that Jon \\"tries to live with honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered\\".[7] They explained that he is one of several characters in the series who must \\"face hard truths about the world they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths. The struggle many of them face is how to do that without losing their grip on who they are.\\"[7] Matt Fowler of IGN wrote in 2013 that while Jon and Daenerys' storylines in season 1 and season 2 \\"felt very separate\\" from the rest of the series' plot, for the first time in season 3, \\"Jon's entire situation felt incorporated into the larger picture.\\"[65] Fowler also added that Jon's \\"oath-breaking romance with Ygritte added a lot of heat to the story\\".[65] In May 2015, International Business Times called Jon \\"clearly the most popular character\\" of the series.[66]\\r\\nIn a 2015 interview Benioff said, \\"The problem with Jon is, hes not a cautious man. It's the problem with him, and also the reason we love him. He is a hero, but heroes are inherently incautious.\\"[67] Weiss added, \\"At the end of the day, Jon is his fathers son, hes a person whos honorable to a fault and does the right thing even when the right thing is extremely dangerous to him personally.\\"[67] In the June 2015 season 5 finale \\"Mother's Mercy\\", Jon is stabbed to death by Alliser Thorne and several men of the Night's Watch after being labeled a traitor.[67] With Martin's 2011 novel A Dance with Dragons vague on Jon's fate, Harington confirmed the character's death in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, saying \\"Ive been told Im dead. Im dead. Im not coming back next season.\\"[68] He added, \\"I loved how they brought [the orphan boy] Olly in to be the person who kills me. I love how the storyline with Thorne was wrapped up.\\"[68] Benioff also said of the episode:\\r\\nThis is obviously a big deal, the death of Jon Snow. This is something we've been thinking about for a long long time, and Alliser kills him, it's kind of like, it's a bad guy killing a good guy. But when it's Olly holding the knife  Olly's not a bad guy. Olly's a kid whos seen just way too much horror way too early, and he makes a decision that's a really hard decision for him but you understand where he's coming from ... It's one of those great conflicts that makes us love the books and this saga, is that it's, ultimately it's not just about good vs evil, it's about people of good intentions who come into conflict with each other because they have very different views of the world, and unfortunately it did not work out well for Jon Snow in this case.[67]\\r\\nWriting for The New York Times, Jeremy Egner called Jon's demise \\"the biggest death on the show\\" since Ned Stark's beheading in season 1.[69] Amid strong fan reaction over Jon's death on social media,[66][70] immediately following the episode journalists began theorizing how the show could resurrect the character.[16][71][72][73][74][75] Nate Jones of Vulture.com noted:\\r\\nIt's easy to see what [other characters'] deaths meant for the series' sprawling narrative: Ned's execution sent the Stark kids adrift in a universe where there was nobody looking out for them, while Robb's murder was the final death knell for the hopes that the saga would ever have a traditional 'happy' ending. What would be accomplished, narratively, by getting rid of Jon permanently right now?[76]\\r\\nA July 2015 sighting of Harington arriving in Belfast, a primary filming location for the series where other actors were arriving for season 6 script read-throughs, prompted further speculation about the character's return.[77][78] However, a story in Vanity Fair pointed out that Charles Dance had been seen in Belfast the previous year after his character Tywin Lannister's death as well, and he only appeared in the first episode of the subsequent season as a corpse.[77][79] Another photo that showed Harington on set in Belfast in a costume that varied from the Night's Watch outfit was published on September 25, 2015.[80] A season 6 Game of Thrones promotional poster released in November 2015 featured a bloodied Jon.[81]\\r\\nJon is resurrected by Melisandre in \\"Home\\", the May 2016 second episode of season 6.[82][83] Though calling it a \\"predictable move\\" for a television series, David Sims of The Atlantic praised the plot development as \\"the right choice\\" for the show's narrative.[84] In a subsequent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Harington said:\\r\\nI'd like to say sorry for lying to everyone. I'm glad that people were upset that he died. I think my biggest fear was that people were not going to care ... But it seems like people had a, similar to the Red Wedding episode, kind of grief about it. Which means something I'm doingor the show is doingis right.[82]\\r\\nJoanna Robinson of Vanity Fair credited Jon's much-discussed cliffhanger death as a primary factor behind Game of Thrones' subsequent 25% ratings increase for season 6.[85] Harington's performance in season 6 earned the actor his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination in July 2016.[86]\\r\\nFollowing the plot of A Game of Thrones, in season 1 Jon, the bastard son of Ned Stark, joins the Night's Watch. He arrives at the Wall, with his direwolf Ghost in tow, to find that the order is a shadow of its former self. Raised to be a talented fighter with a strong sense of justice and honor, Jon is at first contemptuous of his fellow recruits, who are mostly lowborn, untrained criminals and exiles. In \\"Lord Snow\\", he is persuaded by Tyrion Lannister to put aside his prejudices, and helps some of the others with their weapons training. Jon befriends Samwell Tarly, who is more an intellectual than a fighter. Jon takes his vows but is disappointed to be made steward to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont rather than a ranger in \\"You Win or You Die\\". Sam points out that he is likely being groomed for command. Jon saves Mormont from a wight in \\"The Pointy End\\", and in \\"Baelor\\" is given House Mormont's ancestral blade Longclaw, a sword made of Valyrian steel, in thanks. Jon learns of his father's execution for treason in \\"Fire and Blood\\", and though tempted to leave the Wall to help his family, his sense of duty ultimately compels him to stay.\\r\\nIn season 2, Jon witnesses the wildling Craster, a man with many wives who marries his own daughters, sacrifice his newborn son to the White Walkers in \\"The Night Lands\\". Later, as part of a small scouting party led by Night's Watch ranger Qhorin Halfhand, Jon is tasked to kill a wildling prisoner, the woman warrior Ygritte. He finds himself unable to do so in \\"The Old Gods and the New\\", and she escapes, only to capture him with her comrades in \\"The Prince of Winterfell\\". Qhorin orders Jon to pretend to defect and join the wildlings to discover their plans. In \\"Valar Morghulis\\", Qhorin stages a fight and secretly instructs Jon to kill him to gain the wildlings' trust. Jon does, and is taken to meet Mance Rayder, the wildlings' King-Beyond-the Wall.\\r\\nIn season 3, Jon pledges his loyalty to Mance and travels with the wildlings, learning that they intend to scale the Wall and force their way back into Westeros. Jon's feelings for Ygritte begin to intensify, and they have sex in \\"Kissed by Fire\\". When Jon refuses to kill an innocent man to prove his loyalty in \\"The Rains of Castamere\\", he is attacked by the other wildlings, but escapes. In \\"Mhysa\\", he is tracked by Ygritte, who shoots him with three arrows before he is able to escape again and return to Castle Black.\\r\\nIn \\"Two Swords\\", Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt call for Jon's execution for defecting to the wildlings, but Maester Aemon is convinced of Jon's loyalty to the Watch and sets him free. In \\"First of His Name\\", Jon leads an expedition to Craster's Keep, where some men of the Watch have mutinied and murdered Lord Commander Mormont. After defeating the mutineers, Jon is reunited with Ghost. Tormund's wildlings attack Castle Black while Mance's army besieges the Wall in \\"The Watchers on the Wall\\". The wildlings are successfully repelled, though Ygritte is shot and dies in Jon's arms. Before Jon can negotiate with or kill Mance, Stannis Baratheon's army arrives and routs the wildling camp, taking Mance prisoner in the season finale \\"The Children\\".\\r\\nIn \\"The Wars to Come\\", Stannis enlists Jon as an intermediary between himself and Mance, hoping to add the wildling army to his own. Mance refuses to submit to Stannis, and the wildling king is burned at the stake by the red priestess Melisandre. In \\"The House of Black and White\\", Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and make him lord of Winterfell in exchange for his support. Jon is voted the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, initially tying with his nemesis Thorne but having the tie settled by Maester Aemon. Jon's intent to welcome the wildlings into Westeros and grant them lands by the Wall further enrages Thorne's faction of the Watch, who hold a deep seated hatred for the wildlings. In \\"Hardhome\\", Jon travels by ship north of the Wall to the eponymous wildling village, seeking their support for his plan to ally the Night's Watch and the wildlings against the growing threat of the White Walkers. As some the wildling clans board Stannis' ships to travel south, a massive force of wights, led by White Walkers and their Night King, attacks the village. Jon kills a White Walker with Longclaw, learning that weapons forged with Valyrian steel can destroy them completely. Jon and his group barely make it out alive, with only a fraction of the wildling forces. Jon then permits the wildling forces to pass through the Wall into the North. Shortly after returning to Castle Black in the season finale \\"Mother's Mercy\\", Jon is summoned to hear news of his missing uncle Benjen, but is instead stabbed to death by Thorne and his group of mutineers.\\r\\nIn \\"The Red Woman\\", Davos Seaworth, Dolorous Edd, and other brothers of the Watch loyal to Jon barricade themselves in a room with Ghost and Jon's body, and an attack by Thorne and his men is thwarted by the arrival of Tormund and his wildlings. Davos encourages Melisandre to attempt to resurrect Jon in \\"Home\\", and though the ritual at first seems to fail, Jon suddenly awakens. After hanging Thorne, Olly, Bowen Marsh, and Othell Yarwyck for their treason in \\"Oathbreaker\\", Jon gives command of the Watch to Edd and prepares to leave Castle Black. In \\"Book of the Stranger\\", he is reunited with his half-sister Sansa Stark, who has fled her abusive husband Ramsay Bolton and now seeks Jon's aid in crushing the Boltons. Jon is hesitant until a threatening message arrives from Ramsay demanding Sansa's return, and announcing Ramsay's possession of their brother Rickon. Jon, Sansa, Davos, Tormund, and Brienne of Tarth set off to recruit an army to take back Winterfell and rescue Rickon from Ramsay in \\"The Broken Man\\", but their forces grow to only half the size of Bolton's. As the armies face each other in \\"Battle of the Bastards\\", Ramsay murders Rickon to enrage Jon, who rushes in with murderous fury. A devastating battle ensues in which the outnumbered Stark forces are nearly slaughtered, until the Knights of the Vale from House Arryn arrive with Sansa and Petyr Baelish, and attack the Bolton army from the rear. Jon chases Ramsay back into Winterfell and beats him savagely, stopping before killing him. Sansa subsequently feeds Ramsay to his own hounds. In the season finale episode \\"The Winds of Winter\\", Bran Stark has a vision of the past which shows Ned reuniting with a dying Lyanna in the Tower of Joy. She makes him swear to protect her sonJon.[36][37][38] Meanwhile, the Northern lords name Jon the King in the North.\\r\\nAttempting to bolster the North's defenses in \\"Dragonstone\\", Jon is frustrated when his authority is undermined by Sansa, who does not want him to repeat the mistakes that got their father Ned and brother Robb killed. Jon dismisses a message from Cersei Lannister that he swear his allegiance to her. In \\"Stormborn\\", he receives an invitation to Dragonstone from Tyrion on Daenerys Targaryen's behalf. Subsequently, receiving a message from Sam that a hoard of obsidian lies beneath the ancient Targaryen castle, Jon decides to meet Daenerys, leaving a surprised Sansa as his regent. At Dragonstone, he declines swearing fealty to Daenerys in \\"The Queen's Justice\\", and instead asks for her assistance fighting the White Walkers. She demurs, but permits him to mine the obsidian. In \\"Eastwatch\\", Daenerys is surprised when her dragon Drogon approaches Jon and allows the King in the North to pet him. Determined to convince Cersei that their true enemy is the army of the dead, Jon leads an expedition north of the Wall to capture a wight and bring it south to King's Landing. They manage to do so in \\"Beyond the Wall\\", but are surrounded by a horde of the Night King's minions. Daenerys arrives with her dragons, but the Night King kills one of them with an ice spear, forcing the others to flee without Jon. He is saved by the reappearance of his uncle Benjen, who is overtaken by the dead as Jon escapes back to the Wall. Daenerys vows to fight the White Walkers with Jon, and he agrees to swear fealty to her as his queen. In \\"The Dragon and the Wolf\\", the two negotiate a truce with Cersei, who agrees to join them in fighting the Night King's forces. Bran learns that Jon was born Aegon Targaryen, the legitimate son and heir of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Meanwhile, Jon and Daenerys finally give in to their growing attraction for each other and fall into bed together, unaware that they are related by blood.\\r\\nHarington was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the role in 2016.[86][87] He said, \\"It is a serious understatement to say that I am somewhat stunned ... For my work on Game of Thrones to be recognized in this way is an emotional moment for me. I could not be more humbled.\\"[86] Harington was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television for the role in 2012, 2016, and 2017.[88][89][90] His other nominations include the Golden Nymph Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series in 2012,[91] the Young Hollywood Award for Actor of the Year in 2013,[92] and the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2016.[93] IGN also nominated Jon Snow as its Best TV Hero in 2011.[94]","input":"Who is the person who saved jon snow?"},{"output":"Aconcagua","context":"Aconcagua (Spanish pronunciation:?[ako??ka?wa]) is the highest mountain outside Asia, at 6,960.8 metres (22,837?ft), and by extension the highest point in both the Western Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere.[1] It is located in the Andes mountain range, in the Mendoza Province, Argentina, and lies 112 kilometres (70?mi) northwest of its capital, the city of Mendoza, about five kilometres from San Juan Province and 15 kilometres from the international border with Chile. The mountain itself lies entirely within Argentina, immediately east of Argentina's border with Chile.[3] Its nearest higher neighbor is Tirich Mir in the Hindu Kush, 16,520 kilometres (10,270?mi) away. It is one of the Seven Summits.\\r\\nAconcagua is bounded by the Valle de las Vacas to the north and east and the Valle de los Horcones Inferior to the west and south. The mountain and its surroundings are part of the Aconcagua Provincial Park. The mountain has a number of glaciers. The largest glacier is the Ventisquero Horcones Inferior at about 10?kilometres long, which descends from the south face to about 3600?metres in altitude near the Confluencia camp.[4] Two other large glacier systems are the Ventisquero de las Vacas Sur and Glaciar Este/Ventisquero Relinchos system at about 5?kilometres long. The most well-known is the north-eastern or Polish Glacier, as it is a common route of ascent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the name is contested; it is either from the Mapuche Aconca-Hue, which refers to the Aconcagua River and means \\"comes from the other side\\",[3] the Quechua Ackon Cahuak, meaning \\"'Sentinel of Stone\\",[5] the Quechua Anco Cahuac, meaning \\"White Sentinel\\",[2] or the Aymara Janq'u Q'awa, meaning \\"White Ravine\\".[6]\\r\\nThe mountain was created by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate. Aconcagua, used to be an active stratovolcano (from the Late Cretaceous or Early Paleocene through the Miocene), and consisted of several volcanic complexes, on the edge of a basin with a shallow sea. However, sometime in the Miocene, about 8 to 10 million years ago, the subduction angle started to decrease resulting in a stop of the melting and more horizontal stresses between the oceanic plate and the continent, causing the thrust faults that lifted Aconcagua up off its volcanic root. The rocks found on Aconcaguas flanks are all volcanic and consist of lavas, breccias and pyroclastics. The shallow marine basin had already formed earlier (Triassic), even before Aconcagua arose as a volcano. However, volcanism has been present in this region for as long as this basin was around and volcanic deposits interfinger with marine deposits throughout the sequence. The colorful greenish, blueish and grey deposits that can be seen in the Horcones Valley and south of Puente Del Inca, are carbonates, limestones, turbidites and evaporates that filled this basin. The red colored rocks are intrusions, cinder deposits and conglomerates of volcanic origin.[7]\\r\\nIn mountaineering terms, Aconcagua is technically an easy mountain if approached from the north, via the normal route. Aconcagua is arguably the highest non-technical mountain in the world, since the northern route does not absolutely require ropes, axes, and pins. Although the effects of altitude are severe (atmospheric pressure is 40% of sea-level at the summit), the use of supplemental oxygen is not common. Altitude sickness will affect most climbers to some extent, depending on the degree of acclimatization.[8] Even if the normal climb is technically easy, multiple casualties occur every year on this mountain (in January 2009 alone five climbers died).[citation needed] This is due to the large numbers of climbers who make the attempt and because many climbers underestimate the objective risks of the elevation and of cold weather, which is the real challenge on this mountain. Given the weather conditions close to the summit, cold weather injuries are very common.\\r\\nThe Polish Glacier Traverse route, also known as the \\"Falso de los Polacos\\" route, crosses through the Vacas valley, ascends to the base of the Polish Glacier, then traverses across to the normal route for the final ascent to the summit. The third most popular route is by the Polish Glacier itself.\\r\\nNo hard records are kept about Aconcagua ascents, but the Provincial Park reports a success rate of about 60% of climbers who attempt the mountain. About 75% of climbers are foreigners and 25% are Argentinean. Among foreigners, the United States leads in number of climbers, followed by Germany and the UK. About 54% of climbers ascend the Normal Route, 43% up the Polish Glacier Route, and the remaining 3% on other routes.[9]\\r\\nThe routes to the peak from the south and south-west ridges are more demanding and the south face climb is considered quite difficult.\\r\\nThe camp sites on the normal route are listed below (altitudes are approximate).\\r\\nSummit attempts are usually made from a high camp at either Berln or Colera, or from the lower camp at Nido de C܇ndores. All camps are used frequently, namely Plaza de Mulas and Nido de C܇ndores.\\r\\nThe first attempt to reach the summit of Aconcagua by a European was made in 1883 by a party led by the German geologist and explorer Paul Gssfeldt. Bribing porters with the story of treasure on the mountain, he approached the mountain via the Rio Volcan, making two attempts on the peak by the north-west ridge and reaching an altitude of 6,500 metres (21,300?ft). The route that he prospected is now the normal route up the mountain.\\r\\nThe first recorded[2] ascent was in 1897 by a European expedition led by the British mountaineer Edward FitzGerald. FitzGerald failed to reach the summit himself over eight attempts between December 1896 and February 1897, but the (Swiss) guide of the expedition, Matthias Zurbriggen reached the summit on January 14. On the final attempt a month later, two other expedition members, Stuart Vines and Nicola Lanti, reached the summit on February 13.[12]\\r\\nThe east side of Aconcagua was first scaled by a Polish expedition, with Konstanty Narkiewicz-Jodko, Stefan Daszyski, Wiktor Ostrowski and Stefan Osiecki summiting on March 9, 1934, over what is now known as the Polish Glacier. A route over the Southwest Ridge was pioneered over seven days in January 1953 by the Swiss-Argentine team of Frederico and Dorly Marmillod, Francisco Ibanez and Fernando Grajales. The famously difficult South Face was conquered by a French team led by Ren Ferlet?(fr). Pierre Lesueur, Adrien Dagory, Robert Paragot, Edmond Denis, Lucien Berardini and Guy Poulet reached the summit after a month of effort on 25 February 1954.[13][14]\\r\\nThe youngest person to reach the summit of Aconcagua was Tyler Armstrong of California. He was nine years old when he reached the summit on December 24, 2013.[15] The oldest person to climb it was Scott Lewis, who reached the summit on November 26, 2007, when he was 87 years old.[16]\\r\\nIn the base camp Plaza de Mulas (at 4300 meters above sea level) there is the highest contemporary art gallery tent called \\"Nautilus\\" of the Argentine painter Miguel Doura.[17]\\r\\nIn 2014 Kilian Jornet set a record for climbing and descending Aconcagua from Horcones in 12 hours and 49 minutes.[18] The record was broken less than two months later by Ecuadorian-Swiss Karl Egloff, in a time of 11 hours 52 minutes, nearly an hour faster than Kilian Jornet.[19]\\r\\nThe mountain has a cameo in a 1942 Disney cartoon called Pedro.[20] The cartoon stars an anthropomorphic small airplane named Pedro who makes an air mail run over the Andes and has a near-disastrous encounter with Aconcagua (depicted in the film as an anthropomorphic menace).\\r\\nAconcagua is the highest peak of South America and is also considered easy at nearly seven thousand metres.[21] And through that, Aconcagua is believed to have the highest death rate of any mountain in South America ÿ around three a year ÿ which has earned it the nickname, Mountain of Death. More than a hundred people have died on Aconcagua since records began.[22]\\r\\nDue to the improper disposal of human waste in the mountain environment there are significant health hazards[21] that pose a threat to both animals and human beings.[23] Only boiled or chemically treated water is accepted for drinking. Additionally, Ecofriendly toilets are available only to members of an organised expedition, meaning climbers have to be contracted to a toilet service at the base camp and similar camps along the route. Currently, from two base camps (Plaza de Mulas and Plaza Angeritna), over 120 barrels of waste (approx. 22,500?kg) are flown out by helicopter each season.[24] In addition, individual mountaineers must make a payment before using these toilets. Some large organisers will give a price up to US$100, some smaller US$5/day or US$10 for the entire stay. Thus, many independent mountaineers defecate on the mountainside.[21]","input":"What is the tallest mountain in argentina and south america?"},{"output":"Brooklyn","context":"","input":"What is the most populous borough in new york city?"},{"output":"January 10, 2006","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MacBook Pro (sometimes abbreviated as MBP)[1] is a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in January 2006 by Apple Inc.

It replaces the function keys with an interactive, multi-touch \\"Touch Bar\\" and a Touch ID sensor integrated into the Power button.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original 15-inch MacBook Pro was announced on January 10, 2006 by Steve Jobs at the Macworld Conference & Expo.[2] The 17-inch model was unveiled on April 24, 2006.[3] The first design was largely a carryover from the PowerBook G4, but uses Intel Core CPUs instead of PowerPC G4 chips.[4] The 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs the same as the 15-inch aluminum PowerBook G4, but is 0.1 inches (0.25?cm) deeper, 0.4 inches (1.0?cm) wider, and 0.1 inches (0.25?cm) thinner.[5] Other changes from the PowerBook include a built-in iSight webcam and the inclusion of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector designed to detach easily when yanked. These features were later brought over to the MacBook. The optical drive was reduced in size in order to fit into the slimmer MacBook Pro, hence it runs slower than the optical drive in the PowerBook G4 and cannot write to dual layer DVDs.[4][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the original 15- and 17-inch model MacBook Pros come with ExpressCard/34 slots, which replace the PC Card slots found in the PowerBook G4. All first generation 15-inch models have two USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port,[7] while the 17-inch models have three USB 2.0 ports as well as one FireWire 400 port.[8] When first introduced, the MacBook Pro did not come with FireWire 800 or S-Video ports,[5][7] although FireWire 800 was added in the next 15-inch model revision[9] and is present in every version of the 17-inch design.[8] S-Video capability can be attained through the use of a DVI to S-Video adapter.[5] External displays with up to a 2,560?G?1,600 pixel resolution are supported through a dual-link DVI port.[10] All models include a built-in Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0, and 802.11a/b/g.[7][8] Later models include support for the draft 2.0 specification of 802.11n[11] and Bluetooth 2.1.\\r\\nApple refreshed the entire MacBook Pro line on October 24, 2006 to include Intel Core 2 Duo processors.[9] Memory capacity was doubled for each model, to 1?GB on the low-end 15-inch and 2?GB for the high-end 15- and 17-inch models.[9] FireWire 800 was added to the 15-inch models. Hard drive capacity was increased, although video card options stayed the same.[9] The MacBook Pro line received a second update on June 5, 2007 with new Nvidia Geforce 8600M GT video cards and faster processor options.[12][13] LED backlighting was added to the 15-inch model's screen, and its weight was reduced from 5.6 pounds (2.5?kg) to 5.4 pounds (2.4?kg).[13] Furthermore, the speed of the front-side bus was increased from 667?MHz to 800?MHz. On November 1, 2007, Apple added the option of a 2.6?GHz Santa Rosa platform Core 2 Duo CPU as well as reconfigured hard drive options.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 26, 2008, the MacBook Pro line was again updated.[14][15] LED backlighting was added as an option for the 17-inch model.[14] Processors were updated to \\"Penryn\\" cores, which are built on the 45 nanometer process (65 nanometer \\"Merom\\" cores were previously used), and hard drive and memory capacities were increased.[14] Multi-touch capabilities, first introduced with the MacBook Air earlier that year, were brought over to the MacBook Pro's trackpad.[14] When the 15-inch unibody MacBook Pro was introduced on October 14, 2008, the pre-unibody model with the same screen size was discontinued, while the 17-inch pre-unibody model continued to be sold.[16] The original case design was discontinued on January 6, 2009, when the 17-inch MacBook Pro was also updated with unibody construction.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome reviewers applauded the MacBook Pro for its doubling or tripling the speed of the PowerBook G4 in some areas.[4] For example, the 3D rendering program Cinema 4D XL was 3.3?times as fast (2.3 times faster),[4] and its boot-up time was more than twice as quick.[5] The MacBook Pro generally outperformed the PowerBook G4 in performance analyzer utility tests XBench and Cinebench.[5] Reviewers lauded the screen's maximum brightness, 67?percent higher than the PowerBook G4; the excellent horizontal viewing angles; the matte options; and the bright, crisp, and true colors.[6] Although the screen offered fewer vertical pixels (1,440?G?900 in the MacBook Pro instead of 1,440?G?960 in the PowerBook), one reviewer called the screen \\"nothing less than stellar\\".[5] Reviewers praised the new MagSafe power adapter,[4] although one reviewer said it disconnected too easily in some instances.[5] They also praised the backlit keyboard, large trackpad, and the virtually silent operation of the machine.[4][6] The new laptop also offered better wireless performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne reviewer criticized the decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30?percent its original speed.[6] The notebook was also noted for running hot.[4][6] Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks.[5] Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models.[5] Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings.[5] Apple increased the battery capacity by 10?Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60,[5] but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power.[5] Battery life therefore remained about the same as in previous models, at three-plus hours.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuperDrive: 8G DVD-DL discs reads. 4G DVD+/-R & RW recording. 24G CD-R and 10G CD-RW recording (optional for 15-inch)\\r\\nSuperDrive: 4G DVD+R writes, 8G DVD+/-R read, 4G DVD+/-RW writes, 24G CD-R, and 10G CD-RW recording (17-inch)\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 14, 2008, in a press event at company headquarters, Apple officials announced a new 15-inch MacBook Pro featuring a \\"precision aluminum unibody enclosure\\" and tapered sides similar to those of the MacBook Air.[28][29] Designers shifted the MacBook Pro's ports to the left side of the case, and moved the optical disc drive slot from the front to the right side, similar to the MacBook. The new MacBook Pros had two video cards, which the user could switch between: the Nvidia GeForce 9600M GT with either 256 or 512?MB of dedicated memory and a GeForce 9400M with 256?MB of shared system memory.[28] Although the FireWire 400 port was removed, the FireWire 800 port was retained. The DVI port was replaced with a Mini DisplayPort receptacle.[28] The original unibody MacBook Pro came with a user-removable battery; Apple claimed five hours of use,[28] with one reviewer reporting results closer to four on a continuous video battery stress test.[30] Apple said that the battery would hold 80?percent of its charge after 300 recharges.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely follows the styling of the original aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display.[28] The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option is available in the 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed.[32] The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button.[32] The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures.[32] When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad.[33][34][35] The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the MacWorld Expo keynote on January 6, 2009, Phil Schiller announced a 17-inch MacBook Pro with unibody construction. This version diverged from its 15-inch sibling with an anti-glare \\"matte\\" screen option (with the glossy finish standard) and a non user-removable lithium polymer battery.[36] Instead of traditional round cells inside the casing, the lithium-ion polymer batteries are shaped and fitted into each laptop to maximally utilize space. Adaptive charging, which uses a chip to optimize the charge flow to reduce wear and tear, extends the battery's overall life.[36] Battery life for the 17\\" version is quoted at eight hours, with 80?percent of this charge remaining after 1,000 charge-discharge cycles.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 8, 2009, it was announced that the 13-inch unibody MacBook would be upgraded and re-branded as a MacBook Pro,[37] leaving only the white polycarbonate MacBook in the MacBook line.[38] It was also announced that the entire MacBook Pro line would use the non user-removable battery first introduced in the 17-inch MacBook Pro.[39] The updated MacBook Pro 13- and the 15-inch would each have up to a claimed seven hours of battery life, while the 17-inch would keep its eight-hour capacity.[37][39] Some sources even reported up to eight hours of battery life for the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros during casual use,[40] while others reported around six hours.[32] Like the 17-inch MacBook Pro, Apple claims that they will last around 1,000 charge cycles while still containing 80?percent of their capacity.[41] Graphics card options stayed the same from the previous release, although the 13-inch[42] and the base model 15-inch, came with only the GeForce 9400M GPU.[43] The screens were also improved, gaining a claimed 60?percent greater color gamut.[42][43] All of these mid 2009 models also included a FireWire 800 port and all except the 17-inch models would receive an SD card slot.[29] The 17-inch model would retain its ExpressCard/34 slot.[39] For the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Kensington lock slot was moved to the right side of the chassis.[44] In August 2009, Apple extended the \\"matte\\" anti-glare display option to the 15-inch MacBook Pro.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 13, 2010,[46] Intel Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs were introduced in the 15- and 17-inch models, while the 13-inch retained the Core 2 Duo with a speed increase.[46] The power brick was redesigned[33] and a high-resolution display (of 1,680?G?1,050) was announced as an option for the 15-inch models.[34] The 13-inch gained an integrated Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics processing unit (GPU) with 256?MB of shared memory, while the 15- and 17-inch models were upgraded to the GeForce GT 330M, with either 256 or 512?MB of dedicated memory.[46] The 15- and 17-inch models also have an integrated Intel GPU that is built into the Core i5 and i7 processors.[46] The 15-inch model also gained 0.1 pounds (0.045?kg).[34] Save for a third USB 2.0 slot, all the ports on the 17-inch MacBook Pro are the same in type and number as on the 15-inch version.[47] All models come with 4?GB of system memory that is upgradeable to 8?GB.[46] Battery life was also extended further in this update, to an estimated ten hours for the 13-inch and 8ÿ9 hours on the 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pros.[46] This was achieved through both greater power efficiency and adding more battery capacity.[46] One reviewer reported about six hours of battery life through a continuous video battery stress test in the 15-inch[35] and another, who called the battery life \\"unbeatable\\", reported nearer to eight in the 13-inch through their \\"highly demanding battery drain test\\".[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThunderbolt technology, Sandy Bridge dual core Intel Core i5 and i7 (on the 13-inch model) or quad-core i7 (on the 15- and 17-inch models) processors, and a high definition FaceTime camera were added on February 24, 2011. Intel HD Graphics 3000 come integrated with the CPU, while the 15- and 17-inch models also utilize AMD Radeon HD 6490M and Radeon HD 6750M graphics cards. Later editions of these models, following the release of OS X Lion, replaced the dashboard (F4) key with a launchpad key. The chassis bottoms are also engraved differently from the 2010 models.[48] The Thunderbolt serial bus platform can achieve speeds of up to 10?Gbit/s,[49] which is up to twice as fast as the USB 3.0 specification, 20 times faster than the USB 2.0 specification, and up to 12 times faster than FireWire 800.[50] Apple says that Thunderbolt can be used to drive displays or to transfer large quantities of data in a short amount of time.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 11, 2012, Apple showcased its upgraded Mac notebooks, OS X Mountain Lion, and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco.[51] The new MacBook Pro models were updated with Ivy Bridge processors and USB 3.0 ports, and the default RAM on premium models was increased to 8 GB.[52] Following this announcement, the 17-inch model was discontinued. After a media event on October 22, 2013 Apple discontinued all second generation MacBook Pros except for the entry-level 2.5?GHz 13-inch model.[53] Apple discontinued the 13-inch 2nd generation MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016. Prior to its discontinuation it was Apples only product to still include an optical drive and a Firewire port, and only laptop with a hard disk drive and Ethernet port.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome reviewers praised the new laptop's performance and compact size,[30] the quality of the screen, and sturdy unibody build,[30] which allowed easier upgrading of internal components as compared to the original models.[30] Some reviewers also noted that the new MacBook Pro ran more quietly and at cooler temperatures than first generation machines.[30] Others, however, criticized the amount of heat generated by the new design.[55][56]\\r\\n\\r\\nReviewers lamented the loss of a matte screen option for the 2008 unibody MacBook Pro, noting the reflectiveness of the screen in sunlight, even when its brightness was turned all the way up.[30] CNET's Dan Ackerman commented of the mid-2009 models: \\"According to Apple, the new display offers a wider color gamut, and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful, but we wish the same matte-screen option offered on the 17-inch MacBook Pro was available across the line... While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the edge-to-edge glass covering the entire display panel grabs stray light rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions.\\"[32] By 2011, matte screens were offered for both the 15\\" and 17\\" models. Furthermore, the addition of Mini DisplayPort instead of the more popular HDMI was criticized.[30] The relatively low number of ports and lower end technical specifications when compared to similarly priced laptops from other brands were also bemoaned.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nLaptop Magazine's Michael Prospero praised the 2010 15-inch model's display, calling it \\"bright and crisp\\". He further commented, \\"While reflections from the glossy display weren't overwhelming, it's also nice to know there's an antiglare optionthough only for the higher resolution display. Still, colors were bright, blacks were deep and dark, and viewing angles were excellent both vertically and horizontally.\\" He also lauded the quality of the iSight webcam, the responsiveness of the touchpad, the microphone and speakers, as well as the performance of the new CPUs for the 15\\" model and the long battery life. Complaints included the price of the laptop, the low number of USB ports, and the lack of HDMI.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nCNET praised the automatic graphics switching features of the 15- and 17-inch 2010 models as well as the graphics cards themselves. Acclaim was also given to the Core i5 and i7 CPUs, the multi-touch trackpad, and the addition of audio capabilities to the Mini DisplayPort video output.[35] They also called for the addition of HDMI and the Blu-ray optical disc format, saying that most other computers in the MacBook Pro's price range possessed these features.[35] CNET also criticized the option of a higher resolution screen in the 15-inch model, saying that \\"the higher-resolution screen should be included by default.\\"[35]\\r\\n\\r\\n2.53?GHz (T9400) Intel Core 2 Duo Penryn with 6?MB on-chip L2 cacheOptional 2.8?GHz (T9600) with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache\\r\\n\\r\\n2.8?GHz (T9600) (15\\" and 17\\" only) Intel Core 2 Duo Penryn with 6?MB on-chip L2 cacheOptional 3.06?GHz (T9900) with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache (15\\" and 17\\" only)\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the RAM and the hard drive on some generations of MacBook Pro are user serviceable parts, there are aftermarket modifications to enhance the system with up to 16GB of DDR3-1600 RAM (maximum capacity and frequency depend on the hardware in question), 7200-rpm hard drives or third party SSDs.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly and Late 2011 models reportedly suffer from manufacturing problems leading to overheating, graphical issues, and eventually complete GPU and logic board failure. A similar but nonidentical issue affected iMac GPUs which were later recalled by Apple.[88] The problem was covered by many articles in Mac-focused magazines, starting late 2013 throughout 2014.[89][90][91][92][93] In August 2014 the law firm Whitfield Bryson & Mason LLP had begun investigating the problem to determine if any legal claim exists.[94] On October 28, 2014, the firm announced that it has filed a class-action lawsuit in a California federal court against Apple. The lawsuit will cover residents residing in both California and Florida who have purchased a 2011 MacBook Pro notebook with an AMD graphics card. The firm is also investigating similar cases across the United States.[95] On February 20, 2015, Apple instituted the \\"MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues\\"..mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output q{quotes:\\"\\\\\\"\\"\\"\\\\\\"\\"\\"'\\"\\"'\\"}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png\\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png\\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png\\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em} This \\"will repair affected MacBook Pro systems, free of charge\\". The program covered affected MacBook Pro models until December 31, 2016 or four years from original date of sale.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 11, 2012 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, Apple introduced the third generation MacBook Pro, marketed as the \\"MacBook Pro with Retina display\\" to differentiate it from the predecessor model.[51] The new model includes Intel's third generation Core i7 processors (Ivy Bridge microarchitecture), USB 3.0, and a high-resolution 15.4\\" IPS 2880G1800-pixel Retina Display.[52] Other new or changed features include a second Thunderbolt port, a HDMI port, and a thinner MagSafe port, dubbed the \\"MagSafe 2\\".[97] Apple introduced a 13-inch version on October 23, 2012 with specifications similar but slightly inferior to the 15-inch version's, such as less powerful processors.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new models omit Ethernet and FireWire 800 ports, though Apple offers Thunderbolt adapters for both interfaces.[99] They also omit a SuperDrive, making the 15-inch model Apple's first professional notebook since the PowerBook 2400c to ship without a built-in optical drive.[100] Instead of a hard disk drive, the new models ship with a solid state drive housed in a proprietary flash module design rather than a 2.5\\" notebook drive. Apple also claims improved speakers and microphones and a new system for cooling the notebook with improved fans.[97] The new case design does not have a Kensington lock slot, so alternative products are required to physically secure the computer.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retina models also have fewer user-accessible upgrade or replacement options than previous MacBooks. Unlike in previous generations, the memory is soldered onto the logic board and is therefore not upgradable. The solid state drive is not soldered and can be replaced by users, although it has a proprietary connector and form factor.[102] The battery is glued into place; attempts to remove it may destroy the battery and/or trackpad.[103] The entire case uses proprietary pentalobe screws and cannot be disassembled with standard tools. While the battery is glued in, recycling companies have stated that the design is only \\"mildly inconvenient\\" and does not hamper the recycling process.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 13, 2013, Apple announced updated prices and processors for the MacBook Pro with Retina Display and increased the RAM of the high-end 15-inch model to 16 GB.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 22, 2013, Apple updated the line with Intel's Haswell processors and Iris Graphics, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Thunderbolt 2, and PCIe-based flash storage.[106] The chassis of the 13-inch version was slightly slimmed to 0.71 inches (18?mm) to match the 15-inch model. The lower-end 15-inch model only included integrated graphics while the higher-end model continued to include a discrete Nvidia graphics card in addition to integrated graphics.[107] Support for 4K video output via HDMI was added but limited the maximum number of external displays from three to two.[108] On July 29, 2014 Apple announced updated prices and processors for the Haswell MacBook Pro with Retina Display.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 9, 2015, the 13-inch model was updated with Intel Broadwell processors, Iris 6100 graphics, faster flash storage, increased battery life, and a Force Touch trackpad.[110][111] On May 19, 2015, the 15-inch model was also updated with similarly fast flash storage, increased battery life, the Force Touch trackpad, and an AMD Radeon R9 discrete graphics card on the higher-end model.[112][113] The higher-end 15-inch model also added support for dual-cable output to 5120G2880 displays.[114] The 15-inch models were released with the same Intel Haswell processors and Iris Pro graphics as the 2014 models due to a delay in shipment of newer Broadwell quad-core processors.[115] Apple continued to sell the 2015 15-inch model until July 2018.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retina Display MacBook Pro largely follows the design of the previous generation with its aluminum enclosure and separated black keys. The most apparent body changes are a thinner chassis and a display with a redesigned hinge and thinner bezel and the removal of the internal optical drive. The power button is moved from the upper right corner of the chassis onto the keyboard, taking the place of the optical disc eject button.[117] At 0.71 inches (18?mm) thick, the 15-inch model is 25?percent thinner than its predecessor. The model name is no longer placed at the bottom of the screen bezel; instead, it is found on the underside of the chassis, similar to an iOS device. It is the first Macintosh laptop to not have its model name visible during normal use, as every prior laptop had its model name on the screen bezel or keyboard.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third generation MacBook Pro received positive reviews of the Retina Display, flash storage and power. It was criticized, however, for its high price and lack of an Ethernet port and optical drive. Roman Loyola of Macworld said that the Retina MacBook Pro was \\"groundbreaking\\" and made people \\"rethink how they use technology\\". He praised the inclusion of USB 3.0 and the slimmer body.[119] Dan Ackerman of CNET commented \\"I've previously called the 15-inch MacBook Pro one of the most universally useful all-around laptops you can buy. This new version adds to that with HDMI, faster ports, and more portability. But it also subtracts from that with its exclusion of an optical drive and Ethernet port, plus its very high starting price. The Pro and Retina Pro are clearly two laptops designed for two different users, and with the exception of all-day commuters who need something closer to a MacBook Air or ultrabook, one of the two branches of the MacBook Pro family tree is still probably the most universally useful laptop you can buy.\\"[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nJoel Santo Domingo of PC Magazine gave the MacBook Pro an \\"Editor's Choice\\" rating. He praised its \\"brilliant Retina display\\", the thin design, port selection and speedy storage, and highlighted the expandability via Thunderbolt ports which support up to seven devices each.[121] David Pogue of The New York Times praised the 15-inch model's screen, keyboard, sound, start-up time, cosmetics, battery life, storage, and RAM capacity. They criticized the lack of a SuperDrive, pricing, and the MagSafe 2 power connector's lack of backwards compatibility with the older MagSafe design.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retina Display on the MacBook Pro have been criticized for \\"image retention\\", specifically for displays manufactured by LG.[123][124]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, one year after the introduction of the fourth generation of the MacBook Pro, the original lead developer of Tumblr Marco Arment wrote an evocative article in which he declared the third-generation MacBook Pro the best laptop ever made.[125] The sentiment was shared by many users of various social platforms.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the battery is glued in and cannot be easily disassembled for recycling (an EPEAT requirement), Apple received criticisms about the machine's ability to be recycled. Greenpeace spokesman Casey Harrell said Apple \\"has pitted design against the environmentand chosen design. They're making a big bet that people don't care, but recycling is a big issue.\\"[127] Wired also criticized Apple's recyclability claims, stating \\"[t]he design may well be comprised of 'highly recyclable aluminum and glass'but my friends in the electronics recycling industry tell me they have no way of recycling aluminum that has glass glued to it like Apple did with both this machine and the recent iPad.\\"[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.6?GHz (i7-3720QM) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cacheOptional 2.7?GHz (i7-3820QM) with 8?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.9?GHz (i7-3520M) dual-core Intel Core i7 Ivy Bridge processor with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 3.0?GHz (i7-3540M) dual-core Intel Core i7 Ivy Bridge with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.6?GHz (i5-4288U) dual-core Intel Core i5 Haswell with 3?MB shared L3 cacheOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-4558U) dual-core Intel Core i7 Haswell with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i5-4308U) dual-core Intel Core i5 Haswell with 3?MB shared L3 cacheOptional 3.0?GHz (i7-4578U) dual-core Intel Core i7 Haswell with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.9?GHz (i5-5287U) dual-core Intel Core i5 Broadwell with 3?MB shared L3 cacheOptional 3.1?GHz (i7-5557U) dual-core Intel Core i7 Broadwell with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.5?GHz (i7-4870HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)Optional 2.8?GHz (i7-4980HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.7?GHz (i7-3740QM) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cacheOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-3840QM) with 8?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.3?GHz (i7-4850HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)Optional 2.6?GHz (i7-4960HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.5?GHz (i7-4870HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)Optional 2.8?GHz (i7-4980HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\n\\r\\nApple unveiled fourth generation 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro models during a press event at their headquarters on October 27, 2016. All models, except the baseline 13-inch model, introduced the Touch Bar, a multi-touch enabled OLED strip built into the top of the keyboard in place of the function keys. The Touch Bar models also include a sapphire-glass covered Touch ID sensor at the right end of the Touch Bar which doubles as a power button. The models also introduce a \\"second-generation\\" butterfly mechanism keyboard that provided more travel than the first iteration implemented on the Retina MacBook. The 13-inch model has a trackpad that is 46% larger than its predecessor while the 15-inch model has a trackpad twice as large as the prior generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll ports have been replaced with either two or four combination USB-C 3.1 ports that support Thunderbolt 3 and dual DisplayPort 1.2 signals,[142] any of which can be used for charging.[143] The MacBook Pro is incompatible with some older Thunderbolt 3 certified peripherals,[144][145] including Intel's own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices.[146] Furthermore, macOS on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of Thunderbolt 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them.[147] Devices using HDMI, previous generation Thunderbolt, and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro.[143][148][149] The models come with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, although TOSLINK functionality of older generation MacBook Pros has been removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther updates to the MacBook Pro include dual and quad-core Intel \\"Skylake\\" Core i5 and i7 processors, improved graphics, and displays that offer a 25% wider color gamut, 67% more brightness, and 67% more contrast. All versions are able to output to a 5K display, with the 15-inch models capable of two. The 15-inch models include a discrete Radeon Pro 450, 455 or 460 graphics card in addition to the integrated Intel graphics. Additionally, Apple introduced a cheaper lower-end 13-inch model which lacks the Touch Bar in favor of function keys, and has only two USB-C ports. The flash storage in the Touch Bar models is soldered to the logic board and is not upgradeable, while in the 13-inch model without Touch Bar, it is removable, but not replaceable, as it is a proprietary format of SSD storage.[150][151]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 5, 2017 Apple updated the line with Intel Kaby Lake processors and newer graphics cards. Additionally, the 13-inch model now comes with a 128GB storage option, down from the base 256GB storage.[152] On July 12, 2018 Apple updated the Touch Bar models with Intel Coffee Lake quad-core processors in 13-inch models and six-core processors in 15-inch models, updated graphics cards, third-generation butterfly keyboards, Bluetooth 5, T2 SoC Chip, True Tone display technology, and larger capacity batteries. The 15-inch model can also be configured with up to 4TB of storage, 32GB of DDR4 memory and a Core i9 processor.[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth generation MacBook Pro follows the design of the previous two generations with an all-metal unibody enclosure and separated black keys. A few apparent design changes are a thinner chassis, thinner screen bezel, larger trackpad, the OLED Touch Bar, and shallower butterfly mechanism keyboard with less key separation than the previous models. The speakers grilles have been relocated to the sides of the keyboard on the 13-inch variant. Tear downs show that the speaker grilles on the 13-inch model with Touch Bar are \\"largely cosmetic\\", and that sound output mostly comes through the side vents.[154] The fourth generation MacBook Pro comes in two finishes, the traditional silver color and a darker \\"space gray\\" color. The MacBook Pro model name returns to the bottom of the screen bezel in Apple's San Francisco font after being absent from the third generation. As with the Retina MacBook, the new models replace the backlit white Apple logo on the rear of the screen with a glossy black opaque version.\\r\\n\\r\\nMagSafe, a magnetic charging connector, has been replaced with USB-C charging.[143] Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the users field of view to indicate the device's charging status, the USB-C charger has no visual indicator. Instead, the MacBook Pro emits a chime when connected to power.[143] The Macintosh startup chime that has been used since the first Macintosh in 1984 is now disabled by default. The laptop now boots automatically when the lid is opened.[143]\\r\\n\\r\\nArs Technica noted that the second-generation keyboard with firm keys was a \\"drastic departure\\" from previous Retina MacBook keyboards. It further noted that resting palms may brush the trackpad occasionally causing inadvertent cursor jumps onscreen as the laptop interprets this as input, without one's hands or wrists actually resting on it.[143] Also noted was an increase of bandwidth and approximately 40 percent increased read speed of the flash storage.[143] Engadget praised the thinner, lighter design, improved display and audio, and increased speed of the graphics and flash storage, but criticized the lack of ports and price.[155] Wired praised the display, calling it \\"the best laptop display I've ever seen\\", as well as praising the Touch Bar, though it criticized the need of adapters for many common connectors.[156] Likewise, The Verge concluded that \\"using [the new MacBook] is alienating to anyone living in the present. I agree with Apple's vision of the future. I'm just not buying it today.\\"[157]\\r\\n\\r\\nEngadget voiced their concerns that \\"by doing things like removing full-sized USB ports, the memory card reader and even the Function row, Apple seems to have forgotten how many of us actually work\\".[158] Heavy keyboard users criticized the Touch Bar, noting that command-line tools like Vim rely on keyboard usage, and the Touch Bar does not provide the tactile feedback necessary for \\"blind\\" usage of Function keys.[159] Miriam Nielsen from the Verge said about the Touch Bar experience: \\"When I tried to intentionally use the Touch Bar, I felt like a kid learning how to type again. I had to keep looking down at the bar instead of looking at the images I was actually trying to edit.\\"[160] She also pointed out that after learning the Touch Bar one cannot work as efficiently on any other computer. Developers have their share of headaches because they cannot rely on the Touch Bar being present on every machine that runs their software. Even if Apple makes the Touch Bar an integral part of macOS, it will take \\"many years\\" for it to become ubiquitous, in the meantime anything in the Bar needs to be available through another part of the interface.[161]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther items of critique were non-compatibility between Thunderbolt 2 and 3 devices, frequently unpleasant fan whine noises in idle CPU states on the larger screen (15\\") models were reported, where the two integrated fans run all the time by default.[citation needed] The coprocessor powering the touch bar and higher TDP of the stronger CPU models are responsible for this behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battery life of the new models also received mixed reception, with outlets reporting inconsistent battery life and inaccurate estimates of time remaining on battery by the operating system. Apple addressed the latter by hiding the display of estimated battery time remaining entirely in a macOS update.[162][163] Consumer Reports did not initially recommend the 2016 MacBook Pro models, citing inconsistent and unpredictable battery life in its lab testing (which involves the consecutive loading of multiple websites). However, Apple and Consumer Reports found that the results had been affected by a bug caused by disabling caching in Safari's developer tools. Consumer Reports performed the tests again with a patched macOS, and retracted its original assessment.[164][165]\\r\\n\\r\\niFixit gave the models score of 1 out of 10 for repairability, noting that memory, the processor, and flash storage are soldered to the logic board, while the battery is glued to the case. The entire assembly uses proprietary pentalobe screws and cannot be disassembled with standard tools.[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nA report by AppleInsider has claimed that the updated butterfly keyboard fails twice as often as previous models, often due to particles stuck beneath the keys.[166] Repairs for stuck keys have been estimated to cost more than $700.[167] In May 2018, \\r\\ntwo class action lawsuits were filed against Apple regarding the keyboard issue with one alleging a \\"constant threat of nonresponsive keys and accompanying keyboard failure\\" and accusing Apple of not alerting consumers to the issue.[168][169] In June 2018, Apple announced a Service Program to \\"service eligible MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards, free of charge\\".[170] The 2018 models added a membrane underneath keys to prevent malfunction from dust.[171]\\r\\n\\r\\nTesting on the 2018 Core i9 15-inch model shows thermal throttling slows performance, according to PC Magazine \\"the Core i9 processor Apple chose to use inside the MacBook Pro (i9-8950K) has a base clock frequency of 2.9GHz, which is capable of bursting up to 4.8GHz when necessary. However, testing carried out by YouTuber Dave Lee makes it clear the Core i9 can't even maintain 2.9GHz, let alone 4.8GHz. In fact, it ends up running at 2.2GHz due to the heat generated inside the chassis forcing it to throttle... This isn't a problem with Intel's Core i9, it's Apple's thermal solution.\\"[172] On July 24, Apple released a software fix for the new 2018 MacBook Pros which addressed the thermal throttling issue. Apple said \\"there is a missing digital key in the firmware that impacts the thermal management system and could drive clock speeds down under heavy thermal loads on the new MacBook Pro\\".[173]\\r\\n\\r\\nA \\"limited number\\" of 13-inch MacBook Pro units without Touch Bar, manufactured between October 2016 and October 2017, may have the built-in battery expanded, which is also known as \\"swelling\\". Apple initiated a free replacement program for eligible units.[174]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome users are reporting kernel panics on 2018 MacBook Pro units. The T2 chip may be to blame for this issue. Apple is already aware of the issue and performing an investigation.[175]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther than the kernel panic issues, there are user reports about the speaker crackling issues on the 2018 MacBook Pros.[176]\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.4?GHz i7-6660U, up to 3.4 GHz, 4?MB L3 cache[189]\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 3.1?GHz i5-6287U, up to 3.5 GHz, 4?MB L3 cache[191]Optional 3.3?GHz i7-6567U, up to 3.6 GHz, 4?MB L3 cache[192]\\r\\n\\r\\n2.7?GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 Skylake (6820HQ), up to 3.6?GHz, 8MB L3 cache[194]\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.9?GHz i7-6920HQ, up to 3.8 GHz, 8?MB L3 cache[195]\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.5?GHz i7-7660U, up to 4.0 GHz, 4?MB L3 cache\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 3.3?GHz i5-7287U, up to 3.7 GHz, 4?MB L3 cacheOptional 3.5?GHz i7-7567U, up to 4.0 GHz, 4?MB L3 cache\\r\\n\\r\\n2.9?GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake (7820HQ), up to 3.9?GHz, 8MB L3 cache[196]\\r\\nOptional 3.1?GHz i7-7920HQ, up to 4.1 GHz, 8?MB L3 cache\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.7?GHz i7-8559U, up to 4.5 GHz, 8?MB L3 cache[198]\\r\\n\\r\\n2.6?GHz six-core Intel Core i7 Coffee Lake (8850H), up to 4.3?GHz, 9 MB L3 cache[200]\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 2.9?GHz i9-8950HK, up to 4.8 GHz, 12?MB L3 cache[201]\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 16 GB RAM configuration available at time of purchase only\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 16 GB RAM configuration available at time of purchase only\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 16 GB RAM configuration available at time of purchase only\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional 32 GB RAM configuration available at time of purchase only\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD Radeon Pro 450 with 2 GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching (2.6 GHz)\\r\\nConfigurable to Radeon Pro 455 with 2 GB of GDDR5 memory, or Pro 460 with 4 GB of GDDR5 memory\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD Radeon Pro 555 with 2 GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching (2.8 GHz)\\r\\nConfigurable to Radeon Pro 560 with 4 GB of GDDR5 memory\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD Radeon Pro 555X with 4 GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching (2.2 GHz)\\r\\nConfigurable to Radeon Pro 560X with 4 GB of GDDR5 memory\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD Radeon Pro 455 with 2 GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching (2.7 GHz)\\r\\nConfigurable to Radeon Pro 460 with 4 GB of GDDR5 memory\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD Radeon Pro 560 with 4 GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching (2.9 GHz)\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD Radeon Pro 560X with 4 GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching (2.6 GHz)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe macOS operating system has been pre-installed on all MacBook Pros since release, starting with version 10.4.4 (Tiger).[2] Along with OS X, iLife has also shipped with all systems, beginning with iLife '06.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MacBook Pro comes with the successor to BIOS, Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 1.1. EFI handles booting differently from BIOS-based computers,[208] but provides backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations. In addition to OS X, the Microsoft Windows operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software.[76][209] Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially supported.[210] This is made possible by the presence of the Intel architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS emulation Apple has provided on top of EFI.[211][212]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the MacBook Pro uses a different hardware platform from earlier PowerPC (PPC)-based Macintoshes, versions of OS X prior to Lion can run PPC applications only via the Rosetta emulator, which exacts some performance penalty, cannot emulate some lower-level PPC code, and does not support 64-bit (G5 specific) PPC features.[213] Rosetta is not present in Lion and later, so PPC applications cannot be run under those versions of OS X.[214]","input":"When did apple release the first macbook pro?"},{"output":"48-card deck","context":"Pinochle (English:  /?pi?n?k?l/) or binocle (sometimes pinocle, or penuchle) is a  trick-taking card game typically for two to four players and played with a 48-card deck. It is derived from the card game bezique; players score points by trick-taking and also by forming combinations of cards into melds. It is thus considered part of a \\"trick-and-meld\\" category which also includes the game belote. Each hand is played in three phases: bidding, melds, and tricks. The standard game today is called \\"partnership auction pinochle.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPinochle derives from the game bezique. Its name comes from the French word binocle meaning \\"eyeglasses\\".[1] The word is also possibly derived from the French word binage for the combination of cards called \\"binocle\\".[2] This latter pronunciation of the game was adopted by German speakers. German immigrants brought the game to America, where it was later mispronounced and misspelled \\"pinochle.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAuction pinochle for three players has some similarities with the German game skat, although the bidding is more similar to that of bid whist.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War I, the city of Syracuse, New York outlawed the playing of pinochle in a fit of anti-German sentiment.[4] Pinochle was the favorite card game of American Jews and Irish immigrants[citation needed], while skat was the preferred game of a majority of German immigrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pinochle deck consists of two copies of each of the 9, 10, jack, queen, king, and ace cards of all four suits, for 48 cards per deck. Aces are always considered high. Pinochle follows a nonstandard card ordering. The complete ordering from highest to lowest is A, 10, K, Q, J, 9. The game can also be played using standard ranking with a simple change to scoring.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, the deck had to be composed by combining two poker, piquet or euchre decks and removing unneeded cards (a piquet deck does not have the 2-6, making it easier to modify, and a euchre deck is exactly half a pinochle deck), but with the game's popularity in the United States in the early 1900s, a single boxed deck with the necessary cards was marketed, and these specialized pinochle decks are now widely available in similar styles to common 52-card counterparts. Variants of pinochle can be played with five, six, eight or more players. These larger variations can combine two pinochle decks called a \\"double deck\\". The double deck can also be used when playing with four players; hand sizes, average scores and minimum bids are doubled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game is played with a deck of 48 cards and four players; one player is the dealer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the shuffle, the dealer will offer a cut to the player on their right, then distribute the cards. All the cards are dealt in partnership pinochle. In variations for odd numbers of players like three, a \\"widow's hand\\" (also called a \\"kitty\\", \\"talon\\", or \\"stock\\") of cards remain. Traditionally, the deal is done clockwise, dealing a packet of three or four cards at a time, starting with the player to the left (the eldest hand) and ending with the dealer. The deal rotates clockwise, so the dealer's left-hand opponent will deal next.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn auction pinochle, players bid for the points they predict their hand could earn. The highest bidder earns the right to declare the trump suit. One of the players, usually the player to the left of the dealer, or the dealer themselves, is obligated to open with a first bid. The size of bids is based on the point scale and number of decks used; traditionally, points are in multiples of 10, thus a minimum opening bid might be agreed to be 100[5] or 250.[6] However, many alternate scoring rules drop the unnecessary trailing zero; in that case, bids of 10 and 25, respectively, have the same values. When a player has the turn to bid, the player may either bid or pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach bid must be greater than the previous one, and be a multiple of 10 or 25 (if playing without trailing zeroes, the bid must be one or two greater respectively). When a player passes, they can no longer bid. The auction ends when all subsequent players in rotation have passed after the last bid. The last bid becomes the \\"contract\\". The player that made this final bid will then declare trump in the suit that is desired. In some house rules, trump cannot be declared in any suit not containing a \\"run\\", \\"marriage\\" or \\"dix\\" meld.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order for the winning bidder to win the hand, the combined total of melding and trick points must be equal to or greater than the winning bid. Thus bidding involves anticipating the points that will be accumulated from melds and from the points accumulated from winning tricks. If the combined score is lower than the bid, then the bidding team or player has been \\"set\\". This means that the total bid amount is subtracted from the total game score, often accompanied by losing the points scored in meld for that hand as well. This can result in a negative score.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA related though different style of bidding is for the players to bid individually, and partners' bids are then summed. The winning bid only decides trump; both (or all) teams' bids become their contract, meaning any team can score or be set. This creates a more balanced game.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some versions of pinochle, after the bid has been taken and trump declared in a partnership game, the bid winning team exchanges cards. It may be two, three, or four cards, depending on the version of the game. The partner of the bid winner passes first. The objective of the partner is either to add to the total points in meld or to pass trick-winning cards. After receiving the cards, the bid winner examines what will create the strongest hand and then discards an equal number of cards back to their partner. Variations are for the bid winner and partner to exchange the designated number of cards simultaneously, or for no passing to occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelding consists of displaying specific combinations of cards to all players. Typically this is done by placing the combination of cards face up on the playing surface until all players have had the opportunity to examine them. All players meld after the bid winner shows meld first. The types of melds include \\"arounds\\", \\"marriages\\", \\"flushes\\" and \\"pinochles\\". These melds are placed under \\"headings\\"  where a card which is melded under a particular heading can be used again under another heading, but cannot be melded again under the same heading.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group melds containing four of the same face cards?ÿ ace, king, queen or jack?ÿ must include one card from each of the different suits. They are scored as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marriages and flush are the \\"sequence melds\\":\\r\\n\\r\\nA marriage in each suit is worth 240 or 24 total points, which is nothing more than the sum of the marriages, plus kings around and queens around.  As a shortcut, this is called a \\"roundtable\\", \\"marriages around\\", \\"round house\\", or a \\"round robin\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pinochle and dix are the \\"special melds\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the most common form of the game (see variations below), any one card may be used in only one meld of each type. Thus, a queen can be used in one marriage with one king, regardless of if the player has the other king of the same suit. However, a queen can be used to score a marriage and a pinochle if the player also has the correct jack.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the melds are displayed, the points are counted and each player totals their individual meld scores.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause all of these values are multiples of ten, one can arrive at simplified values by removing the trailing zero from each point total.  For instance, a pinochle has a simplified score of 4, a double Pinochle would score 30.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn playing cards for tricks, there are strict rules of forced play, which limit a player's ability to strategically retain high cards. The high bidder leads the play with the first card, which can be any card in the contract winner's hand, although some rules require the first card led to be a trump card. Then there are two variations of following suit depending if you are playing post-1945 or pre-1945 rules.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the pre-1945 rules, every player must follow the lead suit if possible. Usually every player must play a winning card against those played so far, if it is possible to do so, even when the current player expects a later player to win the hand with a better card. The only exception is if a player played a trump card when trump was not the suit led. In that case, those following that player may play any card of the lead suit, since they must follow the lead suit but are already losing to the player who played trump.  Likewise, if a player cannot follow suit, but has trump, they must play trump. Again, if a player does not have any cards of the lead suit and can play a trump card higher than any other trump played so far, the player must do so, even if the player expects that a later player will beat the card. If another trump has already been played that a player cannot beat, then they can play any trump in their hand, but they still must play a trump card if they can. Only when a player has no cards in suit, and has no trump, can the player choose to play any card in their hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost books of post-1945 rules say that unless trump is led, there is no requirement to try to win the trick. It is only when trump is led that \\"heading\\" the trick is mandatory. In pinochle circles and tournaments the post-1945 rules are played about half of the time according to Pagat and Hoyle.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf two identical cards are played, the first one outranks the second.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first trick, the winner of each trick leads the first card for the next trick, until all the cards are played.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoints are scored based on the tricks won in the hand. There are several ways to count up the points for play, but they always add up to 250 points. The last trick is always worth an additional 10 points added to any existing points in the actual trick cards. The classic counting system of pinochle is where aces are worth 11, tens are worth 10, kings are worth four, queens are worth three, jacks are worth two, and nines are worth zero. This method takes longer to count the score at the end of each hand. \\r\\n\\r\\nA simpler method is to count aces and tens for 10 points, kings and queens for five points, and jacks and nines are worth zero.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn even simpler method has aces, tens, and kings worth 10 (and known as  \\"counters\\"), and everything else zero (\\"garbage\\"). Since all points are multiples of ten in the third method, most players drop the redundant zero. Aces, tens, and kings won in tricks are worth one point. The meld scoring can also avoid the zero in the tenth place. Melds like 1,000 aces are thus worth 100. The terms \\"1,000 aces\\", \\"800 kings\\" and so on are often used, even though the point values are one-tenth.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo-handed pinochle[8] is the original pinochle game, while partnership, auction, and all other variants are derived from it. It is the game most similar to the original bezique game, whence pinochle derived. The only significant difference in its rules from bezique is the scoring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original version of pinochle involves a partial deal of twelve cards to both players in packets of four, leaving a stock of 24 cards. A player can score one meld after each trick won of the first 12 tricks. Melded cards can even be used to win tricks. After each trick, players draw one card from the stock into their hand starting with the trick-winning player. For the last 12 tricks, melds are taken into each player's hand and are no longer announced by the player who wins the trick. The traditional trick-taking rules apply only for these last 12 tricks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn variations of two-handed play, no cards are initially dealt, a distinction from all other variations. Instead, the entire deck is placed face-down on the playing surface between the two players to form the widow. One player begins the hand-building process by drawing the top card of the widow. The player can either keep that card for her or his hand or reject the card. If the player chooses to hold the initial card, the player then draws a second card from the widow, then places it face-down, without looking at it, creating a discard pile. If the player rejects the first card, the card becomes the first card in the discard pile. The second card drawn from the widow must be kept, regardless of whether she or he preferred the first card. Players alternate turns in this hand-building process until all cards are chosen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith bidding, the player winning the bid declares trump, then lays all meld face-up on the table. The other player shows her or his melds as well. Meld points are tallied, and players return meld cards to their hands. Some varieties accept a \\"round house\\", kings and queens of each suit, and earn a bonus 10 points awarding a total of 250 points.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrick-taking commences and continues until all held cards have been played. One variation has no \\"leading\\" requirement for the bid winner or subsequent trick winner to lead a specific card, however the rules of \\"following\\" are still observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen adding counters, cards from each player's discard pile are included in totals for a total of 240 counters per round, plus one counter for winning the final trick.   One variation to make it more difficult for the bid-winning player, the discard pile created by drawing cards is used by the non-bidding player to score towards tricks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Three-handed pinochle[8] each player plays for him or herself. The dealer deals 15 cards to each player and three cards to the kittya separate pile in the middle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll players review their cards and silently determine their bids. The player to the dealer's left initiates the bidding process. If the player has a meld, he or she is required to open the bidding; otherwise, they may pass or bid. If he or she passes, the obligation to bid passes to the next player, if meld is held. Once a player passes, he or she is out of the auction.\\r\\n\\r\\nBidding begins at 20, or as little as 19 if dealer,  and increases in multiples of 1. The highest bidder wins the auction and turns up the three-card kitty for all to see. The three widow cards are placed in the bid winner's hand. The bid winner then declares trump and lays down meld. The other two players also lay meld face-up for count. After the appropriate points have been tallied the bid winner must set aside any three cards that have not been melded. This will reduce the bid winner's hand to 15 cards. For all three players, meld is now returned to each respective player's hand, and the round is played. During the round, a player must take at least one trick to \\"save one's meld\\", even if the trick contains no points; otherwise, no meld points will be counted for that player during that round.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all tricks are taken, counters are tallied for each player. The three discards by the highest bidder count toward their counter score for the hand, so there is always a total of 25 points for the trick score among the three players. If the highest bidder fails to make their contract by adding meld points and trick points from the play, then their score is negative the amount of the bid for that hand. The meld count is cancelled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game is won when one player reaches 100 points. It is possible for two or all three players to go over 100 on the same hand. There are three methods of resolving ties:\\r\\n\\r\\nAny time a player accidentally misplays during the play portion of the hand, it is called a renege. There are various forms of misplay:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the bidder reneges, they automatically takes a double set and the amount of the bid is subtracted from their score. The two opposing players get to count their meld points and the remainder of the hand is thrown in.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf either of the two nonbidders misplay, the bidder automatically makes their bid. The bidder gets to score the amount of their bid and meld, the player that misplayed loses all meld and takes a single set, and the third player scores only their meld.\\r\\n\\r\\nCard-Fault Misdeal\\r\\n\\r\\nIf at any point during melding or play it is determined that a non-standard deck is being used, any player may declare a card-fault misdeal.  This results in the nullification of the entire hand including all meld and points obtained.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar to three-handed pinochle, cutthroat is a simple modification.  The dealer deals the entire deck out (16 cards to each player),  in packets of four.  The player to the left of the dealer begins the bidding once meld has been silently determined by all players.  Play continues normally in terms of scoring and trick taking.  The only way to win in cutthroat pinochle, however, is to \\"bid and out\\", or to have taken the bid and surpassed the predetermined winning score.  It is then possible for multiple players to go over the winning score, yet if none has taken a bid and met the resulting contract, a win has not happened and play continues.  It is also possible for a person to lose with the high score if they do not take a winning bid.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour-handed pinochle, or \\"partnership pinochle\\"[8] is played with two teams of two players each. Partners are seated opposite from each other. Each player is dealt 12 cards. The opening bid is typically 150, but can be a higher agreed on value. All four players may bid. Both the bidder and his partner have their score count towards making the contract. High bidder names trump. There typically is no kitty. With a kitty, the four cards are distributed, one to each player, by the bid winner. Each hand must meld separately. As in the three-handed version, the first player is forced to bid when holding meld. Play is often to 1000 but can increase to 1500 during partnership.\\r\\n\\r\\nGames with five hands or more typically modify partnership pinochle in a variety of ways. They are generally played with 1 1/2 or doubled decks, with extra dix added or withheld to make an even deal. With an odd number of players, the bidder asks for a desired card in the trump suit, with the first matching player being partner for that hand. Everyone else plays against the team. In larger groups, one or more players can sit out each hand allowing the remaining players to follow the appropriate rules for the respective number of players.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheck pinochle[8] is a gambling variant of three-hand. It is the same as to 1000, except that players keep track of \\"checks\\". If playing for $1 stakes, each check gained means that the other two players owe a dollar. The following events cause a gain or loss of checks.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday \\"double-deck\\" pinochle[8] is a popular form of the game, exclusively played by the National Pinochle Association, the American Pinochle Association, the Cambridge Pinochle Association, and in the \\"World Series of Pinochle\\".[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDouble-deck pinochle is played with two pinochle decks, without the nines. This makes for an 80 card deck.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlay is similar to regular pinochle, except 20 cards are dealt to each person and minimum bid is increased to 500 points. In some variations, bids are made in increments of 10 or more points until 600 is reached, then by 50 points. This version often features \\"meld bidding\\", a bid made to let a partner know what is in the bidder's hand. The only communication during bidding should be a numerical number or \\"pass\\", any other way of communicating is called \\"talking across the table\\" and is forbidden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are occasionally different meld values for a run and a pinochle; a run being 250 or 150 points, and a pinochle being 150 or 40 points. All other aspects of the game generally remain the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical Misdeal\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a player is dealt 13 or more non-counters and no aces, the player may declare a technical misdeal.  This must declared before he or she plays the first trick.  A technical misdeal nullifies all points melded for all players.  The hand is then re-dealt by the original dealer of that hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n(note:follow all rules of double deck pinochle)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn triple-deck pinochle[8] six play in two partnerships of three each; each player has an opponent at their right and left. Three pinochle decks with no nines are mixed together, making a pack of 120 cards. Each player is dealt 20 cards, and the rules of double deck pinochle apply, except that the minimum bid is 75, and the last trick is worth 3 points. most of the extra melds made possible by the triple pack do not count extra. i.e. if a player should hold twenty aces, five of each suit, the value would be that of double aces and triple aces combined.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nInternet pinochle is almost always \\"double deck\\" except for a few applications for some smart phones.[11][12] Today the Internet is host to many live professional cash tournaments,[13] although many are still cautious about playing online because of potential cheating.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that this use of the term \\"racehorse\\" is inconsistent with the commonly understood meaning of the term when applied to Pinochle. As summarized by Dave LeVasseur: \\"Racehorse means that, after the winning bidder has named trump, that player's partner passes cards across the table\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayed much the same as \\"double deck\\" but to six hands, the point values are inflated.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo teams are formed, 20 cards are then dealt to each player and 4 cards are dealt to the blind. Bidding commences with the person immediately to the left of the dealer automatically bidding 500. The winner of the bid includes the blind into their hand, calls trump and melds.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: all runs, double, triple, and quadruple, marriages must be in trump\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game continues with the standard rules of play. When the play is over each team adds up their points in the count with kings, 10s, and aces worth ten points, while queens and jacks are worth zero. If a team count plus meld does not equal their bid, they \\"go set\\". By going set the amount of the bid is subtracted from the team's score and their count is discarded. The other team retains both their meld and their count provided they took at least 10 points in the count.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo full decks are dealt between eight players, forming four teams. Team members are spaced so that they are not able to see any other hands. The game is usually played to a score of 5,000 or higher. Other than this, the four player rules apply, and any variations may also be used. There is an increased possibility that when one team declares trump another team may have an equal number of trump also, which may lead to an interesting game. An optional scoring rule rewards 1,000 points for a quadruple pinochlefour jacks of diamonds and four queens of spades in a meld.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternate end games\\r\\n\\r\\nOne variation on winning allows a team or individual to win instantly from any score by taking all the tricks in a hand.  To win in this fashion, the winning player or team must play very skillfully to prevent opposing players from taking even one lowly (even zero-point) trick.  This victory is known as \\"pinochling\\".  A player or team can play for this victory even if they are not the highest bidder. \\"pinochling\\" does not require a bidder to make their bid.  They also can play for this victory even if their bid cannot be made with the maximum number of trick points available plus their meld.  However, the highest bidding player or team can prevent other players from attempting this if they elect to \\"throw in\\" the hand before the first card is played.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen playing \\"bid-out\\" rules, a team can win without bidding if their score reaches (and remains above) the agreed upon game-ending score while their opponents fail to make their bid three times.  This is known as a \\"slide-out\\".","input":"How many cards are in a pinochle deck?"},{"output":"in the late 1930s","context":"The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), or simply RIFA, is one of over 280 species in the widespread genus Solenopsis. It is native to South America but it has become both a pest and a health hazard in the southern United States as well as a number of other countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1930s, colonies were accidentally introduced into the United States through the seaport of Mobile, Alabama. Despite earlier views that cargo ships from Brazil docking at Mobile unloaded goods infested with the ants,[1] recent DNA research confirmed that the likely source population for all invasive S. invicta in the United States occurred at or near Formosa, Argentina, and virtually every analysis ruled out all sampled Brazilian populations as a potential source.[2] Biologist E.O. Wilson says that he reported the first colony, in the Mobile area, when he was 13.[3] The ants then spread from Alabama to almost every state of the American South, from Texas to Maryland and a few other Mid-Atlantic states. Since the 1990s infestations have been reported in New Mexico and parts of Arizona in the Southwest. They have also been reported in California in the West, but probably arrived via ship or truck rather than by spreading.[4] In a similar way, the ants were accidentally introduced into Australia in 2001.[5]\\r\\nIn the United States, RIFAs have gradually spread north and west despite intense efforts to stop or eliminate them. As of 2011[update] in the United States they were found in most of the southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also lists the entire island of Puerto Rico as infested.[6]\\r\\nRIFAs were still on the move in the US in the early 21st century, often traveling from one area to another in turf, root balls of nursery plants, and other agricultural products. They could be controlled, but not eradicated. A number of products are available, which can be used on a mound-by-mound basis to destroy ant colonies when they appear. With all such efforts, it is important to reach and kill the queens, which may be as far as six feet (2?m) underground; otherwise, some queens may simply move a short distance away and quickly re-establish the colony. However, during the past few years, even this technique resulted in failure to control colony growth. Scientists then discovered that an adaptation in RIFAs had resulted in many populations having multiple queens in mounds over a large area.[4]\\r\\nIn areas where Solenopsis invicta (red imported fire ants) founded colonies, larger colonies of Tetramorium caespitum (pavement ants) have destroyed them, leading entomologists to conclude that this conflict between the two species would decelerate the northward spread of Solenopsis invicta.[7][8]\\r\\nThe RIFA's introduction to the United States was in the late 1930s. Traveling in soil used as ballast on cargo ships,[9] they came in through the seaport of Mobile, Alabama. They build mounds, usually no larger than 46?cm (18?in) in diameter and 46?cm (18?in) in height, although in Alabama some mounds have been reported to be over 60?cm (2.0?ft) high and larger, especially in fields where cattle graze. They build on soil close to homes and other buildings, and sometimes forage indoors for food and moisture. They are a nuisance, and can threaten sleeping or bedridden individuals and pets. Occasionally, they feed on vegetable plants in home gardens. The worst damage usually occurs during hot, dry weather, when they invade flower beds while seeking warmth and moisture. If disturbed, fire ants bite and sting the intruder.\\r\\nThey are apparently attracted to electrical equipment, and crawl into air conditioning units and the electrical wiring of stop lights, shorting them out. This is the leading cause of traffic light shorts in Texas, where the ants cause more than US$140 million in damage each year[citation needed]. Several ant species, including fire ants, have been shown to contain ferromagnetic nanoparticles that may contribute information about the geomagnetic field for orientation during foraging or migration.[10] However, it has not been found that electric or magnetic fields attract the ants.[11] Rather, when wandering ants cause electrical shorts, they attempt to sting the wire and produce powerful semiochemicals, including defensive and recruitment pheromones.[12] The chemical signals draw additional ants to the short. The only effective protection is to bar ants from the equipment physically or with insecticides.\\r\\nThe FDA estimates more than US$5 billion is spent annually on medical treatment, damage, and control in RIFA-infested areas. Further, the ants cause approximately US$750 million in damage to agricultural assets, including veterinary bills and livestock loss, as well as crop loss.[13]","input":"When were fire ants introduced to the us?"},{"output":"29 January 2016","context":"","input":"When was the last land rover defender made?"},{"output":"roughly 161 rooms","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nReportedly haunted locations:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Winchester Mystery House is a mansion in San Jose, California, that was once the personal residence of Sarah Winchester, the widow of firearm magnate William Wirt Winchester. Located at 525 South Winchester Blvd. in San Jose, the Queen Anne Style Victorian mansion is renowned for its size, its architectural curiosities, and its lack of any master building plan. It is a designated California historical landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is privately owned and serves as a tourist attraction.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its construction in 1884, the property and mansion were claimed by many to be haunted by the ghosts of those killed with Winchester rifles. Under Winchester's day-to-day guidance, its \\"from-the-ground-up\\" construction proceeded around the clock, by some accounts, without interruption, until her death on September 5, 1922, at which time work immediately ceased.[3] Sarah Winchester's biographer, however, says that Winchester \\"routinely dismissed workers for months at a time 'to take such rest as I might'\\" and notes that \\"this flies in the face of claims by today's Mystery House proprietors that work at the ranch was ceaseless for thirty-eight years.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter her husband's death from tuberculosis in 1881, Sarah Winchester inherited more than $20.5 million (equivalent to $520 million in 2017). She also received nearly fifty percent ownership of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, giving her an income of roughly $1,000 per day, equivalent to $25,000 a day in 2017. These inheritances gave her a tremendous amount of wealth which she used to fund the ongoing construction.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nTabloids from the time said that, at some point after her infant daughter died of an illness known as marasmus, a childrens disease in which the body wastes away, and her husband died of pulmonary tuberculosis, a Boston medium[6] told her (while supposedly channeling her late husband) that she should leave her home in New Haven and travel West, where she must continuously build a home for herself and the spirits of people who had fallen victim to Winchester rifles.[7] Winchester left New Haven and headed for California. Though it is possible she was simply seeking a change of location and a hobby during her lengthy depression, other sources say that Winchester came to believe her family and fortune were haunted by ghosts, and that only by moving West and continuously building them a house could she appease these spirits.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1884 she purchased an unfinished farmhouse in the Santa Clara Valley and began building her mansion. Carpenters were hired and worked on the house day and night until it became a seven-story mansion. She did not use an architect and added on to the building in a haphazard fashion, so the home contains numerous oddities such as doors and stairs that go nowhere, windows overlooking other rooms and stairs with odd-sized risers. Many accounts attribute these oddities to her belief in ghosts.[9] Environmental psychologists have theorized that the odd layout itself contributes to the feeling of the house being haunted today.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the 1906 earthquake, the house had been seven stories high and carpenters may have been brought in initially to repair damages caused by the quake.[10] Today it is only four stories. The house is predominantly made of redwood, as Mrs. Winchester preferred the wood; however, she disliked the look of it. She therefore demanded that a faux grain and stain be applied. This is why almost all the wood in the home is covered. Approximately 20,500 U.S. gallons (78,000?L) of paint were required to paint the house. The home itself is built using a floating foundation that is believed to have saved it from total collapse in the 1906 earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. This type of construction allows the home to shift freely, as it is not completely attached to its brick base. There are roughly 161 rooms, including 40 bedrooms, 2 ballrooms (one completed and one unfinished) as well as 47 fireplaces, over 10,000 panes of glass, 17 chimneys (with evidence of two others), two basements and three elevators. Winchester's property was about 162 acres (66?ha) at one time, but the estate has since been reduced to 4.5 acres (1.8?ha)?ÿ the minimum necessary to contain the house and nearby outbuildings. It has gold and silver chandeliers, hand-inlaid parquet floors and trim, and a vast array of colors and materials. Due to Mrs. Winchester's debilitating arthritis, special \\"easy riser\\" stairways were installed as a replacement for her original steep construction. This allowed her to move about her home freely as she was only able to raise each foot a few inches. There was only one working toilet for Winchester, but all other restrooms were decoys to confuse spirits. This is also the reason why she slept in a different room each night.[12]\\r\\nThe home's conveniences were rare at the time of its construction. These included steam and forced-air heating, modern indoor toilets and plumbing, push-button gas lights, and Mrs. Winchester's personal (and only) hot shower from indoor plumbing. There are also three elevators, including an Otis electric and one of which was powered by a rare horizontal hydraulic elevator piston. (Most elevator pistons are vertical to save space, but Winchester preferred the improved functionality of the horizontal configuration.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Winchester never skimped on the many adornments that she believed contributed to its architectural beauty. Many of the stained glass windows were created by the Tiffany Company. Some were designed specifically for her, and others by her, including a \\"spider web\\" window that featured her favorite web design and the repetition of the number thirteen, another of her preoccupations. This window was never installed, but exists in the so-called \\"$25,000 storage room\\" - so named because its contents were originally appraised at a value of $25,000. The value today is inestimable, but $25,000 would be equivalent to $366,000 in 2017. A second window was designed by Tiffany himself, so that when sunlight strikes the prismatic crystals a rainbow is cast across the room. The window was installed in an interior wall in a room with no light exposure, preventing the effect from being seen.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Winchester died, all of her possessions (apart from the house) were bequeathed to her niece and personal secretary. Her niece then took everything she wanted and sold the rest in a private auction. It supposedly took six trucks working eight hours a day for six weeks to remove all of the furniture from the home, an account disputed by Winchester's biographer.[14] Mrs. Winchester made no mention of the mansion in her will, and appraisers considered the house worthless due to damage caused by the earthquake, the unfinished design and the impractical nature of its construction. It was sold at auction to a local investor for over $135,000, and subsequently leased for 10 years to John and Mayme Brown,[15] who eventually purchased the house. In February 1923, five months after Winchester's death, the house was opened to the public, with Mayme Brown serving as the first tour guide.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday the home is owned by Winchester Investments LLC,[17] a privately held company representing the descendants of John and Mayme Brown.[15] The home retains unique touches that reflect Mrs. Winchester's beliefs and her reported preoccupation with warding off malevolent spirits. These spirits are said to have directly inspired her as to the way the house should be built. The number thirteen and spider web motifs, which carried spiritual significance for her, occur throughout the house.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1990s the Winchester property had parapsychologist, anomalist and paranormal investigator Christopher Chacon conduct an investigation (30-day monitoring) of the reported \\"haunt phenomena\\" on the property.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, it was announced that another room was found: an attic space that contains a pump organ, Victorian couch, dress form, sewing machine and paintings. This room was made available for viewing by the public.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, the Winchester Mystery House debuted their first new daytime tour in 20 years, the \\"Explore More Tour\\". This tour takes guests through rooms never before opened to the public, and explores the rooms left unfinished at the time of Sarah Winchester's death.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodwork surrounding fireplace\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic room\\r\\n\\r\\nDark wood paneling of walls and ceiling\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of many instruments\\r\\n\\r\\nSitting area\\r\\n\\r\\nSitting room\\r\\n\\r\\nSkylights\\r\\n\\r\\nStairwell\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall pipe organ\\r\\n\\r\\nClothes wringer","input":"How many rooms are there in the winchester house?"},{"output":"was substantially complete by 1648 AD (1058 AH)","context":"","input":"When did the construction of the taj mahal end?"},{"output":"Sunday, December 6, 1964","context":"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is a 1964 Christmas stop-motion animated television special produced by Videocraft International, Ltd. (later known as Rankin/Bass Productions) and currently distributed by Universal Television. It first aired Sunday, December 6, 1964, on the NBC television network in the United States, and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of The General Electric Fantasy Hour. The special was based on the Johnny Marks song \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks' brother-in-law, Robert L. May. Since 1972, the special has aired on CBS, with the network unveiling a high-definition, digitally remastered version of the program in 2005. As with A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Rudolph no longer airs just once annually, but several times during the Christmas and holiday season on CBS. Unlike other holiday specials that also air on several cable channels (including Freeform), Rudolph only airs on CBS. It has been telecast every year since 1964, making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in history. 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the television special[1] and a series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6, 2014.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSam the Snowman welcomes the viewers to Christmastown at the North Pole and introduces Santa and Mrs. Claus who live in a castle located north of the Christmas Tree Forest. Mrs. Claus fusses over Santa as she wants him to fatten up by Christmas Eve. Sam then recalls the year Christmas was almost cancelled due to a snowstorm and tells the story of how a very special reindeer saved the day.\\r\\nDonner, Santa's lead reindeer, and his wife have given birth to their new baby fawn, Rudolph. Upon admiring him, they are surprised to see that Rudolph has been born with a glowing red nose. When Santa arrives, he warns Donner that Rudolph will not make the sleigh team because of his nose. Donner then decides to hide the nose by covering it with mud to allow Rudolph to fit in with all the other reindeer.\\r\\nOver Rudolph's first year of life, Donner trains him in the basics of being a reindeer, including hiding from the Abominable Snow Monster of the North. Rudolph enters the reindeer games, competing against his fellow fawns. During flight practice, Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice who tells him he is cute, and kisses him, which causes an elated Rudolph to fly higher and faster than everyone else. However, while celebrating with the other bucks, Rudolph's nose cover pops off, and the others react with fear, then scorn and finally rejection as Rudolph is kicked out of the Reindeer Games. Walking away, Rudolph walks with Clarice, who supports him, until her father firmly tells her to never have any more contacts with a red-nosed reindeer. Then, Rudolph meets up with Hermey, an elf who ran away from Santa's workshop because he wanted to be a dentist instead of making toys, and they decide to run away together. The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius, who has fruitlessly searched his whole life for silver and gold. After escaping the snow monster on an ice floe, the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler, a winged lion named King Moonracer. The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa to find homes for the unwanted toys. However, Rudolph leaves the island in the middle of the night on his own, fearing that his nose, which attracts the snow monster, will endanger his friends.\\r\\nTime goes by and Rudolph grows into adulthood; he tries and fails to find a place to settle where he will be accepted despite his nose. Returning home, he finds that his parents and Clarice have been looking for him for months. He sets out once again to find them, only to discover that the snow monster has captured them. Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten, but the monster hits him in the head with a stalactite, dazing him. Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph. Hermey, posing as a pig, lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out. Hermey then pulls out all the monster's teeth. Realizing Yukon drives the toothless (and now terrified) monster back, only to follow it over the cliff with all his pack dogs. Mourning Yukon's presumed death, Rudolph, Hermey, Clarice, and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them. After hearing their story, Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown, promises that he will find homes for the Misfit Toys, Hermey opens his own dentist's office, and Clarice's father apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph. Yukon then returns with a reformed snow monster (Yukon notes that they bounce) and demonstrates the beast's ability to trim a Christmas tree. While everybody's celebrating, Santa interrupts, grimly informing everyone that because of the storm, he is forced to cancel the Christmas trip. Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph's red nose and realizes that its light could cut through the storm. He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees. The team then flies off to the island and pick up the toys. The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night.\\r\\nThe TV special, with the teleplay by Romeo Muller, introduced several new characters inspired by the song's lyrics. Muller told an interviewer shortly before his death that he would have preferred to base the teleplay on May's original book, but could not find a copy.[6] Other than Burl Ives, all characters were portrayed by Canadian actors recorded at RCA studios in Toronto under the supervision of Bernard Cowan.[7]\\r\\nAfter the script, concept designs and storyboards for Rudolph were done by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and his staff of artists at Rankin/Bass in New York City. The company's trademark stop motion animation process, known as \\"Animagic\\", was filmed at MOM Productions in Tokyo with supervision by Tadahito Mochinaga and associate direction by Kizo Nagashima.[6] Besides Rudolph, Mochinaga and the rest of the Japanese puppet animation staff are also known for their partnership with Rankin/Bass on their other Animagic productions almost throughout the 1960s, from The New Adventures of Pinocchio, to Willy McBean and his Magic Machine, to The Daydreamer and Mad Monster Party?.[6]\\r\\nSince those involved with the production had no idea of the future value of the stop-motion puppet figures used in the production, many were not preserved. Rankin claimed in 2007 to be in possession of an original Rudolph figure.[8] Nine other puppetsincluding Santa and young Rudolphwere given to a secretary, who gave them to family members. Eventually seven were discarded.[8] In 2005, the remaining two puppets of Rudolph and Santa were appraised on Antiques Roadshow; the episode aired in 2006 on PBS. At that time, their appraised value was between $8,000 and $10,000. The puppets had been damaged through years of rough handling by children and storage in an attic.[9] Toy aficionado Kevin Kriess bought Santa and Rudolph in 2005; in 2007, he had both puppets restored by Screen Novelties, a Los Angeles-based collective of film directors specializing in stop motion animation with puppet fabricator Robin Walsh leading the project.[8][10] The figures have been shown at conventions since then.[11]\\r\\nThis version has the NBC \\"living color\\" peacock at the introduction. It includes the original end credits, where an elf drops presents that list all the technical credits. It also includes commercials that were exclusively for GE small appliances with some of the same animated elves from the main program introducing each of the products, and closing NBC network bumpers, including promos for the following week's episodes of GE College Bowl and Meet the Press, which were presumably pre-empted that Sunday for the inaugural 5:30 PM (EST) telecast. The College Bowl quiz show was also sponsored by GE.[12] The original does not include Santa traveling to the Island of Misfit Toys, but does include a scene near the end of the special in which Yukon Cornelius discovers a peppermint mine near Santa's workshop. He can be seen throughout the special tossing his pickax into the air, sniffing, then licking the end that contacts the snow or ice. Deletion of the peppermint segment in 1965, to make room for Santa traveling to the Island of Misfit Toys, leaves audience to assume that Cornelius was attempting to find either silver or gold by taste alone.[6]\\r\\nThe 1965 broadcast also included a new duet between Rudolph and Hermey called \\"Fame and Fortune\\", which replaced a scene in which the same characters sang \\"We're a Couple of Misfits\\". Viewers of the 1964 special complained that Santa was not shown fulfilling his promise to the Misfit Toys (to include them in his annual toy delivery).[6] In reaction, a new scene for subsequent rebroadcasts was produced with Santa making his first stop at the Island to pick up the toys. This is the ending that has been shown on all telecasts and video releases ever since. Until sometime in the 1970s the special aired without additional cuts, but eventually more commercial time was required by the network. In 1978, several sequences were deleted to make room for more advertising: the instrumental bridge from \\"We Are Santa's Elves\\" featuring the elf orchestra, additional dialogue by Burl Ives, and the \\"Peppermint Mine\\" scene resolving the fate of Yukon Cornelius.[6] The special's 1993 restoration saw \\"Misfits\\" returned to its original film context, and the 2004 DVD release showcases \\"Fame and Fortune\\" as a separate musical number.\\r\\nMost of the 1965 deletions were restored in 1998, and \\"Fame and Fortune\\" was replaced with the original \\"We're a Couple of Misfits\\" reprise. A short slide reading \\"Rankin/Bass Presents\\" was inserted at the beginning of the special to reflect the company's name change. The \\"Peppermint Mine\\" scene was not restored; it has not aired on CBS since the mid 70s.\\r\\nStarting in 2005, CBS aired the video of the \\"Fame and Fortune\\" scene with the soundtrack replaced by an edited version of \\"We're a Couple of Misfits\\".[6] The special has been edited to make more time for commercial advertising by shortening some musical numbers.\\r\\nWhen Rudolph was first issued on VHS, Betamax, and LaserDisc by Family Home Entertainment and Broadway Video from 1989 to 1997 under the Christmas Classics Series label, the 1965 rebroadcast print described above was used. All current video prints of Rudolph by Classic Media are a compendium of the two previous telecast versions of the special. All the footage in the current versions follow the original NBC airing (without the original GE commercials) up until the \\"Peppermint Mine\\" scene, followed by the final act of the 1965 edit (with the Island of Misfit Toys finale and the 1965 alternate credits in place of the original end credit sequence).\\r\\nIn 1998, the special was released by Sony Wonder on VHS. In 2000, it was released on DVD, and on Blu-ray Disc in 2010 (although the Blu-ray does not contain the bonus features from the previous DVD release.) This edit has been made available in original color form by former rights holders Classic Media,[13] (which in 2012 became the DreamWorks Classics division of DreamWorks Animation, and finally in 2016, part of Universal Pictures)[14] As previously mentioned, this is also the version currently airing on CBS, albeit in edited form to accommodate more commercial time. In November 2014, Classic Media released a 50th anniversary edition of the special on Blu-ray.[15] Walmart released an exclusive 50th anniversary Blu-ray edition with a storybook.\\r\\nThe songs and incidental music were all written by Johnny Marks, with Maury Laws supervising. In addition to the songs previously mentioned, the score also includes the film's love theme \\"There's Always Tomorrow\\", sung by Clarice after Rudolph is kicked out of the reindeer games. Marks' holiday standard \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\" appears as instrumental background music when Rudolph first arrives at the Reindeer Games. Also included in the soundtrack is an instrumental version of Marks' setting of the Christmas hymn \\"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.\\"\\r\\nIn 1964, an LP record of the soundtrack was released on Decca Records. It contained all the original songs performed as they are in the special, with the exception of Burl Ives' material, which has been re-recorded. MCA Special Products released the soundtrack on CD in June 1995. It is an exact duplication of the original LP released in 1964. Tracks 1-9 are the original soundtrack selections while tracks 10-19 are the same songs performed by the Decca Concert Orchestra. The song \\"Fame and Fortune\\" is not contained on either release. On November 30, 2004 the soundtrack was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over 500,000 copies.\\r\\nIves re-recorded \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" and \\"A Holly Jolly Christmas\\", with different arrangements, for his own album Have a Holly Jolly Christmas in 1965.[16]\\r\\nBooks and other items related to the show have in some cases misspelled \\"Hermey\\" as \\"Herbie\\". Rich Goldschmidt, who wrote Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Making of the Rankin/Bass Holiday Classic, says the scripts by Romeo Muller show the spelling to be \\"Hermey\\".[17]\\r\\nA Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer video game was released on November 9, 2010. The adaptation was published by Red Wagon Games for the Wii and Nintendo DS, and was developed by High Voltage Software and Glyphic Entertainment respectively. The Wii version was received poorly, and garnered extremely negative reviews from sites such as IGN giving it a 1.5/10.[18]\\r\\nThe Rankin/Bass special, which currently airs on CBS, inspired numerous television sequels made by the same studio:\\r\\nThe television special's familiarity to American audiences through its annual rebroadcasts, along with its primitive stop-motion animation that is easy to recreate with modern technology and the special's ambiguous copyright status, has lent itself to numerous parodies and homages over the years.\\r\\nAnimator Corky Quakenbush has produced parodies of Rudolph for several American television shows:\\r\\nIn the sci-fi/comedy series The Orville, in the episode \\"About a Girl\\", characters watch Rudolph to make the character Bortus consider his plans to arrange gender reassignment surgery for his newborn daughter (Bortus's species, the Moclans, are a single-gender species who statistically produce only one female every seventy-five years, with females thus having no clear place in their society) by demonstrating how unconventional people can accomplish great things, although Bortus humorously misinterprets the film to suggest that Rudolph's father might have considered euthanizing his child as an anomaly.\\r\\nThe copyright of the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer special lies in a loophole of American federal copyright law. When the recording was originally published, the date of copyright (published in Roman numerals) was accidentally listed as 1164 (MCLXIV), omitting an M that should have been present (1964 in Roman numerals is MCMLXIV); this mistake was not corrected with subsequent edits and remains on televised prints to this day.[26] The songs were validly and separately copyrighted, and the original character on which the special was based also remains under copyright and trademark protection, extending some indirect copyright protection to the special as a derivative work. (A number of films, such as It's a Wonderful Life and His Girl Friday, fall under similar circumstances: a public domain film loosely based on a copyrighted work.)\\r\\nAssuming the error in the copyright is considered substantial enough to invalidate it (U.S. copyright law before 1988 required works to have a valid date on a copyright notice, while providing some leeway in regard to non-substantial errors), the error puts large portions of the special not directly tied to the songs or original story into the public domain. (Some of the characters, particularly Santa Claus and the adult reindeer, relied on material that was already public domain anyway; all of the characters except Rudolph, most of the images, and large portions of the spoken soundtrack would thus be public domain in this interpretation.) Because of the indirect copyright protections and uncertainty over their extent, permission is still required to show the program as a whole. The extensive derivative works seen in popular culture are likely a byproduct of this uncertain copyright status.","input":"When did rudolph the red nosed reindeer first air?"},{"output":"The corpus callosum (/?k??rp?s k??lo?s?m/; Latin for \\"tough body\\"), also callosal commissure","context":"The corpus callosum (/?k??rp?s k??lo?s?m/; Latin for \\"tough body\\"), also callosal commissure, is a wide commissure, a flat bundle of commissural fibers, about 10?cm long[citation needed] beneath the cerebral cortex in the brains of placental mammals. It spans part of the longitudinal fissure, connects the left and right cerebral hemispheres, and enables communication between the hemispheres. It is the largest white matter structure in the human brain, consisting of 200ÿ250 million axonal projections.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe posterior end of the corpus callosum, near to the cerebellum, is called the splenium. This is the thickest part, and overlaps the tela chorioidea of the third ventricle and the mid-brain, and ends in a thick, convex, free border. Splenium translates as bandage in Greek. A sagittal section of the brain shows that the posterior end of the corpus callosum is acutely bent forward, the upper and lower parts being applied to each other.\\r\\nThe anterior end near to the frontal lobes is called the genu (\\"knee\\"). The genu of the corpus callosum is bent downward and backward in front of the septum pellucidum; diminishing rapidly in thickness. It is prolonged backward under the name of the rostrum, and is connected below with the lamina terminalis, which stretches from the interventricular foramina to the recess at the base of the optic stalk. The rostrum is so named for its resemblance to a bird's beak.\\r\\nThe anterior cerebral arteries are in contact with the under surface of the rostrum; they then arch over the front of the genu, and are carried backward above the body of the corpus callosum.\\r\\nThe body or truncus of the corpus callosum is between the splenium and the genu. A narrowed part between the body and the splenium is known as the isthmus of the corpus callosum.\\r\\nOn either side of the corpus callosum, the fibers radiate in the white matter and pass to the various parts of the cerebral cortex; those curving forward from the genu into the frontal lobe constitute the forceps anterior, and those curving backward into the occipital lobe, the forceps posterior. Between these two parts is the main body of the fibers which constitute the tapetum and extend laterally on either side into the temporal lobe, and cover in the central part of the lateral ventricle.\\r\\nThinner axons in the genu connect the prefrontal cortex between the two halves of the brain; these fibres arise from a fork-like bundle of fibers from the tapetum, the forceps anterior. Thicker axons in the mid body, or trunk of the corpus callosum, interconnect areas of the motor cortex, with proportionately more of the corpus callosum dedicated to supplementary motor regions including Broca's area. The posterior body of the corpus, known as the splenium, communicates somatosensory information between the two halves of the parietal lobe and the visual cortex at the occipital lobe, these are the fibres of the forceps posterior.[2][3]\\r\\nIn a study of five- to eighteen-year-olds there was found to be a positive correlation between age and callosal thickness.[1]\\r\\nThe corpus callosum and its relation to sex has been a subject of debate in the scientific and lay communities for over a century. Initial research in the early 20th century claimed the corpus to be different in size between men and women. That research was in turn questioned, and ultimately gave way to more advanced imaging techniques that appeared to refute earlier correlations. However, advanced analytical techniques of computational neuroanatomy developed in the 1990s showed that sex differences were clear but confined to certain parts of the corpus callosum, and that they correlated with cognitive performance in certain tests.[4] One recent study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) found that the midsagittal corpus callosum cross-sectional area is, after controlling brain size, on average, proportionately larger in females.[5]\\r\\nUsing diffusion tensor sequences on MRI machines, the rate at which molecules diffuse in and out of a specific area of tissue, anisotropy can be measured and used as an indirect measurement of anatomical connection strength. These sequences have found consistent sex differences in human corpus callosal morphology and microstructure.[which?][6][7][8]\\r\\nMorphometric analysis has also been used to study specific three-dimensional mathematical relationships with MRIs, and have found consistent and statistically significant differences across genders.[9][10] Specific algorithms have found significant differences between the two genders in over 70% of cases in one review.[11]\\r\\nThe front portion of the human corpus callosum has been reported to be significantly larger in musicians than nonmusicians,[12] and to be 0.75?cm2[13] or 11% larger in left-handed and ambidextrous people than right-handed people.[13][14] This difference is evident in the anterior and posterior regions of the corpus callosum, but not in the splenium.[13] Other magnetic resonance morphometric study showed corpus callosum size correlates positively with verbal memory capacity and semantic coding test performance.[15] Children with dyslexia tend to have smaller and less-developed corpus callosums than their nondyslexic counterparts.[16][17]\\r\\nMusical training has shown to increase plasticity of the corpus callosum during a sensitive period of time in development. The implications are an increased coordination of hands, differences in white matter structure, and amplification of plasticity in motor and auditory scaffolding which would serve to aid in future musical training. The study found children who had begun musical training before the age of six (minimum 15 months of training) had an increased volume of their corpus callosum and adults who had begun musical training before the age of 11 also had increased bimanual coordination.[18]\\r\\nThe symptoms of refractory epilepsy can be reduced by cutting the corpus callosum in an operation known as a corpus callosotomy.[19] This is usually reserved for cases in which complex or grand mal seizures are produced by an epileptogenic focus on one side of the brain, causing an interhemispheric electrical storm. The work up for this procedure involves an electroencephalogram, MRI, PET scan, and evaluation by a specialized neurologist, neurosurgeon, psychiatrist, and neuroradiologist before surgery can be considered.[20]\\r\\nThe formation of the corpus callosum begins with the first midline crossing of pioneer axons around week 12 of the human prenatal development,[21] or embryonic day 15 of the mouse.[22] Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a rare congenital disorder that is one of the most common brain malformations observed in human beings,[23] in which the corpus callosum is partially or completely absent. ACC is usually diagnosed within the first two years of life, and may manifest as a severe syndrome in infancy or childhood, as a milder condition in young adults, or as an asymptomatic incidental finding. Initial symptoms of ACC usually include seizures, which may be followed by feeding problems and delays in holding the head erect, sitting, standing, and walking. Other possible symptoms may include impairments in mental and physical development, hand-eye coordination, and visual and auditory memory. Hydrocephaly may also occur. In mild cases, symptoms such as seizures, repetitive speech, or headaches may not appear for years. Some syndromes that are often associated with ACC are Aicardi syndrome, Andermann syndrome, Shapiro syndrome, and acrocallosal syndrome.\\r\\nACC is usually not fatal. Treatment usually involves management of symptoms, such as hydrocephaly and seizures, if they occur. Although many children with the disorder lead normal lives and have average intelligence, careful neuropsychological testing reveals subtle differences in higher cortical function compared to individuals of the same age and education without ACC. Children with ACC accompanied by developmental delay and/or seizure disorders should be screened for metabolic disorders.[24]\\r\\nIn addition to agenesis of the corpus callosum, similar conditions are hypogenesis (partial formation), dysgenesis (malformation), and hypoplasia (underdevelopment, including too thin).\\r\\nRecent studies have also linked possible correlations between corpus callosum malformation and autism spectrum disorders.[25]\\r\\nKim Peek, a savant and the inspiration behind the movie Rain Man, was found with agenesis of the corpus callosum.\\r\\nAnterior corpus callosum lesions may result in akinetic mutism or anomic aphasia. See also:\\r\\nThe first study of the corpus with relation to gender was by R. B. Bean, a Philadelphia anatomist, who suggested in 1906 that \\"exceptional size of the corpus callosum may mean exceptional intellectual activity\\" and that there were measurable differences between men and women. Perhaps reflecting the political climate of the times, he went on to claim differences in the size of the callosum across different races. His research was ultimately refuted by Franklin Mall, the director of his own laboratory.[26]\\r\\nOf more mainstream impact was a 1982 Science article by Holloway and Utamsing that suggested sex difference in human brain morphology, which related to differences in cognitive ability.[27] Time published an article in 1992 that suggested that, because the corpus is \\"often wider in the brains of women than in those of men, it may allow for greater cross-talk between the hemispherespossibly the basis for womens intuition.\\"[28]\\r\\nMore recent publications in the psychology literature have raised doubt as to whether the anatomic size of the corpus is actually different. A meta-analysis of 49 studies since 1980 found that, contrary to de Lacoste-Utamsing and Holloway, no sex difference could be found in the size of the corpus callosum, whether or not account was taken of larger male brain size.[26] A study in 2006 using thin slice MRI showed no difference in thickness of the corpus when accounting for the size of the subject.[29]\\r\\nThe corpus callosum is found only in placental mammals (the eutherians), while it is absent in monotremes and marsupials,[30] as well as other vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish.[31] (Other groups do have other brain structures that allow for communication between the two hemispheres, such as the anterior commissure, which serves as the primary mode of interhemispheric communication in marsupials,[32][33] and which carries all the commissural fibers arising from the neocortex (also known as the neopallium), whereas in placental mammals, the anterior commissure carries only some of these fibers.[34]) In primates, the speed of nerve transmission depends on its degree of myelination, or lipid coating. This is reflected by the diameter of the nerve axon. In most primates, axonal diameter increases in proportion to brain size to compensate for the increased distance to travel for neural impulse transmission. This allows the brain to coordinate sensory and motor impulses. However, the scaling of overall brain size and increased myelination have not occurred between chimpanzees and humans. This has resulted in the human corpus callosum's requiring double the time for interhemispheric communication as a macaque's.[2] The fibrous bundle at which the corpus callosum appears, can and does increase to such an extent in humans that it encroaches upon and wedges apart the hippocampal structures.[35]\\r\\nCorpus callosum\\r\\nCorpus callosum\\r\\nCorpus callosum\\r\\nCoronal T2 (grey scale inverted) MRI of the brain at the level of the caudate nuclei emphasizing corpus callosum\\r\\nCorpus callosum parts on MRI\\r\\nDTI Corpus callosum\\r\\nVentricles of brain and basal ganglia.Superior view.

At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square?miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20% of its land area.[3] With 1.2 billion people[1] as of 2016, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.[4] The majority of the continent and its countries are in the Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica's average population is the youngest amongst all the continents;[5][6] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[7] Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors as well as later ones that have been dated to around 7 million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergasterthe earliest Homo sapiens (modern human), found in Ethiopia, date to circa 200,000 years ago.[8] Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century, European countries colonised almost all of Africa; most present states in Africa originated from a process of decolonisation in the 20th century. African nations cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of then-known northern Africa to the west of the Nile, and in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).[10][11] This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe, an ancestor of modern Berbers; see Terence for discussion. The name had usually been connected with the Phoenician word ?afar meaning \\"dust\\",[12] but a 1981 hypothesis[13] has asserted that it stems from the Berber word ifri (plural ifran) meaning \\"cave\\", in reference to cave dwellers.[14] The same word[14] may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province it then named Africa Proconsularis, following its defeat of the Carthaginians in the Third Punic War in 146 BC, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.[16] The Latin suffix -ica can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim region of Ifriqiya, following its conquest of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire's Exarchatus Africae, also preserved a form of the name.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while \\"Asia\\" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85ÿ165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of \\"Africa\\" expanded with their knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name \\"Africa\\":\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on Earth, with the human species originating from the continent.[20][21] During the mid-20th century, anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (BP=before present). Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man, such as Australopithecus afarensis (radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9ÿ3.0?million years BP,[22] Paranthropus boisei (c. 2.3ÿ1.4?million years BP)[23] and Homo ergaster (c. 1.9?millionÿ600,000 years BP) have been discovered.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the evolution of Homo sapiens sapiens approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years BP in Africa, the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers.[24][25][26] These first modern humans left Africa and populated the rest of the globe during the Out of Africa II migration dated to approximately 50,000 years BP, exiting the continent either across Bab-el-Mandeb over the Red Sea,[27][28] the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco,[29] or the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in Southern Africa, Southeast Africa, North Africa, and the Sahara.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe size of the Sahara has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions.[32] At the end of the Ice ages, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in Sub-Saharan Africa, with rock art paintings depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in Tassili n'Ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia.[33] However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.[34] The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in Ethiopia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.[35] In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from Algeria to Nubia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.[36] This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the first millennium BC, ironworking had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa,[37] and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. Copper objects from Egypt, North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that Trans-Saharan trade networks had been established by this date.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt about 3300 BC, the historical record opens in Northern Africa with the rise of literacy in the Pharaonic civilization of Ancient Egypt.[38] One of the world's earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, the Egyptian state continued, with varying levels of influence over other areas, until 343 BC.[39][40] Egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day Libya and Nubia, and, according to Martin Bernal, as far north as Crete.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn independent centre of civilization with trading links to Phoenicia was established by Phoenicians from Tyre on the north-west African coast at Carthage.[42][43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean exploration of Africa began with Ancient Greeks and Romans.[citation needed] In 332 BC, Alexander the Great was welcomed as a liberator in Persian-occupied Egypt. He founded Alexandria in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty after his death.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the Roman Empire, the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. Roman settlement occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first Roman emperor native to North Africa was Septimius Severus, born in Leptis Magna in present-day Libyahis mother was Italian Roman and his father was Punic.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nChristianity spread across these areas at an early date, from Judaea via Egypt and beyond the borders of the Roman world into Nubia;[47] by AD 340 at the latest, it had become the state religion of the Aksumite Empire. Syro-Greek missionaries, who arrived by way of the Red Sea, were responsible for this theological development.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic Caliphate expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to Qayrawan in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nPre-colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities[51] characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule. These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the San people of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the Bantu-speaking peoples of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the Horn of Africa; the large Sahelian kingdoms; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the Akan; Edo, Yoruba, and Igbo people in West Africa; and the Swahili coastal trading towns of Southeast Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest Hausa states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were Ghana, Gao, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire.  Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the Mali Empire which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the Muslim north. The Kingdom of Nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri. The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes, found at the town of Igbo-Ukwu. The bronzes have been dated from as far back as the ninth century.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Ife, historically the first of these Yoruba city-states or kingdoms, established government under a priestly oba ('king' or 'ruler' in the Yoruba language), called the Ooni of Ife. Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in West Africa, and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture. The Ife model of government was adapted at the Oyo Empire, where its obas or kings, called the Alaafins of Oyo, once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms; the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey was one of the non-Yoruba domains under Oyo control.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the eleventh century.[53] The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma'qil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula who migrated westwards via Egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Their migration resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers, where the locals were Arabized,[54] and Arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture, under the unifying framework of Islam.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the breakup of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464ÿ1492) founded the Songhai Empire in the region of middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Mohammad I (1493ÿ1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.[56] By the eleventh century, some Hausa states ÿ such as Kano, jigawa, Katsina, and Gobir ÿ had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing caravans, and the manufacture of goods. Until the fifteenth century, these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nMansa Musa ruled the Mali Empire in the 14th century.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nSlavery had long been practiced in Africa.[58][59] Between the 7th and 20th centuries, the Arab slave trade (also known as \\"slavery in the east\\") took 18 million slaves from Africa via trans-Saharan and Indian Ocean routes. Between the 15th and the 19th centuries, the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7ÿ12 million slaves to the New World.[60][61][62] In addition, more than 1 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa between the 16th and 19th centuries.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nAction was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against \\"the usurping King of Lagos\\", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.[65] The largest powers of West Africa (the Asante Confederacy, the Kingdom of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of \\"legitimate commerce\\" in the form of palm oil, cocoa, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 19th century, the European imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: Ethiopia (known to Europeans as \\"Abyssinia\\"), and Liberia. Egypt and Sudan were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Berlin Conference held in 1884ÿ85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King Leopold II of Belgium, and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. The Berlin Conference sought to end the European powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.\\r\\n\\r\\nImperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. Independence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France.[67] Ghana followed suit the next year (March 1957),[68] becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nPortugal's overseas presence in Sub-Saharan Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and S?o Tom and Prncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, under the white minority government of Ian Smith, but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as Zimbabwe) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war. Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups, and graft under these leaders. For political gain, many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.\\r\\n\\r\\nCold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the policies of the International Monetary Fund,[citation needed] also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers. Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In Rhodesia, Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the Zimbabwe Patriotic Front waged a brutal guerrilla war against the country's white government. There was a major famine in Ethiopia, when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.[69][70][71] The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the Second Congo War; this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 5.5 million people.[72] Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster. Another notable tragic event is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. AIDS in post-colonial Africa has also been a prevalent issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the civil war in Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China,[73] which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing as of 2016. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as Africa Rising, can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.[74] Migration from African nations has increased dramatically in the last decade.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest landmass of the Earth. Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea, it is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (transected by the Suez Canal), 163?km (101?mi) wide.[76] (Geopolitically, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula east of the Suez Canal is often considered part of Africa, as well.)[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coastline is 26,000?km (16,000?mi) long, and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is illustrated by the fact that Europe, which covers only 10,400,000?km2 (4,000,000?sq?mi) ÿ about a third of the surface of Africa ÿ has a coastline of 32,000?km (20,000?mi).[78] From the most northerly point, Ras ben Sakka in Tunisia (3721' N), to the most southerly point, Cape Agulhas in South Africa (3451'15\\" S), is a distance of approximately 8,000?km (5,000?mi).[79] Cape Verde, 1733'22\\" W, the westernmost point, is a distance of approximately 7,400?km (4,600?mi) to Ras Hafun, 5127'52\\" E, the most easterly projection that neighbours Cape Guardafui, the tip of the Horn of Africa.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica's largest country is Algeria, and its smallest country is Seychelles, an archipelago off the east coast.[80] The smallest nation on the continental mainland is The Gambia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe African Plate is a major tectonic plate straddling the equator as well as the prime meridian. It includes much of the continent of Africa, as well as oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges. Between 60?million years ago and 10?million years ago, the Somali Plate began rifting from the African Plate along the East African Rift.[82] Since the continent of Africa consists of crust from both the African and the Somali plates, some literature refers to the African Plate as the Nubian Plate to distinguish it from the continent as a whole.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeologically, Africa includes the Arabian Peninsula; the Zagros Mountains of Iran and the Anatolian Plateau of Turkey mark where the African Plate collided with Eurasia. The Afrotropic ecozone and the Saharo-Arabian desert to its north unite the region biogeographically, and the Afro-Asiatic language family unites the north linguistically.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe climate of Africa ranges from tropical to subarctic on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily desert, or arid, while its central and southern areas contain both savanna plains and dense jungle (rainforest) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as sahel and steppe dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.[84] The record for the highest-ever recorded temperature, in Libya in 1922 (58?C (136?F)), was discredited in 2013.[85][86]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and \\"range of freedom\\" of wild animal populations and diversity, with wild populations of large carnivores (such as lions, hyenas, and cheetahs) and herbivores (such as buffalo, elephants, camels, and giraffes) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of \\"jungle\\" animals including snakes and primates and aquatic life such as crocodiles and amphibians. In addition, Africa has the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica has over 3,000 protected areas, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity and arable land. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nDeforestation is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).[87] According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center, 31% of Africa's pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year, which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world.[84] Some sources claim that approximately 90% of the original, virgin forests in West Africa have been destroyed.[88] Over 90% of Madagascar's original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago.[89] About 65% of Africa's agricultural land suffers from soil degradation.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are clear signs of increased networking among African organizations and states. For example, in the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (former Zaire), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, neighbouring African countries became involved (see also Second Congo War). Since the conflict began in 1998, the estimated death toll has reached 5 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe African Union (AU) is a 55-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states. The union was formed, with Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002[91] as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, in South Africa, but the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the Constitutive Act of the African Union, which aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan-African Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and C?te d'Ivoire.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough it has abundant natural resources, Africa remains the world's poorest and most underdeveloped continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations, failed central planning, high levels of illiteracy, lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide).[92] According to the United Nations' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent. In August 2008, the World Bank[94] announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day (versus the previous measure of $1.00). 80.5% of the Sub-Saharan Africa population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with 85.7% for India.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nSub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of the population living in poverty in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973,[96] indicating increasing poverty in some areas. Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.[97][98][99]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity. The continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite,[100] 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium.[101] The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves.[102] Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite.[103] As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis pushed 100 million people into food insecurity.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Harvard University study led by professor Calestous Juma showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. \\"African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity.\\"[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring US President Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a US$7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. He also announced a new programme named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the US.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and consequently, it is relatively young. In some African states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age.[107] The total number of people in Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990.[108] As of 2016, the population of Africa is estimated at 1.2 billion[1]. Africa's total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; African population surpassed Europe in the 1990s, while the Americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000; Africa's rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population, at roughly the same time ÿ India and China's 1.4 billion people each will swap ranking around the year 2022.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeakers of Bantu languages (part of the NigerÿCongo family) are the majority in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu-speaking peoples from the Sahel progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.[110] But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa, the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan (\\"San\\" or \\"Bushmen\\") and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also \\"San\\", closely related to, but distinct from \\"Hottentots\\") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peoples of West Africa primarily speak NigerÿCongo languages, belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The NigerÿCongo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the Hausa, are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the Songhai, Kanuri and Zarma, are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering Central Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo- European Greeks, Romans, and Vandals settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within Morocco and Algeria in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.[112] The Berber-speaking Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and NigerÿCongo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Horn of Africa, some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups (like the Amhara and Tigrayans, collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa.[113] Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers ÿ especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million pieds-noirs in North Africa),[114] Kenya, Congo,[115] Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.[116] Between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone.[117] Nevertheless, white Africans remain an important minority in many African states, particularly Zimbabwe, Namibia, Runion, and the Republic of South Africa.[118] The country with the largest white African population is South Africa.[119] Dutch and British diasporas represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians, particularly from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese[73] have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa, respectively.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy most estimates, well over a thousand languages (UNESCO has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa.[122] Most are of African origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major language families indigenous to Africa:\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the end of colonialism, nearly all African countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa). In numerous countries, English and French (see African French) are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. Arabic, Portuguese, Afrikaans and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former Italian colonies in Africa. German is spoken in Namibia, as it was a former German protectorate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.[124] Leopold II of Belgium attempted to \\"civilize\\" Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nObidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern African art.[125] According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole, \\"The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art.\\" [126] Fraser and Cole assert that, in Igboland, some art objects \\"lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions.[126] Author Chika Okeke-Agulu states that \\"the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign Africa and modernist art.\\" [127] In Soweto, the West Rand Administrative Board established a Cultural Section to collect, read, and review scripts before performances could occur.[128][self-published source] Editors F. Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the \\"traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe.\\" [129] On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)asset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies.\\" [130]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the African Renaissance, led by Thabo Mbeki, Afrocentrism, led by a group of scholars, including Molefi Asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of Vodou and other forms of spirituality.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican art and architecture reflect the diversity of African cultures. The region's oldest known beads were made from Nassarius shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago.[131] The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt was the world's tallest structure for 4,000 years, until the completion of Lincoln Cathedral around the year 1300. The stone ruins of Great Zimbabwe are also noteworthy for their architecture, as are the monolithic churches at Lalibela, Ethiopia, such as the Church of Saint George.\\r\\n\\r\\nEgypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the Atlantic slave trade to modern samba, blues, jazz, reggae, hip hop, and rock. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of Afrobeat and Highlife music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of soukous, dominated by the music of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of North Africa and Southern Africa. Arab influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, Western influences are apparent due to colonization.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifty-four African countries have football (soccer) teams in the Confederation of African Football. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent FIFA World Cups. South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup tournament, becoming the first African country to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nCricket is popular in some African nations. South Africa and Zimbabwe have Test status, while Kenya is the leading non-test team and previously had One-Day International cricket (ODI) status (from 10 October 1997, until 30 January 2014). The three countries jointly hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Namibia is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. Morocco in northern Africa has also hosted the 2002 Morocco Cup, but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. Rugby is a popular sport in South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfricans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs, and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are often a sensitive a topic for governments with mixed religious populations.[132][133] According to the World Book Encyclopedia, Islam is the largest religion in Africa, followed by Christianity. According to Encyclop?dia Britannica, 45% of the population are Christians, 40% are Muslims, and 10% follow traditional religions. A small number of Africans are Hindu, Buddhist, Confucianist, Baha'i, or Jewish. There is also a minority of people in Africa who are irreligious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe countries in this table are categorized according to the scheme for geographic subregions used by the United Nations, and data included are per sources in cross-referenced articles. Where they differ, provisos are clearly indicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica\\r\\n\\r\\nAntarctica\\r\\n\\r\\nAsia\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia\\r\\n\\r\\nEurope\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth America\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth America\\r\\n\\r\\nAfro-Eurasia\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica\\r\\n\\r\\nEurasia\\r\\n\\r\\nOceania","input":"How many countries make up the africa continent?"},{"output":"early eighteenth century","context":"A circus is a company of performers who put on diverse entertainment shows that include clowns, acrobats, trained animals, trapeze acts, musicians, dancers, hoopers, tightrope walkers, jugglers, magicians, unicyclists, as well as other object manipulation and stunt-oriented artists. The term 'circus' also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history. Philip Astley is credited with being the 'father' of the modern circus when he opened the first circus in 1768 in England. A skilled equestrian, Astley demonstrated trick riding, riding in a circle rather than a straight line as his rivals did, and thus chanced on the format which was later named a 'circus'. In 1770 he hired acrobats, tightrope walkers, jugglers and a clown to fill in the pauses between acts. Performances developed significantly through the next fifty years, with large-scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. The 'traditional' format, whereby a ringmaster introduces a varied selection of acts that mostly perform choreographed acts to traditional music, developed in the latter part of the 19th century and continued almost universally to be the main style of circus up until the 1970s.\\r\\nAs styles of performance have developed since the time of Astley, so too have the types of venues where these circuses have performed. The earliest modern circuses were performed in open air structures with limited covered seating. From the late 18th to late 19th century, custom-made circus buildings (often wooden) were built with various types of seating, a centre ring, and sometimes a stage. The 'traditional' large tents, commonly known as 'Big Tops' were introduced in the mid-19th century as touring circuses superseded static venues. These tents eventually became the most common venue and remain so to the present day. Contemporary circuses perform in a variety of venues including tents, theatres and casinos. Many circus performances are still held in a ring usually 13?m (42?ft) in diameter. This dimension was adopted by Astley in the late 18th century as the minimum diameter that enabled an acrobatic horse rider to stand upright on a cantering horse to perform their tricks.\\r\\nContemporary circus has been credited with reviving the circus tradition since the 1980s when a number of groups introduced circus based almost solely on human skills and which drew from other performing art skills and styles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst attested in English 14th century, the word circus derives from Latin circus,[1] which is the romanization of the Greek ?ϰ? (kirkos), itself a metathesis of the Homeric Greek ?? (krikos), meaning \\"circle\\" or \\"ring\\".[2] In the book De Spectaculis early Christian writer Tertullian claimed that the first circus games were staged by the goddess Circe in honour of her father Helios, the Sun God.\\r\\nThe modern and commonly held idea of a 'circus' is of a Big Top with various acts providing entertainment therein. However, the history of circuses is more complex, with historians disagreeing on its origin, as well as revisions being done about the history due to the changing nature of historical research, and the ongoing 'circus' phenomenon. For many, circus history begins with Englishman Philip Astley, while for others its origins go back much furtherto Roman times.\\r\\nIn Ancient Rome, the circus was a building for the exhibition of horse and chariot races, equestrian shows, staged battles, gladiatorial combat and displays of (and fights with) trained animals. The circus of Rome were similar to the ancient Greek hippodromes, although circuses served varying purposes and differed in design and construction, and for events that involved re-enactments of naval battles, the circus was flooded with water. The Roman circus buildings were, however, not circular but rectangular with semi circular ends. The lower seats were reserved for persons of rank, There were also various state boxes for the giver of the games and his friends. The circus was the only public spectacle at which men and women were not separated. Some circus historians such as George Speaight have stated \\"these performances may have taken place in the great arenas that were called 'circuses' by the Romans, but it is a mistake to equate these places, or the entertainments presented there, with the modern circus\\" [3] Others have argued that the lineage of the circus does go back to the Roman 'circuses' and a chronology of circus-related entertainment can be traced from Roman times through medieval and renaissance jesters, minstrels and troubadours to the late 18th century and the time of Astley [4]\\r\\nThe first circus in the city of Rome was the Circus Maximus, in the valley between the Palatine and Aventine hills. It was constructed during the monarchy and, at first, built completely from wood. After being rebuilt several times, the final version of the Circus Maximus could seat 250,000 people; it was built of stone and measured 400m in length and 90m in width.[5] Next in importance were the Circus Flaminius and the Circus Neronis, from the notoriety which it obtained through the Circensian pleasures of Nero. A fourth circus was constructed by Maxentius; its ruins have helped archaeologists reconstruct the Roman circus.\\r\\nFor some time after the fall of Rome, large circus buildings fell out of use as centres of mass entertainment. Instead, itinerant performers, animal trainers and showmen travelled between towns throughout Europe, performing at local fairs.\\r\\nThe origin of the modern circus has been attributed to Philip Astley, who was born 1742 in Newcastle-under-Lyme, England. He became a cavalry officer who set up the first modern amphitheatre for the display of horse riding tricks in Lambeth, London on 4 April 1768.[6][7][8] Astley did not originate trick horse riding, nor was he first to introduce acts such as acrobats and clowns to the English public, but he was the first to create a space where all these acts were brought together to perform a show.[9] Astley rode in a circle rather than a straight line as his rivals did, and thus chanced on the format of performing in a circle.[10] Astley performed stunts in a 42?ft diameter ring, which is the standard size used by circuses ever since.[9] Astley referred to the performance arena as a Circle and the building as an amphitheatre but these were to later be known as a Circus.[11] In 1770 Astley hired acrobats, tightrope walkers, jugglers and a clown to fill in the pauses between acts.[9]\\r\\nAstley was followed by Andrew Ducrow, whose feats of horsemanship had much to do with establishing the traditions of the circus, which were perpetuated by Henglers and Sangers celebrated shows in a later generation. In England circuses were often held in purpose built buildings in large cities, such as the London Hippodrome, which was built as a combination of the circus, the menagerie and the variety theatre, where wild animals such as lions and elephants from time to time appeared in the ring, and where convulsions of nature such as floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions have been produced with an extraordinary wealth of realistic display. Joseph Grimaldi, the first mainstream clown, had his first major role as Little Clown in the pantomime The Triumph of Mirth; or, Harlequin's Wedding in 1781.[12] The Royal Circus opened in London on 4 November 1782 by Charles Dibdin and his partner Charles Hughes.[13] In 1782, Astley established the Amphithatre Anglais in Paris, the first purpose-built circus in France, followed by 18 other permanent circuses in cities throughout Europe.[14][15] Astley leased his Parisian circus to the Italian Antonio Franconi in 1793.[16] In 1826, the first circus took place under a canvas big top.[17]\\r\\nThe Scotsman John Bill Ricketts brought the first modern circus to the United States. He began his theatrical career with Hughes Royal Circus in London in the 1780s, and travelled from England in 1792 to establish his first circus in Philadelphia. The first circus building in the US opened on April 3, 1793 in Philadelphia, where Ricketts gave America's first complete circus performance.[18][19] George Washington attended a performance there later that season.[20]\\r\\nIn the Americas during the first two decades of the 19th century, the Circus of Pepin and Breschard toured from Montreal to Havana, building circus theatres in many of the cities it visited. Victor Ppin, a native New Yorker,[21] was the first American to operate a major circus in the United States.[22] Later the establishments of Purdy, Welch & Co., and of van Amburgh gave a wider popularity to the circus in the United States. In 1825, Joshuah Purdy Brown was the first circus owner to use a large canvas tent for the circus performance. Circus pioneer Dan Rice was the most famous pre-Civil War circus clown,[23] popularizing such expressions as \\"The One-Horse Show\\" and \\"Hey, Rube!\\". The American circus was revolutionized by P. T. Barnum and William Cameron Coup, who launched the travelling P. T. Barnum's Museum, Menagerie & Circus, the first freak show. Coup also introduced the first multiple ringed circuses, and was also the first circus entrepreneur to use circus trains to transport the circus between towns, a practice that continues today.\\r\\nIn 1838, the equestrian Thomas Taplin Cooke returned to England from the United States, bringing with him a circus tent.[24] At this time, itinerant circuses were becoming popular in Britain. William Batty's circus, for example, between 1838 and 1840, travelled from Newcastle to Edinburgh and then to Portsmouth and Southampton. Pablo Fanque, who is noteworthy as Britain's only black circus proprietor and who operated one of the most celebrated travelling circuses in Victorian England, erected temporary structures for his limited engagements or retrofitted existing structures.[25] One such structure in Leeds, which Fanque assumed from a departing circus, collapsed, resulting in minor injuries to many but the death of Fanque's wife.[26][27] Three important circus innovators were Italian Giuseppe Chiarini, and Frenchmen Louis Soullier and Jacques Tourniaire, whose early travelling circuses introduced the circus to Latin America, Australia, South East Asia, China, South Africa and Russia. Soullier was the first circus owner to introduce Chinese acrobatics to the European circus when he returned from his travels in 1866 and Tourniaire was the first to introduce the performing art to Ranga where it became extremely popular.\\r\\nFollowing Barnum's death, his circus merged with that of James Anthony Bailey, and travelled to Europe as the Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show On Earth, where it toured from 1897 to 1902, impressing other circus owners with its large scale, its touring techniques (including the tent and circus train), and its combination of circus acts, a zoological exhibition and a freak show. This format was adopted by European circuses at the turn of the 20th century.\\r\\nThe influence of the American circus brought about a considerable change in the character of the modern circus. In arenas too large for speech to be easily audible, the traditional comic dialog of the clown assumed a less prominent place than formerly, while the vastly increased wealth of stage properties relegated to the background the old-fashioned equestrian feats, which were replaced by more ambitious acrobatic performances, and by exhibitions of skill, strength and daring, requiring the employment of immense numbers of performers and often of complicated and expensive machinery.\\r\\nIn 1919, Lenin, head of the USSR, expressed a wish for the circus to become 'the people's art-form', with facilities and status on par with theatre, opera and ballet. The USSR nationalized Russian circuses. In 1927, the State University of Circus and Variety Arts, better known as the Moscow Circus School, was established; performers were trained using methods developed from the Soviet gymnastics program. When the Moscow State Circus company began international tours in the 1950s, its levels of originality and artistic skill were widely applauded.\\r\\nCircuses from China, drawing on Chinese traditions of acrobatics, like the Chinese State Circus are also popular touring acts.\\r\\nThe International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo[28] has been held in Monte Carlo since 1974 and was the first of many international awards for circus performers. From the late 19th century through the first half of the 20th century, travelling circuses were a major form of spectator entertainment in the US and attracted huge attention whenever they arrived in a city. After World War II, the popularity of the circus declined as new forms of entertainment (such as television) arrived and the public's tastes became more sophisticated. From the 1960s onward, circuses attracted growing criticism from animal rights activists. Many circuses went out of business or were forced to merge with other circus companies. Nonetheless, a good number of travelling circuses are still active in various parts of the world, ranging from small family enterprises to three-ring extravaganzas. Other companies found new ways to draw in the public with innovative new approaches to the circus form itself.\\r\\nContemporary circus (originally known as nouveau cirque) is a recent performing arts movement that originated in the 1970s in Australia, Canada, France,[29] the West Coast of the United States, and the United Kingdom. Contemporary circus combines traditional circus skills and theatrical techniques to convey a story or theme. Compared with the traditional circus, the contemporary genre of circus tends to focus more attention on the overall aesthetic impact, on character and story development, and on the use of lighting design, original music, and costume design to convey thematic or narrative content. For aesthetic or economic reasons, contemporary circus productions may sometimes be staged in theatres rather than in large outdoor tents. Music used in the production is often composed exclusively for that production, and aesthetic influences are drawn as much from contemporary culture as from circus history. Animal acts appear rarely in contemporary circus in contrast to traditional circus where animal acts have been a significant part of circus entertainment.\\r\\nEarly examples of nouveau cirque companies include: Circus Oz, forged in Australia in 1978 from SoapBox Circus and New Circus, both founded in the early 1970s; the Pickle Family Circus, founded in San Francisco in 1975; Ra-Ra Zoo in the UK in 1983, Nofit State Circus in 1984 from Wales; Cirque du Soleil, founded in Quebec in 1984; and Archaos in 1986. More recent examples include: Teatro ZinZanni, founded in Seattle in 1998; Quebec's Cirque loize; Les 7 doigts de la main (also known as The 7 Fingers);[30] and the West African Circus Baobab[31] in the late 1990s. The genre includes other circus troupes such as the Vermont-based Circus Smirkus (founded in 1987 by Rob Mermin), Le Cirque Imaginaire (later renamed Le Cirque Invisible, both founded and directed by Victoria Chaplin, daughter of Charlie Chaplin), the Tiger Lillies, Dislocate,[32] and Vulcana Women's Circus,[33] while The Jim Rose Circus is an interesting take on the sideshow. Swedish contemporary circus company Cirkus Cirk?r was founded in 1995. U.S. Company PURE Cirkus[34] was founded in the subgenre of \\"cirque noir\\" in 2004, and in Northern England, (United Kingdom), Skewed Circus[35] combines punk, rap, dance music, comedy, and stunts to deliver \\"pop-circus\\" entertainment to young urban audiences.\\r\\nThe most conspicuous success story in the contemporary genre has been that of Cirque du Soleil, the Canadian circus company whose estimated annual revenue now exceeds US$810?million,[36] and whose nouveau cirque shows have been seen by nearly 90?million spectators in over 200 cities on five continents.[37] Despite the contemporary circus' shift toward more theatrical techniques and its emphasis on human rather than animal performance, traditional circus companies still exist alongside the new movement. Numerous circuses continue to maintain animal performers, including UniverSoul Circus, and the Big Apple Circus from the United States, Circus Krone from Munich, Circus Royale and Lennon Bros Circus from Australia, Vazquez Hermanos Circus, Circo Atayde Hermanos, and Hermanos Mayaror Circus[38] from Mexico, and Moira Orfei Circus[39] from Italy, to name just a few.\\r\\nA traditional circus performance is often led by a ringmaster who has a role similar to a Master of Ceremonies. The ringmaster presents performers, speaks to the audience, and generally keeps the show moving. The activity of the circus traditionally takes place within a ring; large circuses may have multiple rings, like the six-ringed Moscow State Circus. A circus often travels with its own band, whose instrumentation in the United States has traditionally included brass instruments, drums, glockenspiel, and sometimes the distinctive sound of the calliope.\\r\\nCommon acts include a variety of acrobatics, gymnastics (including tumbling and trampoline), aerial acts (such as trapeze, aerial silk, corde lisse), contortion, stilts, and a variety of other routines. Juggling is one of the most common acts in a circus; the combination of juggling and gymnastics is called equilibristics and include acts like plate spinning and the rolling globe. Acts like these are some of the most common, and the most traditional. Clowns are common to most circuses and are typically skilled in many circus acts; \\"clowns getting into the act\\" is a very familiar theme in any circus. Famous circus clowns have included Austin Miles, the Fratellini Family, Rusty Russell, Emmett Kelly, Grock, and Bill Irwin.\\r\\nDaredevil stunt acts and sideshow acts are also parts of some circus acts, these activities may include human cannonball, chapeaugraphy, fire eating, breathing, and dancing, knife throwing, magic shows, sword swallowing, or strongman. Famous sideshow performers include Zip the Pinhead and The Doll Family. A popular sideshow attraction from the early 19th century was the flea circus, where fleas were attached to props and viewed through a Fresnel lens.\\r\\nA variety of animals have historically been used in acts. While the types of animals used vary from circus to circus, big cats, elephants, horses, birds, sea lions, bears, and domestic animals such as cats and dogs are the most common.\\r\\nThe earliest involvement of animals in circus was just the display of exotic creatures in a menagerie. Going as far back as the early eighteenth century, exotic animals were transported to North America for display, and menageries were a popular form of entertainment.[40] The first true animals acts in the circus were equestrian acts. Soon elephants and big cats were displayed as well. Isaac A. Van Amburgh entered a cage with several big cats in 1833, and is generally considered to be the first wild animal trainer in American circus history.[22] Mabel Stark was a famous female tiger-tamer.\\r\\nAnimal welfare groups have documented many cases of animal cruelty in the training of performing circus animals.[42][43] The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) contends that animals in circuses are frequently beaten into submission and that physical abuse has always been the method for training circus animals. According to PETA, although the US Animal Welfare Act does not permit the use of electric shock prods, whips, hooks, or similar instruments by trainers,[44] these are still used today.[45] According to PETA, during an undercover investigation of Carson & Barnes Circus, video footage was captured showing animal care director Tim Frisco training endangered Asian elephants with electrical shock prods and instructing other trainers to \\"beat the elephants with a bullhook as hard as they could and to sink the sharp metal bullhook into the animals' flesh and twist it until they screamed in pain.\\"[45]\\r\\nOn behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality of the Netherlands, Wageningen University conducted an investigation into the welfare of circus animals in 2008.[46] The following issues, among others, were found:\\r\\nBased on these findings, the researchers called for more stringent regulation regarding the welfare of circus animals. In 2012, the Dutch government announced a ban on the use of wild circus animals.[47]\\r\\nIn testimony in U.S. District Court in 2009, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind the ears, under the chin and on their legs with metal tipped prods, called bull hooks. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers. Feld also acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant, which Feld also stated was appropriate practice. Feld denied that any of these practices harm elephants.[48] In its January 2010 verdict on the case, brought against Feld Entertainment International by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals 'et al.', the Court ruled that evidence against the circus company was \\"not credible with regard to the allegations\\".[49] In lieu of a USDA hearing, Feld Entertainment Inc. (parent of Ringling Bros.) agreed to pay an unprecedented $270,000 fine for violations of the Animal Welfare Act that allegedly occurred between June 2007 and August 2011.[50]\\r\\nA 14-year litigation against the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus came to an end in 2014 when The Humane Society of the United States and a number of other animal rights groups paid a $16?million settlement to Feld Entertainment.[51] However, the circus closed in May 2017 after a 146-year run when it experienced a steep decline in ticket sales during the year after it discontinued its elephant act and sent its pachyderms to a reserve.[52]\\r\\nOn February 1, 1992 at the Great American Circus in Palm Bay, Florida, an elephant named Janet (1965 ÿ February 1, 1992) went out of control while giving a ride to a mother, her two children, and three other children. The elephant then stampeded through the circus grounds outside before being shot to death by police.[53] Also, during a Circus International performance in Honolulu, Hawaii on 20 August 1994, an elephant called Tyke (1974 ÿ August 20, 1994) killed her trainer, Allen Campbell, and severely mauled her groomer, Dallas Beckwith, in front of hundreds of spectators. Tyke then bolted from the arena and ran through the streets of Kakaako for more than thirty minutes. Police fired 86 shots at Tyke, who eventually collapsed from the wounds and died.[54]\\r\\nIn 1998 in the UK, a parliamentary working group chaired by MP Roger Gale studied living conditions and treatment of animals in UK circuses. All members of this group agreed that a change in the law was needed to protect circus animals. Gale told the BBC, \\"It's undignified and the conditions under which they are kept are woefully inadequatethe cages are too small, the environments they live in are not suitable and many of us believe the time has come for that practice to end.\\" The group reported concerns about boredom and stress, and noted that an independent study by a member of the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford University \\"found no evidence that circuses contribute to education or conservation.\\"[55] However, in 2007, a different working group under the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, having reviewed information from experts representing both the circus industry and animal welfare, found an absence of \\"scientific evidence sufficient to demonstrate that travelling circuses are not compatible with meeting the welfare needs of any type of non-domesticated animal presently being used in the United Kingdom.\\" According to that group's report, published in October 2007, \\"there appears to be little evidence to demonstrate that the welfare of animals kept in travelling circuses is any better or any worse than that of animals kept in other captive environments.\\"[56]\\r\\nA ban prohibiting the use of wild animals in circuses in Britain was due to be passed in 2015, but Conservative MP Christopher Chope repeatedly blocked the bill under the reasoning that \\"The EU Membership Costs and Benefits bill should have been called by the clerk before the circuses bill, so I raised a point of order\\". He explained that the circus bill was \\"at the bottom of the list\\" for discussion.[57] The Animal Defenders International non-profit group dubbed this \\"a huge embarrassment for Britain that 30 other nations have taken action before us on this simple and popular measure\\".[58]\\r\\nThere are nationwide bans on using some if not all animals in circuses in Sweden, Costa Rica, India, Finland, Singapore, Switzerland, Norway, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Israel, Taiwan, Malta,[59] Netherlands, and Denmark. Spain, Ireland, United Kingdom, Argentina, Austria, Chile, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the United States have locally restricted or banned the use of animals in entertainment.[60] In response to a growing popular concern about the use of animals in entertainment, animal-free circuses are becoming more common around the world.[61] In 2009, Bolivia passed legislation banning the use of any animals, wild or domestic, in circuses. The law states that circuses \\"constitute an act of cruelty.\\" Circus operators had one year from the bill's passage on July 1, 2009 to comply.[62]\\r\\nCity ordinances banning performances by wild animals have been enacted in San Francisco (2015),[63] Los Angeles (2017),[64] and New York City (2017).[65]\\r\\nGreece became the first European country to ban any animal from performing in any circus in its territory in February 2012, following a campaign by Animal Defenders International and the Greek Animal Welfare Fund (GAWF).[66]\\r\\nOn June 6, 2015, the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe adopted a position paper in which it recommends the prohibition of the use of wild animals in traveling circuses.[67][68]\\r\\nIn some towns, there are circus buildings where regular performances are held. The best known are:\\r\\nIn other countries, purpose-built circus buildings still exist which are no longer used as circuses, or are used for circus only occasionally among a wider programme of events; for example, the Cirkusbygningen (The Circus Building) in Copenhagen, Denmark, Cirkus in Stockholm, Sweden, or Carr Theatre in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\\r\\nThe atmosphere of the circus has served as a dramatic setting for many musicians. The most famous circus theme song is called \\"Entrance of the Gladiators\\", and was composed in 1904 by Julius Fu?k. Other circus music includes \\"El Caballero\\", \\"Quality Plus\\", \\"Sunnyland Waltzes\\", \\"The Storming of El Caney\\", \\"Pahjamah\\", \\"Bull Trombone\\", \\"Big Time Boogie\\", \\"Royal Bridesmaid March\\", \\"The Baby Elephant Walk\\", \\"Liberty Bell March\\", \\"Java\\", Strauss's \\"Radetsky March\\", and \\"Pageant of Progress\\". A poster for Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal, one of the most popular circuses of Victorian England, inspired John Lennon to write Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite! on The Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The song title refers to William Kite, a well-known circus performer in the 19th century. Producer George Martin and EMI engineers created the song's fairground atmosphere by assembling a sound collage of collected recordings of calliopes and fairground organs, which they cut into strips of various lengths, threw into a box, and then mixed up and edited together randomly, creating a long loop which was mixed into the final production.[70] Another traditional circus song is the John Philip Sousa march \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\", which is played only to alert circus performers of an emergency.\\r\\nPlays set in a circus include the 1896 musical The Circus Girl by Lionel Monckton, Polly of the Circus written in 1907 by Margaret Mayo, He Who Gets Slapped written by Russian Leonid Andreyev 1916 and later adapted into one of the first circus films, Katharina Knie written in 1928 by Carl Zuckmayer and adapted for the English stage in 1932 as Caravan by playwright Cecily Hamilton, the revue Big Top written by Herbert Farjeon in 1942, Top of the Ladder written by Tyrone Guthrie in 1950, Stop the World, I Want to Get Off written by Anthony Newley in 1961, and Barnum with music by Cy Coleman and lyrics and book by Mark Bramble, Roustabout: The Great Circus Train Wreck written by Jay Torrence in 2006.\\r\\nFollowing World War I, circus films became popular. In 1924 He Who Gets Slapped was the first film released by MGM; in 1925 Sally of the Sawdust (remade 1930), Variety, and Vaudeville were produced, followed by The Devil's Circus in 1926 and The Circus starring Charlie Chaplin, Circus Rookies, 4 Devils; and Laugh Clown Laugh in 1928. German film Salto Mortale about trapeze artists was released in 1930 and remade in the United States and released as Trapeze starring Burt Lancaster in 1956; in 1932 Freaks was released; Charlie Chan at the Circus, Circus (USSR) and The Three Maxiums were released in 1936 and At the Circus starring the Marx Brothers and You Can't Cheat an Honest Man in 1939. Circus films continued to be popular during the Second World War; films from this era included The Great Profile starring John Barrymore (1940), the animated Disney film Dumbo (1941), Road Show (1941), The Wagons Roll at Night (1941) and Captive Wild Woman (1943).\\r\\nTromba, a film about a tiger trainer, was released in 1948. In 1952 Cecil B. de Mille's Oscar-winning film The Greatest Show on Earth was first shown. Released in 1953 were Man on a Tightrope and Ingmar Bergman's Gycklarnas afton (released as Sawdust and Tinsel in the United States); these were followed by Life Is a Circus; Ring of Fear; 3 Ring Circus (1954) and La Strada (1954), an Oscar-winning film by Federico Fellini about a girl who is sold to a circus strongman. Fellini made a second film set in the circus called The Clowns in 1970. Films about the circus made since 1959 include Disney's Toby Tyler (1960), the B-movie Circus of Horrors (also in 1960); the musical film Billy Rose's Jumbo (1962); A Tiger Walks, a Disney film about a tiger that escapes from the circus; and Circus World (1964), starring John Wayne. Mera Naam Joker (1970) a Hindi drama film directed by Raj Kapoor which was about a clown who must make his audience laugh at the cost of his own sorrows. In the film Jungle Emperor Leo (1997), Leo's son Lune is captured and placed in a circus, which burns down when a tiger knocks down a ring of fire while jumping through it.\\r\\nThe TV series Circus Humberto, based on the novel by Eduard Bass, follows the history of the circus family Humberto between 1826 and 1924. The setting of the HBO television series Carnivle, which ran from 2003 to 2005, is also largely set in a travelling circus. The circus has also inspired many writers. Numerous books, both non-fiction and fiction, have been published about circus life. Notable examples of circus-based fiction include Circus Humberto by Eduard Bass, Cirque du Freak by Darren Shan, and Spangle by Gary Jennings. The novel Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen tells the fictional tale of a circus veterinarian and was made into a movie with the same title, starring Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon.\\r\\nCircus is the central theme in comic books of Super Commando Dhruva, an Indian comic book superhero. According to this series, Dhruva was born and brought up in a fictional Indian circus called Jupiter Circus. When a rival circus burnt down Jupiter Circus, killing everyone in it, including Dhruva's parents, Dhruva vowed to become a crime fighter. A circus-based television series called Circus was also telecast in India in 1989 on DD National, starring Shahrukh Khan as the lead actor.","input":"When were elephants first used in the circus?"},{"output":"Arsne Wenger","context":"There are 92 association football teams in the top four tiers of English football, all of which have a manager, or pair of joint managers, sometimes given the alternative title of head coach.

The area also has its fair share of scientific museums, such as SciWorks, the International Civil Rights Center and Museum, the Wake Forest Museum of Anthropology, and the Greensboro Science Center. The North Carolina Zoo, the world's largest open-air natural habitat zoo, is located just outside the Randoph County city of Asheboro.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economy in the Piedmont Triad is a mixed economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Triad area is notable for large textile, tobacco, and furniture corporations. The Triad remains a national center for textile manufacturing, represented by corporations including Hanes based in Winston-Salem, and International Textile Group, based in Greensboro. Tobacco remains a prominent crop in the Triad's rural areas and many tobacco companies like Lorillard Tobacco Company of Greensboro, and Reynolds American, based in Winston-Salem, call the Piedmont Triad home.  Numerous furniture manufacturers are also headquartered in the Triad area, especially in the cities of High Point (deemed the \\"Furniture Capital of the World\\"), Thomasville (known as the \\"Chair City\\"), and Lexington. The furniture and textile industries have in turn spawned large trucking, logistics, and warehousing businesses in the area.  Popular brands like \\"Thomasville\\" and \\"Lexington\\" are derived from the names of these cities. Recently, however, many furniture and tobacco factories have been closing and/or laying off workers across the region in response to escalating industrial globalization.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many of the old industries in the area began to die out, many Piedmont Triad cities began encouraging technological businesses to move into the Triad. Winston-Salem, for instance, founded within its downtown the Piedmont Triad Research Park, now known as Wake Forest Innovation Quarter, a highly interactive, 200-acre, master-planned innovation community developed to support life science and information technology research and development. Dell, Inc. in the early 2000s struck a deal with local officials allowing for the construction of a new computer assembly plant near the Triad city of Kernersville. Dell pulled out of its contract with the city, however, and left after only a few years.  Additionally, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, the largest institution of higher learning in the region, and North Carolina A&T State University have joined forces to establish the Gateway University Research Park, a technology-based entity that will focus its efforts on a host of biological, life, and environmental science research projects.  Upon full build out of the project, it is expected to be housed by two 75-acre (300,000?m2) campuses, employ approximately 2,000 people, and generate $50 million per year to the Triad economy.

It is 10ÿ14?mm long, slightly larger than a house fly, and has brilliant, metallic, blue-green or golden coloration with black markings. It has short, sparse black bristles (setae) and three cross-grooves on the thorax. The wings are clear with light brown veins, and the legs and antennae are black. The maggots (larvae) of the fly are used for maggot therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLucilia sericata is common all over the temperate and tropical regions of the planet, mainly the Southern Hemisphere: Africa and Australia. It prefers warm and moist climates and accordingly is especially common in coastal regions, but it also is present in arid areas.[2] The female lays her eggs in meat, fish, animal corpses, infected wounds of humans or animals, and excrement. The larvae feed on decomposing tissue. The insect favours species of the genus Ovis, domestic sheep in particular. This can lead to blow fly strike, causing problems for sheep farmers, though L. sericata is not a major cause of blow fly strike in most regions.\\r\\nThe defining characteristic of L. sericata, and most used when identifying the adult fly is the presence of three bristles on the dorsal mesothorax. This body region is located on the middle of the back of the fly. L. sericata is almost identical to its sister species, L. cuprina. Identification between these requires microscopic examination of two main distinguishing characteristics. As opposed to L. cuprina, which has a metallic green femoral joint in the first pair of legs, L. sericata is blue-black. Also, when looking at the occipital setae, L. sericata has one to nine bristles on each side, while L. cuprina has three or less.[3]\\r\\nThe lifecycle of Lucilia sericata is typical of flies in the family Calliphoridae in that the egg hatches into a larva that passes through three instars, enters a prepupal and then a pupal stage before emerging into the adult stage or imago. The female lays a mass of eggs in a wound, a carcass or corpse, or in necrotic or decaying tissue. The eggs hatch in about 9 hours in warm, moist weather, but may take as long as three days in cooler weather. In this, they differ from the more opportunistic Sarcophagidae, that lay hatching eggs or completely hatched larvae. A single female L. sericata typically lays 150?200 eggs per clutch and may produce 2,000 to 3,000 eggs in her lifetime. The pale yellow or grayish, conical larvae, like those of most blow flies, have two posterior spiracles through which they respire. These larvae are moderately sized, ranging from 10 to 14 millimeters long.\\r\\nThe larva feeds on dead or necrotic tissue for 3 to 10 days, depending on temperature and the quality of the food. During this period the larva passes through three larval instars. At a temperature of 16?C, the first larval instar lasts about 53 hours, the second about 42 hours and the third about 98 hours. At higher temperatures (27?C) the first larval instar lasts about 31 hours, the second about 12 hours, and the third about 40 hours.[4] Third-instar larvae then drop off the host onto soil, where available, where they enter a pupal stage which usually lasts from 6 to 14 days. However, if the temperature is suitably low, a pupa might overwinter in the soil until the temperature rises. After emerging from the pupa, the adult feeds opportunistically on nectar or other suitable food, such as carrion, while it matures. Adults usually lay eggs about 2 weeks after they emerge. Their total lifecycle typically ranges from 2 to 3 weeks, but this varies with seasonal and other circumstances. L. sericata usually completes three or four generations each year in cold, temperate climates, and more in warmer regions.[5]\\r\\nL. sericata is an important species to forensic entomologists. Like most calliphorids, L. sericata has been heavily studied and its lifecycle and habits are well documented. Accordingly, the stage of its development on a corpse is used to calculate a minimum post mortem interval, so that it can be used to aid in determining the time of death of the victim. The presence or absence of L. sericata can provide information about the conditions of the corpse. If the insects seem to be on the path of their normal development, the corpse likely has been undisturbed. If, however, the insect shows signs of a disturbed lifecycle, or is absent from a decaying body, this suggests post mortem tampering with the body. Because L. sericata is one of the first insects to colonize a corpse, it is preferred to many other species in determining an approximate time of colonization. Developmental progress is determined with relative accuracy by measuring the length and weight of larval lifecycles.[6]\\r\\nMany blow flies have an impact in the veterinary sense, and L. sericata is no exception. In places such as the UK and Australia, L. sericata is commonly referred to as the \\"sheep blow fly\\" since sheep are its primary host in those regions. Although it affects mainly sheep, L. sericata is not host-specific.\\r\\nIn northern Europe, the fly lays its eggs in sheep wool. The larvae then migrate down the wool where they feed directly on the skin surface. This can cause massive lesions and secondary bacterial infections. In the UK, blow fly strike affects an estimated 1 million sheep, as well as 80% of sheep farms each year. This causes a huge economic impact in these regions. Not only does it cost money to treat infected animals, but measures also must be taken to control L. sericata.\\r\\nSince this fly tends to lay its eggs in wool, a simple and effective way to reduce the incidence of infection is to shear ewes regularly. Enacting simple sanitary measures can also reduce blow fly strike. Timely and proper disposal of carcasses and proper removal of feces can aid in significantly reducing strike. Moving sheep from warm, humid, and sheltered areas to more open areas can also help to reduce blow fly strike, for this eliminates conditions conducive to fly development. Trapping systems such as sticky paper may also be used to control fly numbers. Treating a flock with chemical agents can be costly, but can aid greatly in maintaining the resistance of the flock to L. sericata. Plunge dipping in diazinon can directly kill the fly on contact. This method works from 3 to 8 weeks in controlling the fly. An alternate chemical method is a pyrethroid pour-on, which lasts 6 to 10 weeks depending on the type of pyrethroid used. Cryomazine and dicylanil, which are insect growth regulators, are also effective and last from 10 to 16 weeks. Although chemical treatment can be very effective, it is costly, tedious, and takes up valuable time. [7]\\r\\nL. sericata has been of medical importance since 1826, when Meigen removed larvae from the eyes and facial cavities of a human patient. L. sericata has shown promise in three separate clinical approaches. First, larvae have been shown to debride wounds with extremely low probability of myiasis upon clinical application. Larval secretions have been shown to help in tissue regeneration. L. sericata has also been shown to lower bacteremia levels in patients infected with MRSA. Basically, L. sericata larvae can be used as biosurgery agents in cases where antibiotics and surgery are impractical.\\r\\nLarval secretions in vitro enhance fibroblast migration to the wound site, improving wound closure.[8] Larval therapy of L. sericata is highly recommended for the treatment of wounds infected with Gram-positive bacteria, yet is not as effective for wounds infected with Gram-negative bacteria. Also, bacteria from the genus Vagococcus were resistant to the maggot excreta/secreta.[9] Attempts are currently ongoing to extract or synthesize the chymotrypsins found in larval secretions to destroy MRSA without application of the larvae.[10]\\r\\nDue to this species' high forensic interest, extensive research on its lifecycle has already been conducted. Medically, however, research is ongoing centered on the secretions produced by L. sericata as an agent against MRSA and VRSA,[11] and the larval applications for maggot therapy. In a new antimicrobial agent was isolated from L. sericata secretions and patented under the name Seraticin.[12] Efforts in the latter are geared toward making medical professionals more familiar to the current techniques.[13] Like many other ectoparasites, L. sericata has a huge economic impact on farmers, so many studies and research projects have been put in place since the late 1980s to help farmers reduce their impact.","input":"What kind of fly is a green fly?"},{"output":"11 to 13 years, though some can live well into their teens","context":"The Boston Terrier is a breed of dog originating in the United States. This \\"American Gentleman\\" was accepted in 1893 by the American Kennel Club as a non-sporting breed.[2] Color and markings are important when distinguishing this breed to the AKC standard. They should be either black, brindle or seal with white markings.[3][4] Bostons are small and compact with a short tail and erect ears. The AKC says they are highly intelligent and very easily trained.[5] They are friendly and can be stubborn at times. The average life span of a Boston is around 11 to 13 years, though some can live well into their teens.[6]\\r\\nThe American Kennel Club ranked the Boston Terrier as the 21st most popular breed in 2016.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boston terrier breed originated around 1870, when Robert C. Hooper of Boston, purchased from Edward Burnett a dog named Judge (known later as Hooper's Judge), which was of a Bull and Terrier type lineage. Hooper's Judge is either directly related to the original Bull and Terrier breeds of the 19th and early 20th centuries, or Judge is the result of modern English Bulldogs being crossed into terriers created in the 1860s for show purposes, like the White English Terrier. The American Kennel Club cites Hooper's Judge as the ancestor of almost all true modern Boston Terriers.[9]\\r\\nJudge weighed over 27.5 pounds (12.5?kg). The offspring interbred with one or more French Bulldogs, providing the foundation for the Boston Terrier. Bred down in size from fighting dogs of the Bull and Terrier types, the Boston Terrier originally weighed up to 44 pounds (20?kg) (Olde Boston Bulldogge).[2] The breed was first shown in Boston in 1870. By 1889 the breed had become sufficiently popular in Boston that fanciers formed the American Bull Terrier Club, the breed's nickname, \\"roundheads\\". Shortly after, at the suggestion of James Watson (a noted writer and authority), the club changed its name to the Boston Terrier Club and in 1893 it was admitted to membership in the American Kennel Club, thus making it the first US breed to be recognized.[9] It is one of a small number of breeds to have originated in the United States. The Boston Terrier was the first non-sporting dog bred in the US.\\r\\nIn the early years, the color and markings were not very important. By the 20th century the breed's distinctive markings and color were written into the standard, becoming an essential feature. The Boston Terrier has lost most of its aggressive nature, preferring the company of humans, although some males will still challenge other dogs if they feel their territory is being invaded. Boston University's mascot is Rhett the Boston Terrier. The Boston Terrier is also the mascot of Wofford College in Spartanburg, S.C.\\r\\nThe Boston Terrier is a compactly built, well-proportioned dog. It has a square-looking head with erect ears and a slightly arched neck. The muzzle is short and generally wrinkle-free, with an even or a slightly undershot bite. The chest is broad and the tail is short.[4][10] According to international breed standards, the dog should weigh no more than 25 pounds (11?kg). Boston Terriers usually stand up to 15-17?inches at the withers.[3]\\r\\nThe American Kennel Club divides the breed into three classes: under 15 pounds, 15 pounds and under 20 pounds, 20 pounds and not exceeding 25 pounds.[9]\\r\\nThe Boston Terrier is characteristically marked with white in proportion to either black, brindle, seal (color of a wet seal, a very dark brown that looks black except in the bright sun), or a combination of the three.[9] Any other color is not accepted as a Boston Terrier by the American Kennel Club, as they are usually obtained by crossbreeding with other breeds and the dog loses its characteristic \\"tuxedo\\" appearance.[3][4]\\r\\nAccording to the American Kennel Club, an ideal Boston Terrier should have white that covers its chest, muzzle, band around the neck, halfway up the forelegs, up to the hocks on the rear legs, and a white blaze between (but not touching) the eyes. For conformation showing, symmetrical markings are preferred.[3] Due to the Boston Terrier's markings resembling formal wear, in addition to its refined and pleasant personality, the breed is commonly referred to as the \\"American Gentleman.\\"[2][9]\\r\\nBoston is a gentle breed that typically has a strong, happy-go-lucky, and friendly personality with a merry sense of humour. Bostons are generally eager to please their owner and can be easily trained. They can be very protective of their owners, which may result in aggressive and territorial behavior toward other pets and strangers. The breed requires only a minimal amount of grooming.[9]\\r\\nWhile originally bred for fighting as well as hunting rats in garment factories, they were later down bred for companionship. They are not considered terriers by the American Kennel Club, however, but are part of the non-sporting group.[9]\\r\\nBoth females and males are generally quiet and bark only when necessary,[11] though early training in this regard is essential.[12][13] Their usually sensible attitude towards barking makes them excellent choices for apartment dwellers. They enjoy being around people, get along well with children, the elderly, other canines, and non-canine pets, if properly socialized.[2]\\r\\nCurvature of the back, called roaching, might be caused by patella problems with the rear legs, which in turn causes the dog to lean forward onto the forelegs.[2] This might also just be a structural fault with little consequence to the dog. Many Bostons cannot tolerate excessive heat and also extremely cold weather, due to the shortened muzzle, so hot or cold weather combined with demanding exercise can bring harm to a Boston Terrier. A sensitive digestive system is also typical of Boston Terriers. In the absence of good quality, proper diet, flatulence is associated with the breed.[14] Their large and prominent eyes make Boston Terriers prone to corneal ulcers.[15]\\r\\nBostons are brachycephalic breeds. The word comes from Greek roots \\"Brachy,\\" meaning short and \\"cephalic,\\" meaning head. This anatomy can cause tiny nostrils, long palates and a narrow trachea. Bostons may be prone to snoring and reverse sneezea rapid and repeated forced inhalation through the noseaccompanied by snorting or gagging sounds used to clear the palate of mucus, which does not harm the dog in any way.[16][17] Brachycephalic dogs may be prone to complications with general anesthesia. Bostons frequently require caesarean section to give birth, with over 90% of litters in a UK Kennel Club survey delivered this way.[18][19]\\r\\nIn the past, Bostons were primarily pit-fighting dogs, but with their friendly and happy temperament they became a companion and rat hunter.\\r\\nIn modern days, aside from being an excellent companion, the Boston Terrier also excels in all sorts of canine sports. The breed is increasingly popular in dog agility competitions, obedience training, rally obedience, tracking, dock diving, flyball, weight-pulling, barn hunt and lure coursing. Being such a versatile breed and with their outgoing personality and eagerness to meet new acquaintances, the Boston Terrier is a popular therapy dog.[20]","input":"What is the life span for a boston terrier?"},{"output":"Louisiana State University","context":"The 1958 NCAA University Division football season was notable in that it was the first to feature the two-point conversion.

The NCAA did recognize a national champion based upon the final results of \\"wire service\\" (AP and UPI) polls. The extent of that recognition came in the form of acknowledgment in the annual NCAA Football Guide of the \\"unofficial\\" national champions. The AP poll in 1958 consisted of the votes of as many as 203 sportswriters. Though not all writers voted in every poll, each would give their opinion of the twenty best teams. Under a point system of 20 points for first place, 19 for second, etc., the \\"overall\\" ranking was determined. Although the rankings were based on the collective opinion of the representative sportswriters, the teams that remained \\"unbeaten and untied\\" were generally ranked higher than those that had not. A defeat, even against a strong opponent, tended to cause a team to drop in the rankings, and a team with two or more defeats was unlikely to remain in the Top 20.

The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nE. coli and other facultative anaerobes constitute about 0.9% of gut microbiota,[10] and fecalÿoral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination.[11][12] A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside a host.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bacterium can be grown and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. E. coli is a chemoheterotroph whose chemically defined medium must include a source of carbon and energy.[14] E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism, and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology, where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA. Under favorable conditions, it takes up to 20 minutes to reproduce.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nE. coli is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic (that makes ATP by aerobic respiration if oxygen is present, but is capable of switching to fermentation or anaerobic respiration if oxygen is absent) and nonsporulating bacterium.[16]  Cells are typically rod-shaped, and are about 2.0 m long and 0.25ÿ1.0?m in diameter, with a cell volume of 0.6ÿ0.7?m3.[17][18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nE. coli stains Gram-negative because its cell wall is composed of a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane. During the staining process, E. coli picks up the color of the counterstain safranin and stains pink. The outer membrane surrounding the cell wall provides a barrier to certain antibiotics such that E. coli is not damaged by penicillin.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nStrains that possess flagella are motile. The flagella have a peritrichous arrangement.[20] It also attaches and effaces to the microvilli of the intestines via an adhesion molecule known as intimin.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nE. coli can live on a wide variety of substrates and uses mixed-acid fermentation in anaerobic conditions, producing lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate, and carbon dioxide. Since many pathways in mixed-acid fermentation produce hydrogen gas, these pathways require the levels of hydrogen to be low, as is the case when E. coli lives together with hydrogen-consuming organisms, such as methanogens or sulphate-reducing bacteria.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nOptimum growth of E. coli occurs at 37?C (98.6?F), but some laboratory strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49?C (120?F).[23] E. coli grows in a variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide.[24] E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bacterial cell cycle is divided into three stages.  The B period occurs between the completion of cell division and the beginning of DNA replication.  The C period encompasses the time it takes to replicate the chromosomal DNA.  The D period refers to the stage between the conclusion of DNA replication and the end of cell division.[25]  The doubling rate of E. coli is higher when more nutrients are available.  However, the length of the C and D periods do not change, even when the doubling time becomes less than the sum of the C and D periods.  At the fastest growth rates, replication begins before the previous round of replication has completed, resulting in multiple replication forks along the DNA and overlapping cell cycles.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nE. coli and related bacteria possess the ability to transfer DNA via bacterial conjugation or transduction, which allows genetic material to spread horizontally through an existing population. The process of transduction, which uses the bacterial virus called a bacteriophage,[27] is where the spread of the gene encoding for the Shiga toxin from the Shigella bacteria to E. coli helped produce E. coli O157:H7, the Shiga toxin-producing strain of E. coli.\\r\\n\\r\\nE. coli encompasses an enormous population of bacteria that exhibit a very high degree of both genetic and phenotypic diversity. Genome sequencing of a large number of isolates of E. coli and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable. However, this has not been done, largely due to its medical importance,[28] and E. coli remains one of the most diverse bacterial species: only 20% of the genes in a typical E. coli genome is shared among all strains.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, from the evolutionary point of view, the members of genus Shigella (S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei) should be classified as E. coli strains, a phenomenon termed taxa in disguise.[30] Similarly, other strains of E. coli (e.g. the K-12 strain commonly used in recombinant DNA work) are sufficiently different that they would merit reclassification.\\r\\n\\r\\nA strain is a subgroup within the species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, the ability to use a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples.[11][12] For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.\\r\\n\\r\\nA common subdivision system of E. coli, but not based on evolutionary relatedness, is by serotype, which is based on major surface antigens (O antigen: part of lipopolysaccharide layer; H: flagellin; K antigen: capsule), e.g. O157:H7).[31] It is, however, common to cite only the serogroup, i.e. the O-antigen. At present, about 190 serogroups are known.[32] The common laboratory strain has a mutation that prevents the formation of an O-antigen and is thus not typeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all lifeforms, new strains of E. coli evolve through the natural biological processes of mutation, gene duplication, and horizontal gene transfer; in particular, 18% of the genome of the laboratory strain MG1655 was horizontally acquired since the divergence from Salmonella.[33] E. coli K-12 and E. coli B strains are the most frequently used varieties for laboratory purposes. Some strains develop traits that can be harmful to a host animal. These virulent strains typically cause a bout of diarrhea that is often self-limiting in healthy adults but is frequently lethal to children in the developing world.[34] More virulent strains, such as O157:H7, cause serious illness or death in the elderly, the very young, or the immunocompromised.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genera Escherichia and Salmonella diverged around 102 million years ago (credibility interval: 57ÿ176?mya), which coincides with the divergence of their hosts: the former being found in mammals and the latter in birds and reptiles.[36] This was followed by a split of an Escherichia ancestor into five species (E. albertii, E. coli, E. fergusonii, E. hermannii, and E. vulneris). The last E. coli ancestor split between 20 and 30 million years ago.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long-term evolution experiments using E. coli, begun by Richard Lenski in 1988, have allowed direct observation of genome evolution over more than 65,000 generations in the laboratory.[38] For instance, E. coli typically do not have the ability to grow aerobically with citrate as a carbon source, which is used as a diagnostic criterion with which to differentiate E. coli from other, closely, related bacteria such as Salmonella. In this experiment, one population of E. coli unexpectedly evolved the ability to aerobically metabolize citrate, a major evolutionary shift with some hallmarks of microbial speciation.\\r\\n\\r\\nE. coli is the type species of the genus (Escherichia) and in turn Escherichia is the type genus of the family Enterobacteriaceae, where the family name does not stem from the genus Enterobacter + \\"i\\" (sic.) + \\"aceae\\", but from \\"enterobacterium\\" + \\"aceae\\" (enterobacterium being not a genus, but an alternative trivial name to enteric bacterium).[39][40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original strain described by Escherich is believed to be lost, consequently a new type strain (neotype) was chosen as a representative: the neotype strain is U5/41T,[42] also known under the deposit names DSM 30083,[43] ATCC 11775,[44] and NCTC 9001,[45] which is pathogenic to chickens and has an O1:K1:H7 serotype.[46] However, in most studies, either O157:H7, K-12 MG1655, or K-12 W3110 were used as a representative E. coli. The genome of the type strain has only lately been sequenced.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nA large number of strains belonging to this species have been isolated and characterised. In addition to serotype (vide supra), they can be classified according to their phylogeny, i.e. the inferred evolutionary history, as shown below where the species is divided into six groups.[47][48] Particularly the use of whole genome sequences yields highly supported phylogenies. Based on such data, five subspecies of E. coli were distinguished.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe link between phylogenetic distance (\\"relatedness\\") and pathology is small,[42] e.g. the O157:H7 serotype strains, which form a clade (\\"an exclusive group\\")group E beloware all enterohaemorragic strains (EHEC), but not all EHEC strains are closely related. In fact, four different species of Shigella are nested among E. coli strains (vide supra), while E. albertii and E. fergusonii are outside this group.\\r\\nIndeed, all Shigella species were placed within a single subspecies of E. coli in a phylogenomic study that included the type strain,[42] and for this reason an according reclassification is difficult.\\r\\nAll commonly used research strains of E. coli belong to group A and are derived mainly from Clifton's K-12 strain (? F?; O16) and to a lesser degree from d'Herelle's Bacillus coli strain (B strain)(O7).\\r\\n\\r\\nSalmonella enterica\\r\\n\\r\\nE. albertii\\r\\n\\r\\nE. fergusonii\\r\\n\\r\\nE. coli SE15 (O150:H5.

It is a circular DNA molecule 4.6 million base pairs in length, containing 4288 annotated protein-coding genes (organized into 2584 operons), seven ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons, and 86 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Despite having been the subject of intensive genetic analysis for about 40 years, a large number of these genes were previously unknown. The coding density was found to be very high, with a mean distance between genes of only 118 base pairs. The genome was observed to contain a significant number of transposable genetic elements, repeat elements, cryptic prophages, and bacteriophage remnants.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than three hundred complete genomic sequences of Escherichia and Shigella species are known. The genome sequence of the type strain of E. coli was added to this collection before 2014.[42] Comparison of these sequences shows a remarkable amount of diversity; only about 20% of each genome represents sequences present in every one of the isolates, while around 80% of each genome can vary among isolates.[29] Each individual genome contains between 4,000 and 5,500 genes, but the total number of different genes among all of the sequenced E. coli strains (the pangenome) exceeds 16,000. This very large variety of component genes has been interpreted to mean that two-thirds of the E. coli pangenome originated in other species and arrived through the process of horizontal gene transfer.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nGenes in E. coli are usually named by 4-letter acronyms that derive from their function (when known) and italicized. For instance, recA is named after its role in homologous recombination plus the letter A. Functionally related genes are named recB, recC, recD etc. The proteins are named by uppercase acronyms, e.g. RecA, RecB, etc. When the genome of E. coli was sequenced, all genes were numbered (more or less) in their order on the genome and abbreviated by b numbers, such as b2819 (= recD). The \\"b\\" names were created after Fred Blattner, who led the genome sequence effort.[51] Another numbering system was introduced with the sequence of another E. coli strain, W3110, which was sequenced in Japan and hence uses numbers starting by JW... (Japanese W3110), e.g. JW2787 (= recD).[52]  Hence, recD = b2819 = JW2787. Note, however, that most databases have their own numbering system, e.g. the EcoGene database[53]  uses EG10826 for recD. Finally, ECK numbers are specifically used for alleles in the MG1655 strain of E. coli K-12.[53] Complete lists of genes and their synonyms can be obtained from databases such as EcoGene or Uniprot.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral studies have investigated the proteome of E. coli. By 2006, 1,627 (38%) of the 4,237 open reading frames (ORFs) had been identified experimentally.[54]\\r\\nThe 4,639,221ÿbase pair sequence of Escherichia coli K-12 is presented. Of 4288 protein-coding genes annotated, 38 percent have no attributed function. Comparison with five other sequenced microbes reveals ubiquitous as well as narrowly distributed gene families; many families of similar genes within E. coli are also evident. The largest family of paralogous proteins contains 80 ABC transporters. The genome as a whole is strikingly organized with respect to the local direction of replication; guanines, oligonucleotides possibly related to replication and recombination, and most genes are so oriented. The genome also contains insertion sequence (IS) elements, phage remnants, and many other patches of unusual composition indicating genome plasticity through horizontal transfer.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interactome of E. coli has been studied by affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP/MS) and by analyzing the binary interactions among its proteins.\\r\\n\\r\\nProtein complexes. A 2006 study purified 4,339 proteins from cultures of strain K-12 and found interacting partners for 2,667 proteins, many of which had unknown functions at the time.[56] A 2009 study found 5,993 interactions between proteins of the same E. coli strain, though these data showed little overlap with those of the 2006 publication.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nBinary interactions. Rajagopala et al. (2014) have carried out systematic yeast two-hybrid screens with most E. coli proteins, and found a total of 2,234 protein-protein interactions.[58] This study also integrated genetic interactions and protein structures and mapped 458 interactions within 227 protein complexes.\\r\\n\\r\\nE. coli belongs to a group of bacteria informally known as coliforms that are found in the gastrointestinal tract of warm-blooded animals.[39] E. coli normally colonizes an infant's gastrointestinal tract within 40 hours of birth, arriving with food or water or from the individuals handling the child.  In the bowel, E. coli adheres to the mucus of the large intestine. It is the primary facultative anaerobe of the human gastrointestinal tract.[59] (Facultative anaerobes are organisms that can grow in either the presence or absence of oxygen.) As long as these bacteria do not acquire genetic elements encoding for virulence factors, they remain benign commensals.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nNonpathogenic E. coli strain Nissle 1917, also known as Mutaflor, and E. coli O83:K24:H31 (known as Colinfant[61]) are used as probiotic agents in medicine, mainly for the treatment of various gastroenterological diseases,[62] including inflammatory bowel disease.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost E. coli strains do not cause disease,[64] but virulent strains can cause gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, neonatal meningitis, hemorrhagic colitis, and Crohn's disease. Common signs and symptoms include severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, vomiting, and sometimes fever. In rarer cases, virulent strains are also responsible for bowel necrosis (tissue death) and perforation without progressing to hemolytic-uremic syndrome, peritonitis, mastitis, septicemia, and Gram-negative pneumonia. Very young children are more susceptible to develop severe illness, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, however, healthy individuals of all ages are at risk to the severe consequences that may arise as a result of being infected with E. coli.[59][65][66][67]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome strains of E. coli for example O157:H7, can produce Shiga toxin (classified as a bioterrorism agent).  This toxin causes premature destruction of the red blood cells, which then clog the body's filtering system, the kidneys, causing hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).Unlike most E. coli that naturally live in the gut, the Shiga toxin that causes inflammatory responses in target cells of the gut (the lesions the toxin leaves behind are the reason why bloody diarrhea is a symptom of an Shiga toxin producing E. Coli infection).[21][In some rare cases (usually in children and the elderly) Shiga toxin producing E. Coli infection may lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can cause kidney failure and even death.[21]  Signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome, include decreased frequency of urination, lethargy, and paleness of cheeks and inside the lower eyelids. In 25% of HUS patients, complications of nervous system occur, which in turn causes strokes due to small clots of blood which lodge in capillaries in the brain.  This causes the body parts controlled by this region of the brain not to work properly.  In addition, this strain causes the buildup of fluid (since the kidneys do not work), leading to edema around the lungs and legs and arms.  This increase in fluid buildup especially around the lungs impedes the functioning of the heart, causing an increase in blood pressure.[68][69][70][71][66][67]\\r\\n\\r\\nUropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) is one of the main causes of urinary tract infections.[72] It is part of the normal microbiota in the gut and can be introduced in many ways. In particular for females, the direction of wiping after defecation (wiping back to front) can lead to fecal contamination of the urogenital orifices. Anal intercourse can also introduce this bacterium into the male urethra, and in switching from anal to vaginal intercourse, the male can also introduce UPEC to the female urogenital system.[72] For more information, see the databases at the end of the article or UPEC pathogenicity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2011, one E. coli strain, O104:H4, was the subject of a bacterial outbreak that began in Germany. Certain strains of E. coli are a major cause of foodborne illness. The outbreak started when several people in Germany were infected with enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) bacteria, leading to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a medical emergency that requires urgent treatment. The outbreak did not only concern Germany, but also 15 other countries, including regions in North America.[73] On 30 June 2011, the German Bundesinstitut fr Risikobewertung (BfR) (Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, a federal institute within the German Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection) announced that seeds of fenugreek from Egypt were likely the cause of the EHEC outbreak.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time between ingesting the STEC bacteria and feeling sick is called the \\"incubation period\\". The incubation period is usually 3ÿ4 days after the exposure, but may be as short as 1 day or as long as 10 days. The symptoms often begin slowly with mild belly pain or non-bloody diarrhea that worsens over several days. HUS, if it occurs, develops an average 7 days after the first symptoms, when the diarrhea is improving.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mainstay of treatment is the assessment of dehydration and replacement of fluid and electrolytes. Administration of antibiotics has been shown to shorten the course of illness and duration of excretion of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) in adults in endemic areas and in traveller's diarrhea, though the rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics is increasing and they are generally not recommended.[76] The antibiotic used depends upon susceptibility patterns in the particular geographical region. Currently, the antibiotics of choice are fluoroquinolones or azithromycin, with an emerging role for rifaximin. Oral rifaximin, a semisynthetic rifamycin derivative, is an effective and well-tolerated antibacterial for the management of adults with non-invasive traveller's diarrhea. Rifaximin was significantly more effective than placebo and no less effective than ciprofloxacin in reducing the duration of diarrhea. While rifaximin is effective in patients with E. coli-predominant traveller's diarrhea, it appears ineffective in patients infected with inflammatory or invasive enteropathogens.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nETEC is the type of E. coli that most vaccine development efforts are focused on. Antibodies against the LT and major CFs of ETEC provide protection against LT-producing, ETEC-expressing homologous CFs. Oral inactivated vaccines consisting of toxin antigen and whole cells, i.e. the licensed recombinant cholera B subunit (rCTB)-WC cholera vaccine Dukoral, have been developed. There are currently no licensed vaccines for ETEC, though several are in various stages of development.[78] In different trials, the rCTB-WC cholera vaccine provided high (85ÿ100%) short-term protection. An oral ETEC vaccine candidate consisting of rCTB and formalin inactivated E. coli bacteria expressing major CFs has been shown in clinical trials to be safe, immunogenic, and effective against severe diarrhoea in American travelers but not against ETEC diarrhoea in young children in Egypt. A modified ETEC vaccine consisting of recombinant E. coli strains over-expressing the major CFs and a more LT-like hybrid toxoid called LCTBA, are undergoing clinical testing.[79]\\r\\n[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther proven prevention methods for E. coli transmission include handwashing and improved sanitation and drinking water, as transmission occurs through fecal contamination of food and water supplies. Additionally, thoroughly cooking meat and avoiding consumption of raw, unpasteurized beverages, such as juices and milk are other proven methods for preventing E.coli. Lastly, avoid cross-contamination of utensils and work spaces when preparing food.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of its long history of laboratory culture and ease of manipulation, E. coli plays an important role in modern biological engineering and industrial microbiology.[82] The work of Stanley Norman Cohen and Herbert Boyer in E. coli, using plasmids and restriction enzymes to create recombinant DNA, became a foundation of biotechnology.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nE. coli is a very versatile host for the production of heterologous proteins,[84] and various protein expression systems have been developed which allow the production of recombinant proteins in E. coli. Researchers can introduce genes into the microbes using plasmids which permit high level expression of protein, and such protein may be mass-produced in industrial fermentation processes. One of the first useful applications of recombinant DNA technology was the manipulation of E. coli to produce human insulin.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany proteins previously thought difficult or impossible to be expressed in E. coli in folded form have been successfully expressed in E. coli. For example, proteins with multiple disulphide bonds may be produced in the periplasmic space or in the cytoplasm of mutants rendered sufficiently oxidizing to allow disulphide-bonds to form,[86] while proteins requiring post-translational modification such as glycosylation for stability or function have been expressed using the N-linked glycosylation system of Campylobacter jejuni engineered into E. coli.[87][88][89]\\r\\n\\r\\nModified E. coli cells have been used in vaccine development, bioremediation, production of biofuels,[90] lighting, and production of immobilised enzymes.[84][91]\\r\\n\\r\\nStrain K-12 is a mutant form of E. coli that over-expresses the enzyme Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP).[92] The mutation arises due to a defect in the gene that constantly codes for the enzyme. A gene that is producing a product without any inhibition is said to have constitutive activity. This particular mutant form is used to isolate and purify the aforementioned enzyme.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nStrain OP50 of Escherichia coli is used for maintenance of Caenorhabditis elegans cultures.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrain JM109 is a mutant form of E. coli that is recA and endA deficient developed by Promega. The strain can be utilized for blue/white screening when the cells carry the fertility factor episome[93] Lack of recA decreases the possibility of unwanted restriction of the DNA of interest and lack of endA inhibit plasmid DNA decomposition. Thus, JM109 is useful for cloning and expression systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nE. coli is frequently used as a model organism in microbiology studies. Cultivated strains (e.g. E. coli K12) are well-adapted to the laboratory environment, and, unlike wild-type strains, have lost their ability to thrive in the intestine. Many laboratory strains lose their ability to form biofilms.[94][95] These features protect wild-type strains from antibodies and other chemical attacks, but require a large expenditure of energy and material resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1946, Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum first described the phenomenon known as bacterial conjugation using E. coli as a model bacterium,[96] and it remains the primary model to study conjugation.[97] E. coli was an integral part of the first experiments to understand phage genetics,[98] and early researchers, such as Seymour Benzer, used E. coli and phage T4 to understand the topography of gene structure.[99] Prior to Benzer's research, it was not known whether the gene was a linear structure, or if it had a branching pattern.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nE. coli was one of the first organisms to have its genome sequenced; the complete genome of E. coli K12 was published by Science in 1997.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy evaluating the possible combination of nanotechnologies with landscape ecology, complex habitat landscapes can be generated with details at the nanoscale.[101] On such synthetic ecosystems, evolutionary experiments with E. coli have been performed to study the spatial biophysics of adaptation in an island biogeography on-chip.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies are also being performed attempting to program E. coli to solve complicated mathematics problems, such as the Hamiltonian path problem.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1885, the German-Austrian pediatrician Theodor Escherich discovered this organism in the feces of healthy individuals. He called it Bacterium coli commune because it is found in the colon. Early classifications of prokaryotes placed these in a handful of genera based on their shape and motility (at that time Ernst Haeckel's classification of bacteria in the kingdom Monera was in place).[80][103][104]\\r\\n\\r\\nBacterium coli was the type species of the now invalid genus Bacterium when it was revealed that the former type species (\\"Bacterium triloculare\\") was missing.[105] Following a revision of Bacterium, it was reclassified as Bacillus coli by Migula in 1895[106] and later reclassified in the newly created genus Escherichia, named after its original discoverer.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nBacterium coli has since been used for biological lab experiment research, infection can lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal injury.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996 the world's worst outbreak of E. coli food poisoning occurred in Wishaw, Scotland, killing 20 people.[109]","input":"What is the full name of e coli?"},{"output":"five out of a planned seven volumes","context":"","input":"How many books make up the game of thrones series?"},{"output":"actress","context":"LisaRaye McCoy (born September 23, 1967),[3][4][5][6] known as LisaRaye, is an American actress, model, businesswoman and fashion designer.

The fire burned 229,651 acres (92,936?ha; 359?sq?mi), before it was 100% contained late on August 30, 2018. The Carr Fire destroyed at least 1,604 structures (at least 1,077 were homes) while damaging 277 others,[1] becoming the sixth-most destructive fire in California history,[6] as well as the seventh-largest wildfire recorded in modern California history.[7] The Carr Fire cost over $1.659 billion (2018) in damages, including $1.5 billion in insured losses and more than $158.7 million in suppression costs.[3][4][5] At its height, the fire engaged as many as 4,766 personnel from multiple agencies. [8] The fire was reported on the afternoon of July 23, 2018, at the intersection of Highway 299 and Carr Powerhouse Road, in the Whiskeytown district of the WhiskeytownÿShastaÿTrinity National Recreation Area. The fire was started when a flat tire on a vehicle caused the wheel's rim to scrape against the asphalt, creating sparks that set off the fire.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 26, the fire jumped the Sacramento River, making its way into the city of Redding, causing the evacuation of 38,000 people.

Eight people died in the fire, including three firefighters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Carr Fire was reported on the afternoon of July 23, 2018, at the intersection of Highway 299 and Carr Powerhouse Road, in the Whiskeytown district of the WhiskeytownÿShastaÿTrinity National Recreation Area, in Shasta County, California, near French Gulch. The fire was believed to have been started accidentally by a vehicle towing a dual-axle travel trailer.  One of the tires on the trailer blew out, causing the steel rim to scrape along the pavement, generating sparks that ignited dry vegetation along the edge of the highway.  Wind caused the fire to spread quickly.[10][11] Hot conditions and steep, inaccessible terrain presented challenges for fire crews as they strengthened containment lines. Highway 299 was closed and French Gulch was placed under mandatory evacuation.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOvernight from July 25 to 26, the fire grew to 20,000 acres (8,094?ha) in total area burned.[13] By the evening of July 26, the fire had burned 28,763 acres (11,640?ha) and was 10 percent contained.[14] It was reported to have destroyed 15 buildings and damaged 5, while remaining a threat to 496 other buildings.[1] The fire jumped the Sacramento River and portions of the western area of Redding were put under mandatory evacuation orders. Power to residents in North Redding was shut off by Redding Electric Utility. A state of emergency was declared by Governor Jerry Brown.[14] The evacuation center at Shasta High School was relocated to Shasta College.[15] A firefighter was killed while operating a bulldozer.[16] The National Guard was called in to help fight the fire on the night of July 26.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire remained active overnight, with fire crews continuing to build containment lines. However, crews were stalled in their work due to the fire's extreme behavior.[18] Just after midnight, evacuation orders were put in place for Shasta Dam, Summit City, and neighborhoods in western Redding.[19] A second firefighter, Jeremy Stoke of the Redding Fire Department, was killed and it was reported that three firefighters from Marin County sustained burns. They were defending a structure when a heat blast from the flames came towards them. All three were released, with one being evaluated at the University of California, Davis Burn Center for burns on his face, hands and ears.[16][20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the evening of July 27, the fire had destroyed 500 structures and threatened almost 5,000. CrossPointe Community Church was named the third evacuation place.[22] Amtrak announced that their Coast Starlight service would stop in Sacramento and Klamath Falls with alternative transportation being provided.[23] Containment lines remained the priority for firefighters overnight. Red flag warnings and heat advisories were put in place for the area.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the next morning, over 38,000 individuals had been evacuated.[21] The Shasta College evacuation center reached capacity by July 28 and two more shelters operated by the Red Cross, and one at Grace Baptist Church, were opened.[25] President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the state of California due to this fire and other fires burning in the state.[26] The communities of Happy Valley and Anderson, as well as other areas, were put under mandatory evacuation in the mid-morning.[1] A woman and two children, who were reported missing on July 26 due to the fire, were reported dead.[2] More buildings were evaluated for damage, bringing the total up to 536 destroyed and 117 damaged. Winds were erratic, fueled by hot weather, which created spot fires throughout the fire area.[27] Weaverville Elementary School was closed as an evacuation center and a new center was opened at Trinity High School.[28] In the evening, new evacuation orders were put in place for Highway 299 at Trinity Dam Road west to Douglas City and other nearby subdivisions.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nA sixth fatality was reported on July 29, as the fire moved from densely populated areas and into rural parts of Shasta and Trinity Counties. The community of Lewiston was evacuated. By the evening, fire containment had grown from 5 to 17 percent. The National Guard was assigned to Redding to monitor for looting in evacuated neighborhoods.[30] The next day, repopulation began of areas of western Redding, Shasta Lake, and Happy Valley that had previously been evacuated.[31][32][33] Overnight, strengthening containment lines remained a priority as east and west winds converged and created challenges for firefighters.[1] Repopulation efforts continued, starting on the morning of July 31 for areas of western Redding, Summit City, Buckeye, and Happy Valley.[34][35] Celebrity chef Guy Fieri provided food for evacuees in Redding.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the evening of July 31, the fire had burned 112,888 acres (45,684?ha) and was 30 percent contained.[1] Crews were challenged by the fire along the western edge, where the fire burned in high terrain with strong winds and dry fuels.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nA powerful fire whirl with winds estimated in excess of 143?mph (230?km/h)equivalent to an EF3 tornadodeveloped within the Carr Fire in Redding, California, on July?26. Remaining on the ground from 7:30ÿ8:00?p.m., the fire whirl reached an estimated height of 18,000?ft (5,500?m) and caused extensive tornado-like damage while spreading the fire.[38][39] The winds toppled transmission towers, shredded foliage, and debarked and uprooted trees. The smoke plume from the whirl \\"dominated\\" the majority of the wildfire.[39] Substantial damage occurred in areas untouched by fire, including signs of ground scouring.[38] Three people were killed inside their Redding home after the structure's walls were blown out and the roof collapsed on the occupants. Several other homes suffered significant roof damage.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire grew over 2,000 acres (809?ha) and to 35 percent containment, as the fire burned into August 1.[37] Late morning, evacuation orders were lifted for the Mary Lake Subdivision and, later in the day, residents were allowed back to Plateau Road.[41][42] The City of Redding shut down their Carr Fire-related missing persons hotline as all missing people were accounted for. Shasta College, which served as an evacuation center, resumed normal services. Six people were reported as arrested for alleged looting or illegally being in evacuated areas.[41] The area west of Lakehead, California, was closed to public access to allow for fire crews' safety.[43] Thus far, the fire had destroyed 1,546 structures, including 1,058 residential and 13 commercial.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning of August 2, the fire was 125,842 acres (50,926?ha) and remained 35 percent contained.[1] Over 1,600 structures remained threatened, due to the fire. The Carr Fire continued to grow as the terrain, wind, and dry fuels continued to create challenges for fire crews. The Sunset West, Sunset Terrace, Ranch Land Acres, Middletown Park neighborhoods, and Centerville were reopened to population in the morning.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy August 4, the fire grew to 145,015 acres (58,685?ha) and to 41 percent containment. California Governor Jerry Brown toured the site and announced that he had requested a major disaster declaration, which provides federal assistance.[46] Later that day, President Donald Trump approved the request for Shasta County.[47] A seventh fatality was reported when a PG&E employee died in a vehicle incident.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy August 9, the fire grew to 178,752 acres (72,338?ha), with 49 percent containment. Early that morning, a Cal Fire heavy equipment mechanic was killed in a traffic incident, bringing the total number of fatalities to eight.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the evening of August 30, the Carr Fire was reported to be 100% contained, at 229,651 acres (92,936?ha).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Carr Fire is currently the sixth-most destructive in California history.[45] It caused evacuations of over 36,000 people in the communities of French Gulch, Igo, Ono, Lewiston, Douglas City, Shasta, Shasta Lake City, Summit City, and the City of Redding, and caused closures of portions of California State Route 299. The fire directly impacted the water sources Keswick Dam and Shasta Dam.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire affected recreational activities. At early stages, the access to WhiskeytownÿShastaÿTrinity National Recreation Area was halted, specifically in Shasta County, including access to Whiskey Creek and Whiskeytown Lake.[12] The area surrounding Shasta Dam and the dam's visitors center were evacuated and closed.[1] Lake Redding Park and the adjacent golf course were closed due to the fire after it jumped the Sacramento River, destroying close to 40 homes in the surrounding neighborhood.[51] The Bureau of Land Management closed trails in western Redding.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmtrak service on the Coast Starlight was disrupted between Sacramento and Klamath Falls, Oregon. Amtrak arranged alternative transportation for travelers between those two cities.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nLarge portions of Highway 299 were closed as a result of the fire. Many sections of the highway's route through Redding were closed, including the North Market Street Bridge which connects downtown Redding to the Benton Tract neighborhood. Highway 273 was closed in many areas.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess to Keswick Dam was restricted and the surrounding areas were evacuated as a result of the fire.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess to the remains of the historic ghost town of Gas Point was restricted due to the fire. A 2008 fire had destroyed the historic town.[52] The historic town of French Gulch was evacuated and closed. This was the second time the community had been evacuated due to a fire, the prior evacuation taking place in August 2004, in which 103 structures burned in the community.[12] The Shasta State Historic Park was also affected, where the 1920s schoolhouse was destroyed and other buildings were damaged. Artifacts had been removed before the fire.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire affected air quality throughout Northern California and the Central Valley down to Bakersfield, Oregon, Washington and Nevada. Smoke reached as far north as Seattle, Washington, and Boise, Idaho.[54][55]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo firefighters have been killed in the Carr Fire. One was a contract firefighter who was driving a bulldozer when he died.[16] The second was Redding-based fire inspector Jeremy Stoke.[50] On July 28, a great-grandmother and her two great-grandchildren were found dead, as they did not have a car and were unable to evacuate.[56] A sixth fatality was reported on July 29. An evacuation order was issued to the victim, but they did not evacuate.[30] The victim was recovering from heart surgery, which possibly prevented him from leaving.[57] On August 4, a PG&E employee was killed in a vehicle incident.[48] On August 9, a Cal Fire heavy equipment mechanic was killed in a traffic incident.[49]","input":"How big is the car fire in redding california?"},{"output":"HOV lanes are normally created to increase average vehicle occupancy and persons traveling with the goal of reducing traffic congestion and air pollution","context":"A high-occupancy vehicle lane (also known as an HOV lane, carpool lane, diamond lane, 2+ lane, and transit lane or T2 or T3 lanes in Australia and New Zealand) is a restricted traffic lane reserved at peak travel times or longer for the exclusive use of vehicles with a driver and one or more passengers, including carpools, vanpools, and transit buses. The normal minimum occupancy level is 2 or 3 occupants. Many jurisdictions exempt other vehicles, including motorcycles, charter buses, emergency and law enforcement vehicles, low-emission and other green vehicles, and/or single-occupancy vehicles paying a toll. HOV lanes are normally created to increase average vehicle occupancy and persons traveling with the goal of reducing traffic congestion and air pollution,[1][2][3] although their effectiveness is questionable.[4]\\r\\nRegional and corporate-sponsored vanpools, carpools, and rideshare communities give commuters a way to increase occupancy. For places without such services, online rideshare communities can serve a similar purpose.[citation needed] Slugging lines are common in some places, where solo drivers pick up a passenger to share the ride and allow use of the HOV lane. High-occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes) have been introduced in the United States to allow solo driver vehicles to use the lane on payment of a variable fee, which usually varies with demand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introduction of HOV lanes in the United States progressed slowly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Major growth occurred from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s.[5] The first freeway HOV lane in the United States was implemented in the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway in Northern Virginia, between Washington, DC, and the Capital Beltway, and was opened in 1969 as a bus-only lane.[5][6][7] The busway was opened in December 1973 to carpools with four or more occupants, becoming the first instance in which buses and carpools officially shared a HOV lane over a considerable distance.[8][9]\\r\\nIn 2005, the two lanes of this HOV 3+ facility carried during the morning peak hour (6:30 am to 9:30 am) a total of 31,700 people in 8,600 vehicles (3.7 persons/veh), while the three or four general-purpose lanes carried 23,500 people in 21,300 vehicles (1.1 persons/veh). Average travel time in the HOV facility was 29 minutes, and 64 minutes in the general traffic lanes.[10] As of 2012, the I-95/I-395 HOV facility is 30?mi (48?km) long and extends from Washington, D.C., to Dumfries, Virginia, and has two reversible lanes separated from the regular lanes by barriers, with access through elevated on- and off-ramps. Three or more people in a vehicle (HOV 3+) are required to travel on the facility during rush hours on weekdays.[11]\\r\\nThe second freeway HOV facility was the contraflow bus lane on the Lincoln Tunnel Approach and Helix in Hudson County, New Jersey, opened in 1970.[5] According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Lincoln Tunnel XBL is the country's HOV facility with the highest number of peak hour persons among HOV facilities with utilization data available, with 23,500 persons in the morning peak,[6] and 62,000 passengers during the four-hour morning peak.[12]\\r\\nThe first permanent HOV facility in California was the bypass lane at the San FranciscoÿOakland Bay Bridge toll plaza, opened to the public in April 1970.[7] The El Monte Busway (I-10 / San Bernardino Freeway) in Los Angeles was initially only available for buses when it opened in 1973. Three-person carpools were allowed to use the bus lane for three months in 1974 due to a strike by bus operators, and then permanently at a 3+ HOV from 1976. It is one of the most efficient HOV facilities in North America[13] and is currently being converted into a high-occupancy toll lane operation to allow low-occupancy vehicles to bid for excess capacity on the lane in the Metro ExpressLanes project.[14]\\r\\nBeginning in the 1970s, the Urban Mass Transit Administration recognized the advantages of exclusive bus lanes and encouraged their funding. In the 1970s the FHWA began to allow state highway agencies to spend federal funds on HOV lanes.[8] As a result of the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo, interest in ridesharing picked up, and states began experimenting with HOV lanes. In order to reduce crude oil consumption, the 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act mandated maximum speed limits of 55?mph (89?km/h) on public highways and became the first instance when the U.S. federal government provided funding for ridesharing and states were allowed to spend their highway funds on rideshare demonstration projects. The 1978 Surface Transportation Assistance Act made funding for rideshare initiatives permanent.[9]\\r\\nAlso during the early 1970s, ridesharing was recommended for the first time as a tool to mitigate air quality problems. The 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments established the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and gave the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) substantial authority to regulate air quality attainment. A final control plan for the Los Angeles Basin was issued in 1973, and one of its main provisions was a two-phase conversion of 184?mi (296?km) of freeway and arterial roadway lanes to bus/carpool lanes and the development of a regional computerized carpool matching system. However, it took until 1985 before any HOV project was constructed in Los Angeles County, and by 1993 there were only 58?mi (93?km) of HOV lanes countywide.[9]\\r\\nA significant policy shift took place in October 1990, when a memorandum from the FHWA administrator stated that \\"FHWA strongly supports the objective of HOV preferential facilities and encourages the proper application of HOV technology.\\" Regional administrators were directed to promote HOV lanes and related facilities.[8] Also in the early 1990s, two laws reinforced the U.S. commitment to HOV lane construction. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 included HOV lanes as one of the transportation control measures that could be included in state implementation plans to attain federal air quality standards. The 1990 amendments also deny the administrator of the EPA the authority to block FHWA from funding 24-hour HOV lanes as part of the sanctions for a state's failure to comply with the Clean Air Act, if the secretary of transportation wishes to approve the FHWA funds.[8]\\r\\nOn the other hand, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 encouraged the construction of HOV lanes, which were made eligible for Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds in regions not attaining federal air quality standards. CMAQ funds may be spent on new HOV lane construction, even if the HOV designation holds only at peak travel times or in the peak direction. ISTEA also provided that under the Interstate Maintenance Program, only HOV projects would receive the 90% federal matching ratio formerly available for the addition of general purpose lanes. And ISTEA permitted state authorities to define a high occupancy vehicle as having a minimum of two occupants (HOV 2+).[8]\\r\\nAs of 2009, California was the state with the most HOV facilities in the country, with 88, followed by Minnesota with 83 facilities, Washington with 41, Texas with 35, and Virginia with 21. The only active U.S. facility with two HOV lanes in each direction is I-110 between Adams Boulevard and SR 91 in Los Angeles.[6] By 2006, HOV lanes in California were operating at two-thirds of their capacity, and these HOV facilities carried on average 2,518 persons per hour during peak hours, substantially more people than the congested general-traffic lanes.[1] As of 2008, the longest HOV facility in operation was the I-95 between SR 112 and Gateway Boulevard in Miami, Florida, with 116.0?mi (186.7?km) of lanes in a route of 58.0?mi (93.3?km). This facility has been exceeded by the HOV facility on the I-495 Capital Beltway in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area, that has two HOV lanes in each direction with elevated on/off ramp access, for a total of 224.0?mi (360.5?km) of HOV lanes in a route of 56.0?mi (90.1?km).[6]\\r\\nAs of 2012, there are some 126 HOV facilities on freeways in 27 metropolitan areas in the United States, which includes over 1,000 corridor miles (1,600?km).[15]\\r\\nThe first HOV facilities in Canada were opened in Greater Vancouver and Toronto in the early 1990s, followed shortly by facilities in Ottawa, Gatineau, Montreal, and later Calgary. As of 2010 there were about 150?km (93?mi) of highway HOV lanes in 11 locations in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, and over 130?km (81?mi) of arterial HOV lanes in 24 locations in Greater Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and Gatineau.[1] The Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) estimated in 2006 that commuters in Toronto using the HOV facilities on Highways 403 and 404 were saving 14ÿ17 minutes per trip compared to their travel time before the HOV lanes opened. The MTO also estimated that almost 40% of commuters were carpooling on Highway 403 eastbound in the morning peak hour, compared to 14% in 2003, and 37% of commuters were carpooling on Highway 403 westbound in the afternoon peak hour, compared to 22% in 2003. The average rush hour speed on the HOV lanes is 100?km/h (62?mph), compared to 60?km/h (37?mph) in general-traffic lanes on Highway 403.[1] Temporary HOV lanes were added to selections of 400-series highways in the Greater Toronto Area for the 2015 Pan Am Games and 2015 Parapan American Games.\\r\\nAs of 2012 there are a few HOV lanes in operation in Europe. The main reason for this is that, in general, European cities have better public transport services and fewer high-capacity multi-lane urban motorways than do the U.S. and Canada. However, at around 1.3 persons per vehicle, average car occupancy is relatively low in most European cities.[16] The emphasis in Europe has been on providing bus lanes and on-street bus priority measures.[17] The first HOV lane in Europe was opened in the Netherlands in October 1993 and operated until August 1994. Its facility was a 7?km (4.3?mi) barrier-separated HOV 3+ on the A1 near Amsterdam. The facility did not attract enough users to overcome public criticism and was converted to a reversible lane open to general traffic after the judge in a legal test case ruled that Dutch traffic law lacked the concept of a car pool and thus that the principle of equality was violated.[17][18]\\r\\nSpain was the next European country to introduce HOV lanes, when median reversible HOV lanes were opened in Madrid's N-VI National Highway in 1995. This facility is Europe's oldest HOV facility that is still in operation.[17] The first HOV facility in the United Kingdom opened in Leeds in 1998. The facility was implemented on A647 road near Leeds as an experimental scheme, but it became permanent. The HOV facility is 1.5?km (0.93?mi) long and operates as a HOV 2+ facility.[16][17][19] A 2.8?km (1.7?mi) HOV 3+ facility opened in Linz, Austria, in 1999. Sweden opened its first HOV lane in Stockholm in 2000, an 8?km (5.0?mi) HOV 3+ facility.[20] The first HOV lane in Norway was implemented in May 2001 as an HOV 3+ on Elgeseter Street, an undivided four-lane arterial road in Trondheim. This facility was followed by HOV lanes in Oslo and Kristiansand.[17][21]\\r\\nThe first HOV lane (known as a Transit Lane T2 or T3[22]) in Australia opened in February 1992. This is located on the Eastern Highway in Melbourne.[23] As of 2012, there were also T2 and T3 facilities in Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane.\\r\\nIn Auckland, New Zealand, there are several short HOV 2+ and 3+ lanes throughout the region, commonly known as T2 and T3 lanes.[24] There is a T2 transit lane in Tamaki Drive, in a short stretch between Glendowie and downtown Auckland.[25] There are also T2 priority lanes on Auckland's Northern, Southern, Northwestern, and Southwestern Motorways. These priority lanes are left-side on-ramp lanes heading towards the motorway, where vehicles with two or more people can bypass the ramp meter signal. Priority lanes can also be used by trucks, buses, and motorcycles, and the priority lanes can be used by carpoolers at any time.[25] 11 lanes have been opened to electric vehicles, too.[26] There are also several short T2 and T3 facilities in North Shore City operating during rush hours.[27]\\r\\nIn Jakarta, HOV 3+ is known as \\"Three in One\\" (Tiga dalam satu) and was first implemented by governor Sutiyoso. HOV 3+ is implemented on weekdays in existing roads of Sisingamangraja Road (fast and slow lane), Jenderal Sudirman Road (fast and slow lane), MH. Thamrin Road (fast and slow lane), Medan Merdeka Barat Road, Majapahit Road, and sections of Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto. The policy was originally implemented only between 7:00 am and 10:00 am. Since the introduction of Jakarta's bus rapid transit in December 2003, the policy was extended to 7:00 am ÿ 10:00 am and 4:00 pm ÿ 7:00 pm. In September 2004, the evening time was changed to 4:30 pm ÿ 7:00 pm.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Shenzhen, HOV 2+ is going to be implemented on Binhai Avenue from 25 April 2016. The policy will be extended to 7:30 am ÿ 9:30 am and 5:30 pm ÿ 9:30 pm.\\r\\nIn Chengdu, From January 23, 2017, HOV 2+ has been implemented on Kehua Road South, Kehua Road Middle, and Tianfu Avenue Section 1 and 2, during 7:00 am-9:00am and 5:00 pm-7:00pm.\\r\\nIn Dalian, an expressway (Northeast Expressway, or Dongbei Expressway) linking old town and new town had one lane in both outbound and inbound directions set to HOV 2+. Starting from September 20 2017, commuters can opt to drive in HOV lane on Northeast Expressway during the morning peak hours of 06:30-08:30, and evening peak hours of 16:30-19:00. A fine of CNY100 (about USD15) will be enforced for first violators. For a second violation, the fine will double.\\r\\nHOV lanes may be either a single traffic lane within the main roadway with distinctive markings or a separate roadway with one or more traffic lanes either parallel to the general lanes or grade-separated, above or below the general lanes. For example, Interstate 110 in California has four HOV lanes on an upper deck.\\r\\nHOV bypass lanes to allow carpool traffic to bypass areas of regular congestion in many places, and an HOV lane may operate as a reversible lane, working in the direction of the dominant traffic flow in both the morning and the afternoon. All lanes of a 10 miles (16?km) section of the Interstate 66 in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., are treated as an HOV during the rush hour in the primary direction of flow.[11]\\r\\nThe traffic speed differential between HOV and general-purpose lanes creates a potentially dangerous situation if the HOV lanes are not separated by a barrier. A Texas Transportation Institute study found that HOV lanes lacking barrier separations caused a 50% increase in injury crashes.[28]\\r\\nA business access and transit (BAT) lane is a type of HOV lane that allows for all traffic to enter the lane for a short distance in order to access other streets and business entrances.[29]\\r\\nBecause some HOV lanes were not utilized to their full capacity, users of low- or single-occupancy vehicles may be permitted to use an HOV lane if they pay a toll. This scheme is known as high-occupancy toll lane (or HOT lanes), and it has been introduced mainly in the United States. The first practical implementation was California's formerly private toll 91 Express Lanes, in Orange County, California, in 1995, followed in 1996 by Interstate 15 north of San Diego.[30][31] According to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, by 2012 there were 294 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes and 163 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes under construction in the United States.[32]\\r\\nSolo drivers are permitted to use the HOV lanes upon payment of a fee that varies based on demand. Tolls change throughout the day according to real-time traffic conditions, which is intended to manage the number of cars in the lanes to maintain good journey times.[33][34]\\r\\nProponents claim that all motorists benefit from HOT lanes, even those who choose not to use them. This argument applies only to projects that increase the total number of lanes.[35] Proponents also claim that HOT lanes provide an incentive to use transit and ridesharing.[citation needed] There has been controversy over this concept, and HOT schemes have been called \\"Lexus\\" lanes, as critics see this new pricing scheme as a perk for the rich.[36]\\r\\nHOT tolls are collected by manned toll booths, automatic number plate recognition, or electronic toll collection systems. Some systems use RFID transmitters to monitor entry and exiting of the lane and charge drivers depending on demand. Typically, tolls increase as traffic density and congestion within the tolled lanes increase, a policy known as congestion pricing. The goal of this pricing scheme is to minimize traffic congestion within the lanes.[37][38]\\r\\nQualification for HOV status varies by scheme, but the following vehicles may be included:\\r\\nNew York City HOV lane codes prior to 2008 did not allow motorcycles leading to ticketing of motorcycle drivers and complaints from the American Motorcyclist Association, but have since been revised to comply with the federal regulations listed above.[43][45][46]\\r\\nIn some jurisdictions such as Ontario, Canada, taxicabs and airport limousines are allowed to use HOV lanes even when no passenger is present because that vehicle \\"will be able return to duty faster after dropping off a fare or arrive sooner to pick up a fare, thereby moving more people to their destinations in fewer vehicles\\".[44]\\r\\nIn Virginia, commuters form sluglines where drivers pick up one or more passengers from a designated \\"slug lines\\" to drive on HOV lanes along interstate 95/395; the driver pulls over near the sluglines and shouts out his or her destination, and people in the line going to that destination enter the car on a first-come, first-served basis.[47]\\r\\nFines are usually imposed on drivers of non-qualifying vehicles who use the lanes.[48]\\r\\nFollowing the introduction the HOVs, some drivers placed inflatable dolls in the passenger seat, a practice that persists today, even though it is now illegal.[48] Cameras that can distinguish between humans and mannequins or dolls were tested in the United Kingdom in 2005.[49]\\r\\nIn the United States, law enforcement officials have documented a variety of methods used by drivers in attempts to circumvent HOV occupancy rules:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2015, a motorist tried to use a cardboard cutout of actor Jonathan Goldsmith to access an HOV lane in Fife, Washington. The officer noted that other drivers had used sleeping bags in earlier attempts to access the HOV lane.[51]\\r\\nIn January 2013, a motorist tried to claim that the Articles of Incorporation of his business, which had been placed unbuckled on the passengers seat, constituted a person, citing the principle of corporate personhood and California's state Vehicle Code, which defines a person as \\"natural persons and corporations\\". This argument was rejected in traffic court, where the presiding judge commented, \\"Common sense says carrying a sheath of papers in the front seat does not relieve traffic congestion.\\"[52]\\r\\nIn February 2010, a 61-year-old woman tried to pass off a life-sized mannequin as a passenger in order to use the HOV lane in New York State. A police officer on a routine HOV patrol became suspicious when he noticed that the so-called passenger was wearing sunglasses and using the visor on a cloudy morning. When the officer approached the vehicle, he discovered that the \\"passenger\\" was, in fact, a mannequin wearing lipstick, designer shades, a full-length wig, and a blue sweater. The driver was issued a traffic ticket for using the HOV lane without a human passenger, which carries a fine of $135 and two points on a driver's license.[53][54]\\r\\nIn early 2006, an Arizona woman asserted that she had been improperly ticketed for using the HOV lane because the unborn child she was carrying in her womb justified her use of the lane, while noting that Arizona traffic laws do not define what constitutes a person. However, a judge subsequently ruled that to qualify as an \\"individual\\" under Arizona traffic laws, the individual must occupy a \\"separate and distinct\\" space in a vehicle.[50] Likewise, in California, in order to use HOV lanes, there must be two (or, if posted, three) separate individuals occupying seats in a vehicle, and an unborn child does not count towards this requirement.[55]\\r\\nIn 2009 and 2010 it was found that non-compliance rates on HOV lanes in Brisbane, Australia, were approaching 90%. Enhanced enforcement led to increased compliance, average bus journey times dropped by up to 19%, and total person throughput increased by 12%.[56] In 2006 it was claimed that many vehicles had only one occupant.[57]\\r\\nAccording to 2009 data from the U.S. census, 76% drive to work alone and only 10% rideshare; for suburban commuters working in a city, the solo driving rate is 82%.[58]\\r\\nSome underused HOV lanes in several states have been converted to high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT), which offer solo drivers access to HOV lanes after paying a toll.[58]\\r\\nHOV lanes are also an effective way to manage traffic after natural disasters, as seen in New York City after Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. At the time Mayor Bloomberg banned passenger cars with less than three occupants from entering Manhattan. The restriction affected all bridges and tunnels entering the city except the George Washington Bridge.[59]\\r\\nCritics have argued that HOV lanes are underused. It is unclear whether HOV lanes are sufficiently used to compensate for delays in the other mixed-use lanes.[60][61]\\r\\nIn 1995, six people died in a head-on collision when the gates of a reversible lane were not set correctly on the Interstate 279 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[62]\\r\\nStandard restrictive traffic sign in the United States.

It introduced Count Dracula, and established many conventions of subsequent vampire fantasy.[1] The novel tells the story of Dracula's attempt to move from Transylvania to England so that he may find new blood and spread the undead curse, and of the battle between Dracula and a small group of men and a woman led by Professor Abraham Van Helsing.\\r\\nDracula has been assigned to many literary genres including vampire literature, horror fiction, the gothic novel, and invasion literature. The novel has spawned numerous theatrical, film, and television interpretations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is told in epistolary format, as a series of letters, diary entries, newspaper articles, and ships' log entries, whose narrators are the novel's protagonists, and occasionally supplemented with newspaper clippings relating events not directly witnessed. The events portrayed in the novel take place chronologically and largely in England and Transylvania during the 1890s and all transpire within the same year between 3 May and 6 November. A short note is located at the end of the final chapter written 7 years after the events outlined in the novel.\\r\\nThe tale begins with Jonathan Harker, a newly qualified English solicitor, visiting Count Dracula in the Carpathian Mountains on the border of Transylvania, Bukovina, and Moldavia, to provide legal support for a real estate transaction overseen by Harker's employer, Mr Peter Hawkins of Exeter. At first enticed by Dracula's gracious manners, Harker soon realizes that he is Dracula's prisoner. Wandering the Count's castle against Dracula's admonition, Harker encounters three female vampires, called \\"the sisters\\", from whom he is rescued by Dracula. Harker soon realizes that Dracula himself is also a vampire. After the preparations are made, Dracula leaves Transylvania and abandons Harker to the sisters. Harker barely escapes from the castle with his life.\\r\\nDracula boards a Russian ship, the Demeter, taking along with him boxes of Transylvanian soil, which he required in order to regain his strength. Not long afterward, the ship having weighed anchor at Varna, runs aground on the shores of Whitby in the east coast of England. The captain's log narrates the gradual disappearance of the entire crew, until the captain alone remained, himself bound to the helm to maintain course. An animal resembling \\"a large dog\\" is seen leaping ashore. The ship's cargo is described as silver sand and 50 boxes of \\"mould\\", or earth, from Transylvania. It is later learned that Dracula successfully purchased multiple estates under the alias 'Count De Ville' throughout London and devised to distribute the 50 boxes to each of them utilizing transportation services as well as moving them himself. He does this to secure for himself \\"lairs\\" and the 50 boxes of earth would be used as his graves which would grant safety and rest during times of feeding and replenishing his strength.\\r\\nHarker's fiance, Mina Murray, is staying with her friend Lucy Westenra, who is holidaying in Whitby. Lucy receives three marriage proposals from Dr. John Seward, Quincey Morris, and Arthur Holmwood (the son of Lord Godalming who later obtains the title himself[2]). Lucy accepts Holmwood's proposal while turning down Seward and Morris, but all remain friends. Dracula communicates with Seward's patient, Renfield, an insane man who wishes to consume insects, spiders, birds, and rats to absorb their \\"life force\\". Renfield is able to detect Dracula's presence and supplies clues accordingly.\\r\\nSoon Dracula is indirectly shown to be stalking Lucy. As time passes she begins to suffer from episodes of sleepwalking and dementia, as witnessed by Mina. When Lucy begins to waste away suspiciously, Seward invites his old teacher, Abraham Van Helsing, who immediately determines the true cause of Lucy's condition. He refuses to disclose it but diagnoses her with acute blood-loss. Van Helsing prescribes numerous blood transfusions to which he, Seward, Quincey, and Arthur all contribute over time. Van Helsing also prescribes garlic flowers to be placed throughout her room and weaves a necklace of withered garlic blossoms for her to wear. However she continues to waste away ÿ appearing to lose blood every night. While both doctors are absent, Lucy and her mother are attacked by a wolf and Mrs. Westenra, who has a heart condition, dies of fright. Van Helsing attempts to protect her with garlic but fate thwarts him each night, whether Lucy's mother removes the garlic from her room, or Lucy herself does so in her restless sleep. The doctors have found two small puncture marks about her neck, which Dr. Seward is at a loss to understand. After Lucy dies, Van Helsing places a golden crucifix over her mouth, ostensibly to delay or prevent Lucy's vampiric conversion. Fate conspires against him again when Van Helsing finds the crucifix in the possession of one of the servants who stole it off Lucy's corpse.\\r\\nFollowing Lucy's death and burial, the newspapers report children being stalked in the night by a \\"bloofer lady\\" (i.e., \\"beautiful lady\\").[3] Van Helsing, knowing Lucy has become a vampire, confides in Seward, Lord Godalming, and Morris. The suitors and Van Helsing track her down and, after a confrontation with her, stake her heart, behead her, and fill her mouth with garlic. Around the same time, Jonathan Harker arrives from Budapest, where Mina marries him after his escape, and he and Mina join the campaign against Dracula.\\r\\nThe vampire hunters stay at Dr. Seward's residence, holding nightly meetings and providing reports based on each of their various tasks. Mina discovers that each of their journals and letters collectively contain clues to which they can track him down. She tasks herself with collecting them, researching newspaper clippings, fitting the most relevant entries into chronological order and typing out copies to distribute to each of the party which they are to study. Jonathan Harker tracks down the shipments of boxed graves and the estates which Dracula has purchased in order to store them. Van Helsing conducts research along with Dr. Seward to analyze the behaviour of their patient Renfield who they learn is directly influenced by Dracula. They also research historical events, folklore, and superstitions from various cultures to understand Dracula's powers and weaknesses. Van Helsing also establishes a criminal profile on Dracula in order to better understand his actions and predict his movements. Arthur Holmwood's fortune assists in funding the entire operation and expenses. As they discover the various properties Dracula had purchased, the male protagonists team up to raid each property and are several times confronted by Dracula. As they discover each of the boxed graves scattered throughout London, they pry them open to place and seal wafers of sacramental bread within. This act renders the boxes of earth completely useless to Dracula as he is unable to open, enter or further transport them.\\r\\nAfter Dracula learns of the group's plot against him, he attacks Mina on three occasions, and feeds Mina his own blood to control her. This curses Mina with vampirism and changes her but does not completely turn her into a vampire. Van Helsing attempts to bless Mina through prayer and by placing a wafer of sacrament against her forehead, but it burns her upon contact leaving a wretched scar. Under this curse, Mina oscillates from consciousness to a semi-trance during which she perceives Dracula's surroundings and actions. Van Helsing is able to use hypnotism twice a day, at dawn and at sunset, to put her into this trance to further track Dracula's movements. Mina, afraid of Dracula's link with her, urges the team not to tell her their plans out of fear that Dracula will be listening. After the protagonists discover and sterilize 49 boxes found throughout his lairs in London, they learn that Dracula has fled with the missing 50th box back to his castle in Transylvania. They pursue him under the guidance of Mina. They split up into teams once they reach Europe; Van Helsing and Mina team up to locate the castle of Dracula while the others attempt to ambush the boat Dracula is using to reach his home. Van Helsing raids the castle and destroys the vampire \\"sisters\\". Upon discovering Dracula being transported by Gypsies, the three teams converge and attack the caravan carrying Dracula in the 50th box of Earth. After dispatching many Gypsies who were sworn to protect the Count, Harker shears Dracula through the throat with a kukri knife, while the mortally wounded Quincey stabs the Count in the heart with a Bowie knife. Dracula crumbles to dust, and Mina is freed from her curse of vampirism, as the scar on her forehead disappears. Soon after, Quincey dies from his wounds.\\r\\nThe book closes with a note left by Jonathan Harker seven years after the events of the novel, detailing his married life with Mina and the birth of their son, whom they name after all four members of the party, but address as \\"Quincey\\". Quincey is depicted sitting on the knee of Van Helsing as they recount their adventure. Seward and Arthur have each gotten married.\\r\\nA small section was removed from a draft of the final chapter, in which Dracula's castle falls apart as he dies, hiding the fact that vampires were ever there.[4]\\r\\nAs we looked there came a terrible convulsion of the earth so that we seemed to rock to and fro and fell to our knees. At the same moment with a roar which seemed to shake the very heavens the whole castle and the rock and even the hill on which it stood seemed to rise into the air and scatter in fragments while a mighty cloud of black and yellow smoke volume on volume in rolling grandeur was shot upwards with inconceivable rapidity.\\r\\nThen there was a stillness in nature as the echoes of that thunderous report seemed to come as with the hollow boom of a thunder-clap ÿ the long reverberating roll which seems as though the floors of heaven shook. Then down in a mighty ruin falling whence they rose came the fragments that had been tossed skywards in the cataclysm.\\r\\nBetween 1879 and 1898, Stoker was a business manager for the Lyceum Theatre in London, where he supplemented his income by writing a large number of sensational novels, his most successful being the vampire tale Dracula published on 26 May 1897.[6]:269 Parts of it are set around the town of Whitby, where he spent summer holidays.[7]\\r\\nThroughout the 1880s and 1890s, authors such as H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, and H. G. Wells wrote many tales in which fantastic creatures threatened the British Empire. Invasion literature was at a peak, and Stoker's formula was very familiar by 1897 to readers of fantastic adventure stories, of an invasion of England by continental European influences. Victorian readers enjoyed Dracula as a good adventure story like many others, but it did not reach its legendary status until later in the 20th century when film versions began to appear.[8]\\r\\nBefore writing Dracula, Stoker spent seven years researching European folklore and stories of vampires, being most influenced by Emily Gerard's 1885 essay \\"Transylvania Superstitions\\" which includes content about a vampire myth.[9][10] Some historians are convinced that a historic figure, Vlad III Dracula, often called Vlad the Impaler, was the model for Stoker's Count although there is no supporting evidence.[11] Stoker borrowed only \\"scraps of miscellaneous information\\", according to one expert, about this bloodthirsty tyrant of Wallachia and there are no comments about him in Stoker's working notes.[12] Dracula scholar Elizabeth Miller has remarked that aside from the name and some mention of Romanian history, the background of Stoker's Count bears no resemblance to that of Vlad III Dracula.[13][14][self-published source]\\r\\nLater he also claimed that he had a nightmare, caused by eating too much crab meat, about a \\"vampire king\\" rising from his grave.[15]\\r\\nAlthough a widely known vampire novel, Dracula was not the first. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe published The Bride of Corinth in 1797. (From my grave to wander I am forcd Still to seek The Gods long-severd link, Still to love the bridegroom I have lost, And the life-blood of his heart to drink;)[16] Later Sheridan Le Fanu's 1871 Carmilla,[17] about a lesbian vampire could have inspired Bram Stoker's Dracula, or Varney the Vampire,[18] a lengthy penny dreadful serial from the mid-Victorian period by James Malcolm Rymer. John Polidori created the image of a vampire portrayed as an aristocratic man, like the character of Dracula, in his tale \\"The Vampyre\\" (1819). (He wrote Vampyre during a summer which he spent with Frankenstein creator Mary Shelley, her husband poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Lord Byron in 1816.)\\r\\nThe Lyceum Theatre where Stoker worked between 1878 and 1898 was headed by actor-manager Henry Irving, who was Stoker's real-life inspiration for Dracula's mannerisms and who Stoker hoped would play Dracula in a stage version.[19] Irving never did agree to do a stage version, but Dracula's dramatic sweeping gestures and gentlemanly mannerisms drew their living embodiment from Irving.[19]\\r\\nThe Dead Un-Dead was one of Stoker's original titles for Dracula, and the manuscript was entitled simply The Un-Dead up until a few weeks before publication. Stoker's notes for Dracula show that the name of the count was originally \\"Count Wampyr\\", but Stoker became intrigued by the name \\"Dracula\\" while doing research, after reading William Wilkinson's book An Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia with Political Observations Relative to Them (London 1820),[20] which he found in the Whitby Library and consulted a number of times during visits to Whitby in the 1890s.[21] The name Dracula was the patronym (Dr?culea) of the descendants of Vlad II of Wallachia, who took the name \\"Dracul\\" after being invested in the Order of the Dragon in 1431. In the Old Romanian language, the word dracul (Romanian drac \\"dragon\\" + -ul \\"the\\") meant \\"the dragon\\" and Dracula meant \\"son of the dragon\\". In the present day however, dracul means \\"the devil\\".[22][23][24][self-published source]\\r\\nDracula was published in London in May 1897 by Archibald Constable and Company. Costing six shillings, the novel was bound yellow cloth and titled in red letters.[25] It was copyrighted in the United States in 1899 with the publication by Doubleday & McClure of New York.[26] But when Universal Studios purchased the rights, it came to light that Bram Stoker had not complied with a portion of US copyright law, placing the novel into the public domain.[27] In the United Kingdom and other countries following the Berne Convention on copyrights, the novel was under copyright until April 1962, fifty years after Stoker's death.[28]\\r\\nDracula was not an immediate bestseller when it was first published, although reviewers were unstinting in their praise. The contemporary Daily Mail ranked Stoker's powers above those of Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe, as well as Emily Bront?'s Wuthering Heights.[29]\\r\\nAccording to literary historians Nina Auerbach and David J. Skal in the Norton Critical Edition, the novel has become more significant for modern readers than it was for Victorian readers, most of whom enjoyed it just as a good adventure story. It reached its broad and iconic status only later in the 20th century when the movie versions appeared.[30] A. Asbj?rn J?n has also noted that Dracula has had a significant impact on the image of the vampire in popular culture, folklore, and legend.[31][32]\\r\\nIt did not make much money for Stoker. In the last year of his life, he was so poor that he had to petition for a compassionate grant from the Royal Literary Fund,[33] and his widow was forced to sell his notes and outlines of the novel at a Sotheby's auction in 1913, where they were purchased for a little over S2.[34] But then F. W. Murnau's unauthorized adaptation of the story was released in theatres in 1922 in the form of Nosferatu. Stoker's widow took affront and, during the legal battle that followed, the novel's popularity started to grow.[35]\\r\\nNosferatu was followed by a highly successful stage adaptation, touring the UK for three years before arriving in the US where Stoker's creation caught Hollywood's attention and, after the American 1931 movie version was released, the book has never been out of print.[36]\\r\\nHowever, some Victorian fans were ahead of the time, describing it as \\"the sensation of the season\\" and \\"the most blood-curdling novel of the paralysed century\\".[37] Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote to Stoker in a letter, \\"I write to tell you how very much I have enjoyed reading Dracula. I think it is the very best story of diablerie which I have read for many years.\\"[38] The Daily Mail review of 1 June 1897 proclaimed it a classic of Gothic horror, \\"In seeking a parallel to this weird, powerful, and horrorful story our mind reverts to such tales as The Mysteries of Udolpho, Frankenstein, The Fall of the House of Usher ... but Dracula is even more appalling in its gloomy fascination than any one of these.\\"[39]\\r\\nSimilarly good reviews appeared when the book was published in the U.S. in 1899. The first American edition was published by Doubleday & McClure in New York.[40]\\r\\nIn the last several decades, literary and cultural scholars have offered diverse analyses of Stoker's novel and the character of Count Dracula. C.F. Bentley reads Dracula as an embodiment of the Freudian id.[41] Carol A. Senf reads the novel as a response to the powerful New Woman,[42] while Christopher Craft sees Dracula as embodying latent homosexuality and sees the text as an example of a 'characteristic, if hyperbolic instance of Victorian anxiety over the potential fluidity of gender roles'.[43] Stephen D. Arata interprets the events of the novel as anxiety over colonialism and racial mixing,[44] and Talia Schaffer construes the novel as an indictment of Oscar Wilde.[45] Franco Moretti reads Dracula as a figure of monopoly capitalism,[46] though Hollis Robbins suggests that Dracula's inability to participate in social conventions and to forge business partnerships undermines his power.[47][48] Richard Noll reads Dracula within the context of 19th century alienism (psychiatry) and asylum medicine.[49] D. Bruno Starrs understands the novel to be a pro-Catholic pamphlet promoting proselytization.[50]\\r\\nDracula is a work of fiction, but it does contain some historical references; although it is a matter of conjecture and debate as to how much historical connection was deliberate on Stoker's part.\\r\\nAttention was drawn to the supposed connections between the historical Transylvanian-born Vlad III Dracula (also known as Vlad Tepes) of Wallachia and Bram Stoker's fictional Dracula, following the publication of In Search of Dracula by Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally in 1972.[51]\\r\\nDuring his main reign (1456ÿ1462), \\"Vlad the Impaler\\" is said to have killed from 40,000 to 100,000 European civilians (political rivals, criminals, and anyone that he considered \\"useless to humanity\\"), mainly by impaling. The sources depicting these events are records by Saxon settlers in neighbouring Transylvania who had frequent clashes with Vlad III. Vlad III is revered as a folk hero by Romanians for driving off the invading Ottoman Turks, of whom his impaled victims are said to have included as many as 100,000.[52] There is no solid evidence that the Count in the novel was modelled on Vlad the Impaler of Wallachia.[11] At most, Stoker borrowed only the name Dracula and \\"scraps of miscellaneous information\\" about Romanian history, according to one expert, Elizabeth Miller; as well, and there are no comments about him in the author's working notes. [12][14][53]\\r\\nHistorically, the name \\"Dracula\\" is derived from a Chivalric order called the Order of the Dragon, founded by Sigismund of Luxembourg (then king of Hungary) to uphold Christianity and defend the Empire against the Ottoman Turks. Vlad II Dracul, father of Vlad III, was admitted to the order around 1431, after which Vlad II wore the emblem of the order and later, as ruler of Wallachia, his coinage bore the dragon symbol, from which the name \\"Dracula\\" is derived since \\"dracul\\" in Romanian means \\"the dragon\\".[54] People of Wallachia only knew voievod (king) Vlad III as Vlad ?epe? (the Impaler). The name \\"Dracula\\" became popular in Romania after publication of Stoker's book. Contrary to popular belief, the name Dracula does not translate to \\"son of the devil\\" in Romanian, which would be \\"pui de drac\\".\\r\\nStoker came across the name Dracula in his reading on Romanian history, and chose this to replace the name (Count Wampyr) originally intended for his villain.[55]Some Dracula scholars led by Elizabeth Miller argue that Stoker knew little of the historic Vlad III except for the name \\"Dracula\\" in addition to a few bits of Romanian history.[12][14] Stoker mentions that his Dracula fought against the Turks and was later betrayed by his brother, historical facts in the novel which point to Vlad III:\\r\\nWho was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! (Chapter 3, pp. 19)\\r\\nThe Count's identity is later speculated on by Professor Van Helsing:\\r\\nHe must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land. (Chapter 18, p. 145)\\r\\nMany of Stoker's biographers and literary critics have found strong similarities to the earlier Irish writer Sheridan Le Fanu's classic of the vampire genre Carmilla. In writing Dracula, Stoker may also have drawn on stories about the sdhe,[citation needed] some of which feature blood-drinking women. The Irish legend of Abhartach has also been suggested as a source.[56]\\r\\nIn 1983, McNally additionally suggested that Stoker was influenced by the history of Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory, who allegedly tortured and killed between 36 and 700 young women.[57] It was later a commonly believed rumor that she committed these crimes to bathe in their blood, believing that this preserved her youth.[58]\\r\\nIn her book The Essential Dracula, Clare Haword-Maden suggested that the castle of Count Dracula was inspired by Slains Castle, at which Bram Stoker was a guest of the 19th Earl of Erroll.[59] According to Miller, he first visited Cruden Bay in 1893, three years after work had begun on Dracula. Haining and Tremaine maintain that, during this visit, Stoker was especially impressed by Slains Castle's interior and the surrounding landscape. Miller and Leatherdale question the stringency of this connection.[60]\\r\\nPossibly, Stoker was not inspired by a real edifice at all, but by Jules Verne's novel The Carpathian Castle (1892) or Anne Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794).[61] A third possibility is that he copied information about a castle at Vcs from one of his sources on Transylvania, the book by Major E.C. Johnson.[62] A further option is that Stoker saw an illustration of Castle Bran (T?rzburg) in the book on Transylvania by Charles Boner, or read about it in the books by Mazuchelli or Crosse.[63]\\r\\nMany of the scenes in Whitby and London are based on real places that Stoker frequently visited, although he distorts the geography for the sake of the story in some cases. One scholar has suggested that Stoker chose Whitby as the site of Dracula's first appearance in England because of the Synod of Whitby, given the novel's preoccupation with timekeeping and calendar disputes.[47]\\r\\nDaniel Farson, Leonard Wolf, and Peter Haining have suggested that Stoker received much historical information from rmin Vmbry, a Hungarian professor whom he met at least twice. Miller argues, \\"there is nothing to indicate that the conversation included Vlad, vampires, or even Transylvania\\", and \\"furthermore, there is no record of any other correspondence between Stoker and Vmbry, nor is Vmbry mentioned in Stoker's notes for Dracula.\\"[64]\\r\\nThe short story \\"Dracula's Guest\\" was posthumously published in 1914, two years after Stoker's death. It was, according to most contemporary critics, the deleted first (or second) chapter from the original manuscript[65] and the one which gave the volume its name,[6]:325 but which the original publishers deemed unnecessary to the overall story.\\r\\n\\"Dracula's Guest\\" follows an unnamed Englishman traveller as he wanders around Munich before leaving for Transylvania. It is Walpurgis Night and the young Englishman foolishly leaves his hotel, in spite of the coachman's warnings, and wanders through a dense forest alone. Along the way, he feels that he is being watched by a tall and thin stranger (possibly Count Dracula).\\r\\nThe short story climaxes in an old graveyard where the Englishman, caught in a blizzard, takes refuge in the marble tomb of \\"Countess Dolingen of Gratz\\". Within the tomb, he sees the Countessapparently asleep and healthybut before he can investigate further, a mysterious force throws him clear of the tomb. A lightning bolt then strikes the tomb, destroying it and incinerating the undead screaming countess. The Englishman then loses consciousness. He awakens to find a \\"gigantic\\" wolf lying on his chest and licking at his throat; however, the wolf merely keeps him warm and protects him until help arrives.\\r\\nWhen the Englishman is finally taken back to his hotel, a telegram awaits him from his expectant host Dracula, with a warning about \\"dangers from snow and wolves and night\\".\\r\\nIn 2009, an official sequel was published, written by Bram Stoker's great grand-nephew Dacre Stoker and Ian Holt.\\r\\nDacre Stoker and J. D. Barker will write a prequel to Dracula titled Dracul. An interpretation of the missing 101 pages of the original novel, it was pieced together from Bram Stoker's editorial notes, artifacts, and journals.[66]\\r\\nThe story of Dracula has been the basis for numerous films and plays. Stoker himself wrote the first theatrical adaptation, which was presented at the Lyceum Theatre on 18 May 1897 under the title Dracula, or The Undead shortly before the novel's publication and performed only once, in order to establish his own copyright for such adaptations. This adaption was first published only a century later in October 1997.[67] The first motion picture to feature Dracula was Dracula's Death, produced in Hungary in 1921.[citation needed] The now-lost film, however, was not an adaptation of Stoker's novel, but featured an original story.[citation needed]\\r\\nF. W. Murnau's unauthorised film adaptation Nosferatu was released in 1922, and the popularity of the novel increased considerably, owing to an attempt by Stoker's widow to have the film removed from public circulation.[68] Prana Film, the production company, had been unable to obtain permission to adapt the story from Bram's widow Florence Stoker, so screenwriter Henrik Galeen was told to alter numerous details to avoid legal trouble. Galeen transplanted the action of the story from 1890s England to 1830s Germany and reworked several characters, dropping some (such as Lucy and all three of her suitors), and renaming others (Dracula became Orlok, Jonathan Harker became Thomas Hutter, Mina became Ellen, and so on). This attempt failed to avoid a court case, however; Florence Stoker sued Prana Film, and all copies of the film were ordered to be destroyed. However, the company was bankrupt, and Stoker only recovered her legal fees in damages. Some copies survived and found their way into theatres. Eventually, Florence Stoker gave up the fight against public displays of the film.[27] Subsequent rereleases of the film have typically undone some of the changes, such as restoring the original character names (a practice also followed by Werner Herzog in his 1979 remake of Murnau's film Nosferatu the Vampyre).[citation needed]\\r\\nFlorence Stoker licensed the story to playwright Hamilton Deane, whose 1924 stage play adaptation toured England for several years before settling down in London.[citation needed] In 1927, American stage producer Horace Liveright hired John L. Balderston to revise Deane's script in advance of its American premiere. Balderston significantly compressed the story, most notably consolidating or removing several characters. The Deane play and its Balderston revisions introduced an expanded role and history for Renfield, who now replaced Jonathan Harker as Dracula's solicitor in the first part of the story; combined Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra into a single character (named Lucy); and omitted both Arthur Holmwood and Quincey Morris entirely. When the play premiered in New York, it was with Bela Lugosi in the title role, and with Edward van Sloan as Abraham Van Helsing,[citation needed] roles which both actors (as well as Herbert Bunston as Dr. Seward) reprised for the English-language version of the 1931 Universal Studios film production. The 1931 film was one of the most commercially successful adaptations of the story to date; it and the Deane/Balderston play that preceded it set the standard for film and television adaptations of the story, with the alterations to the novel becoming standard for later adaptations for decades to come.[citation needed] Universal Studios continued to feature the character of Dracula in many of their horror films from the 1930s and 1940s.\\r\\nIn 1958, British film company Hammer Film Productions followed the success of its The Curse of Frankenstein from the previous year with Dracula, released in the US as The Horror of Dracula, directed by Terence Fisher. Fisher's production featured Christopher Lee as Dracula and Peter Cushing as Van Helsing. It was an international hit for Hammer Film, and Lee fixed the image of the fanged vampire in popular culture.[69][70] Both Lee and Cushing reprised their roles multiple times over the next decade and a half, concluding with The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (with Cushing but not Lee) in 1974. Christopher Lee also took on the role of Dracula in Count Dracula, a 1970 Spanish-Italian-German coproduction notable for its adherence to the plot of the original novel. Playing the part of Renfield in that version was Klaus Kinski, who later played Dracula himself in 1979's Nosferatu the Vampyre.\\r\\nIn 1977, the BBC made Count Dracula, a 155-minute adaptation for television starring Louis Jourdan. Later film adaptations include John Badham's 1979 Dracula, starring Frank Langella and inspired by the 1977 Broadway revival of the Deane/Hamilton play, and Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 Bram Stoker's Dracula, starring Gary Oldman. The character of Count Dracula has remained popular over the years, and many films have used the character as a villain, while others have named him in their titles, including Dracula's Daughter and The Brides of Dracula. As of 2009, an estimated 217 films feature Dracula in a major role, a number second only to Sherlock Holmes (223 films). A large number of these appearances are not adaptations of Stoker's novel, but merely feature the character in an unrelated story.","input":"Where does bram stoker's dracula take place?"},{"output":"Nairobi Kenya","context":"Catholic University of Eastern Africa (CUEA) is a multi-campus university in Kenya.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main campus of the university is located in Langata, a southwestern neighborhood of the city of Nairobi, the capital of Kenya and the largest city in that country.

The Institute was founded by the regional ecclesiastical authority known as Association of Member Episcopal Conferences of Eastern Africa (AMECEA). The member countries of AMECEA are: Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.Initially, CHIEA offered two-year Licentiate/MA programmes in Theology, as authorized by the Congregation for Catholic Education, Vatican City (cf. Prot. N. 821/80/34), effective 2 May 1984. On 3 September of the same year, it was officially inaugurated by the Right Reverend Bishop Medardo Mazombwe, the then Chairman of AMECEA. On 18 August 1985, it was formally opened by Pope John Paul II. In 1986, the Graduate School of Theology started negotiations with the Commission for Higher Education in Kenya to establish the Catholic University of Eastern Africa (CUEA).\\r\\nIn 1989, the Institute obtained the \\"Letter of Interim Authority\\" as the first step towards its establishment as a private university. After three years of intensive negotiations between the Authority of the Graduate School of Theology (CHIEA) and the Commission for Higher Education, the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences was established. The climax of the negotiations was a granting of the Civil Charter to CHIEA on 3 November 1992. This marked the birth of the university as a private institution. The Institute rebranded as the Catholic University of Eastern Africa, in 1992.\\r\\nIn 2002, the Faculties of Science and Commerce were established.

Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number. The standard form of the table consists of a grid of elements with rows called periods and columns called groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the periodic table reflects over a century of growth in the understanding of chemical properties. The most important event in its history occurred in 1869, when the table was published by Dmitri Mendeleev,[2] who built upon earlier discoveries by scientists such as Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier and John Newlands, but who is nevertheless generally given sole credit for its development.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of physical elements (such as platinum, mercury, tin and zinc) have been known from antiquity, as they are found in their native form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.[3]  Around 330 BCE, the Greek philosopher Aristotle proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more roots, an idea that had originally been suggested by the Sicilian philosopher Empedocles. The four roots, which were later renamed as elements by Plato, were earth, water, air and fire. Similar ideas about these four elements also existed in other ancient traditions, such as Indian philosophy. While Aristotle and Plato understood the concept of an element, their ideas did nothing to advance the understanding of the nature of matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the periodic table is also a history of the  discovery of the chemical elements. The first person in history to discover a new element was Hennig Brand, a bankrupt German merchant. Brand tried to discover the Philosopher's Stone? a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base metals into gold. In 1669 (or later), his experiments with distilled human urine resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called \\"cold fire\\" (kaltes Feuer).[4] He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when Robert Boyle rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings. The discovery of phosphorus helped to raise the question of what it meant for a substance to be an element.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1661, Boyle defined an element as \\"those primitive and simple Bodies of which the mixt ones are said to be composed, and into which they are ultimately resolved.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nLavoisier's Trait lmentaire de Chimie (Elementary Treatise of Chemistry), which was written in 1789 and first translated into English by the writer Robert Kerr, is considered to be the first modern textbook about chemistry. Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.[6]  This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of subatomic particles. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \\"simple substances\\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, mercury, zinc and sulfur, which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included 'light' and 'caloric', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and non metals. While many leading chemists refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the Elementary Treatise was written well enough to convince the younger generation. However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1815, the English physician and chemist William Prout noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1817, Johann Wolfgang D?bereiner, a chemist, began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements.[8] In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties.  He termed these groups triads.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinition of Triad law:-\\"Chemically analogous elements arranged in increasing order of their atomic weights formed well marked groups of three called Triads in which the atomic weight of the middle element was found to be generally the arithmetic mean of the atomic weight of the other two elements in the triad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexandre-Emile Bguyer de Chancourtois, a French geologist, was the first person to notice the periodicity of the elements? similar elements occurring at regular intervals when they are ordered by their atomic weights.  In 1862 he devised an early form of periodic table, which he named Vis tellurique (the 'telluric helix'), after the element tellurium, which fell near the center of his diagram.[10][11] With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight, de Chancourtois saw that elements with similar properties lined up vertically. His 1863 publication included a chart (which contained ions and compounds,[12] in addition to elements), but his original paper in the Comptes Rendus de l'Acadmie des Sciences used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include a diagram. As a result, de Chancourtois' ideas received little attention until after the work of Dmitri Mendeleev had been publicised.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1864, the English chemist John Newlands classified the sixty-two known elements into eight groups, based on their physical properties.[14][15][16][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nNewlands noted that many pairs of similar elements existed, which differed by some multiple of eight in mass number, and was the first to assign them an atomic number.[1] When his 'law of octaves' was printed in Chemistry News, likening this periodicity of eights to the musical scale, it was ridiculed by some of his contemporaries. His lecture to the Chemistry Society on 1 March 1866 was not published, the Society defending their decision by saying that such 'theoretical' topics might be controversial.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe importance of Newlands' analysis was eventually recognised by the Chemistry Society with a Gold Medal five years after they recognised Mendeleev's work. It was not until the following century, with Gilbert N. Lewis's valence bond theory (1916) and Irving Langmuir's octet theory of chemical bonding (1919), that the importance of the periodicity of eight would be accepted.[18][19][20] The Royal Chemistry Society acknowledged Newlands' contribution to science in 2008, when they put a Blue Plaque on the house where he was born, which described him as the \\"discoverer of the Periodic Law for the chemical elements\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe contributed the word 'periodic' in chemistry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev was the first scientist to make a periodic table similar to the one used today.[citation needed] Mendeleev arranged the elements by atomic mass, corresponding to relative molar mass. It is sometimes said that he played 'chemical solitaire' on long train journeys, using cards with various facts about the known elements.[21]  On March 6, 1869, Mendeleev gave a formal presentation, The Dependence Between the Properties of the Atomic Weights of the Elements, to the Russian Chemical Society. In 1869, the table was published in an obscure Russian journal and then republished in a German journal, Zeitschrift fr Chemie.[22][23]  In it, Mendeleev stated that:\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific benefits of Mendeleev's table\\r\\n\\r\\nUnknown to Mendeleev, a German chemist, Lothar Meyer, was also working on a periodic table.[11] Although his work was published in 1864, and was done independently of Mendeleev, few historians regard him as an equal co-creator of the periodic table. Meyer's table only included twenty-eight elements, which were not classified by atomic weight, but by valence, and he never reached the idea of predicting new elements and correcting atomic weights. A few months after Mendeleev published his periodic table of the known elements, predicted new elements to help complete his table and corrected the atomic weights of some of the elements, Meyer published a virtually identical periodic table.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeyer and Mendeleev are considered by some historians of science to be the co-creators of the periodic table, but Mendeleev's accurate prediction of the qualities of undiscovered elements enables him to have the larger share of the credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1864, the English chemist William Odling also drew up a table that was remarkably similar to the table produced by Mendeleev.[24] Odling overcame the tellurium-iodine problem and even managed to get thallium, lead, mercury and platinum into the right groups, which is something that Mendeleev failed to do at his first attempt.\\r\\nOdling failed to achieve recognition, however, since it is suspected that he, as Secretary of the Chemical Society of London, was instrumental in discrediting Newlands' earlier work on the periodic table.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1912 almost 50 different radioactive elements had been found, too many for the periodic table. Frederick Soddy in 1913 found that although they emitted different radiation, many elements were alike in their chemical characteristics so shared the same place on the table.[26] They became known as isotopes, from the Greek eisos topos (\\"same place\\").[11][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1914, a year before he was killed in action at Gallipoli, the English physicist Henry Moseley found a relationship between the X-ray wavelength of an element and its atomic number.[28]  He was then able to re-sequence the periodic table by nuclear charge, rather than by atomic weight. Before this discovery, atomic numbers were sequential numbers based on an element's atomic weight. Moseley's discovery showed that atomic numbers were in fact based upon experimental measurements.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing information about their X-ray wavelengths, Moseley placed argon (with an atomic number Z=18) before potassium (Z=19), despite the fact that argon's atomic weight of 39.9 is greater than the atomic weight of potassium (39.1). The new order was in agreement with the chemical properties of these elements, since argon is a noble gas and potassium is an alkali metal. Similarly, Moseley placed cobalt before nickel and was able to explain that tellurium occurs before iodine, without revising the experimental atomic weight of tellurium,  as had been proposed by Mendeleev.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoseley's research showed that there were gaps in the periodic table at atomic numbers 43 and 61, which are now known to be occupied by technetium and promethium respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his Manhattan Project research in 1943, Glenn T. Seaborg experienced unexpected difficulties in isolating the elements  americium and curium. Seaborg wondered if these elements belonged to a different series, which would explain why their chemical properties were different from what was expected. In 1945, against the advice of colleagues, he proposed a significant change to Mendeleev's table: the actinide series.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeaborg's actinide concept of heavy element electronic structure, predicting that the actinides form a transition series analogous to the rare earth series of lanthanide elements, is now well accepted and included in the periodic table. The actinide series is the second row of the f-block (5f series). In both the actinide and lanthanide series, an inner electron shell is being filled. The actinide series comprises the elements from actinium to lawrencium. Seaborg's subsequent elaborations of the actinide concept theorized a series of superheavy elements in a transactinide series comprising elements from 104 to 121 and a superactinide series of elements from  122 to 153.","input":"Who made the first periodic table of elements?"},{"output":"The Fast and the Furious","context":"The Fast and the Furious (also known as Fast & Furious) is an American franchise based on a series of action films that is largely concerned with illegal street racing, heists and espionage, and includes material in various other media that depicts characters and situations from the films.

He tracks Dominic's location by triangulating his cell phone signal and they arrive at the hijacking in progress to find Letty, badly injured in a car accident, and Vince critically wounded, having lacerated his arm and been shot by a truck driver. Brian and Mia work together with Dominic, Leon and Letty to rescue Vince. Brian then makes the difficult decision to blow his cover to the crew by phoning in for a medivac. The revelation enrages Dominic, who flees with Leon, Letty, and Mia as the medivac arrives for Vince.\\r\\nBrian soon follows Dominic to his house and holds him at gunpoint to prevent him from fleeing further. Jesse arrives shortly afterwards, apologizing for his actions at Race Wars and pleading for Dominic's help with Johnny Tran (Rick Yune).

Brian agrees but only if he is given permission to choose his partner, refusing to partner with the agent assigned to watch him. Brian heads home to Barstow, California, where he recruits Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), a childhood friend of Brian who had served jail time and is under house arrest, to help him. Pearce agrees, but only for the same deal Brian was offered, and with the help of Monica, Brian and Roman work together to take down Verone. After acquiring confiscated vehicles and being hired by Verone as his drivers, the duo return to a Customs/FBI hideout, where Roman confronts Markham over the latter's interference with the mission. After the situation is cooled down, Brian tells Bilkins and Markham that Verone plans to smuggle the money into his private jet and fly off, but also suspects something wrong with Monica's role in the mission.\\r\\nLater, Brian and Roman race two of Verone's drivers for their cars and begin to devise a personal back up plan if the operation goes awry.

Takashi, Sean, and his father become involved in an armed standoff which is resolved by Neela agreeing to leave with Takashi. Twinkie gives his money to Sean to replace the money Han stole, which Sean then returns to Kamata.\\r\\nSean proposes a race against Takashi to determine who must leave Tokyo. Sean and Han's friends then build a 1967 Ford Mustang, with an inline-6 engine and other parts salvaged from Han's Silvia that Sean had destroyed. Sean wins the race and is later challenged by Dominic Toretto.\\r\\nFast & Furious, as well as its succeeding films, takes place before the events of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift.\\r\\nAbout five years after the events of the first film, Dominic and his new crew (Letty, Han, Leo, Santos and Cara) have been hijacking fuel tankers in the Dominican Republic. When their trail gets too hot, Dominic disbands the crew. However, he is later informed that Letty has been murdered. Dominic returns to Los Angeles where he finds traces of nitro-methane at the crash site, and tracks the buyer of the gas to David Park. Meanwhile, Brian O'Conner, who has been working as an FBI agent, is tracking down a drug trafficker named Arturo Braga. When Brian and Dominic cross paths at David Park's apartment, Dominic is about to drop David out the window. But Brian intervenes, and works a scheme where he enters a street race where the winner would join Braga's team of drivers. Although Dominic wins the four-car race by bumping Brian's car, Brian later joins the team by replacing one of Braga's other drivers.\\r\\nThe team meets Fenix Calderon (Laz Alonso) who directs them to drive the heroin across the border using underground tunnels to avoid detection. Brian realizes that the drivers are to be killed following the mission, and when Fenix reveals to Dominic that he killed Letty, Dominic detonates the nitrous in his car, blowing up a bunch of vehicles. In the chaos, Brian hijacks the Hummer that is carrying the heroin. Dominic and Brian drive back to Los Angeles, hiding the heroin in an impound lot. When Dominic learns Brian was the last person to contact Letty, he attacks him until Brian reveals that Letty was working undercover for Brian, tracking down Braga in exchange for clearing Dominic's name. Brian negotiates with the agency to free Dominic if they can lure Braga into personally coming to exchange the heroin for cash. However, at the drop site, it is revealed that the Braga they arrested was a decoy, and that the real Braga (John Ortiz) has escaped, fleeing to Mexico.\\r\\nSuspended from duty, Brian joins Dominic to go to Mexico and in hopes of catching Braga. Although Braga agreeably surrenders, they are pursued by Braga's men through town and then the tunnels. Fenix T-bones Brian's car right outside the tunnel exit, but before he can kill Brian, Dominic drives into and kills Fenix. As the police arrive, Dominic refuses to escape, saying he is tired of running. Despite Brian's request for clemency, the judge sentences Dominic to 25 years to life. During the prison bus ride to Lompoc penitentiary, Brian and Mia, along with Leo and Santos, arrive in their cars and intercept the bus.\\r\\nWhen Dominic \\"Dom\\" Toretto is being transported to Lompoc Prison by bus, his sister Mia Toretto and friend Brian O'Conner lead an assault on the bus, causing it to crash and freeing Dom. While the authorities search for them, the trio escapes to Rio de Janeiro. Awaiting Dom's arrival, Mia and Brian join their friend Vince and other participants on a job to steal three cars from a train. Brian and Mia discover that agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) are also on the train and that the cars are seized property. When Dom arrives with the rest of the participants, he realizes that the lead participant, Zizi, is only interested in stealing one car - a Ford GT40. Dom has Mia steal the car herself before he and Brian fight Zizi and his henchmen, during which Zizi kills the DEA agents assigned to the vehicles. Dom and Brian are captured and brought to crime lord Hernan Reyes, the owner of the cars and Zizi's boss. Reyes orders the pair be interrogated to discover the location of the car, but they manage to escape and retreat to their safehouse.\\r\\nWhile Brian, Dom, and Mia examine the car to discover its importance, Vince arrives and is caught trying to remove a computer chip from it. He admits he was planning to sell the chip to Reyes on his own, and Dom forces him to leave. Brian investigates the chip and discovers it contains the complete financial details of Reyes' criminal empire, including the locations of US$100?million in cash.\\r\\nDiplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs and his team arrive in Rio to arrest Dom and Brian. With the help of local officer Elena Neves, they travel to Dom's safehouse, but find it under assault by Reyes' men. Brian, Dom and Mia escape; Dom suggests they split up and leave Rio, but Mia announces she is pregnant with Brian's child. Dom agrees to stick together and suggests they steal the money from Reyes to start a new life. They organize a team to perform the heist: Han, Roman, Tej, Gisele, Leo, and Santos. Vince later joins the team after saving Mia from being captured by Reyes' men.\\r\\nHobbs and his team eventually find and arrest Dom, Mia, Brian, and Vince. While transporting them to the airport for extradition to the United States, the convoy is attacked by Reyes' men, who kill Hobbs' team. Hobbs and Elena are saved by Dom, Brian, Mia, and Vince as they fight back and escape, but Vince is shot in the process and dies. Wanting to avenge his murdered team, Hobbs and Elena agree to help with the heist. The gang break into the police station and tear the vault holding Reyes' money from the building using their cars, dragging it through the city. After an extensive police chase, Dom makes Brian continue without him while he attacks the police and the pursuing Reyes, using the vault attached to his car to smash their vehicles. Brian returns and kills Zizi while Reyes is badly injured by Dom's assault. Hobbs arrives on the scene and executes Reyes to avenge his team. Though Hobbs refuses to let Dom and Brian go free, he gives them a 24-hour head start to escape on the condition they leave the vault as it is. However, the vault is empty as it had been switched during the chase. After splitting the cash (Vince's share is given to his family), they go their separate ways.\\r\\nOn a tropical beach, Brian and a visibly pregnant Mia relax. They are met by Dom and Elena. Brian challenges Dom to a final, no-stakes race to prove who is the better driver.\\r\\nIn a mid-credits scene, Hobbs is given a file by Monica Fuentes concerning the hijack of a military convoy in Berlin, where he discovers a recent photo of Dom's former girlfriend Letty, who had been presumed dead.\\r\\nFollowing their successful heist in Brazil, Dominic \\"Dom\\" Toretto and his professional criminal crew have fled around the world: Dom lives with Elena; his sister Mia lives with Brian O'Conner and their son, Jack; Gisele and Han live together; and Roman and Tej live in luxury. Meanwhile, DSS agent Luke Hobbs and Riley Hicks investigate the destruction of a Russian military convoy by a crew led by former British SAS Major and special ops soldier Owen Shaw. Hobbs persuades Dom to help capture Shaw by showing him a photo of the supposedly long-dead Letty Ortiz, Dom's former lover. Dom and his crew accept the mission in exchange for their amnesty, allowing them to return to the United States.\\r\\nIn London, Shaw's hideout is found, but this is revealed to be a trap, distracting them and the police while Shaw's crew performs a heist at an Interpol building. Shaw flees by car, detonating his hideout and disabling most of the police, leaving Dom, Brian, Tej, Han, Gisele, Hobbs, and Riley to pursue him. Letty arrives to help Shaw, shooting Dom without hesitation before escaping. Back at their headquarters, Hobbs tells Dom's crew that Shaw is stealing components to create a deadly device, intending to sell it to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, Shaw's investigation into the opposing crew reveals Letty's relationship with Dom, but she is revealed to be suffering from amnesia. Dominic's crew learns that Shaw is connected to a drug lord who was imprisoned by Brian, Arturo Braga. Brian returns to Los Angeles as a prisoner to question Braga, who says Letty survived the explosion that seemingly killed her; Shaw took her in after discovering her amnesia. With FBI help, Brian is released from prison, regrouping with the team in London.\\r\\nDom challenges Letty in a street racing competition; afterwards, he returns her cross necklace he had kept. After Letty leaves, Shaw offers Dom a chance to walk away, threatening to otherwise hurt his family, but Dom refuses. Tej tracks Shaw's next attack to a Spanish NATO base. Shaw's crew assaults a highway military convoy carrying a computer chip to complete his deadly device. Dom's crew interferes while Shaw, accompanied by Letty, commandeers a tank, destroying cars en route. Brian and Roman manage to flip the tank before it causes further damage, resulting in Letty being thrown from the vehicle and Dom risking his life to save her. Shaw and his crew are captured, but reveal Mia has been kidnapped by Shaw. Hobbs is forced to release Shaw, and Riley, revealed to be Shaw's covert accomplice, leaves with him; Letty chooses to remain with Dom.\\r\\nShaw's group board a large moving aircraft on a runway as Dom's crew gives chase. Dom, Letty, and Brian board the craft; Brian rescues Mia, escaping in an onboard car. The plane attempts to take-off, but is held down by excess weight as the rest of the team tether the plane to their vehicles. Gisele sacrifices herself to save Han from Shaw's henchman; Letty kills Riley and escapes to safety, but Dom pursues Shaw and the computer chip. As the plane crashes into the ground, Shaw is thrown from it, seriously injuring him, and Dom drives a car out of the exploding plane. Dom reunites with his crew, and gives the chip to Hobbs to secure their pardons. Dom and the others return to his old family home in Los Angeles. Hobbs and Elena, now working together, arrive to confirm the crew's freedom; Elena accepts that Dom loves Letty. As Roman says grace over the crew's meal, Dom asks Letty if the gathering feels familiar; she answers \\"no, but it feels like home.\\"\\r\\nIn a mid-credits scene, which takes place in Tokyo, Han is involved in a car chase when he is suddenly broadsided by an oncoming car. The driver walks away from the scene after leaving Letty's cross necklace by the crash, and calls Dom as Han's car fatally explodes, saying, \\"You don't know me. You're about to.\\"\\r\\nAfter defeating Owen Shaw and his crew and securing amnesty for their past crimes,[N 1] Dominic \\"Dom\\" Toretto, Brian O'Conner and the rest of their team have returned to the United States to live normal lives again. Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital that the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom and his team, before breaking into Luke Hobbs' Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a bomb, disguised in a package sent from Tokyo, explodes and destroys the Toretto house just seconds after Han, a member of Dom's team, is killed by Shaw in Tokyo. Dom later visits Hobbs in a hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother. Dom then travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, and meets and races Sean Boswell, a friend of Han's who gives him personal items found at Han's crash site.\\r\\nBack at Han's funeral in Los Angeles, Dom notices a car observing them, and after a chase, confronts its driver, who is revealed to be Shaw. Both prepare to fight, but Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire, led by Mr. Nobody. Nobody says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain God's Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande. Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce, and Tej Parker then airdrop their cars over the Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. The team then heads to Abu Dhabi, where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing God's Eye, and manages to steal it from the owner. With God's Eye near telecommunications repeaters, the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men and forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Nobody is left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.\\r\\nWhile Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a stealth helicopter and an aerial drone, Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye. Hobbs, seeing the team in trouble, leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance. Brian engages Jakande's henchman Kiet and throws him down an elevator shaft, allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on top of a public parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at Jakande's helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, before injuring himself when his car lands and crashes. Hobbs then shoots the bag of grenades from ground level, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead. As Letty cradles Dom's body in her arms, she reveals that she has regained her memories, and that she remembers their wedding. Dom regains consciousness soon after, remarking, \\"It's about time\\".\\r\\nShaw is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret, high-security prison. At a beach, Brian and Mia play with their son while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey observe, acknowledging that Brian is better off retired with his family. Dom silently leaves, Ramsey asks if he's gonna say goodbye. Dom says, \\"It's never goodbye.\\" He drives away, but Brian catches up with him at a crossroad. As Dom remembers the times that he had with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions, as the screen fades to \\"For Paul\\" written on a white title screen.\\r\\nDominic \\"Dom\\" Toretto and Letty Ortiz are on their honeymoon in Havana when Dom's cousin Fernando gets in trouble owing money to local racer Raldo. Sensing Raldo is a loan shark, Dom challenges Raldo to a race, pitting Fernando's reworked car against Raldo's, and wagering his own show car. After narrowly winning the race, Dom allows Raldo to keep his car, earning his respect, and instead leaves his cousin with his show car.\\r\\nThe next day, Dom is approached by the elusive cyberterrorist Cipher who coerces him into working for her. Shortly afterwards, Dom and his team, comprising Letty, Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, and Ramsey, are recruited by Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs to help him retrieve an EMP device from a military outpost in Berlin. During the getaway, Dom goes rogue, forcing Hobbs off the road and stealing the device for Cipher. Hobbs is arrested and locked up in the same high-security prison he helped imprison Deckard Shaw in. After escaping, Deckard and Hobbs are recruited by intelligence operative Mr. Nobody and his protg to help the team find Dom and capture Cipher. Deckard reveals that Cipher had hired his brother Owen Shaw to steal the Nightshade device and Mose Jakande to steal God's Eye, Ramsey's software program. The team tracks Dom and Cipher to their very location just as the latter two attack the base and steal God's Eye. When Dom questions Cipher's motives, she reveals that she has been holding hostage Dom's ex-lover and DSS agent Elena Nevesas well as their son, of whose existence Dom was previously unaware. Elena tells Dom that she wanted him to decide the child's first name, having already given him the middle name Marcos.\\r\\nIn New York City, Cipher sends Dom to retrieve a nuclear football held by the Russian Minister of Defence. Prior to the theft, Dom briefly evades Cipher and persuades Deckard and Owen's mother, Magdalene Shaw, to help him. Cipher hacks into the electronics systems of a large number of cars, causing them to drive automatically and taking out the convoy so that Dom can take the football. The team intercepts Dom, but Dom escapes, shooting and apparently killing Deckard in the process. Letty catches up to Dom, but is ambushed and nearly killed by Cipher's enforcer, Connor Rhodes, before Dom rescues her. In retaliation, Cipher has Rhodes execute Elena in front of Dom.\\r\\nDom infiltrates a base in Russia to use the EMP device to disable their security and then to disable a nuclear submarine, enabling Cipher to hijack it and attempt to use its arsenal to trigger a nuclear war. They are once again intercepted by the team, who attempt to shut down the sub, and then drive out toward the gates that would prevent the sub from leaving into open waters. Meanwhile, Deckard, whose death was apparently faked, teams up with Owen, and under Magdalene's behest, infiltrates Cipher's plane to rescue Dom's son. Once Deckard reports that the child is safe, Dom turns on Cipher and kills Rhodes, avenging Elena's death, before rejoining his team. Outraged, Cipher fires an infrared homing missile at Dom, but he breaks away from his team and maneuvers around it, causing the missile to hit the submarine instead. The team quickly forms a vehicular blockade around Dom, shielding him from the ensuing explosion. When Deckard reaches the front of the plane and confronts a defeated Cipher, she makes her escape by parachuting out of the plane.\\r\\nMr. Nobody and his protg visit Dom and his team in New York City to report that Cipher is still at large in Athens. Hobbs is offered his DSS job back, but he declines in order to spend more time with his daughter. Deckard delivers Dom his son, putting his differences aside with Dom and Hobbs. Dom names his son Brian, after his friend and brother-in-law Brian O'Conner, and they celebrate.\\r\\nIn February 2016, Diesel announced the ninth film and tenth film would be released on April 10, 2020,[3][4] and April 2, 2021, respectively, and that the tenth film would serve as the final film in the series.[5][6] Justin Lin is reportedly in line to direct the ninth installment.[7] It was also announced that Jordana Brewster would return for the ninth installment.\\r\\nIn May 2018, Daniel Casey from Kin, was announced to write a screenplay for the ninth film, making the first film in the franchise without long-time screenwriter Chris Morgan.[8]\\r\\nVin Diesel announced in an interview with Variety that potential spin-offs were in the early stages of development.[9][10] A spin-off film centered around two characters Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw was announced by Universal and set with release date of July 26, 2019,[11] with Variety reporting that Shane Black was being considered to direct and Morgan returning to write the script.[12] The announcement of the spin-off provoked a response on Instagram by Tyrese Gibson, criticizing Johnson for causing the ninth Fast & Furious film to be delayed for another year.[11]\\r\\nOn October 23, 2017, Dwayne Johnson posted a video on Instagram which showed the finished script for the spin-off, titled Hobbs and Shaw.

While the FBI launch a national manhunt for him, Brian travels across Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, winning every street race he participates in, with his red Dodge Stealth. However, he is forced to ditch his car at a motel in San Antonio when police officers are notified of his presence. When they collect the car, he manages to hitch a ride from an unknown woman (Minka Kelly), despite her knowing who he really is. She drops him at a used car lot, with him realizing she knows that he is a wanted man. There, he buys a green Nissan Skyline GT-R R34. Later, collecting money from street races, he modifies the car with new rims and repaints it silver before traveling eastbound and winning more races on the way.

Originally, it ran 363 miles (584?km) from Albany, on the Hudson River, to Buffalo, at Lake Erie. It was built to create a navigable water route from New York City and the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. When completed in 1825, it was the second longest canal in the world (after the Grand Canal in China) and greatly affected the development and economy of New York, New York City, and the United States.[2]\\r\\nFirst proposed in the 1780s, then re-proposed in 1807, a survey was authorized, funded, and executed in 1808. Proponents of the project gradually wore down opponents; its construction began in 1817. The canal has 35 numbered locks, plus the Federal Black Rock Lock,[1] and an elevation differential of about 565 feet (172?m). It opened on October 26, 1825.[3]\\r\\nIn a time when bulk goods were limited to pack animals (a 250 pounds (113?kg) maximum[4]), and there were no railways, water was the most cost-effective way to ship bulk goods.\\r\\nThe canal, denigrated by its political opponents as \\"Clinton's Folly\\"[5] or \\"Clinton's Big Ditch\\",[6][7] was the first transportation system between the eastern seaboard and the western interior of the United States that did not require portage.\\r\\nIt was faster than carts pulled by draft animals and cut transport costs by about 95%.[8] The canal gave New York City's port an incomparable advantage over all other U.S. port cities and ushered in the state's 19th century political and cultural ascendancy.[2] The canal fostered a population surge in western New York and opened regions farther west to settlement. It was enlarged between 1834 and 1862. The canal's peak year was 1855, when 33,000 commercial shipments took place. In 1918, the western part of the canal was enlarged to become part of the New York State Barge Canal, which ran parallel to the eastern half of the Erie Canal, and extended to the Hudson River.\\r\\nIn 2000, the United States Congress designated the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor[9] to recognize the national significance of the canal system as the most successful and influential human-built waterway and one of the most important works of civil engineering and construction in North America.[9] Mainly used by recreational watercraft since the retirement of the last large commercial ship, Day Peckinpaugh, in 1994, the canal saw a recovery in commercial traffic in 2008.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first days of the expansion of the British colonies from the coast of North America into the heartland of the continent, a recurring problem was that of transportation between the coastal ports and the interior. This was not unique to the Americas, and the problem still exists in those parts of the world where muscle power provides a primary means of transportation within a region. An equally ancient solution was implemented in many culturesthings in the water weighed far less and took less effort to move since friction became negligible. Close to the seacoast, rivers often provided adequate waterways, but the Appalachian Mountains, 400 miles (640?km) inland, running over 1,500 miles (2,400?km) long as a barrier range with just five places where mule trains or wagon roads could be routed,[11] presented a great challenge. Passengers and freight had to travel overland, a journey made more difficult by the rough condition of the roads. In 1800, it typically took 2-1/2 weeks to travel overland from New York to Cleveland, Ohio (460 miles (740?km)); 4 weeks to Detroit (612 miles (985?km)).[12]\\r\\nThe principal exportable product of the Ohio Valley was grain, which was a high-volume, low-priced commodity, bolstered by supplies from the coast. Frequently it was not worth the cost of transporting it to far-away population centers. This was a factor leading to farmers in the west turning their grains into whiskey for easier transport and higher sales, and later the Whiskey Rebellion. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, it became clear to coastal residents that the city or state that succeeded in developing a cheap, reliable route to the West would enjoy economic success, and the port at the seaward end of such a route would see business increase greatly.[13] In time, projects were devised in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and relatively deep into the coastal states.\\r\\nThe successes of the Canal du Midi in France (1681), Bridgewater Canal in Britain (1769), and Eiderkanal in Denmark (1784) spurred on what was called in Britain \\"canal mania\\". The idea of a canal to tie the East Coast to the new western settlements was discussed as early as 1724: New York provincial official Cadwallader Colden made a passing reference (in a report on fur trading) to improving the natural waterways of western New York.\\r\\nGouverneur Morris and Elkanah Watson were early proponents of a canal along the Mohawk River. Their efforts led to the creation of the \\"Western and Northern Inland Lock Navigation Companies\\" in 1792, which took the first steps to improve navigation on the Mohawk and construct a canal between the Mohawk and Lake Ontario,[14] but it was soon discovered that private financing was insufficient. Christopher Colles (who was familiar with the Bridgewater Canal) surveyed the Mohawk Valley, and made a presentation to the New York state legislature in 1784, proposing a shorter canal from Lake Ontario. The proposal drew attention and some action but was never implemented.\\r\\nJesse Hawley had envisioned encouraging the growing of large quantities of grain on the western New York plains (then largely unsettled) for sale on the Eastern seaboard. However, he went bankrupt trying to ship grain to the coast. While in Canandaigua debtors' prison, Hawley began pressing for the construction of a canal along the 90-mile (140?km)-long Mohawk River valley with support from Joseph Ellicott (agent for the Holland Land Company in Batavia). Ellicott realized that a canal would add value to the land he was selling in the western part of the state. He later became the first canal commissioner.\\r\\nThe Mohawk River (a tributary of the Hudson) rises near Lake Ontario and runs in a glacial meltwater channel just north of the Catskill range of the Appalachian Mountains, separating them from the geologically distinct Adirondacks to the north. The Mohawk and Hudson valleys form the only cut across the Appalachians north of Alabama, allowing an almost complete water route from New York City in the south to Lake Ontario and Lake Erie in the west. Along its course and from these lakes, other Great Lakes, and to a lesser degree, related rivers, a large part of the continent's interior (and many settlements) would be made well connected to the Eastern seaboard.\\r\\nThe problem was that the land rises about 600 feet (180?m) from the Hudson to Lake Erie. Locks at the time could handle up to 12 feet (3.7?m) of lift, so even with the heftiest cuttings and viaducts, fifty locks would be required along the 360-mile (580?km) canal. Such a canal would be expensive to build even with modern technology; in 1800, the expense was barely imaginable. President Thomas Jefferson called it \\"a little short of madness\\" and rejected it; however, Hawley interested New York Governor DeWitt Clinton in the project. There was much opposition, and the project was ridiculed as \\"Clinton's folly\\" and \\"Clinton's ditch.\\" In 1817, though, Clinton received approval from the legislature for $7?million for construction.[3]\\r\\nThe original canal was 363 miles (584?km) long, from Albany on the Hudson to Buffalo on Lake Erie. The channel was cut 40 feet (12?m) wide and 4 feet (1.2?m) deep, with removed soil piled on the downhill side to form a walkway known as a towpath.[3]\\r\\nIts construction, through limestone and mountains, proved a daunting task. In 1823 construction reached the Niagara Escarpment, necessitating the building of five locks along a 3-mile (4.8?km) corridor to carry the canal over the escarpment. To move earth, animals pulled a \\"slip scraper\\" (similar to a bulldozer). The sides of the canal were lined with stone set in clay, and the bottom was also lined with clay. The stonework required hundreds of German masons, who later built many of New York's buildings. All labor on the canal depended upon human (and animal) power or the force of water. Engineering techniques developed during its construction included the building of aqueducts to redirect water; one aqueduct was 950 feet (290?m) long to span 800 feet (240?m) of river. As the canal progressed, the crews and engineers working on the project developed expertise and became a skilled labor force.\\r\\nCanal boats up to 3.5 feet (1.1?m) in draft were pulled by horses and mules on the towpath. The canal had one towpath, generally on the north side. When canal boats met, the boat with the right of way remained on the towpath side of the canal. The other boat steered toward the berm (or heelpath) side of the canal. The driver (or \\"hoggee\\", pronounced HO-gee) of the privileged boat kept his towpath team by the canalside edge of the towpath, while the hoggee of the other boat moved to the outside of the towpath and stopped his team. His towline would be unhitched from the horses, go slack, fall into the water and sink to the bottom, while his boat decelerated on with its remaining momentum. The privileged boat's team would step over the other boat's towline, with their horses pulling the boat over the sunken towline without stopping. Once clear, the other boat's team would continue on its way.\\r\\nPulled by teams of horses, canal boats still moved slowly, but methodically, shrinking time and distance. Efficiently, the nonstop smooth method of transportation cut the travel time between Albany and Buffalo nearly in half, moving by day and by night. Venturing west, men and women boarded packets to visit relatives, or solely for a relaxing excursion. Emigrants took passage on freight boats, camping on deck, or on top of crates. Packet boats, serving passengers exclusively, reached speeds of up to five miles an hour, and ran at much more frequent intervals than the cramped, bumpy stages.[15]:54\\r\\nPacket boats, measuring up to seventy-eight feet in length and fourteen and a half feet across, made ingenious use of space, in order to accommodate up to forty passengers at night and up to three times as many in the daytime.[15]:59 The best examples, furnished with carpeted floors, stuffed chairs, and mahogany tables stocked with current newspapers and books, served as sitting rooms during the days. At mealtimes, crews transformed the cabin into dining rooms. Drawing a curtain across the width of the room divided the cabin into ladies' and gentlemen's sleeping quarters in the evening hours. Pull-down tiered beds folded from the walls, and additional cots could be hung from hooks in the ceiling. Some captains hired musicians and held dances.[15]:59 The canal had brought civilization into the wilderness.\\r\\nThe men who planned and oversaw construction were novices as surveyors and as engineers. There were no civil engineers in the United States.[16] James Geddes and Benjamin Wright, who laid out the route, were judges whose experience in surveying was in settling boundary disputes. Geddes had only used a surveying instrument for a few hours before his work on the Canal.[16] Canvass White was a 27-year-old amateur engineer who persuaded Clinton to let him go to Britain at his own expense to study the canal system there. Nathan Roberts was a mathematics teacher and land speculator. Yet these men \\"carried the Erie Canal up the Niagara escarpment at Lockport, maneuvered it onto a towering embankment to cross over Irondequoit Creek, spanned the Genesee River on an awesome aqueduct, and carved a route for it out of the solid rock between Little Falls and Schenectadyand all of those venturesome designs worked precisely as planned\\". (Bernstein, p.?381)\\r\\nConstruction began July 4, 1817, at Rome, New York. The first 15 miles (24?km), from Rome to Utica, opened in 1819. At that rate, the canal would not be finished for 30 years. The main delays were caused by felling trees to clear a path through virgin forest and moving excavated soil, which took longer than expected, but the builders devised ways to solve these problems. To fell a tree, they threw rope over the top branches and winched it down. They pulled out the stumps with an innovative stump puller. A pair of huge wheels were mounted loose on an axle. A large wheel, barely smaller than the others, was fixed to the center of the axle. A chain was wrapped around the axle and hooked to the stump. A rope was wrapped around the center wheel and hooked to a team of oxen. The mechanical advantage (torque) obtained ripped the stumps out of the soil. Soil to be moved was shoveled into large wheelbarrows that were dumped into mule-pulled carts. Using a scraper and a plow, a three-man team with oxen, horses, and mules could build a mile in a year.[17]\\r\\nThe remaining problem was finding labor; increased immigration helped fill the need. Many of the laborers working on the canal were Irish, who had recently come to the United States as a group of about 5,000 from Ireland, most of whom were Roman Catholic, a religion that raised much suspicion in early America due to its hierarchic structure, and many laborers on the canal suffered violent assault as the result of misjudgment and xenophobia.[15]:52\\r\\nConstruction continued at an increased rate as new workers arrived. When the canal reached Montezuma Marsh (at the outlet of Cayuga Lake west of Syracuse), it was rumored over 1,000 workers died of \\"swamp fever\\" (malaria), and construction was temporarily stopped.[18] However, recent research has revealed the death toll was likely much lower, as no contemporary reports mention significant worker mortality, and mass graves from the period have never been found in the area.[19] Work continued on the downhill side towards the Hudson, and when the marsh froze in winter, the crews worked to complete the section across the swamps.\\r\\nThe middle section from Utica to Salina (Syracuse) was completed in 1820, and traffic on that section started up immediately. Expansion to the east and west proceeded, and the whole eastern section, 250 miles (400?km) from Brockport to Albany, opened on September 10, 1823 to great fanfare.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Champlain Canal, a separate but interconnected 64-mile (103?km) north-south route from Watervliet on the Hudson to Lake Champlain, opened on the same date.\\r\\nIn 1824, before the canal was completed, a detailed Pocket Guide for the Tourist and Traveler, Along the Line of the Canals, and the Interior Commerce of the State of New York, was published for the benefit of travelers and land speculators.\\r\\nAfter Montezuma Marsh, the next difficulties were crossing Irondequoit Creek and the Genesee River near Rochester. The first ultimately required building the 1,320-foot (400?m) long \\"Great Embankment,\\" which carried the canal at a height of 76 feet (23?m) above the level of the creek, which was carried through a 245-foot (75?m) culvert underneath.[20] The river was crossed on a stone aqueduct 802 feet (244?m) long and 17 feet (5.2?m) wide, with 11 arches.[21]\\r\\nAfter the Genesee, the next obstacle was crossing the Niagara Escarpment, an 80-foot (24?m) wall of hard dolomitic limestone, to rise to the level of Lake Erie. The route followed the channel of a creek that had cut a ravine steeply down the escarpment, with two sets of five locks in a series, soon giving rise to the community of Lockport. The 12-foot (3.7?m) lift-locks had a total lift of 60 feet (18?m), exiting into a deeply cut channel. The final leg had to be cut 30 feet (9.1?m) through another limestone layer, the Onondaga ridge. Much of that section was blasted with black powder, and the inexperience of the crews often led to accidents, and sometimes rocks falling on nearby homes.[citation needed]\\r\\nTwo villages competed to be the terminus: Black Rock, on the Niagara River, and Buffalo, at the eastern tip of Lake Erie. Buffalo expended great energy to widen and deepen Buffalo Creek to make it navigable and to create a harbor at its mouth. Buffalo won over Black Rock, and grew into a large city, eventually encompassing its former competitor.\\r\\nThe entire canal was officially completed on October 26, 1825. The event was marked by a statewide \\"Grand Celebration,\\" culminating in successive cannon shots along the length of the canal and the Hudson, a 90-minute cannonade from Buffalo to New York City. A flotilla of boats, led by Governor Dewitt Clinton aboard Seneca Chief, sailed from Buffalo to New York City in ten days. Clinton then ceremonially poured Lake Erie water into New York Harbor to mark the \\"Wedding of the Waters\\". On its return trip, Seneca Chief brought a keg of Atlantic Ocean water back to Buffalo to be poured into Lake Erie by Buffalo's Judge Samuel Wilkeson, who would later become mayor.\\r\\nThe Erie Canal was thus completed in eight years at a cost of $7,143,000[22] (equivalent to $109,000,000 in 2017).[23] It was acclaimed as an engineering marvel that united the country and helped New York City become a financial capital.[3]\\r\\nThe canal began on the west side of the Hudson River at Albany, and ran north to Watervliet, where the Champlain Canal branched off. At Cohoes, it climbed the escarpment on the west side of the Hudson River and then turned west along the south shore of the Mohawk River, crossing to the north side at Crescent and again to the south at Rexford. The canal continued west near the south shore of the Mohawk River all the way to Rome, where the Mohawk turns north.[3]\\r\\nAt Rome, the canal continued west parallel to Wood Creek, which flows westward into Oneida Lake, and turned southwest and west cross-country to avoid the lake. From Canastota west, it ran roughly along the north (lower) edge of the Onondaga Escarpment, passing through Syracuse, Onondaga Lake, and Rochester. Before reaching Rochester, the canal uses a series of natural ridges to cross the deep valley of Irondequoit Creek. At Lockport the canal turned southwest to rise to the top of the Niagara Escarpment, using the ravine of Eighteen Mile Creek.[3]\\r\\nThe canal continued south-southwest to Pendleton, where it turned west and southwest, mainly using the channel of Tonawanda Creek. From the Tonawanda south toward Buffalo, it ran just east of the Niagara River, where it reached its \\"Western Terminus\\" at Little Buffalo Creek (later it became the Commercial Slip), which discharged into the Buffalo River just above its confluence with Lake Erie.[3] With Buffalo's re-excavation of the Commercial Slip, completed in 2008, the Canal's original terminus is now re-watered and again accessible by boats. With several miles of the Canal inland of this location still lying under 20th-century fill and urban construction, the effective western navigable terminus of the Erie Canal is found at Tonawanda.\\r\\nThe Erie made use of the favorable conditions of New York's unique topography, which provided that area with the only break in the Appalachians south of the Saint Lawrence River. The Hudson is tidal to Troy, and Albany is west of the Appalachians. It allowed for eastÿwest navigation from the coast to the Great Lakes within US?territory.[24] The canal system thus gave New York a competitive advantage, helped New York City develop as an international trade center, and allowed Buffalo to grow from just 200?settlers in 1820 to more than 18,000 people by 1840. The port of New York became essentially the Atlantic home port for all of the Midwestbecause of this vital connection and others to follow, such as the railroads, New York would become known as the \\"Empire State\\" or \\"the great Empire State\\".[3]\\r\\nProblems developed but were quickly solved. Leaks developed along the entire length of the canal, but these were sealed using cement that hardened underwater (hydraulic cement). Erosion on the clay bottom proved to be a problem and the speed was limited to 4?mph (6.4?km/h).\\r\\nThe original design planned for an annual tonnage of 1.5?million tons (1.36 million metric tons), but this was exceeded immediately. An ambitious program to improve the canal began in 1834. During this massive series of construction projects, known as the First Enlargement, the canal was widened from 40 to 70 feet (12 to 21?m) and deepened from 4 to 7 feet (1.2 to 2.1?m). Locks were widened and/or rebuilt in new locations, and many new navigable aqueducts were constructed. The canal was straightened and slightly re-routed in some stretches, resulting in the abandonment of short segments of the original 1825 canal. The First Enlargement was completed in 1862, with further minor enlargements in later decades.\\r\\nToday, the reconfiguration of the canal created during the First Enlargement is commonly referred to as the \\"Improved Erie Canal\\" or the \\"Old Erie Canal\\", to distinguish it from the canal's modern-day course. Existing remains of the 1825 canal abandoned during the Enlargement are sometimes referred to today as \\"Clinton's Ditch\\" (which was also the popular nickname for the entire Erie Canal project during its original 1817ÿ1825 construction).\\r\\nAdditional feeder canals soon extended the Erie Canal into a system. These included the Cayuga-Seneca Canal south to the Finger Lakes, the Oswego Canal from Three Rivers north to Lake Ontario at Oswego, and the Champlain Canal from Troy north to Lake Champlain. From 1833 to 1877, the short Crooked Lake Canal connected Keuka Lake and Seneca Lake. The Chemung Canal connected the south end of Seneca Lake to Elmira in 1833, and was an important route for Pennsylvania coal and timber into the canal system. The Chenango Canal in 1836 connected the Erie Canal at Utica to Binghamton and caused a business boom in the Chenango River valley. The Chenango and Chemung canals linked the Erie with the Susquehanna River system. The Black River Canal connected the Black River to the Erie Canal at Rome and remained in operation until the 1920s. The Genesee Valley Canal was run along the Genesee River to connect with the Allegheny River at Olean, but the Allegheny section, which would have connected to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, was never built. The Genesee Valley Canal was later abandoned and became the route of the Genesee Valley Canal Railroad.\\r\\nIn 1903 the New York State legislature authorized construction of the New York State Barge Canal as the \\"Improvement of the Erie, the Oswego, the Champlain, and the Cayuga and Seneca Canals\\".[25]:14 In 1905, construction of the Barge Canal began, which was completed in 1918, at a cost of $96.7 million.[25]:557 Freight traffic reached a total of 5.2 million short tons (4.7 million metric tons) by 1951, before declining in the face of combined rail and truck competition.\\r\\nAs the canal brought travelers to New York City, it took business away from other ports such as Philadelphia and Baltimore. Those cities and their states started projects to compete with the Erie Canal. In Pennsylvania, the Main Line of Public Works was a combined canal and railroad running west from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh on the Ohio River, opened in 1834. In Maryland, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ran west to Wheeling, West Virginia, also on the Ohio River, and was completed in 1853.\\r\\nOther competition was more direct. The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad opened in 1837, providing a bypass to the slowest part of the canal between Albany and Schenectady. Other railroads were soon chartered and built to continue the line west to Buffalo, and in 1842 a continuous line (which later became the New York Central Railroad and its Auburn Road in 1853) was open the whole way to Buffalo. As the railroad served the same general route as the canal, but provided for faster travel, passengers soon switched to it. However, as late as 1852, the canal carried thirteen times more freight tonnage than all the railroads in New York State combined; it continued to compete well with the railroads through 1902, when tolls were abolished.\\r\\nThe New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway was completed in 1884, as a route running closely parallel to both the canal and the New York Central Railroad. However, it went bankrupt and was acquired the next year by the New York Central.\\r\\nThe Erie Canal greatly lowered the cost of shipping between the Midwest and the Northeast, bringing much lower food costs to Eastern cities and allowing the East to economically ship machinery and manufactured goods to the Midwest. The canal also made an immense contribution to the wealth and importance of New York City, Buffalo, and New York State. Its impact went much further, increasing trade throughout the nation by opening eastern and overseas markets to Midwestern farm products and by enabling migration to the West.[26][27]\\r\\nThe Erie Canal was an immediate success. Tolls collected on freight had already exceeded the state's construction debt in its first year of official operation.[15]:52 By 1828, import duties collected at the New York Customs House supported federal government operations and provided funds for all the expenses in Washington except the interest on the national debt.[28] Additionally, New York state's initial loan for the original canal had been paid by 1837.[15]:52 Although it had been envisioned as primarily a commercial channel for freight boats, passengers also traveled on the canal's packet boats. In 1825 more than forty thousand passengers took advantage of the convenience and beauty of canal travel.[15]:52 The canal's steady flow of tourists, businessmen and settlers lent it to uses never imagined by its initial sponsors. Evangelical preachers made their circuits of the upstate region and the canal served as the last leg of the underground railroad ferrying runaway slaves to Buffalo near the CanadaÿUS border.[15]:53 Aspiring merchants found that tourists proved to double as reliable customers. Vendors moved from boat to boat peddling items such as books, watches and fruit while less scrupulous \\"confidence men\\" sold remedies for foot corns or passed off counterfeit bills.[15]:53 Tourists were carried along the \\"northern tour\\", which ultimately led to the popular honeymoon destination Niagara Falls, just north of Buffalo.\\r\\nConsisting of a massive stone aqueduct which carried boats over incredible cascades, Little Falls was one of the most popular stops for American and foreign touristsas depicted in Scene 4 of William Dunlap's play A Trip to Niagara, where he depicts the general preference of tourists to travel by canal so that they could see a combination of artificial and natural sites.[15]:55 Canal travel was, for many, an opportunity to take in the sublime and commune with nature. The play also reflects the less enthusiastic view of some seeing movement on the canal as tedious.\\r\\nNew ethnic Irish communities formed in some towns along its route after completion, as Irish immigrants were a large portion of the construction labor force. Earth extracted from the canal was transported to the New York city area and used as landfill in New York and New Jersey.[citation needed] A plaque honoring the canal's construction is located in Battery Park in southern Manhattan.\\r\\nBecause so many immigrants traveled on the canal, many genealogists have sought copies of canal passenger lists. Apart from the years 1827ÿ1829, canal boat operators were not required to record or report passenger names to the government, which, in this case, was the state of New York. Those passenger lists that were recorded survive today in the New York State Archives, and other sources of traveler information are sometimes available.\\r\\nThe Canal also helped bind the still-new nation closer to Britain and Europe. British repeal of the Corn Law resulted in a huge increase in exports of Midwestern wheat to Britain. Trade between the United States and Canada also increased as a result of the Corn Law and a reciprocity (free-trade) agreement signed in 1854; much of this trade flowed along the Erie.\\r\\nIts success also prompted imitation: a rash of canal-building followed. Also, the many technical hurdles that had to be overcome made heroes of those whose innovations made the canal possible. This led to an increased public esteem for practical education. Chicago, among other Great Lakes cities, recognized the commercial importance of the canal to its economy, and two West Loop streets are named \\"Canal\\" and \\"Clinton\\" (for canal proponent DeWitt Clinton).\\r\\nConcern that erosion caused by logging in the Adirondacks could silt up the canal contributed to the creation of another New York National Historic Landmark, the Adirondack Park, in 1885.\\r\\nMany notable authors wrote about the canal, including Herman Melville, Frances Trollope, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Mark Twain, Samuel Hopkins Adams and the Marquis de?Lafayette, and many tales and songs were written about life on the canal. The popular song \\"Low Bridge\\" by Thomas S. Allen was written in 1905 to memorialize the canal's early heyday, when barges were pulled by mules rather than engines.\\r\\nThe New York State Legislature debated closing the locks of the Erie Canal on Sundays, when they convened in 1858. However, George Jeremiah and Dwight Bacheller, two of the bill's opponents, argued that the state had no right to stop canal traffic on the grounds that the Erie Canal and its tributaries had ceased to be wards of the state. The canal at its inception had been imagined as an extension of nature, an artificial river where there had been none. The canal succeeded by sharing more in common with lakes and seas than it had with public roads. Jeremiah and Bacheller argued, successfully, that just as it was unthinkable to halt oceangoing navigation on Sunday, it was so with the canal.[15]:172\\r\\nIn 1918, the Canal was replaced by the larger New York State Barge Canal. This new canal replaced much of the original route, leaving many abandoned sections (most notably between Syracuse and Rome). New digging and flood control technologies allowed engineers to canalize rivers that the original canal had sought to avoid, such as the Mohawk, Seneca, and Clyde rivers, and Oneida Lake. In sections that did not consist of canalized rivers (particularly between Rochester and Buffalo), the original Erie Canal channel was enlarged to 120 feet (37?m) wide and 12 feet (3.7?m) deep. The expansion allowed barges up to 2,000 short tons (1,800?t) to use the Canal. This expensive project was politically unpopular in parts of the state not served by the canal, and failed to save it from becoming obsolete for commercial shipping.\\r\\nThe new alignment began on the Hudson River at the border between Cohoes and Waterford, where it ran northwest with five locks (the so-called \\"Waterford Flight\\"), running into the Mohawk River east of Crescent. The Waterford Flight is claimed to be one of the steepest series of locks in the world.[29][3]:19[30]:267\\r\\nWhile the old Canal ran next to the Mohawk all the way to Rome, the new canal ran through the river, which was straightened or widened where necessary.[3]:13 At Ilion, the new canal left the river for good, but continued to run on a new alignment parallel to both the river and the old canal to Rome. From Rome, the new route continued almost due west, merging with Fish Creek just east of its entry into Oneida Lake.\\r\\nFrom Oneida Lake, the new canal ran west along the Oneida River, with cutoffs to shorten the route. At Three Rivers the Oneida River turns northwest, and was deepened for the Oswego Canal to Lake Ontario. The new Erie Canal turned south there along the Seneca River, which turns west near Syracuse and continues west to a point in the Montezuma Marsh (430011N 764352W? / ?43.00296N 76.73115W? / 43.00296; -76.73115). There the Cayuga and Seneca Canal continued south with the Seneca River, and the new Erie Canal again ran parallel to the old canal along the bottom of the Niagara Escarpment, in some places running along the Clyde River, and in some places replacing the old canal. At Pittsford, southeast of Rochester, the canal turned west to run around the south side of Rochester, rather than through downtown. The canal crosses the Genesee River at the Genesee Valley Park (430717N 773833W? / ?43.1215N 77.6425W? / 43.1215; -77.6425), then rejoins the old path near North Gates.\\r\\nFrom there it was again roughly an upgrade to the original canal, running west to Lockport. This reach of 64.2?miles from Henrietta to Lockport is called \\"the 60?mile level\\" since there are no locks and the water level rises only two feet over the entire segment. Diversions from and to adjacent natural streams along the way are used to maintain the canal's level. It runs southwest to Tonawanda, where the new alignment discharges into the Niagara River, which is navigable upstream to the New York Barge Canal's Black Rock Lock and thence to the Canal's original \\"Western Terminus\\" at Buffalo's Inner Harbor.\\r\\nThe growth of railroads and highways across the state, and the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, caused commercial traffic on the canal to decline dramatically during the second half of the 20th century.\\r\\nIn 1992, the New York State Barge Canal was renamed the New York State Canal System (including the Erie, Cayuga-Seneca, Oswego, and Champlain canals) and placed under the newly created New York State Canal Corporation, a subsidiary of the New York State Thruway Authority. The canal system is operated using money generated by Thruway tolls.\\r\\nSince the 1990s, the canal system has been used primarily by recreational traffic, although a small but growing amount of cargo traffic still uses it.\\r\\nToday, the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor covers 524 miles (843?km) of navigable water from Lake Champlain to the Capital Region and west to Buffalo. The area has a population of 2.7?million: about 75% of Central and Western New York's population lives within 25 miles (40?km) of the Erie Canal.\\r\\nThe Erie Canal is open to small craft and some larger vessels from May through November each year. During winter, water is drained from parts of the canal for maintenance. The Champlain Canal, Lake Champlain, and the Chambly Canal, and Richelieu River in Canada form the Lakes to Locks Passage, making a tourist attraction of the former waterway linking eastern Canada to the Erie Canal. In 2006 recreational boating fees were eliminated to attract more visitors.\\r\\nTravel on the canal's middle section (particularly in the Mohawk Valley) was severely hampered by flooding in late June and early July 2006. Flood damage to the canal and its facilities was estimated as at least $15 million.\\r\\nThere were some 42 commercial shipments on the canal in 2008, compared to 15 such shipments in 2007 and more than 33,000 shipments in 1855, the canal's peak year. The new growth in commercial traffic is due to the rising cost of diesel fuel. Canal barges can carry a short ton of cargo 514 miles (827?km) on one gallon of diesel fuel, while a gallon allows a train to haul the same amount of cargo 202 miles (325?km) and a truck 59 miles (95?km). Canal barges can carry loads up to 3,000 short tons (2,700 long tons), and are used to transport objects that would be too large for road or rail shipment.[10] Today, the system is served by several commercial towing companies.[31] In 2012, the New York State Canal System (which consists of the Erie Canal and a few smaller canals) was used to ship 42,000 tons of cargo.[32]\\r\\nAside from transportation, the canal's waters are still utilized for other purposes such as irrigation for farmland, hydroelectricity, research, industry, and even drinking by numerous businesses, farms, factories and communities alongside its banks. Users of the canal system have an estimated total economic impact of $6.2 billion annually.[32]\\r\\nSections of the old Erie Canal not used after 1918 are owned by New York State, or have been ceded to or purchased by counties or municipalities. Many stretches of the old canal have been filled in to create roads such as Erie Boulevard in Syracuse and Schenectady, and Broad Street and the Rochester Subway in Rochester. A 36?mile (58?km) stretch of the old canal from the town of DeWitt, New York, east of Syracuse, to just outside Rome, New York, is preserved as the Old Erie Canal State Historic Park. In 1960 the Schoharie Crossing State Historic Site, a section of the canal in Montgomery County, was one of the first sites recognized as a National Historic Landmark.[33]\\r\\nSome municipalities have preserved sections as town or county canal parks, or have plans to do so. Camillus Erie Canal Park preserves a 7-mile (11?km) stretch and has restored Nine Mile Creek Aqueduct, built in 1841 as part of the First Enlargement of the canal.[34] In some communities, the old canal has refilled with overgrowth and debris. Proposals have been made to rehydrate the old canal through downtown Rochester or Syracuse as a tourist attraction. In Syracuse, the location of the old canal is represented by a reflecting pool in downtown's Clinton Square and the downtown hosts a canal barge and weigh lock structure, now dry.[citation needed] Buffalo's Commercial Slip is the restored and re-watered segment of the canal which formed its \\"Western Terminus\\".\\r\\nThe Erie Canal is a destination for tourists from all over the world, and has inspired guidebooks dedicated to exploration of the waterway.[30][35] An Erie Canal Cruise company, based in Herkimer, operates from mid-May until mid-October with daily cruises. The cruise goes through the history of the canal and also takes passengers through Lock 18.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2004, the administration of New York Governor George Pataki was criticized when officials of New York State Canal Corporation attempted to sell private development rights to large stretches of the Old Erie Canal to a single developer for $30,000, far less than the land was worth on the open market. After an investigation by the Syracuse Post-Standard newspaper, the Pataki administration nullified the deal.[citation needed]\\r\\nRecords of the planning, design, construction, and administration of the Erie Canal are vast and can be found in the New York State Archives. Except for two years (1827ÿ1829), the State of New York did not require canal boat operators to maintain or submit passenger lists.[36]\\r\\nParks and museums related to the old Erie Canal include (listed from East to West):\\r\\nThe following list of locks is provided for the current canal, from east to west. There are a total of 36 (35 numbered) locks on the Erie Canal.\\r\\nAll locks on the New York State Canal System are single-chamber; the dimensions are 328 feet (100?m) long and 45 feet (14?m) wide with a minimum 12-foot (3.7?m) depth of water over the miter sills at the upstream gates upon lift. They can accommodate a vessel up to 300 feet (91?m) long and 43.5 feet (13.3?m) wide.[38][39][40] Overall sidewall height will vary by lock, ranging between 28 and 61 feet (8.5 and 18.6?m) depending on the lift and navigable stages.

CFPB jurisdiction includes banks, credit unions, securities firms, payday lenders, mortgage-servicing operations, foreclosure relief services, debt collectors and other financial companies operating in the United States.\\r\\nThe CFPB's creation was authorized by the DoddÿFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, whose passage in 2010 was a legislative response to the financial crisis of 2007ÿ08 and the subsequent Great Recession.[2]\\r\\nThe CFPB was established as an independent agency, but this status is being reviewed by the US Court of Appeals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Director Richard Cordray, the Bureau's priorities are mortgages, credit cards and student loans.[2][3] It was designed to consolidate employees and responsibilities from a number of other federal regulatory bodies, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration and even the Department of Housing and Urban Development.[4] The bureau is an independent unit located inside and funded by the United States Federal Reserve, with interim affiliation with the U.S. Treasury Department. It writes and enforces rules for financial institutions, examines both bank and non-bank financial institutions, monitors and reports on markets, as well as collects and tracks consumer complaints.[3] Furthermore, as required under DoddÿFrank and outlined in the 2013 CFPBÿState Supervisory Coordination Framework, the CFPB works closely with state regulators in coordinating supervision and enforcement activities.[5]\\r\\nThe CFPB opened its website in early February 2011 to accept suggestions from consumers via YouTube, Twitter, and its own website interface. According to the United States Treasury Department, the bureau is tasked with the responsibility to \\"promote fairness and transparency for mortgages, credit cards, and other consumer financial products and services\\".[6] According to its web site, the CFPB's \\"central mission...is to make markets for consumer financial products and services work for Americanswhether they are applying for a mortgage, choosing among credit cards, or using any number of other consumer financial products\\".[7] In 2016 alone most of the hundreds of thousands of consumer complaints about their financial servicesincluding banks and credit card issuerswere received and compiled by CFPB and are publicly available on a federal government database.[8] The Trump administration wants more control over the CFPB and is considering prohibiting the publication of consumer complaints.[8] Since the CFPB database was established in 2011, more than 730,000 complaints have been published.[8] CFPB supporters include the Consumers Union claim that it is a \\"vital tool that can help consumers make informed decisions\\".[8] CFPB detractors argue that the CFPB database in a \\"gotcha game\\" and that there is already a database maintained by the Federal Trade Commission although that information is not available to the public.[8]\\r\\nIn July 2010, Congress passed the DoddÿFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, during the 111th United States Congress in response to the Late-2000s recession and financial crisis.[2] The agency was originally proposed in 2007 by Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren.[9] The proposed CFPB was actively supported by Americans for Financial Reform, a newly created umbrella organization of some 250 consumer, labor, civil rights and other activist organizations.[10] On September 17, 2010, Obama announced the appointment of Warren as Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to set up the new agency.[11][12] The CFPB formally began operation on July 21, 2011, shortly after Obama announced that Warren would be passed over as Director in favor of Richard Cordray,[13] who prior to the nomination had been hired as chief of enforcement for the agency.[14]\\r\\nThe Financial CHOICE Act, proposed by House Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling to repeal the DoddÿFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed the House on June 8, 2017. In June 2017, the Senate was crafting its own reform bill.[15][16]\\r\\nElizabeth Warren, who proposed and established the CFPB, was removed from consideration as the bureau's first formal director after Obama administration officials became convinced Warren \\"could not overcome strong Republican opposition\\".[17] On July 17, President Obama nominated former Ohio Attorney General and Ohio State Treasurer Richard Cordray to be the first formal director of the CFPB.[18] However, his nomination was immediately in jeopardy due to 44 Senate Republicans vowing to derail any nominee in order to encourage a decentralized structure of the organization. Senate Republicans had also shown a pattern of refusing to consider regulatory agency nominees, purportedly as a method of budget cutting.[19] Due to the way the legislation creating the bureau was written, until the first Director was in place, the agency was not able to write new rules or supervise financial institutions other than banks.[4]\\r\\nOn July 21, Senator Richard Shelby wrote an op?ed for the Wall Street Journal affirming his continued opposition to a centralized structure, noting that both the Securities Exchange Commission and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had executive boards and that the CFPB should be no different. He noted lessons learned from experiences with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as support for his argument.[20] Politico interpreted Shelby's statements as saying that Cordray's nomination was \\"dead on arrival\\".[21] Republican threats of a filibuster to block the nomination in December 2011 led to Senate inaction.\\r\\nOn January 4, 2012, Barack Obama issued a recess appointment to install Cordray as director through the end of 2013. This was a highly controversial move as the Senate was still holding pro forma sessions, and the possibility existed that the appointment could be challenged in court.[22]\\r\\nThe constitutionality of Cordray's recess appointment came into question after a January 2013 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that President Obama's appointment of three members to the NLRB (at the same time as Cordray) violated the Constitution.[23]\\r\\nOn July 16, 2013, the Senate confirmed Cordray as director in a 66ÿ34 vote.[24]\\r\\nOn July 11, 2013, the CFPB Rural Designation Petition and Correction Act (H.R. 2672; 113th Congress) was introduced into the House of Representatives. The bill would amend the DoddÿFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to direct the CFPB to establish an application process that would allow a person to have their county designated as \\"rural\\" for purposes of federal consumer financial law.[25] One practical effect of having a county designated rural is that people can qualify for some types of mortgages by getting them exempted from the CFPB's qualified mortgage rule.[26][27]\\r\\nOn September 26, 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Safety and Soundness Improvement Act of 2013 (H.R. 3193; 113th Congress) was introduced into the United States House of Representatives.[28] If adopted, the bill would have modified the CFPB by transforming it into a five-person commission and removing it from the Federal Reserve System.[29] The CFPB would have been renamed the \\"Financial Product Safety Commission\\". The bill was also intended to make it easier to override the CFPB decisions. It passed in the House of Representatives on February 27, 2014 and was received by the Senate on March 4.[30] It was never considered in the Democratic controlled Senate.[31]\\r\\nRegulatory implementation regarding mortgages is covered on the bureau website. Topics provided for consumers include, 2013 mortgage rule implementation, resources to help people comply, quick reference charts, supervision and examination materials, and a link for feedback. It also provides additional information that covers rural or under-served counties, HUD-approved housing counselors, and Appendix Q.[32]\\r\\nAppendix Q relates to the debt-to-income ratio that must be possessed for \\"qualified mortgages\\" and provides details about how to determine the factors for that calculation. The standard is set at no more than 43 percent.\\r\\nThe CFPB is weighing whether it should take on a role in helping Americans manage retirement savings and regulate savings plans, particularly focusing on investment scams that target the retired and elderly. \\"Thats one of the things weve been exploring and are interested in in terms of whether and what authority we have, bureau director Richard Cordray said in a January 2013 interview.[33] Some conservatives have been critical of this potential role, with William Tucker of the American Media Institute asserting that the agency intends to \\"control\\" retirement savings and force people to buy federal debt.[34] The AARP has encouraged the agency to take an active role, arguing that the bureau will help protect elderly Americans from affinity fraud that often targets senior citizens, ensuring that their investments are less likely to be stolen through securities fraud or malpractice.[35]\\r\\nThe main regulator of retirement and benefit plans established by employers and private industry is the U.S. Department of Labor, which enforces the main laws (ERISA, COBRA, and HIPAA), retirement plans (including 401(k), SIMPLE, 403(b), and traditional defined-benefit pensions) as well as many aspects of employer group-health plans. The Affordable Care Act, establishing marketplaces selling health plans directly to consumers, adopted the ERISA-style regulatory model, requiring all plans to have standardized documents such as a \\"summary plan document\\" (SPD), but the marketplace was regulated by the individual insurance commissioners of every state, with some states having multiple regulators (California maintains both a Department of Insurance and a Department of Managed Care). IRAs, also directed to consumers, are regulated by type of custodian (the FDIC regulates bank custodians, the IRS regulates non-bank custodians). Annuities, life insurance, and disability insurance purchased directly by consumers, are regulated by individual state insurance commissioners. Marketing to consumers is generally regulated by the FCC and various state laws.\\r\\nBecause state commissioners are the main regulators, the CFPB is unlikely to assume a leadership role in retirement investment regulation without further legislation and possibly a US constitutional amendment transferring insurance lawmaking power to the federal government. In 2011, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners identified \\"the single most significant challenge for state insurance regulators is to be vigilant in the protection of consumers, especially in light of the changes taking place in the financial services marketplace\\",[36] and the CFPB may help fill this void. Many[who?] have argued the state-based system of insurance regulation (including insurance-like products such as annuities) is highly economically inefficient, results in uneven and non-portable insurance plans, artificially shrinks risk pools (especially in smaller states) resulting in higher premiums, limits mobility of brokers who have to re-certify in new states, complicates the needs of multi-state business, and should be replaced with a national insurance regulator or national insurance charter option as has taken place with the regulation of securities and banking.[37][38]\\r\\nThe CFPB has created a number of personal finance tools for consumers, including Ask CFPB, which compiles plain-language answers to personal finance questions, and Paying for College, which estimates the cost of attending specific universities based on the financial aid offers a student has received.[39][40]\\r\\nThe CFPB has also attempted to help consumers understand virtual currencies such as Bitcoin.[41]\\r\\n??Democratic ??Republican\\r\\nTwo lawsuits were filed in the early years of the CFPB; they were both dismissed by federal courts, but one was appealed and is still ongoing. The first one, filed in June 21, 2012, by a Texas bank along with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, challenged the constitutionality of provisions of the CFPB.[42] One year later, in August 2013, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit because the plaintiffs had failed to show that they had suffered harm.[43] In July 2015, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the bank, but not the states that later joined the lawsuit, had standing to challenge the law, and returned the case to Huvelle for further proceedings.[44][45]\\r\\nA lawsuit filed July 22, 2013, by Morgan Drexen Integrated Systems, a provider of outsourced administrative support services to attorneys, and Connecticut attorney Kimberly A. Pisinski, challenged the constitutionality of the CFPB.[46][47] The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleged that the \\"CFPB's structure insulates it from political accountability and internal checks and balances in violation of the United States Constitution. Unbridled from constitutionally-required accountability, CFPB has engaged in ultra vires and abusive practices, including attempts to regulate the practice of law (a function reserved for state bars), attempts to collect attorney-client protected material, and overreaching demands for, and mining of, personal financial information of American citizens, which has prompted a Government Accountability Office (\\"GAO\\") investigation, commenced on July 12, 2013.\\"[48] That October, this case was dismissed by a D.C. Federal Court.[49] On August 22, 2013, one month after Morgan Drexen's lawsuit, the CFPB filed its own lawsuit against Morgan Drexen in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging that Morgan Drexen charged advance fees for debt relief services in violation of the Telemarketing Sales Rule and engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA).[50] The CFPB won this lawsuit and Morgan Drexen was ordered to pay $132,882,488 in restitution and a $40 million civil penalty.[51]\\r\\nIn October 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that it was unconstitutional for the CFPB Director to be removable by the President of the United States only for cause, such as \\"inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance.\\"[52] Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh, joined by Senior Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, wrote that the law was \\"a threat to individual liberty\\" and instead found that the President could remove the CFPB Director at will.[52] The ruling essentially makes the CFPB part of the United States federal executive departments. Circuit Judge Karen L. Henderson agreed that the CFPB Director had been wrong in adopting a new interpretation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, finding the statute of limitations did not apply to the CFPB, and fining the petitioning mortgage company PHH Corporation $109 million, but she dissented from giving the President a new power to remove the Director, citing constitutional avoidance.[53] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has ordered en banc review of this decision to be heard on May 24, 2017.[54][needs update]\\r\\nA 2013 press release from the United States House Financial Services Committee criticized the CFPB for what was described as a \\"radical structure\\" that \\"is controlled by a single individual who cannot be fired for poor performance and who exercises sole control over the agency, its hiring and its budget.\\" Moreover, the committee alleged a lack of financial transparency and a lack of accountability to Congress or the President. Committee Vice Chairman Patrick McHenry, expressed particular concern about travel costs and a $55 million renovation of CFPB headquarters, stating \\"$55 million is more than the entire annual construction and acquisition budget for GSA for the totality of federal buildings.\\"[55] In 2012, the majority of GSA's Federal Buildings Fund went to rental costs, totaling $5.2 billion. $50 million was budgeted for construction and acquisition of facilities.[56]\\r\\nIn 2014, some employees and former employees of the CFPB testified before Congress about an alleged culture of racism and sexism at the agency. Former employees testified they were retaliated against for bringing problems to the attention of superiors.[57]\\r\\nThe CFPB has been heavily criticized for the methodology it uses to identify instances of racial discrimination among auto lenders. Because of legal constraints, the agency used a system to \\"guess\\" the race of auto loan applicants based on their last name and zip code. Based on that information, the agency charged several lenders were discriminating against minority applicants and levied large fines and settlements against those companies. Ally Financial paid $98 million in fines and settlement fees in 2013. As the agency's methodology means it can only guess who may be victims of discrimination entitled to settlement funds, as of late 2015 the CFPB had yet to compensate any individuals who were victims of Ally's allegedly discriminatory practices.[58]\\r\\nThe CFPB acknowledged in private documents that it knew the agency was overestimating the number of minority applicants, but continued using the flawed methodology anyway to levy penalties against financial companies.[59]","input":"When was the consumer financial protection bureau established?"},{"output":"Road/Track (no \\"and\\")","context":"R/T is the performance marker used on Dodge automobiles since the 1960s (much like Chevrolet Super Sport).

The first Death Star was stated to be more than 100?km to 160?km in diameter, depending on source. It was crewed by an estimated 1.7 million military personnel and 400,000 droids.[1][2] Its superweapon delivered enough energies on a scale equivalent to all the energy released by the Sun in an entire week.[citation needed] The second Death Star was significantly larger, between 200?km to 400?km in diameter depending on source, and technologically more advanced than its predecessor. Both versions of these dwarf planet-sized fortresses were designed for massive power projection capabilities, capable of destroying multiple naval fleets or entire planets with one blast from their superlasers.[3]\\r\\nAlthough details, such as the superlaser's location, shifted between different concept models during production of Star Wars, the notion of the Death Star being a large, spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter was consistent in all of them.[4] George Lucas gave the original task of designing a \\"Death Star\\" to concept artist and spaceship modeler Colin Cantwell,[5] who had collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey.[6] In a 2016 interview, Cantwell related that \\"I didn't originally plan for the Death Star to have a trench, but when I was working with the mold, I noticed the two halves had shrunk at the point where they met across the middle.\\" As it \\"would have taken a week of work just to fill and sand and refill this depression,\\" Cantwell suggested a trench to Lucas to save the labor. Lucas liked the idea,[5][6] and the Death Star model was created by John Stears.[7][8] The buzzing sound counting down to the Death Star firing its superlaser comes from the Flash Gordon serials.[9] Portraying an incomplete yet powerful space station posed a problem for Industrial Light & Magic's modelmakers for Return of the Jedi.[10] Only the front side of the 137-centimeter model was completed, and the image was flipped horizontally for the final film.[10] Both Death Stars were depicted by a combination of complete and sectional models and matte paintings.[4][10]\\r\\nThe Death Star explosions featured in the special edition of A New Hope and in Return of the Jedi are rendered with a Praxis effect, wherein a flat ring of matter erupts from the explosion.\\r\\nThe grid plan animations shown during the Rebel briefing for the attack on the Death Star late in A New Hope were an actual computer graphics simulation from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory made by Larry Cuba and Gary Imhoff as part of a CalArts project, and had been included during filming.[11]\\r\\nThese are depictions of the Death Star and other similar weapons of mass destruction within the Star Wars canon.\\r\\nThe original Death Star's completed form appears in Star Wars, known officially as the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station, or Project Stardust in Rogue One. Commanded by Governor Tarkin, it is the Galactic Empire's \\"ultimate weapon\\",[12] a huge spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter capable of destroying a planet with one shot of its superlaser. The film opens with Princess Leia transporting the station's schematics to the Rebel Alliance to aid them in destroying the Death Star. Tarkin orders the Death Star to destroy Leia's home world of Alderaan in an attempt to press her into giving him the location of the secret Rebel base; she gives them the false location of Dantooine, but Tarkin has Alderaan destroyed anyway, as a demonstration of the Death Star's firepower and the Empire's resolve. Later, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, and R2-D2 are pulled aboard the station by a tractor beam, where they discover and manage to rescue Princess Leia. As they make their escape, Obi-Wan dies fighting Darth Vader, enabling the others to flee the station. Later, Luke returns as part of a fighter force to attack its only weak point: a ray-shielded particle exhaust vent leading straight from the surface directly into its reactor core. Luke was able to successfully launch his fighter's torpedoes into the vent, impacting the core and triggering a catastrophic explosion, which completely destroyed the station before it could use its superlaser weapon to annihilate its intended target, the rebel base on Yavin IV.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Clone Wars Legacy story reel from the unfinished Crystal Crisis on Utapau episodes revealed that the reason General Grievous was on Utapau in Revenge of the Sith was to acquire enormous kyber crystals, which were required to power the Death Star's superlaser.[13]\\r\\nThe first Death Star's schematics are visible in the scenes on Geonosis in Star Wars: Episode II ÿ Attack of the Clones showcasing the early development of the Death Star prototype, the Death Star plans were designed by Geonosians led by Archduke Poggle the Lesser, a member of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and is shown early in construction at the end of Star Wars: Episode III ÿ Revenge of the Sith.

Saw Gerrera, having been sent to Geonosis to investigate, deduced the Empire possesses a superweapon and resolved to discover the Death Star as depicted in the final season two-parter \\"In the Name of the Rebellion.\\" Though it was a dead end, finding only scientists being abducted by the Empire, Saw learned the weapon is powered by kyber crystals taken from the Jedha system.\\r\\nThe anthology film Rogue One focuses on a band of Rebels stealing the plans for the first Death Star prior to the events of A New Hope. The Death Star project was overseen by Orson Krennic, the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military. Under Krennic's supervision, the project was beset by constant delays, and he forcibly recruited weapons designer Galen Erso (the father of Jyn Erso, the movie's main protagonist) to complete the design; nevertheless, it was another fifteen years before the Death Star was operational. The Death Star's primary laser was powered by kyber crystals mined from the desert moon of Jedha, and is first used to destroy Jedha City both as a response to a violent insurgency on the planet, and as a display of the Death Star's operational status to restore the Empire's confidence in the project. Grand Moff Tarkin assumes control over the Death Star while Krennic investigates security breaches in the design project. It is subsequently revealed that Galen discreetly sabotaged the design by building a vulnerability into the reactor. This is the same vulnerability that Luke Skywalker takes advantage of during the events of A New Hope. After the Death Star plans are stolen from the Scarif vault, Tarkin fires the Death Star laser on the base killing Krennic, as well as Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe canonical population of the first Death Star was 1.7 million military personnel, 400,000 maintenance droids, and 250,000 civilians/independent contractors.[1][2]\\r\\nThe 2014 book Star Wars: Tarkin detailed the life of Grand Moff Tarkin, and prominently featured the first Death Star. The theme of the construction of the Death Star is continued in the 2016 book, Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel, which tells the story of the development of the Death Star's superweapon by the scientist, Galen Erso and Krennic's deception of him. It also reveals how Poggle worked with Krennic on the Project but then turned on him.[14]\\r\\nIn the film Rogue One, it is revealed that the Death Star's superlaser is powered by multiple reactors, allowing it to vary its destructive power depending on the target. Skeptical of the station's power, Tarkin ordered that it first be tested on Jedha City using a single reactor. Subsequently, a second single-reactor test would destroy their installation on Scarif, along with the Rebel strike force who had successfully stolen the station's plans. The destruction of the planet Alderaan would be the first time the Death Star was tested with all reactors employed.[citation needed]\\r\\nReturn of the Jedi features a second Death Star still under construction in orbit around the second moon of Endor. Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader send the Rebels false information that the station's weapons systems are not operational in order to lure them into a trap. When the station's protective shield is disabled by a ground assault team on the forest moon of the planet Endor (led by Han Solo) with the help of the native Ewoks, rebel fighters flew into the unfinished station targeting its reactor core chamber and damaged the reactor core itself, which eventually explodes and destroys the station. It was destroyed by Wedge Antilles and Lando Calrissian (with Nien Nunb as his Millennium Falcon co-pilot), the former destroying a power regulator and the latter destroying the main reactor.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Death Star II is featured in the cover of the book Star Wars: Aftermath (2015), which also features many flashbacks to the destruction of the Death Star II, as well as the events directly after its destruction. One of the main characters in the story personally escaped the explosion of the Death Star. The destruction of the second Death Star was also shown in holograms in the book. The 2015 comic book Star Wars: Shattered Empire also explores the days following the destruction of the Death Star II from the perspective of Poe Dameron's parents, who were pilots during the event. The video game Star Wars: Uprising also takes place during the aftermath of the second Death Star's destruction, and features a hologram of its description on multiple occasions in and out of cutscenes.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Star Wars Rebels episode Twilight of the Apprentice features a forbidden planet called Malachor,[15] home of an ancient Sith Temple.[16] This temple contained a Battle Station capable of destroying planets, and could only be activated by placing a special Sith Holocron[17] in an obelisk at the summit of the pyramid inside the temple. Thousands of years prior, a battle was waged on Malachor that resulted in the deaths of its inhabitants. Somewhere between the events of his last appearance in The Clone Wars and this episode, Darth Maul had become stranded on Malachor. When Ahsoka Tano, Kanan and Ezra arrived, Ezra was separated from them. He was discovered by a character who later revealed himself to be Maul. Together, they solved a series of test chambers that required cooperation between two Force wielders, and retrieved a Sith Holocron. With the help of Kanan and Ahsoka, they fought three Inquisitors, all of whom were killed by Maul. Maul then betrayed his allies, blinding Kanan, and proceeded to activate the Battle Station. Once Maul was defeated by a sightless Kanan, Darth Vader arrived with the intention of retrieving the holocron, but was challenged by Ahsoka Tano, his former Padawan. While the station was preparing to fire, Kanan and Ezra retrieved the holocron themselves and escaped, preventing this weapon of mass destruction from being used. Even though the temple was destabilized, Ahsoka and Vader kept fighting to the death within the rapidly-crumbling building, until it eventually exploded, wounding Darth Vader and almost killing Ahsoka.[18]\\r\\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens features Starkiller Base, a planet turned into a battle station built by the First Order. Significantly larger than either the first or second Death Star, and unlike either of those cost-prohibitive space stations, this battle station cut-costs by terraforming an existing planet and draws its fire power directly from a sun, but it requires time to draw enough energy. Once fired, it has the power to destroy up to five planets within the same star system simultaneously, making it a far deadlier superweapon than the Death Star. General Hux gave an intense speech while the Starkiller Base demonstrated its lethality by obliterating the five planets of the Hosnian Prime system (the location of the Republic government, which rotates every few years), the cataclysm witnessed by Han Solo, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn from Maz Kanata's castle. After Rey was captured by Kylo Ren, he interrogated her within the base. Han, Chewbacca and Finn approached the base at light-speed because the base's shield kept out anything going under the speed of light.

The first level of LucasArts' Dark Forces gives the player a supporting role in Leia's mission, while a mission in Battlefront II tasks the player with acting as a stormtrooper or Darth Vader in an attempt to recover the plans and capture Leia. Steve Perry's novel Shadows of the Empire describes a mission that leads to the Rebels learning of the second Death Star's existence, and that mission is playable in LucasArts' X-Wing Alliance combat flight simulator. Numerous LucasArts titles recreate the movies' attacks on the Death Stars, and the Death Star itself is a controllable weapon for the Empire in the Rebellion and Empire at War strategy game. A Death Star variation appears in Kevin J. Anderson's novel Darksaber (1995), and a prototype version of the Death Star can be found in his novel Jedi Search (1994).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first Death Star is depicted in various sources of having a crew of 265,675, as well as 52,276 gunners, 607,360 troops, 30,984 stormtroopers, 42,782 ship support staff, and 180,216 pilots and support crew.[21] Its hangars contain assault shuttles, blastboats, Strike cruisers, land vehicles, support ships, and 7,293 TIE fighters.[22] It is also protected by 10,000 turbolaser batteries, 2,600 ion cannons, and at least 768 tractor beam projectors.[22] Various sources state the first Death Star has a diameter of between 140 and 160 kilometers.[21][23][24] There is a broader range of figures for the second Death Star's diameter, ranging from 160 to 900 kilometers.[25][26]\\r\\nIn the Legends novels Death Star, Dark Empire II, Jedi Search and Champions of the Force, an experimental Death Star prototype, DS-X (a durasteel frame surrounding a reactor core, superlaser, engines and a control room) was conceived by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin as a test bed for the first Death Star. It was constructed by Bevel Lemelisk and his engineers at the Empire's secret Maw Installation. The prototype measured 120 kilometers in diameter. Its superlaser was only powerful enough to destroy a planet's core, rendering it an uninhabitable \\"dead planet\\". The targeting system on the prototype was never calibrated and the superlaser was inefficient, leaving the weapon's batteries drained. The prototype had no interior except a slave-linked control room, hyperdrive engines and other components; the station operated with skeleton-crew of 75 personnel.[citation needed]\\r\\nGeorge Lucas himself confirmed that the plans featured in Attack of the Clones and the under-construction facility in Revenge of the Sith was indeed the original Death Star.

In the original Star Tours, a Death Star III is seen and destroyed during the ride sequence by the New Republic. Leland Chee originally created the third Death Star to explain why a Death Star is present on the Star Tours ride when both of the stations in the movies were destroyed.[27] The station being built near the Forest Moon of Endor like the second Death Star before it is similar to an original concept for Return of the Jedi, where two Death Stars would have been built near Had Abbadon (then the Imperial capital world). The Habitation spheres, based on the Imperials' suspicious claims that they were designed strictly for peaceful purposes, were suggested by some fans to have been the origin for the Death Star III. This was later revealed to be the case in Part 2 of the StarWars.com Blog series The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire.

In 1961, their first store in South Carolina opened, followed by stores in Georgia and Virginia, which were opened in 1962 and 1965, respectively. During the 1960s, the store company was largely a southern United States operation. By 1969, there were fifty stores in Charlotte alone.\\r\\nThe 1970s were growing years for the store chain. In 1970, Family Dollar's stock went public for the first time, at $14.50 per share. In 1971, the chain's 100th store opened, followed by their 200th in 1974 and their 300th in 1978.

According to the national census conducted in 2015, 19.7% of the population belongs to Protestantism, 15.5% to Buddhism (Korean Buddhism), and 7.9% to the Roman Catholic Church; in total Christianity is the religion of 27.6% of the Korean population. Buddhism was influential in ancient times and Christianity persuaded large segments of the population already in the 18th and 19th century, yet they grew rapidly in membership only by the mid-20th century, as part of the profound transformations that South Korean society has gone through in the past century,[2] and then have shown some decline from the 2000s onwards. Native shamanic religions (i.e. Sindo) remain popular and could represent a large part of the unaffiliated. Indeed, according to a 2012 survey, only 15% of the population declared to be not religious in the sense of \\"atheism\\".[3] According to the 2015 census, the proportion of the unaffiliated is higher among the youth, about 65% among the 20-years old.[4]\\r\\nKorea entered the 20th century with an already ingrained Christian presence and a vast majority of the population practicing native religion (Sindo). The latter never gained the high status of a national religious culture comparable to China's system and Japan's Shinto; this weakness of Korean Sindo was among the reasons that left freehand to an early and thorough rooting of Christianity.[5] The population also took part in Confucianising rites and held private ancestor worship.[2] Organised religions and philosophies belonged to the ruling elites, and the long patronage exerted by the Chinese empire led these elites to embrace a particularly strict Confucianism (i.e. Korean Confucianism). Korean Buddhism, despite an erstwhile rich tradition, at the dawn of the 20th century was virtually extinct as a religious institution, after 500 years of suppression under the Joseon kingdom.[2][6] Christianity had antecedents in the Korean peninsula as early as the 18th century, when the philosophical school of Seohak supported the religion. With the fall of the Joseon in the last decades of the 19th century, Koreans largely embraced Christianity, since the monarchy itself and the intellectuals looked to Western models to modernise the country and endorsed the work of Catholic and Protestant missionaries.[7] During Japanese colonisation in the first half of the 20th century, the identification of Christianity with Korean nationalism was further strengthened,[8] as the Japanese tried to merge native Sindo with their State Shinto.\\r\\nWith the division of Korea into two states after 1945, the communist north and the anti-communist south, the majority of the Korean Christian population that had been until then in the northern half of the peninsula,[9] fled to South Korea.[10] It has been estimated that Christians who migrated to the south were more than one million.[11] Throughout the second half of the 20th century, the South Korean state enacted measures to further marginalise indigenous Sindo, at the same time strengthening Christianity and a revival of Buddhism.[12] According to scholars, South Korean censuses do not count believers in indigenous Sindo and underestimate the number of adherents of Sindo sects.[13] Otherwise, statistics compiled by the ARDA[14] estimate that as of 2010, 14.7% of South Koreans practice ethnic religion, 14.2% adhere to new movements, and 10.9% practice Confucianism.[15]\\r\\nAccording to some observers, the sharp decline of some religions (Catholicism and Buddhism) recorded between the censuses of 2005 and 2015 is due to the change in survey methodology between the two censuses. While the 2005 census was an analysis of the entire population (\\"whole survey\\") through traditional data sheets compiled by every family, the 2015 census was largely conducted through the internet and was limited to a sample of about 20% of the South Korean population. It has been argued that the 2015 census penalised the rural population, which is more Buddhist and Catholic and less familiar with the internet, while advantaging the Protestant population, which is more urban and has easier access to the internet. Both the Buddhist and the Catholic communities criticised the 2015 census' results.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the introduction of Buddhism, all Koreans believed in their indigenous religion socially guided by mu (shamans). Buddhism was introduced from the Chinese Former Qin state in 372 to the northern Korean state of Goguryeo and developed into distinctive Korean forms. At that time, the peninsula was divided into three kingdoms: the aforementioned Goguryeo in the north, Baekje in the southwest, and Silla in the southeast. Buddhism reached Silla only in the 5th century, but it was made the state religion only in that kingdom in the year 552.[22] Buddhism became much more popular in Silla and even in Baekje (both areas now part of modern South Korea), while in Goguryeo the Korean indigenous religion remained dominant. In the following unified state of Goryeo (918ÿ1392) Buddhism flourished, and even became a political force.[23]\\r\\nThe Joseon kingdom (1392ÿ1910), adopted an especially strict version of Neo-Confucianism (i.e. Korean Confucianism) and suppressed and marginalised Korean Buddhism[24][25] and Korean shamanism.[6] Buddhist monasteries were destroyed, and their number dropped from several hundreds to a mere thirty-six; Buddhism was eradicated from the life of towns as monks and nuns were prohibited from entering them and were marginalised to the mountains.[25] These restrictions lasted until the 19th century.[26]\\r\\nIn the late 19th century, the Joseon state was politically and culturally collapsing.[27] Interested parties were looking for solutions to invigorate and transform the nation.[27] It was in this critical period that they came into contact with Western Protestant missionaries who offered a proven way to use religious beliefs and their system of fears for shaping a citizenship that is obedient to religious and other leaderships.[27] Christian communities already existed in Joseon since the 17th century, however it was only by the 1880s that the government allowed a large number of Western missionaries to enter the country.[28] Protestant missionaries set up schools, hospitals and publishing agencies.[29] The royal family supported Christianity.[30]\\r\\nDuring the absorption of Korea into the Japanese Empire (1910ÿ1945) the already formed link of Christianity with Korean nationalism was strengthened,[8] as the Japanese tried to impose State Shinto, co-opting within it native Korean Sindo, and Christians refused to take part in Shinto rituals.[8] At the same time, numerous religious movements that since the 19th century had been trying to reform the Korean indigenous religion, notably Cheondoism, flourished.[31]\\r\\nWith the division of Korea into two states in 1945, the communist north and the anti-communist south, the majority of the Korean Christian population that had been until then in the northern half of the peninsula,[9] fled to South Korea.[10] Christians who resettled in the south were more than one million. Cheondoists, who were concentrated in the north like Christians, remained there after the partition,[31] and South Korea now has no more than few thousands Cheondoists.\\r\\nThe so-called \\"movement to defeat the worship of gods\\" promoted by governments of South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, prohibited indigenous cults and wiped out nearly all traditional shrines (sadang ??) of the Confucian kinship religion.[32] This was particularly tough under the rule of Park Chung-hee (a Buddhist).[33]\\r\\nThis measure, combined with the rapid social changes of the same period,[2] favoured a rapid revival of Korean Buddhism and growth of Christian churches in a trend to register as members of organised religions.[34] The number of Buddhist temples rose from 2,306 in 1962 to 11,561 in 1997, Protestant churches rose from 6,785 in 1962 to 58,046 in 1997, the Catholic Church had 313 churches in 1965 and 1,366 in 2005, Won Buddhism had 131 temples in 1969 and 418 in 1997.[35] Similarly, Daesun Jinrihoe's temples have grown from 700 in 1983 to 1,600 in 1994.[36] Statistics from censuses show that the proportion of the South Korean population self-identifying as Buddhist has grown from 2.6% in 1962 to 22.8% in 2005,[2] while the proportion of Christians has grown from 5% in 1962 to 29.2% in 2005.[2] However, both religions have shown a decline between the years 2005 and 2015, with Buddhism sharply declining in influence to 15.5% of the population, and a less significant decline of Christianity to 27.6%.[1]\\r\\nSince the 1980s and the 1990s there have been acts of hostility committed by Protestants against Buddhists and followers of traditional religions in South Korea. This include the arson of temples, the beheading of statues of Buddha and bodhisattvas, and red Christian crosses painted on either statues or other Buddhist and other religions' properties.[37] Some of these acts have even been promoted by churches' pastors.[37]\\r\\nChristianity (??? Gidoggyo) in South Korea is predominantly Protestant (??? Gaesingyo, \\"renewed teaching\\") and Catholic (??? Cheonjugyo, \\"religion of the Lord of Heaven\\", or ???? Gatolliggyo), respectively with 9.6 million and 3.8 million members as of the 2015 census. There are also small communities of Orthodox Christians (??? Jeonggyohoe), founded by Russian Orthodox missionary endeavours in the 19th century, and Mormons (???? Molmongyo).\\r\\nForeign Roman Catholic missionaries did not arrive in Korea until 1794, a decade after the return of Yi Sung-hun, a diplomat who was the first baptised Korean in Beijing.[38] He established a grass roots lay Catholic movement in Korea. However, the writings of the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci, who was resident at the imperial court in Beijing, had been already brought to Korea from China in the 17th century. Scholars of the Silhak (\\"Practical Learning\\") were attracted to Catholic doctrines, and this was a key factor for the spread of the Catholic faith in the 1790s.[39] The penetration of Western ideas and Christianity in Korea became known as Seohak (\\"Western Learning\\"). A study of 1801 found that more than half of the families that had converted to Catholicism were linked to the Seohak school.[40] Largely because converts refused to perform Confucian ancestral rituals, the Joseon government prohibited Christian proselytising. Some Catholics were executed during the early 19th century, but the restrictive law was not strictly enforced.\\r\\nProtestant missionaries entered Korea during the 1880s and, along with Catholic priests, converted a remarkable number of Koreans, this time with the support of the royal government which winked at Westernising forces in a period of deep internal crisis (due to the waning of centuries-long patronage from a then-weakened China).[30] The lack of a national religious system compared to those of China and that of Japan (Korean Sindo never developed to a high status of institutional and civic religion) gave a free hand to Christian churches.[5] Methodist and Presbyterian missionaries were especially successful. They established schools, universities, hospitals, and orphanages and played a significant role in the modernisation of the country.[29] During the Japanese colonial occupation, Christians were in the front ranks of the struggle for independence. Factors contributing to the growth of Protestantism included the decayed state of Korean Buddhism, the support of the intellectual elite, and the encouragement of self-support and self-government among members of the Korean church, and finally the identification of Christianity with Korean nationalism.[30]\\r\\nA large number of Christians lived in the northern part of the peninsula (it was part of the so-called \\"Manchurian revival\\")[30] where Confucian influence was not as strong as in the south.[9] Before 1948 Pyongyang was an important Christian centre: one-sixth of its population of about 300,000 people were converts. Following the establishment of the communist regime in the north, an estimated more than one million Korean Christians resettled to South Korea to escape persecution by North Korea's anti-Christian policies.[10]\\r\\nChristianity grew significantly in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s it continued to grow, but at a slower rate, and since the 2000s it has shown some decline. Christianity is especially dominant in the west of the country including Seoul, Incheon, and the regions of Gyeonggi and Honam. The Christian faith in South Korea is dominated by four denominations: Presbyterianism (??? pronounced Jangnogyo), Methodism (??? pronounced Gamnigyo), Baptists (??? pronounced Chimnyegyo) and Catholicism. The Yoido Full Gospel Church is the largest Pentecostal church in the country. Some non-denominational churches also exist. Korean Catholics still observe jesa (ancestral rites); the Korean tradition is very different from the institutional religious ancestral worship that is found in China and Japan and can be easily integrated as ancillary to Christianity. Protestants, by contrast, have completely abandoned the practice.[41]\\r\\nThe peace churches have not gained a strong foothold on the peninsula. Quaker thought briefly attracted a national following in the late 20th century, thanks to the leadership of Ham Seok-heon. However, after Ham's death, interest in Quakerism declined. The state of Unitarianism is similar.\\r\\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South Korea was established following the baptism of Kim Ho Jik in 1951. Studying nutrition in Cornell, he met a member of their faith, Oliver Wyman, and was struck with their doctrine. Upon joining the church and completing his degree, Kim travelled back to South Korea, started translations for materials, and helped the church gain official recognition.[42]\\r\\nAs of 2012 there were 81,628 Mormons and one temple in Seoul,[43] four missions (Seoul, Daejeon, Busan, and Seoul South),[44] 128 congregations, and twenty-four family history centres.[45]\\r\\nBuddhism (?? Bulgyo) entered Korea from China during the period of the three kingdoms (372, or the 4th century).[22] Buddhism was the dominant religious and cultural influence in the Silla (668-935) and subsequent Goryeo (918-1392) states. Confucianism was also brought to Korea from China in early centuries, and was formulated as Korean Confucianism in Goryeo. However, it was only in the subsequent Joseon kingdom (1392ÿ1910) that Korean Confucianism was established as the state ideology and religion, and Korean Buddhism underwent 500 years of suppression.[24][25] Buddhism in the contemporary state of South Korea is stronger in the east of the country, namely the Yeongnam and Gangwon regions, as well as in Jeju.\\r\\nThere are a number of different schools in Korean Buddhism (???? Daehanbulgyo), including the Seon (Korean Zen). The overwhelming majority of Buddhist temples in contemporary South Korea belong to the dominant Jogye Order, traditionally related to the Seon school. The order's headquarters are at Jogyesa in central Seoul, and it operates most of the country's old and famous temples, such as Bulguksa and Beomeosa.\\r\\nOther Buddhist traditions in South Korea include the \\"Taego\\" and \\"Cheontae\\" lineages. Taego is a form of Seon (Zen), while the Choentae is a modern revival of the Tiantai lineage in Korea, focusing on the Lotus Sutra. Another lineage, the Jingak, is a form of Vajrayana Buddhism. Both the Jogye and Cheontae orders require their monastics to be celibate, while the Taego and Jingak orders allow for married priests.\\r\\nWon Buddhism (??? Wonbulgyo) is a modern reformed Buddhism that seeks to make enlightenment possible for everyone and applicable to regular life. The scriptures and practices are simplified so that anyone, regardless of their wealth, occupation, or other external living conditions, can understand them.[46]\\r\\nKorean shamanism, also known as \\"Muism\\" (?? Mugyo, \\"mu [shaman] religion\\")[47] and \\"Sindo\\" (??) or \\"Sinism\\" (?? Singyo \\"Way of the Gods\\").[48][49] is the native religion of the Koreans.[50][note 1] Although used synonymously, the two terms aren't identical:[50] Jung Young Lee describes Muism as a form of Sindo - the shamanic tradition within the religion.[51] Particularly akin to Japan's Shinto, contrarywise to it ad to China's religious systems, Korean Sindo never developed into a national religious culture.[5][clarification needed]\\r\\nIn contemporary Korean language the shaman-priest or mu (hanja: ) is known as a mudang (Hangul: ?? hanja: ) if female or baksu if male, although other names and locutions are used.[50][note 2] Korean mu \\"shaman\\" is synonymous with Chinese wu, which defines priests both male and female.[51] The role of the mudang is to act as intermediary between the spirits or gods, and the human plain, through gut (rituals), seeking to resolve problems in the patterns of development of human life.[53]\\r\\nCentral is interaction with Haneullim or Hwanin, meaning \\"source of all being\\",[54] and of all gods of nature,[51] the utmost god or the supreme mind.[55] The mu are mythically described as descendants of the \\"Heavenly King\\", son of the \\"Holy Mother [of the Heavenly King]\\", with investiture often passed down through female princely lineage.[56] However, other myths link the heritage of the traditional faith to Dangun, male son of the Heavenly King and initiator of the Korean nation.[57]\\r\\nBesides Japanese Shinto, Korean religion has also similarities with Chinese Wuism,[58] and is akin to the Siberian, Mongolian, and Manchurian religious traditions.[58] Some studies trace the Korean ancestral god Dangun to the Ural-Altaic Tengri \\"Heaven\\", the shaman and the prince.[59][60] In the dialects of some provinces of Korea the shaman is called dangul dangul-ari.[54] The mudang is similar to the Japanese miko and the Ryukyuan yuta. Muism has exerted an influence on some Korean new religions, such as Cheondoism and Jeungsanism. According to various sociological studies, Korea's type of Christianity owes much of its success to native shamanism, which provided a congenial mindset and models for the religion to take root.[61]\\r\\nIn the 1890s, the last decades of the Joseon kingdom, Protestant missionaries gained significant influence, and led a demonisation of native religion through the press, and even carried out campaigns of physical suppression of local cults.[62] The Protestant discourse would have had an influence on all further attempts to uproot native religion.[62] The \\"movement to destroy Sindo\\" carried out in South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, destroyed much of the physical heritage of Korean religion (temples and shrines),[32] especially during the regime of President Park Chung-hee.[33][63][64] There has been of a revival of shamanism in South Korea in most recent times.[65][66]\\r\\nCheondoism (??? Cheondogyo) is a fundamentally Confucian religious tradition derived from indigenous Sinism. It is the religious dimension of the Donghak (\\"Eastern Learning\\") movement that was founded by Choe Je-u (1824-1864), a member of an impoverished yangban (aristocratic) family,[67] in 1860 as a counter-force to the rise of \\"foreign religions\\",[68] which in his view included Buddhism and Christianity (part of Seohak, the wave of Western influence that penetrated Korean life at the end of the 19th century).[68] Choe Je-u founded Cheondoism after having been allegedly healed from illness by an experience of Sangje or Haneullim, the god of the universal Heaven in traditional shamanism.[68]\\r\\nThe Donghak movement became so influential among common people that in 1864 the Joseon government sentenced Choe Je-u to death.[68] The movement grew and in 1894 the members gave rise to the Donghak Peasant Revolution against the royal government. With the division of Korea in 1945, most of the Cheondoist community remained in the north, where the majority of them dwelled.[31] Only few thousands of them remain in South Korea today.\\r\\nThe social and historical significance of the Donghak movement and Cheondoism has been largely ignored in South Korea,[69] contrarywise to North Korea where Cheondoism is viewed positively as a folk (minjung) movement.[69]\\r\\nApart from Cheondoism, other sects based on indigenous religion were founded between the end of the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century. They include Daejongism (??? Daejonggyo),[70] which has as its central creed the worship of Dangun, legendary founder of Gojoseon, thought of as the first proto-Korean kingdom; and a splinter sect of Cheondoism: Suwunism.[citation needed]\\r\\nJeungsanism (??? Jeungsangyo) defines a family of religions founded in the early 20th century[71] that emphasise magical practices and millenarian teachings. Part of it are more than a hundred \\"Jeungsan religions,\\" including the now defunct Bocheonism: the largest in Korea is currently Daesun Jinrihoe (?????), an offshoot of the still existing Taegeukdo (???), while Jeungsando (???) is the most active overseas[72]. They show themes derived from Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and Korean folk religion.[73]\\r\\nThere are also a number of small religious sects, which have sprung up around Gyeryongsan (\\"Rooster-Dragon Mountain\\", always one of Korea's most-sacred areas) in South Chungcheong Province, the supposed future site of the founding of a new dynasty originally prophesied in the 18th century (or before). Japanese Tenriism (??? Cheonligyo) also claims to have thousands of South Korean members.[74]\\r\\nAccording to Andrew Eungi Kim, there was a rise of new religious movements in the late 1900s which account for about 10 percent of all churches in South Korea. According to Kim, this is the outcome of foreign invasions, as well as conflicting views regarding social and political issues. Many of the new religious movements are syncretic in character.[75]\\r\\nOnly few contemporary South Koreans identify as adherents of Confucianism (?? Yugyo). Korean intellectuals historically developed a distinct Korean Confucianism. However, with the end of the Joseon state and the wane of Chinese influence in the 19th and 20th century, Confucianism was abandoned. The influence of Confucian ethical thought remains strong in other religious practices, and in Korean culture in general. Confucian rituals are still practised at various times of the year. The most prominent of these are the annual rites held at the Shrine of Confucius in Seoul. Other rites, for instance those in honour of clan founders, are held at shrines found throughout the country.\\r\\nDiplomatic ties between the Chinese empire and the Korean kingdom meant that Chinese officers and diplomats tried to exert influence by exporting Chinese religious models and divine cults, building temples to Chinese gods. Chinese religious facilities were used almost exclusively by Chinese officials and their families and the Korean population remained indifferent towards such practices. The Dongmyo (Temple of Guan Yu) in the capital Seoul is one of the few remaining examples of state Chinese religion in Korea.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Japan's colonisation of Korea (1910-1945), given the common Altaic origins of the two peoples, Koreans were considered to be outright part of the Japanese population, to be wholly assimilated. The Japanese studied and coopted native Sindo by overlapping it with their State Shinto (similar measures of assimilation were applied to Buddhism), which hinged upon the worship of Japanese high gods and the emperor's godhead. Hundreds of Japanese Shinto shrines were built throughout the peninsula.[76]\\r\\nThis policy led to massive conversion of Koreans to Christian churches, which were already well ingrained in the country, representing a concern for the Japanese program, and supported Koreans' independence.[77] After the downfall of Japanese power in the peninsula, the Shinto infrastructure was completely dismantled.\\r\\nIslam (???? Iseullamgyo) in South Korea is represented by a community of roughly 40,000 Muslims, mainly composed by people who converted during the Korean War and their descendants and not including migrant workers from South and Southeast Asia. The largest mosque is the Seoul Central Mosque in the Itaewon district of Seoul; smaller mosques can be found in most of the country's major cities.\\r\\nIn addition to native Korean Muslims, there are around a hundred thousand foreign workers from Muslim countries, particularly Pakistanis and Bangladeshis.[78]\\r\\nHinduism (??? Hindugyo) is practiced among South Korea's small Indian and Nepali immigrant community. However, Hindu traditions such as yoga and Vedanta have attracted interest among younger South Koreans. There are two Hindu temples in the Seoul region, the Sri Radha Shyamasundar Mandir and the Sri Sri Radha Krishna temple, located on Seoul's outskirts.\\r\\nThe Jewish existence in South Korea effectively began with the dawn of the Korean War in 1950. At this time a large number of Jewish soldiers, including the chaplain Chaim Potok, came to the Korean peninsula. Today the Jewish community is very small and limited to the Seoul Capital Area. There have been very few Korean converts to Judaism (??? Yutaegyo).\\r\\nThe Unification Church or Unificationism (??? Tongilgyo)[79] is a new religious movement founded in South Korea in 1954 by Sun Myung Moon. Since its founding, the church has expanded throughout the world with most members living in East Asia.\\r\\nUnificationist beliefs are derived from the Christian Bible and are explained in the church's textbook, the Divine Principle. It teaches that God is the creator and Heavenly Father, whose dual nature combines both masculinity and femininity and whose centre is true love.\\r\\nThe Unification Church has sponsored many organizations and projects over the years; including businesses, news media, projects in education and the arts, and political and social activism. The church was led by Moon until his death on September 3, 2012. At the time of Moon's death, it was reported that his widow Hak Ja Han would assume the leadership of the church. Their philosophy for establishing the Kingdom of Heaven is family centred.[80]\\r\\nIn 2003, Korean Unification Church members started a political party in South Korea. It was named \\"The Party for God, Peace, Unification, and Home\\". In an inauguration declaration, the new party said it would focus on preparing for the reunification of the South and North Korea by educating the public about God and peace. A church official said that similar political parties would be started in Japan and the United States.[81]\\r\\nOther Korean new religions that originated within Christianity are the World Mission Society Church of God and the Victory Altar.","input":"What is the main religion in south korea?"},{"output":"Arati Gupta ne Saha","context":"Arati Gupta ne Saha (24 September 1940 ÿ 23 August 1994) was an Indian long distance swimmer. Born in Calcutta, West Bengal, British India, Arati was initiated in swimming at the early age of four, and her talent was spotted by Sachin Nag. She was inspired by Indian swimmer Mihir Sen to try to cross the English Channel. In 1959 she became the first Asian woman to swim across the English Channel.[1] In 1960, she became the first Indian female sportsperson to be awarded Padma Shri.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArati came from a middle class Bengali Hindu family. She was born the second of three children and the first of two daughters to Panchugopal Saha in 1940 in Kolkata. Her father was an ordinary employee in the armed forces.[2] At the age of two and half, she lost her mother. Her elder brother and younger sister Bharati was raised at the maternal uncle's house, while she was raised by her grandmother in North Kolkata.\\r\\nWhen she reached the age of four, she would accompany her uncle to the Champatala Ghat for bath where she learned to swim. Noticing his daughter's interest in swimming, Panchugopal Saha admitted his daughter to the Hatkhola Swimming Club. In 1946, at the age of five, she won the gold in 110 yards freestyle at the Shailendra Memorial Swimming Competition. It was the beginning of her swimming career.\\r\\nBetween 1946 and 1956, Arati participated in several swimming competitions. Between 1945 and 1951 she won 22 state-level competitions in West Bengal.[2] Her main events were 100 metres freestyle, 100 metres breast stroke and 200 metres breast stroke.[2] She came second only to Dolly Nazir of Bombay.[2]\\r\\nIn 1948, she participated in the national championship held at Mumbai. She won silver in 100 metres freestyle and 200 metres breast stroke and won bronze in 200 metres freestyle. She made an all-India record in 1949. At the 1951 West Bengal state meet, she clocked 1 minute 37.6 seconds in 100 metres breast stroke and broke Dolly Nazir's all-India record.[2] At the same meet, she set new state-level record in 100 metres freestyle, 200 metres freestyle and 100 metres back stroke.[2]\\r\\nShe represented India at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics along with compatriot Dolly Nazir.[3] She was one of the four women participants and the youngest member of the Indian contingent. At the Olympics, she took part in 200 metres breast stroke event. At the heats she clocked 3 minutes 40.8 seconds. After returning from the Olympics, she lost in 100 metres freestyle to her sister Bharati Saha. After the loss, she concentrated only on breast stroke.\\r\\nShe used to take part in long distance swimming competition in the Ganges. Arati got the first inspiration to cross the English Channel from Brojen Das. At the 1958 Butlin International Cross Channel Swimming Race, Brojen Das became the first among the men and earned the distinction of being the first person from the Indian subcontinent to cross the English Channel. Greta Andersen, a Danish-born female swimmer from United States clocked 11 hours and 1 minute and stood first among both men and women. This inspired the female swimmers all over the world. Arati sent a congratulatory message to Brojen Das on his victory. He replied back stating that she too shall be able to achieve it. He proposed the name of Arati to the organizers of the Butlin International Cross Channel Swimming Race for the next year's event.\\r\\nAt the inspiration of Brojen Das, Arati began to seriously think about participating in the event. Mihir Sen welcomed her decision and encouraged her. Dr. Arun Gupta, the assistant executive secretary of Hatkhola Swimming Club took the major initiative in organising Arati's participation at the event. He organised exhibits of Arati's swimming prowess as a part of fund raising programs. Apart from him, Jamininath Das, Gour Mukherjee and Parimal Saha too provided their help in organising Arati's trip. However, in spite of sincere efforts of her sympathizers, funds raised still fell short of the target. At this point eminent social work Sambhunath Mukherjee and Ajay Ghoshal took up the matter with Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, the Chief Minister of West Bengal. He arranged an amount of ? 11,000. Jawahar Lal Nehru, the Prime Minister of India, too showed keen interest in Arati's endeavour.\\r\\nWhile the logistics of her trip was being arranged, Arati began her training. A major component of her preparation was swimming for long hours. On 13 April 1959, Arati swam continuously for eight hours at the pond in Deshbandhu Park, in the presence of renowned swimmers and thousands of supporters. Later she swam continuously for 16 hours. She sprinted the last 70 metres and showed almost no signs of fatigue. On 24 July 1959, she left for England along with her manager Dr. Arun Gupta. After basic practice, she started her final practice at the English Channel from 13 August. During this time, she was mentored by Dr. Bimal Chandra, who was also participating at the 1959 Butlin International Cross Channel Swimming Race. He had arrived in England from another swimming competition in Naples in Italy.\\r\\nA total of 58 participants including 5 women from 23 countries took part in the competition. The race was scheduled on 27 August 1959 at 1?am local time from Cape Gris Nez, France to Sandgate, England. However, the pilot boat of Arati Saha did not arrive in time. She had to start late by 40 minutes and lost the favourable condition. By 11?am, she had swum more than 40 miles and came within 5 miles of the England coast. At that point she faced a strong current from the opposite direction. As a result, by 4?pm, she could only swim about two more miles. While she was still determined to carry on, she had to quit under pressure from her pilot.\\r\\nIn spite of the failure, Arati was determined not to give up. She prepared herself for a second attempt. Her manager Dr. Arun Gupta's illness made her situation difficult, but she carried on with her practice. On 29 September 1959, she made her second attempt. Starting from Cape Gris Nez, France, she swam for 16 hours and 20 minutes, batting tough waves and covered 42 miles to reach Sandgate, England. On reaching the coast of England, she hoisted the Indian flag. Vijaylakshmi Pandit was the first to congratulate her. Jawahar Lal Nehru and many eminent people personally congratulated her. On 30 September, the All India Radio announced the achievement of Arati Saha.\\r\\nArati had completed her Intermediate from City College. In 1959, under the supervision of Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, she got married to her manager Dr. Arun Gupta. First they had a court marriage and later a social marriage. Her in law's house was in Tarak Chatterjee Lane, very near to her grandmother's house. After marriage she had a daughter named Archana. She was employed in Bengal Nagpur Railway. On 4 August 1994, she got admitted to a private nursing home in Kolkata with jaundice and encephalitis. After battling for 19 days she died on 23 August 1994.\\r\\nShe was awarded Padma Shri in 1960. In 1999, the Department of Posts celebrated her conquest by bringing out a postage stamp of ? 3 denomination. In 1996, a bust of Arati Saha was erected near her residence.[4] The 100-metre long lane in front the bust was renamed after her.[4]","input":"Who was the first female sportsperson to be awarded padma shri?"},{"output":"17,985","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSeparation of Powers\\r\\n\\r\\nJurisdiction\\r\\n\\r\\nTopics\\r\\n\\r\\nProsecution\\r\\n\\r\\nLaw Enforcement Agencies\\r\\n\\r\\nTypes of Agency\\r\\n\\r\\nTypes of Agent\\r\\n\\r\\nLaw enforcement in the United States is one of three major components of the criminal justice system of the United States, along with courts and corrections. Although each component operates semi-independently, the three collectively form a chain leading from investigation of suspected criminal activity to administration of criminal punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaw enforcement operates primarily through governmental police agencies. There are 17,985 U.S. police agencies in the United States which include college campus police, sheriff departments, local police, and federal agencies. The law-enforcement purposes of these agencies are the investigation of suspected criminal activity, referral of the results of investigations to the courts, and the temporary detention of suspected criminals pending judicial action. Law enforcement agencies, to varying degrees at different levels of government and in different agencies, are also commonly charged with the responsibilities of deterring criminal activity and preventing the successful commission of crimes in progress. Other duties may include the service and enforcement of warrants, writs, and other orders of the courts.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaw enforcement agencies are also involved in providing first response to emergencies and other threats to public safety; the protection of certain public facilities and infrastructure; the maintenance of public order; the protection of public officials; and the operation of some correctional facilities (usually at the local level).\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicing in the United States is conducted by \\"close to 1 federal, state, local and city departments\\".[1] Every state has its own nomenclature for agencies, and their powers, responsibilities and funding vary from state to state.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the federal level, there exists both federal police, who possess full federal authority as given to them under United States Code (U.S.C.), and federal law enforcement agencies, who are authorized to enforce various laws at the federal level. Both police and law enforcement agencies operate at the highest level and are endowed with police roles; each may maintain a small component of the other (for example, the FBI Police). The agencies have nationwide jurisdiction for enforcement of federal law. Most federal agencies are limited by the U.S. Code to investigating only matters that are explicitly within the power of the federal government. However, federal investigative powers have become very broad in practice, especially since the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act. There are also federal law enforcement agencies, such as the United States Park Police, that are granted state arrest authority off primary federal jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) is responsible for most law enforcement duties at the federal level.[2] It includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), the United States Marshals Service, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is another branch with numerous federal law enforcement agencies reporting to it. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS), United States Secret Service (USSS), United States Coast Guard (USCG), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) are some of the agencies that report to DHS. It should be noted that the United States Coast Guard is assigned to the United States Department of Defense in the event of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a crime or disaster scene affecting large numbers of people, multiple jurisdictions, or broad geographic areas, many police agencies may be involved by mutual aid agreements, for example the United States Federal Protective Service responded to the Hurricane Katrina natural disaster. Command in such situations remains a complex and flexible issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn accordance with the federal, as opposed to unitary or confederal, structure of the United States government, the national (federal) government is not authorized to execute general police powers by the Constitution of the United States of America. Each of the United States' 50 federated states (referred to simply as 'states' in the United States despite their lack of full sovereignty[citation needed]) retain their own police, military and domestic law-making powers. The US Constitution gives the federal government the power to deal with foreign affairs and interstate affairs (affairs between the states).  For policing, this means that if a non-federal crime is committed in a US state and the fugitive does not flee the state, the federal government has no jurisdiction. However, once the fugitive crosses a state line he violates the federal law of interstate flight and is subject to federal jurisdiction, at which time federal law enforcement agencies may become involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost states operate statewide government agencies that provide law enforcement duties, including investigations and state patrols. They may be called state police or highway patrol, and are normally part of the state Department of Public Safety. In addition, the Attorney General's office of each state has its own state bureau of investigation such as in California with the California Department of Justice. In Texas, the Texas Ranger Division fulfill this role though they have their history in the period before Texas became a state.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious departments of state governments may have their own enforcement divisions, such as capitol police, campus police, state hospitals, Departments of Correction, water police, environmental (fish and game/wildlife) game wardens or conservation officers (who have full police powers and statewide jurisdiction). In Colorado, for instance, the Department of Revenue has its own investigative branch, as do many of the state-funded universities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso known as parishes and boroughs, county law enforcement is provided by sheriffs' departments or offices and county police.\\r\\n\\r\\nCounty police tend to exist only in metropolitan counties and have countywide jurisdiction. In some areas, there is a sheriff's department which only handles minor issues such as service of papers and security for the local courthouse. In other areas, there are no county police and the local sheriff is the exclusive law enforcement agency and acts as both sheriff and county police, which is more common than there being a separate county police force. County police tend to fall into three broad categories:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the Commonwealth of Virginia does not have overlapping County and City jurisdictions, whereas in the other 49 states most municipalities fall within (and share jurisdiction and many other governmental responsibilities with) a County. In Virginia, governmental power flows down from the State (or in Virginia's case, Commonwealth) directly to either a County or an Independent City. Thus, policing in Virginia is more streamlined: the County Sheriff's Office/Department or County Police Department does not overlap with an Independent City Police Department. Unincorporated Townships remain part of their parent County, but may have Town Police Departments to augment their County law enforcement. Town Police Departments are often small, and may deploy a combination of paid and nonpaid, full and part-time law enforcement officers, including auxiliary officers who typically serve as part-time, unpaid volunteers. If present, Independent City Sheriff's Offices usually follow the Restrictive model shown below for Sheriff's Departments, with limited law enforcement authority including warrant service, jail bailiff, etc. Mutual assistance compacts may exist where neighboring law enforcement agencies will assist each other, however, in addition to State (Commonwealth) law enforcement resources.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nMunicipal police range from one-officer agencies (sometimes still called the town marshal) to the 40,000 person-strong New York City Police Department. Most municipal agencies take the form (Municipality Name) Police Department. Most municipalities have their own police departments.\\r\\n\\r\\nMetropolitan departments, such as the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, have jurisdiction covering multiple communities and municipalities, often over a wide area typically share geographical boundaries within one or more cities or counties. Metropolitan departments have usually been formed by a merger between local agencies, typically several local police departments and often the local sheriff's department or office, in efforts to provide greater efficiency by centralizing command and resources and to resolve jurisdictional problems, often in communities experiencing rapid population growth and urban sprawl, or in neighboring communities too small to afford individual police departments. Some county sheriff's departments, such as the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, are contracted to provide full police services to local cities within their counties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are other types of specialist police departments with varying jurisdictions. Most of these serve special-purpose districts and are known as special district police. In some states, they serve as little more than security police, but in states such as California, special district forces are composed of fully sworn peace officers with statewide authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese agencies can be transit police, school district police, campus police, airport police, railroad police, park police or police departments responsible for protecting government property, such as the former Los Angeles General Services Police. Some agencies, such as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department, have multi-state powers. There are also some Private Police agencies, such as the Parkchester Department of Public Safety and Co-op City Department of Public Safety\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Puerto Rico Police traces back to 1837, when Spanish governor Francisco Javier de Moreda y Prieto created La Guardia Civil de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Civil Guard) to protect the lives and property of Puerto Ricans who at the time were Spanish subjects, and provide police services to the entire island, even though many municipalities maintain their own police force. The United States invaded and took possession of Puerto Rico in July 1898 as a result of the SpanishÿAmerican War and has controlled the island as a US territory since then. The Insular Police of Puerto Rico was created on February 21, 1899, under the command of Col. Frank Thacher (US Marine officer during the SpanishÿAmerican War), with an authorized strength of 313 sworn officers. As of 2009, the PRPD had over 17,292 officers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTextbooks and scholars have identified three primary police agency functions.  The following is cited from The American System of Criminal Justice, by George F. Cole and Christopher E. Smith, 2004, 10th edition, Wadsworth/Thomson Learning:\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly policing in American history was based on the ancient English common law system which relied heavily on citizen volunteers, watch groups, and a conscription system known as posse comitatus similar to the militia system, which continued until the mid-Nineteenth century.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been many initiatives to reform policing, notably since the 1960s, under President Lyndon Johnson, and several more recent efforts. Police departments across the country continue to be scandalized by instances of corruption and brutality. Reforms based on community dialogue, legal requirements and updating of police training is growing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe militarization of both rural and urban law enforcement has been attributed to the United States' involvement in wars during the 20th century, although some attribute the militarization to the more recent campaigns on drugs and terror.[6][7] Historian Charles Beard argues that cultural change during the Great Depression encouraged the militarization of law enforcement,[8] whereas Harwood argues that the creation of SWAT teams and tactical units within law enforcement during the 1960s began such trend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, the use of military equipment and tactics for community policing and for public order policing has become more widespread under the 1033 program.[9][10] The program prompted discussion among lawmakers in 2014 after unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.[11][12] President Obama introduced restrictions in 2015 on the transfer of surplus military equipment to police. In 2017, the Trump administration announced it will reinstate the program.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the broad mandates of police work, and yet having limited resources, police administrators must develop policies to prioritize and focus their activities. Some of the more controversial policies restrict, or even forbid, high-speed vehicular pursuits.  Researchers Falcone, Wells, & Weisheit's describe a historical separation of police models between small towns and larger cities. The distinction has also been defined between rural and urban policing models, which tended to function differently with separate hierarchical systems supporting each.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree styles of policing develop from a jurisdiction's socioeconomic characteristics, government organization, and choice of police administrators. According to a study by James Q. Wilson (\\"Varieties of Police Behavior\\", 1968, 1978, Harvard University Press), there were three distinct types of policing developed in his study of eight communities. Each style emphasized different police functions, and were linked to specific characteristics of the community the department served.  (Wilson's field of study was in the United States, and it is not clear if similar studies have been done for other countries with different governmental organization and laws).\\r\\n\\r\\nWilson's study applies to police behavior for the entire department, over time.  At any given time, police officers may be acting in a watchman, service, or legalistic function by nature of what they're doing at the time, or temperament, or mood. Individual officers may also be inclined to one style or another, regardless of supervisor or citizen demands.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunity-oriented policing is a shift in policing practices in the U.S. that moved away from standardization and towards a more preventative model where police actively partner with the community it serves.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nLaw enforcement officers are granted certain powers to enable them to carry out their duties. When there exists probable cause to believe that a person has committed a serious crime, a law enforcement officer can handcuff and arrest a person, who will be held in a police station or jail pending a judicial bail determination or an arraignment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe procedural use of strip searches and cavity searches by law enforcement has raised civil liberties concerns.[16][17][18]  The practice of taking an arrested person on a perp walk, often handcuffed, through a public place at some point after the arrest, creating an opportunity for the media to take photographs and video of the event, has also raised concerns.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the FBI estimated that law enforcement agencies made 13,120,947 arrests (excluding traffic violations). Of those persons arrested, 74.5% were male and 69.4 percent of all persons arrested were white, 28.0 percent were black, and the remaining 2.6 percent were of other races.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nA law enforcement officer may briefly detain a person upon reasonable suspicion of involvement in a crime but short of probable cause to arrest. Contrary to popular belief and Hollywood-style depictions in TV and movies, merely lawfully detaining a personin and of itselfdoes not deprive a person of their Fourth Amendment right against unlawful searches. Federal, state, and local laws, and individual law enforcement departmental policies govern when, where, how, and upon whom a law enforcement officer may perform a \\"pat down,\\" \\"protective search,\\" or \\"Terry frisk,\\" based on several U.S. Supreme Court decisions (including Terry v. Ohio (1968), Michigan v. Long (1983), and Maryland v. Buie (1990)):[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Terry v. Ohio, the landmark decision introducing the term \\"Terry frisk,\\" or \\"frisk,\\" to the broader public:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Our evaluation of the proper balance that has to be struck in this type of case leads us to conclude that there must be a narrowly drawn authority to permit a reasonable search for weapons for the protection of the police officer, where he has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual, regardless of whether he has probable cause to arrest the individual for a crime. The officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger (italics added).\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York City Police Department came under scrutiny in 2012 for its use of a stop-and-frisk program.[23][24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement officers may enter a house without knocking if they have \\"a reasonable suspicion\\" that announcing their presence would be dangerous or allow a suspect to destroy evidence (for example, by flushing drugs down the toilet). In addition, rules on civil asset forfeiture allow law enforcement officers to seize anything which they can plausibly claim was the proceeds of a crime. The property-owner need not be convicted of that crime; if officers find drugs in a house, they can take cash from the house and possibly the house itself. Commentators have said these rules provide an incentive for law enforcement officers to focus on drug-related crimes rather than rape and murder investigations. They also provide an incentive to arrest suspected drug-dealers inside their houses, which can be seized, and to raid stash houses after most of their drugs have been sold, when officers can seize the cash.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most states, law enforcement officers operate under the same self-defense laws as the citizens of that state. Generally, when the officer or an innocent party is at risk of serious bodily injury and/or death, lethal force is justified. Most law enforcement agencies establish a use of force continuum and list deadly force as a force of last resort. With this model, agencies try to control excessive use of force. Nonetheless, some question the number of killings by law enforcement officers, including killings of people who are unarmed, raising questions about widespread and ongoing excessive use of force.[28][29] Other non-fatal incidents and arrests have raised similar concerns.[30][31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral serious cases of police misconduct have raised questions surrounding abuse of powers by individual or groups of officers. Historical examples include the Chicago Police Department's torture of felony suspects between 1972-1991 by and under Jon Burge, Los Angeles Police Department's 1991 beating of Rodney King and late-1990s LAPD Rampart Scandal, New York City Police Department's 1970s fatal shootings of Clifford Glover (1973) and Randolph Evans (1976), the 1980s chokehold of Michael Stewart (1983), shootings of Eleanor Bumpers (1984) and Edmund Perry (1985), the stun gun torture of Mark Davidson (1985), the 1990s torture of Abner Louima and shooting of Amadou Diallo, the 2000s shootings and record-publicizing of Patrick Dorismond, and Sean Bell, Philadelphia Police Department's torture of suspects in the 1970s to improve then-mayor Frank Rizzo's reputation and Torrington, Connecticut's Tracey Thurman.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly all U.S. states and the federal government have by law adopted minimum-standard standardized training requirements for all officers with powers of arrest within the state. Many standards apply to in-service training as well as entry-level training, particularly in the use of firearms, with periodic re-certification required. These standards often comply with standards promoted by the US Department of Justice. These standards typically require a thorough background check that potential police recruits:[33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nRepeated interviews, written tests, medical examinations, physical fitness tests, comprehensive background investigations, fingerprinting, drug testing, a police oral board interview, a polygraph examination and consultation with a psychologist are common practices used to review the suitability of candidates. Recruiting in most departments is competitive, with more suitable and desirable candidates accepted over lesser ones, and failure to meet some minimum standards disqualifying a candidate entirely. Police oral boards are the most subjective part of the process and often disqualifies the biggest portion of qualified candidates.[35] Departments maintain records of past applicants under review, and refer to them in the case of either reapplication or requests between other agencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite these safeguards, some departments have at times relaxed hiring and staffing policies, sometimes in violation of the law, most often in the cases of local departments and federally funded drug task forces facing staffing shortages, attrition, and needs to quickly fill positions. This has included at times the fielding (and sometimes the arming) of uncertified officers (who may be working temporarily in what is supposed to be a provisional limited-duty status prior to certification) and the hiring of itinerant \\"gypsy cops\\", who may have histories of poor performance or misconduct in other departments.[36][37][38][39][40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice in the United States usually carry a handgun on duty. Many are required to be armed on-duty and often required to have a concealable off-duty handgun. Among the most common sidearms are models produced by Glock, Smith & Wesson, SIG Sauer, Beretta, and Heckler & Koch, usually in 9mm, .40 S&W, .357 SIG (US Secret Service and other Federal Law Enforcement agencies) or .45 ACP.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the late 1980s and early 1990s, most US police officers carried revolvers, typically in .38 Special or .357 Magnum calibers, as their primary duty weapons. At the time, Smith & Wesson, Colt, Ruger and some Taurus models were popular with police officers, most popular being the Smith & Wesson or Colt revolvers.  Since then, most agencies have switched to semiautomatic pistols. Two key events influencing many US police forces to upgrade their primary duty weapons to weapons with greater stopping power and round capacity were the 1980 Norco shootout and the 1986 FBI Miami shootout.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome police departments allow qualified officers to carry shotguns and/or semiautomatic rifles in their vehicles for additional firepower, typically to be used if a suspect is involved in an active shooter situation, or a hostage/barricade incident.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice also often carry an impact weapon - a baton, also known as a nightstick. The common nightstick and the side handle baton have been replaced in many locations by expandable batons such as the Monadnock Auto-Lock Expandable Baton or ASP baton. One advantage of the collapsible baton is that the wearer can comfortably sit in a patrol vehicle while still wearing the baton on their duty belt. The side handle night stick usually has to be removed before entering the vehicle. Many departments also use less-lethal weapons like mace, pepper spray, electroshock guns, and beanbag shotgun rounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother less lethal weapon that police officers often carry is an electroshock gun, also known as a Taser. The handheld electroshock weapon was designed to incapacitate a single person from a distance by using electric current to disrupt voluntary control of muscles. Someone struck by a Taser experiences stimulation of his or her sensory nerves and motor nerves, resulting in strong involuntary muscle contractions. Tasers do not rely only on pain compliance, except when used in Drive Stun mode, and are thus preferred by some law enforcement over non-Taser stun guns and other electronic control weapons.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost large police departments have elite SWAT units which are called in to handle situations, such as barricaded suspects, hostage situations and high-risk warrant service, that require greater force, specialized equipment, and special tactics. These units usually have submachine guns, automatic carbines or rifles, semiautomatic combat shotguns, sniper rifles, gas, smoke and flashbang grenades, and other specialized weapons and equipment at their disposal.  Some departments are equipped with armored vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nUniformed police officers are often issued body armor, typically in the form of a lightweight Level IIA, II or IIIA vest that can be worn under service shirts.  SWAT teams typically wear heavier Level III or IV tactical armored vests, often with steel or ceramic trauma plates, comparable to those worn by U.S. military personnel engaged in ground operations.  Officers trained in bomb disposal wear specialized heavy protective armor designed to protect them from the effects of an explosion when working around live ordnance. Local police foundations have initiated programs to provide law enforcement agencies with higher level vests that provide greater protection and vests for police K-9s as well.[42][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple states have pending body-worn camera legislation that require its law enforcement to be equipped with body-worn cameras when the officers are on duty. Some of these states include California, Washington, and Illinois, among others.[44] Body-worn cameras are video recording devices around three inches long that cost between $129-$900.[45] There are different body-worn camera models, but a standard body-worn camera includes an on and off switch that enables the image capturing technology to record and store data in the cloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nBody-worn cameras have become standard due to the rise of civilian complaints about police brutality across the nation.[46] Supporters argue that the use of a body-worn camera allows evidence to be viewed from an unbiased perspective. Corporations are currently working on body-worn camera models that will resolve the technology's limitations such as better audio capturing technology and battery life, to name a few. Surveillance items that can be used by law enforcement which have been scrutinized also include the automatic number plate recognition due to its similarities to mass surveillance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost American police departments are dispatched from a centralized communications center, using VHF, UHF or, more recently, digitally trunked radio transceivers mounted in their vehicles, with individual officers carrying portable handsets or ear-worn headsets for communication when away from their vehicles.  American police cars are also increasingly equipped with mobile data terminals (MDT's)or portable computers linked by radio to a network allowing them access to state department of motor vehicles information, criminal records, and other important information.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost police communications are now conducted within a regional pool of area telecommunicators or dispatchers using 9-1-1 and 9-1-1 telephone taxation. A large number of police agencies have pooled their 9-1-1 tax resources for Computer Aided Dispatching (CAD) to streamline dispatching and reporting.  CAD systems are usually linked to MDT's (see above).\\r\\n\\r\\nA variety of national, regional, state and local information systems are available to law enforcement agencies in the U.S., with differing purposes and types of information. One example is the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS),[47] an interstate justice and public safety network owned by the states supporting inquiry into state systems for criminal history, driver's license and motor vehicle registration, as well as supporting inquiry into federal systems, such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Law Enforcement Support Center, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) National Drug Pointer Index (NDPIX), and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aircraft Registry, plus the Government of Canada's Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC).[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nNLETS operates primarily through a secure private network through which each state has an interface to the network, and all agencies within the state operate through this portal. The federal and international components operate very similarly. Users include all United States and territories, Federal agencies with a justice mission, and certain international agencies. The primary operational site for the network is housed in Arizona, with a secure backup site located in the East Central U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the NLETS network, law enforcement and criminal justice agencies can access a wide range of information, from standard driver license and vehicle queries to criminal history and Interpol information.[49]  Operations consist of nearly 1.5 billion transactions a year to over 1 million PC, mobile and handheld devices in the U.S. and Canada at 45,000 user agencies, and to 1.3 million individual users.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice departments share arrest information with third-party news organizations that archive names of citizens and legal allegations in a \\"police blotter\\". However, if the allegations are dismissed in court a citizen may not petition the third-party for removal.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, federal police employed approx. 120,000 full-time law enforcement officers, authorized to make arrests and carry firearms in the United States.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2012 Bureau of Justice Statistics' Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA), found there were 17,985 state and local law enforcement agencies employing at least one full-time officer or the equivalent in part-time officers.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, state and local law enforcement agencies employed more than 1.1 million people on a full-time basis, including about 765,000 sworn personnel (defined as those with general arrest powers). Agencies also employed approximately 100,000 part-time employees, including 44,000 sworn officers.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2004 to 2008, overall full-time employment by state and local law enforcement agencies nationwide increased by about 57,000 (or 5.3%). Sworn personnel increased by about 33,000 (4.6%), and nonsworn employees by about 24,000 (6.9%). From 2004 to 2008, the number of full-time sworn personnel per 100,000 U.S. residents increased from 250 to 251.[51] From 1992 to 2008, the growth rate for civilian personnel was more than double that of sworn personnel.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal police departments were the largest employer of sworn personnel, accounting for 60% of the total. Sheriffs' offices were next, accounting for 24%. About half (49%) of all agencies employed fewer than 10 full-time officers. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of sworn personnel worked for agencies that employed 100 or more officers.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nFifteen of the 50 largest local police departments employed fewer full-time sworn personnel in 2008 than in 2004. The largest declines were in Detroit (36%), Memphis (23%), New Orleans (13%), and San Francisco (10%).[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nTen of the 50 largest local police departments reported double-digit increases in sworn personnel from 2004 to 2008. The largest increases were in Phoenix (19%), Prince George's County (Maryland) (17%), Dallas (15%), and Fort Worth (14%).[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nSalary varies widely for police officers, with most being among the top third of wage-earners, age 25 or older, nationwide.[53] In May 2012, the overall median was $56,980. The top 10% earned more than $93,450 and bottom 10% less than $33,060.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe median wages for police and detective occupations in May 2012 were as follows:[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrover Cleveland was Sheriff of Erie County New York 1871-1872\\r\\n\\r\\nTheodore Roosevelt as Police Commissioner of New York City with Jacob Riis 1894\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated:\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral:","input":"How many different police agencies are there in the us?"},{"output":"Joseph-Michel and Jacques-tienne Montgolfier","context":"A hot air balloon is a lighter than air aircraft consisting of a bag, called an envelope, which contains heated air. Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and (usually) a source of heat, in most cases an open flame. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. Unlike gas balloons, the envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air near the bottom of the envelope is at the same pressure as the surrounding air. In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric and the inlet of the balloon (closest to the burner flame) is made from a fire resistant material such as Nomex. Modern balloons have been made in all kinds of shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial, and many commercial, applications.\\r\\nThe hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying flight technology. The first untethered manned hot air balloon flight was performed by Jean-Fran?ois Pilatre de Rozier and Fran?ois Laurent d'Arlandes on November 21, 1783, in Paris, France,[1] in a balloon created by the Montgolfier brothers.[2] The first hot-air balloon flown in the Americas was launched from the Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia on January 9, 1793 by the French aeronaut Jean Pierre Blanchard.[3] Hot air balloons that can be propelled through the air rather than simply drifting with the wind are known as thermal airships.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly unmanned hot air balloons were used in China. Zhuge Liang of the Shu Han kingdom, during the Three Kingdoms era (220ÿ280 AD), used airborne lanterns for military signaling. These lanterns are known Chinese lanterns (simplified Chinese: ^]; traditional Chinese: ^]??).[4]\\r\\nThe brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-tienne Montgolfier developed a hot air balloon in Annonay, Ardeche, France, and demonstrated it publicly on September 19, 1783, making an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes. After experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals, the first balloon flight with humans aboard, a tethered flight, performed on or around October 15, 1783, by Jean-Francois pilatre de Rozier who made at least one tethered flight from the yard of the Reveillon workshop in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Later that same day, Pilatre de Rozier became the second human to ascend into the air, reaching an altitude of 26?m (85?ft), the length of the tether.[5][6] The first free flight with human passengers was made a few weeks later, on November 21, 1783.[7] King Louis XVI had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but de Rozier, along with Marquis Fran?ois d'Arlandes, petitioned successfully for the honor.[8][9][10] The first military use of a hot air balloon happened in 1794 during the battle of Fleurus, when the French used the balloon l'Entreprenant for observation.[11]\\r\\nModern hot air balloons, with an onboard heat source, were developed by Ed Yost, beginning during the 1950s; his work resulted in his first successful flight, on October 22, 1960.[12] The first modern hot air balloon to be made in the United Kingdom (UK) was the Bristol Belle, built in 1967. Presently, hot air balloons are used primarily for recreation. Hot air balloons are able to fly to extremely high altitudes. On November 26, 2005 Vijaypat Singhania set the world altitude record for highest hot air balloon flight, reaching 21,027?m (68,986?ft). He took off from downtown Mumbai, India, and landed 240?km (150?mi) south in Panchale.[13] The previous record of 19,811?m (64,997?ft) had been set by Per Lindstrand on June 6, 1988, in Plano, Texas.\\r\\nOn January 15, 1991, the 'Virgin Pacific Flyer' balloon completed the longest flight in a hot air balloon when Per Lindstrand (born in Sweden, but resident in the UK) and Richard Branson of the UK flew 7,671.91?km (4,767.10?mi) from Japan to Northern Canada. With a volume of 74 thousand cubic meters (2.6 million cubic feet), the balloon envelope was the largest ever built for a hot air craft. Designed to fly in the trans-oceanic jet streams, the Pacific Flyer recorded the fastest ground speed for a manned balloon at 245?mph (394?km/h). The longest duration record was set by Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard, Auguste Piccard's grandson; and Briton Brian Jones, flying in the Breitling Orbiter 3. It was the first nonstop trip around the world by balloon. The balloon left Chateau-d'Oex, Switzerland, on March 1, 1999, and landed at 1:02?a.m. on March 21 in the Egyptian desert 300 miles (480?km) south of Cairo. The two men exceeded distance, endurance, and time records, traveling 19 days, 21 hours, and 55 minutes. Steve Fossett, flying solo, exceeded the record for briefest time traveling around the world on 3 July 2002 on his sixth attempt,[14] in 320 h 33 min.[15] Fedor Konyukhov flew solo round the world on his first attempt in a hybrid hot-air/helium balloon from 11 to 23 July 2016[16] for a round-the world time of 272h 11m, as of 17 September 2016[update] awaiting official confirmation as the new record.[15]\\r\\nA hot air balloon for manned flight uses a single-layered, fabric gas bag (lifting \\"envelope\\"), with an opening at the bottom called the mouth or throat. Attached to the envelope is a basket, or gondola, for carrying the passengers. Mounted above the basket and centered in the mouth is the \\"burner\\", which injects a flame into the envelope, heating the air within. The heater or burner is fueled by propane, a liquefied gas stored in pressure vessels, similar to high pressure forklift cylinders.[17][18]\\r\\nModern hot air balloons are usually made of materials such as ripstop nylon or dacron (a polyester).[19]\\r\\nDuring the manufacturing process, the material is cut into panels and sewn together, along with structural load tapes that carry the weight of the gondola or basket. The individual sections, which extend from the throat to the crown (top) of the envelope, are known as gores or gore sections. Envelopes can have as few as 4 gores or as many as 24 or more.[20]\\r\\nEnvelopes often have a crown ring at their very top. This is a hoop of smooth metal, usually aluminium, and approximately 1?ft (0.30?m) in diameter. Vertical load tapes from the envelope are attached to the crown ring.\\r\\nAt the bottom of the envelope the vertical load tapes are sewn into loops that are connected to cables (one cable per load tape). These cables, often referred to as flying wires, are connected to the basket by carabiners.\\r\\nThe most common technique for sewing panels together is called the French felled, French fell, or double lap seam.[21][22][23][24] The two pieces of fabric are folded over on each other at their common edge, possibly with a load tape as well, and sewn together with two rows of parallel stitching. Other methods include a flat lap seam, in which the two pieces of fabric are held together simply with two rows of parallel stitching, and a zigzag, where parallel zigzag stitching holds a double lap of fabric.[23]\\r\\nThe fabric (or at least part of it, the top 1/3 for example) may be coated with a sealer, such as silicone or polyurethane, to make it impermeable to air.[25] It is often the degradation of this coating and the corresponding loss of impermeability that ends the effective life of an envelope, not weakening of the fabric itself. Heat, moisture, and mechanical wear-and-tear during set-up and pack-up are the primary causes of degradation. Once an envelope becomes too porous to fly, it may be retired and discarded or perhaps used as a 'rag bag': cold inflated and opened for children to run through. Products for recoating the fabric are becoming available commercially.[26]\\r\\nA range of envelope sizes is available. The smallest, one-person, basket-less balloons (called \\"Hoppers\\" or \\"Cloudhoppers\\") have as little as 600?m3 (21,000?cu?ft) of envelope volume;[27] for a perfect sphere the radius would be around 5?m (16?ft). At the other end of the scale, balloons used by commercial sightseeing operations may be able to carry well over two dozen people, with envelope volumes of up to 17,000?m3 (600,000?cu?ft).[27] The most-used size is about 2,800?m3 (99,000?cu?ft), and can carry 3 to 5 people.\\r\\nThe top of the balloon usually has a vent of some sort, enabling the pilot to release hot air to slow an ascent, start a descent, or increase the rate of descent, usually for landing. Some hot air balloons have turning vents, which are side vents that, when opened, cause the balloon to rotate. Such vents are particularly useful for balloons with rectangular baskets, to facilitate aligning the wider side of the basket for landing.[28]\\r\\nThe most common type of top vent is a disk-shaped flap of fabric called a parachute vent, invented by Tracy Barnes.[29] The fabric is connected around its edge to a set of \\"vent lines\\" that converge in the center. (The arrangement of fabric and lines roughly resembles a parachutethus the name.) These \\"vent lines\\" are themselves connected to a control line that runs to the basket. A parachute vent is opened by pulling on the control line. Once the control line is released, the pressure of the remaining hot air pushes the vent fabric back into place. A parachute vent can be opened briefly while in flight to initiate a rapid descent. (Slower descents are initiated by allowing the air in the balloon to cool naturally.) The vent is pulled open completely to collapse the balloon after landing.\\r\\nAn older, and presently less commonly used, style of top vent is called a \\"Velcro-style\\" vent. This too is a disk of fabric at the top of the balloon. However, rather than having a set of \\"vent lines\\" that can repeatedly open and close the vent, the vent is secured by \\"hook and loop\\" fasteners (such as Velcro) and is only opened at the end of the flight. Balloons equipped with a Velcro-style vent typically have a second \\"maneuvering vent\\" built into the side (as opposed to the top) of the balloon. Another common type of top design is the \\"Smart Vent,\\" which, rather than lowering a fabric disc into the envelope as in the \\"parachute\\" type, gathers the fabric together in the center of the opening. This system can theoretically be used for in-flight maneuvering, but is more commonly used only as a rapid-deflation device for use after landing, of particular value in high winds. Other designs, such as the \\"pop top\\" and \\"MultiVent\\" systems, have also attempted to address the need for rapid deflation on landing, but the parachute top remains popular as an all-around maneuvering and deflation system.\\r\\nBesides special shapes, possibly for marketing purposes, there are several variations on the traditional \\"inverted tear drop\\" shape. The simplest, often used by home builders, is a hemisphere on top of a truncated cone. More-sophisticated designs attempt to minimize the circumferential stress on the fabric, with different degrees of success depending on whether they take fabric weight and varying air density into account. This shape may be referred to as \\"natural\\".[30] Finally, some specialized balloons are designed to minimize aerodynamic drag (in the vertical direction) to improve flight performance in competitions.[31]\\r\\nBaskets are commonly made of woven wicker or rattan. These materials have proven to be sufficiently light, strong, and durable for balloon flight. Such baskets are usually rectangular or triangular in shape. They vary in size from just big enough for two people to large enough to carry thirty.[32] Larger baskets often have internal partitions for structural bracing and to compartmentalize the passengers. Small holes may be woven into the side of the basket to act as foot holds for passengers climbing in or out.[33]\\r\\nBaskets may also be made of aluminium, especially a collapsible aluminium frame with a fabric skin, to reduce weight or increase portability.[34] These may be used by pilots without a ground crew or who are attempting to set altitude, duration, or distance records. Other specialty baskets include the fully enclosed gondolas used for around-the-world attempts,[35] and baskets that consist of little more than a seat for the pilot and perhaps one passenger.\\r\\nThe burner unit gasifies liquid propane,[36] mixes it with air, ignites the mixture, and directs the flame and exhaust into the mouth of the envelope. Burners vary in power output; each will generally produce 2 to 3 MW of heat (7 to 10 million BTUs per hour), with double, triple, or quadruple burner configurations installed where more power is needed.[37][38] The pilot actuates a burner by opening a propane valve, known as a blast valve. The valve may be spring-loaded so that it closes automatically, or it may stay open until closed by the pilot. The burner has a pilot light to ignite the propane and air mixture. The pilot light may be lit by the pilot with an external device, such as a flint striker or a lighter, or with a built-in piezo electric spark.[39]\\r\\nWhere more than one burner is present, the pilot can use one or more at a time depending on the desired heat output. Each burner is characterized by a metal coil of propane tubing the flame shoots through to preheat the incoming liquid propane. The burner unit may be suspended from the mouth of the envelope, or supported rigidly over the basket. The burner unit may be mounted on a gimbal to enable the pilot to aim the flame and avoid overheating the envelope fabric. A burner may have a secondary propane valve that releases propane more slowly and thereby generates a different sound. This is called a whisper burner and is used for flight over livestock to lessen the chance of spooking them. It also generates a more yellow flame and is used for night glows because it lights up the inside of the envelope better than the primary valve.\\r\\nPropane fuel tanks are usually cylindrical pressure vessels made from aluminium, stainless steel, or titanium with a valve at one end to feed the burner and to refuel. They may have a fuel gauge and a pressure gauge. Common tank sizes are 10 (38), 15 (57), and 20 (76) US gallons (liters).[25] They may be intended for upright or horizontal use, and may be mounted inside or outside the basket.\\r\\nThe pressure necessary to force the fuel through the line to the burner may be supplied by the vapor pressure of the propane itself, if warm enough, or by the introduction of an inert gas such as nitrogen.[39] Tanks may be preheated with electrical heat tapes to produce sufficient vapor pressure for cold weather flying.[40] Warmed tanks will usually also be wrapped in an insulating blanket to preserve heat during the setup and flight.\\r\\nA balloon may be outfitted with a variety of instruments to aid the pilot. These commonly include an altimeter, a rate of climb (vertical speed) indicator known as a variometer, envelope (air) temperature, and ambient (air) temperature.[41] A GPS receiver can be useful to indicate ground speed (traditional aircraft air speed indicators would be useless) and direction.\\r\\nThe combined mass of an average system can be calculated as follows:[25]\\r\\nusing a density of 0.9486?kg/m3 for dry air heated to 210?F (99?C).\\r\\nIncreasing the air temperature inside the envelope makes it less dense than the surrounding (ambient) air. The balloon floats because of the buoyant force exerted on it. This force is the same force that acts on objects when they are in water and is described by Archimedes' principle. The amount of lift (or buoyancy) provided by a hot air balloon depends primarily upon the difference between the temperature of the air inside the envelope and the temperature of the air outside the envelope. For most envelopes made of nylon fabric, the maximum internal temperature is limited to approximately 120?C (250?F).[42]\\r\\nIt should be noted that the melting point of nylon is significantly greater than this maximum operating temperature  about 230?C (450?F)  but higher temperatures cause the strength of the nylon fabric to degrade more quickly over time. With a maximum operating temperature of 120?C (250?F), balloon envelopes can generally be flown for between 400 and 500 hours before the fabric needs to be replaced. Many balloon pilots operate their envelopes at temperatures significantly less than the maximum to extend envelope fabric life.\\r\\nThe lift generated by 100,000?ft3 (2831.7?m3) of dry air heated to various temperatures may be calculated as follows:\\r\\nThe density of air at 20?C, 68?F is about 1.2?kg/m3. The total lift for a balloon of 100,000?ft3 heated to (99?C, 210?F) would be 1595?lb, 723.5?kg. This is just enough to generate neutral buoyancy for the total system mass (not including the heated air trapped in the envelope, of course) stated in the previous section. Liftoff would require a slightly greater temperature, depending on the desired rate of climb. In reality, the air contained in the envelope is not all the same temperature, as the accompanying thermal image shows, and so these calculations are based on averages.\\r\\nFor typical atmospheric conditions (20?C, 68?F), a hot air balloon heated to (99?C, 210?F) requires about 3.91?m3 of envelope volume to lift 1?kilogram (62.5?ft3/lb). The precise amount of lift provided depends not only upon the internal temperature mentioned above, but the external temperature, altitude above sea level, and humidity of the air surrounding. On a warm day, a balloon cannot lift as much as on a cool day, because the temperature required for launch will exceed the maximum sustainable for nylon envelope fabric. Also, in the lower atmosphere, the lift provided by a hot air balloon decreases about 3% for each 1,000?meters (1% per 1,000?ft) of altitude gained.[43]\\r\\nStandard hot air balloons are known as Montgolfier balloons and rely solely on the buoyancy of hot air provided by the burner and contained by the envelope.[44] This style of balloon was developed by the Montgolfier brothers, and had its first public demonstration on 4 June 1783 with an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes, followed later that year with manned flights.[45]\\r\\nThe 1785 Rozire balloon, a type of hybrid balloon, named after its creator, Jean-Fran?ois Pilatre de Rozier, has a separate cell for a lighter than air gas (typically helium,) as well as a cone below for hot air (as is used in a hot air balloon) to heat the helium at night. Hydrogen gas was used in the very early stages of development but was quickly abandoned due to the obvious danger of introducing an open flame near the gas. All modern Roziere balloons now use helium as a lifting gas.[46]\\r\\nSolar balloons are hot air balloons that use just solar energy captured by a dark envelope to heat the air inside.[47]\\r\\nTo help ensure the safety of pilot and passengers, a hot air balloon may carry several pieces of safety equipment.\\r\\nTo relight the burner if the pilot light goes out and the optional piezo ignition fails, the pilot should have ready access to a means of backup ignition, such as a flint spark lighter. Many systems, especially those that carry passengers, have completely duplicate fuel and burner systems: two fuel tanks, connected to two separate hoses, which feed two distinct burners. This enables a safe landing in the case of a blockage somewhere in one system or if a system must be disabled because of a fuel leak.\\r\\nA fire extinguisher suitable for extinguishing propane fires is useful. Most balloons carry a 1 or 2 ?kg AB:E type fire extinguisher.\\r\\nA handling or drop line is mandatory safety equipment in many countries. This is a rope or webbing of 20ÿ30 meters in length attached to the balloon basket with a quick release connection at one end. In very calm winds the balloon pilot can throw the handling line from the balloon so that the ground crew can guide the balloon safely away from obstructions on the ground.\\r\\nFor commercial passenger balloons, a pilot restraint harness is mandatory in some countries. This consists of a hip belt and a webbing line that together allow for some movement while preventing the pilot from being ejected from the basket during a hard landing.\\r\\nFurther safety equipment may include a first-aid kit, a fire blanket and a strong rescue knife.\\r\\nAt a minimum, the pilot should wear leather or flame-retardant fiber (such as nomex) gloves, so that they may shut off a gas valve in the case of a leak, even if there is a flame present; quick action in this regard can turn a potential catastrophe into a mere inconvenience. The pilot should additionally wear flame-resistant clothing covering their arms and legs; either natural fiber, such as cotton, linen, hemp, or wool, or engineered flame-retardant fiber, such as nomex, is acceptable in this capacity. Most engineered fibers (with the exception of rayon, which is also safe to wear) are thermoplastic; many are also hydrocarbons. This makes such fabrics very much unsuitable to wear near high temperatures, since non-flame-retardant thermoplastics will melt onto the wearer, and most hydrocarbons, whether fibrous or not, are suitable to use as fuels. Natural fiber will singe rather than melt or burn readily, and flame-retardant fiber generally has a very high melting point and is intrinsically non-flammable. Many pilots also advise their passengers to wear similar protective clothing that covers their arms and legs, as well as strong shoes or boots that offer good ankle support. Finally, some balloon systems, especially those that hang the burner from the envelope instead of supporting it rigidly from the basket, require the use of helmets by the pilot and passengers.\\r\\nThe ground crew should wear gloves whenever there is a possibility of handling ropes or lines. The mass and exposed surface to air movement of a medium-sized balloon is sufficient to cause rope friction burns to the hands of anyone trying to stop or prevent movement. The ground crew should also wear sturdy shoes and at least long pants in case of the need to access a landing or landed balloon in rough or overgrown terrain.\\r\\nAs with aircraft, hot air balloons require regular maintenance to remain airworthy. As aircraft made of fabric and that lack direct horizontal control, hot air balloons may occasionally require repairs to rips or snags. While some operations, such as cleaning and drying, may be performed by the owner or pilot, other operations, such as sewing, must be performed by a qualified repair technician and recorded in the balloon's maintenance log book.\\r\\nTo ensure long life and safe operation, the envelope should be kept clean and dry. This prevents mold and mildew from forming on the fabric and abrasion from occurring during packing, transport, and unpacking due to contact with foreign particles. In the event of a landing in a wet (because of precipitation or early morning or late evening dew) or muddy location (farmer's field), the envelope should be cleaned and laid out or hung to dry.\\r\\nThe burner and fuel system must also be kept clean to ensure safe operation on demand. Damaged fuel hoses need to be replaced. Stuck or leaky valves must be repaired or replaced. The wicker basket may require occasional refinishing or repair. The skids on its bottom may require occasional replacement.\\r\\nBalloons in most parts of the world are maintained in accordance with a fixed manufacturer's maintenance schedule that includes regular (100 flight hours or 12 month) inspections, in addition to maintenance work to correct any damage. In Australia, balloons used for carrying commercial passengers must be inspected and maintained by approved workshops.[48]\\r\\nIn the case of a snag, burn, or rip in the envelope fabric, a patch may be applied or the affected panel completely replaced. Patches may be held in place with glue, tape, stitching, or a combination of these techniques. Replacing an entire panel requires the stitching around the old panel to be removed, and a new panel to be sewn in with the appropriate technique, thread, and stitch pattern.\\r\\nDepending on the size of the balloon, location, and intended use, hot air balloons and their pilots need to comply with a variety of regulations.\\r\\nAs with other aircraft in the USA, balloons must be registered (have an N-number), have an airworthiness certificate, and pass annual inspections. Balloons below a certain size (empty weight of less than 155?pounds or 70?kg including envelope, basket, burners and empty fuel tanks) can be used as an ultralight aircraft.\\r\\nIn Australia, private balloon pilots are managed by the Australian Ballooning Federation[49] and typically become members of regional hot air ballooning clubs. Commercial operations carrying fare paying passengers or charging for promotional flights must operate under an Air Operators Certificate from the Australian Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) with a nominated Chief Pilot. Pilots must have different degrees of experience before they are allowed to progress to larger balloons. Hot air balloons must be registered aircraft with CASA and are subject to regular airworthiness checks by authorised personnel.[50]\\r\\nIn the UK, the person in command must hold a valid Private Pilot's Licence issued by the Civil Aviation Authority specifically for ballooning; this is known as the PPL(B). There are two types of commercial balloon licences: CPL(B) Restricted and CPL(B) (Full). The CPL(B) Restricted is required if the pilot is undertaking work for a sponsor or being paid by an external agent to operate a balloon. The pilot can fly a sponsored balloon with everything paid for with a PPL unless asked to attend any event. Then a CPL(B) Restricted is required. The CPL(B) is required if the pilot is flying passengers for money. The balloon then needs a transport category C of A (certificate of air worthiness). If the pilot is only flying sponsor's guests, and not charging money for flying other passengers, then the pilot is exempted from holding an AOC (air operator's certificate) though a copy of it is required.[clarification needed] For passenger flying the balloon also requires a maintenance log.\\r\\nIn the United States, a pilot of a hot air balloon must have a pilot certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and it must carry the rating of \\"Lighter-than-air free balloon\\", and unless the pilot is also qualified to fly gas balloons, will also carry this limitation: \\"Limited to hot air balloons with airborne heater\\". A pilot does not need a license to fly an ultralight aircraft, but training is highly advised, and some hot air balloons meet the criteria.\\r\\nTo carry paying passengers for hire (and attend some balloon festivals), a pilot must have a commercial pilot certificate. Commercial hot air balloon pilots may also act as hot air balloon flight instructors. While most balloon pilots fly for the pure joy of floating through the air, many are able to make a living as a professional balloon pilot. Some professional pilots fly commercial passenger sightseeing flights, while others fly corporate advertising balloons.[51]\\r\\nThe largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is Cameron Balloons company of Bristol, England, which also owns Lindstrand Balloons of Oswestry, England. Cameron Balloons, Lindstrand Balloons and another English balloon manufacturing company, Thunder and Colt (since acquired by Cameron), have been innovators and developers of special shaped balloons. These hot air balloons use the same principle of lift as conventional inverted teardrop shaped balloons but often sections of the special balloon envelope shape do not contribute to the balloon's ability to stay aloft.\\r\\nThe second largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is Ultramagic company, based in Spain, which produces from 80 to 120 balloons per year. Ultramagic can produce very large balloons, such as the N-500 that accommodates as many as 27 persons in the basket, and has also produced many balloons with special shapes, as well as cold-air inflatables.\\r\\nIn the USA Aerostar International, Inc. of Sioux Falls, South Dakota was North America's largest balloon manufacturer and a close second in world manufacturing before ceasing to build balloons in January 2007. The oldest U.S. certified manufacture is now Adams Balloons out of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Firefly Balloons, formerly The Balloon Works, is a manufacturer of hot-air balloons in Statesville, North Carolina. Another manufacturer is Head Balloons, Inc. of Helen, Georgia.\\r\\nThe major manufacturers in Canada are Sundance Balloons and Fantasy Sky Promotions. Other manufacturers include Kavanagh Balloons of Australia, Schroeder Fire Balloons of Germany, and Kubicek Balloons of the Czech Republic.","input":"Who is credited with inventing the hot air balloon?"},{"output":"since at least the 1890s","context":"","input":"When did america become world's largest economy?"},{"output":"18, plus two goaltenders","context":"","input":"How many players on a hockey team nhl?"},{"output":"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos","context":"The World's Billionaires is an annual ranking by documented net worth of the world's wealthiest billionaires compiled and published in March annually by the American business magazine Forbes. The list was first published in March 1987.[1] The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated and is cited in United States dollars, based on their documented assets and accounting for debt. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists.[3] This ranking is an index of the wealthiest documented individuals, excluding and ranking against those with wealth that is not able to be completely ascertained.[4]\\r\\nIn 2018, there was a record of 2,208 people on the list, that included 259 newcomers mostly from China and the U.S.; there were 63 people under 40 and it had a record number of 256 women.[2] The average net worth of the list came in at US$4.1?billion, up US$350?million from 2017. Added together, the total net worth for 2018's billionaires was US$9.1?trillion, up from US$7.67?trillion in 2017.[2][5][6] As of 2018[update], Microsoft founder Bill Gates has topped the list 18 of the past 24 years, while Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is ranked at the top for the first time and he became the first to reach the $100 billion mark.[5]\\r\\nIn 2017, 500 of the richest people in the world became richer by $1 trillion, according to a report by Bloomberg News.[7][8] According to a 2017 Oxfam report, the top eight billionaires own as much combined wealth as \\"half the human race\\".[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year, Forbes employs a team of more than 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world's wealthiest individuals.[11] Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to Forbes, they received three types of responses?ÿ some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions.[12] Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets?ÿ land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc.?ÿ are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual's holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual's estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual's true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.[11]\\r\\nFamily fortunes dispersed over a large number of relatives are included only if those individuals' holdings are worth more than a billion dollars. However, when a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members, it is included under a single listing provided that individual is still living.[11] Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.[13]\\r\\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worth listed are snapshots taken at that time. These lists only show the top 10 wealthiest billionaires for each year.\\r\\nOn the 32nd list of world's billionaires, the gap between the top 1% and the rest of the billionaires continues to widen.[2] A record of 2,208 billionaires were in the ranking and the total wealth is $9.1 trillion, up 18% since 2017. For the first time, Jeff Bezos was listed as the top billionaire due to Amazon's rising stock price that resulted in one person's biggest one year gain in wealth since Forbes started tracking in 1987.[2] The U.S. continues to have the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 585 while China is catching up with 476 (when including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan).\\r\\nOn the 30th anniversary of the Forbes' list of the world's billionaires, for the fourth year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world.[5] In 2017, there was a record of 2,043 people on the list, which is the first time over 2,000 people were listed, that included 195 newcomers that included 76 from China and 25 from the U.S.; there were 56 people under 40 and it had a record of 227 women.[14] The number of billionaires increased 13% to 2,043 from 1,810 in 2016; this is the biggest change in over 30 years of tracking billionaires globally.[5] Added together, the total net worth for 2017's billionaires was US$7.67?trillion, up from US$7.1?trillion in 2015.[5][6] This is the first time after 12 years that Carlos Slim was not within the top five. The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 565. China has 319 (not including Hong Kong or Macau), Germany has 114, and India has the fourth most with 101; India has reached over 100 billionaires for its first time.\\r\\nFor the third year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world by Forbes's 2016 list of the world's billionaires.[15] This is the 17th time that the founder of Microsoft has claimed the top spot. Amancio Ortega rose from last year's position of number four to second.[16] Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway came in third for the second consecutive time,[17] while Mexican telecommunication mogul Carlos Slim slipped down from last year's second position to fourth. Jeff Bezos of Amazon,[18] Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook[19] and Michael Bloomberg of Bloomberg L.P.,[20] appear for the first time on the Forbes top 10 billionaires list, coming at fifth, sixth and eighth position, respectively. Zuckerberg became the youngest top 10 billionaire this year at the age of 31. Larry Ellison, Charles Koch and David Koch also slipped down from their last year's positions, with Ellison dropping to seventh from fifth and the Kochs falling to ninth position from sixth, respectively.\\r\\nIn the 29th annual Forbes list of global billionaires, a record 1,826 billionaires were named with an aggregated net worth of $7.1 trillion compared to $6.4 trillion last year. 46 of the billionaires in this list are under the age of 40. A record number of 290 people joined the list for the first time, of whom 25 percent hail from China, which produced a world-leading 71 newcomers. The United States came in second, with 57, followed by India, with 28, and Germany, with 23.[21] The United States has the largest number of billionaires with 526. Russia went down to 88 from 111 in 2014. Russia was placed behind China, Germany and India by the number of billionaires. Self-made billionaires made up the largest number of people on the list with 1,191 positions (over 65 percent) while just 230 (under 13 percent) have wealth through inheritance. The number of billionaires who inherited a portion but are still working to increase their fortunes is 405.[22]\\r\\nBill Gates was named the richest man in the world by Forbes's annual list of the world's billionaires. This was the 16th time that the founder of Microsoft claimed the top spot. Carlos Slim came in second for the second consecutive time. Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway was placed third, while Amancio Ortega of Spain, slipped down a position from last year to number four. Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle rounded off the top five. Christy Walton was the highest-ranking female at number eight. America's Evan Spiegel, co-founder of photo messaging app Snapchat became the youngest billionaire this year at the age of 24. At age 99, David Rockefeller maintained his position as the oldest billionaire to be included in the list.[23] Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, rose to number 16 with $33.4 billion. Iceland had a billionaire, Thor Bjorgolfsson, in the list after a gap of five years. Guatemala had a billionaire, Mario Lopez Estrada, for the first time in its history.[24]\\r\\nBill Gates added $9 billion to his fortune since 2013 and topped the Forbes 2014 billionaire list. He has topped the list 15 of the previous 20 years, but his previous number one ranking was in 2009.[25] Mexican telecommunication mogul Carlos Slim came in second place after being number one the previous four years. Zara founder Amancio Ortega placed third for the second consecutive year. American investor Warren Buffett was in the top five for the 20th consecutive year, placing fourth.[26] America's Christy Walton was the highest ranking woman, placing ninth overall.[1] Aliko Dangote of Nigeria became the first African ever to enter the top 25, with an estimated net worth of $25 billion.[3]\\r\\nA total of 1,645 people made the 2014 billionaire list, representing combined wealth of $6.4 trillion.[26] Of those, a record 268 were newcomers, surpassing 2008's 226 newcomers.[1] One hundred people listed in 2013 failed to make the list.[26] The number of women on the list rose to a record 172 in 2014.[1] Approximately 66 percent of the list was self-made, 13 percent achieved their wealth through inheritance alone, and 21 percent through a mixture of the two.[3]\\r\\nThe United States had 492 billionaires on the list, the most of any country.[26] The country also had the most newcomers with 50, and women with 54.[1] China had the second most billionaires with 152, while Russia was third with 111.[26] Algeria, Lithuania, Tanzania, and Uganda were all represented on the list for the first time. Turkey saw the most people drop off the list, 19, due to a period of high inflation in the country.[3]\\r\\nCarlos Slim topped the 2013 billionaire list, marking his fourth consecutive year at the top. Bill Gates remained in second, while Amancio Ortega moved up to third. Ortega's gain of $19.5 billion was the largest of anyone on the list.[27] Warren Buffett failed to make the top three for the first time since 2000, placing fourth. Diesel founder Renzo Rosso was among the top newcomers, debuting with an estimate net worth of $3 billion.[28]\\r\\nA global rise in asset prices, led Forbes editor Randall Lane to declare \\"It [was] a very good year to be a billionaire\\". However, it was not a good year to be Eike Batista who fell from seventh to 100th, suffering the largest net loss of anyone on the list.[27] Overall, net gainers outnumbered net losers by 4:1.[28]\\r\\nA record total of 1,426 people made the 2013 list, representing $5.4 trillion of assets.[29] Of those, 442 billionaires hailed from the United States.[27] The Asian-Pacific region had 386 billionaires and Europe 366. The list also featured a record number of newcomers, 210, representing 42 different countries. Sixty people from the 2012 list fell below a billion dollar of assets in 2013 and eight others from the 2012 list died. The Asia-Pacific region had the most drop-offs, with 29, followed by the United States with 16. The 2013 list featured 138 women, of which 50 came from the United States. A majority of the list (961 individuals, 67 percent) was entirely self-made; 184 (13 percent) inherited their wealth, and 281 (20 percent) achieved their fortune through a combination of inheritance and business acumen.[29]\\r\\nCarlos Slim topped the 2012 list, marking this third consecutive year at the top. Bill Gates placed second, but narrowed the gap from 2011 as Slim's fortune fell $5 billion while Gates' rose $5 billion. Warren Buffett remained in third place. Bernard Arnault of France was the top-ranking European on the list, placing fourth.[30] Ricardo Salinas Pliego was the greatest gainer in terms of dollars, adding $9.2 billion to his fortune and moving up to number 37 overall.[30] Making her debut on the list at age 27, Spanx founder Sara Blakely became the youngest self-made female billionaire ever.[31] Colombia's Alejandro Santo Domingo was the highest-ranked newcomer, inheriting a $9.5 billion stake in Santo Domingo Group from his father.[30] India's Lakshmi Mittal was the largest loser as his fortune dropped from $31.1 billion to $20.7 billion as the price of steel maker ArcelorMittal fell sharply.[30] As a result, he failed to make the top 10 for the first time since 2004 and lost his title of richest Asian to Hong Kongs Li Ka-shing.[32]\\r\\nA record total of 1,226 people made the 2012 list, representing 58 different countries. Of those, 126 were newcomers to the list and 104 were women. The United States had the greatest number of billionaires with 425. Russia had 96 people on the list, while China had 95.[30] Georgia, Morocco, and Peru were newly represented on the list. Falling stock prices in Asia contributed to 117 former billionaires falling from the list worldwide. Twelve others listed in 2011 died. Overall, net gainers (460) barely outnumbered net losers (441).[32]\\r\\nTo coincide with the release of the 2012 list, Forbes announced a new \\"Billionaire Real-Time Ticker\\" updating the wealth of the world's top fifty billionaires in real time.[30]\\r\\nIn the 25th annual Forbes list of global billionaires, Carlos Slim added $20.5 billion to his fortune, the most of anyone, and retained his number one ranking with a total fortune of $74 billion. Bill Gates remained in second place with $56 billion, while Warren Buffett was third with $50 billion. The top 10 had a combined wealth of $406 billion, up from $342 billion in 2010.[33] According to Forbes editor Kerry Dolan, \\"media and technology billionaires definitely benefited from a stronger stock market and a growing enthusiasm for all things social\\" since the 2010 list.[34] However, Nigerian commodity mogul Aliko Dangote was the greatest gainer on a percentage basis as his fortune increased 557 percent to $13.5 billion. Mark Zuckerberg was one of seven Facebook-related billionaires on the list, as he $9.5 billion to his fortune to move up to 52nd. Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz was the youngest person on the list. Aged 26, eight days younger than Zuckerberg, he debuted at number 420 with an estimated fortune of $2.7 billion. IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad was the largest loser as he saw his fortune plummet from $23 billion to $6 billion, dropping him from 11th to 162nd overall.[33]\\r\\nA record 1,210 billionaires made the 2011 list, representing a combined wealth of $4.5 trillion, up from $3.6 trillion the previous year.[35] One third of the world's billionaires, 413, came from the United States. China had the second most billionaires with 115, while Russia was third with 101. Asia moved up to 332 billionaires, passing Europe as a region for the first time since the 1990s.[33] The 2011 list included 214 newcomers and the average net worth of those on it increased to $3.7 billion.[34]\\r\\nCarlos Slim narrowly eclipsed Bill Gates to top the billionaire list for the first time. Slim saw his estimated worth surge $18.5 billion to $53.5 billion as shares of America Movil rose 35 percent. Gates' estimated wealth rose $13 billion to $53 billion, placing him second. Warren Buffett was third with $47 billion.[36] Christy Walton was the highest-ranking woman, placing 12th overall, with an inherited fortune of $22.5 billion.[37] At age 25, Mark Zuckerberg continued to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire.[12] American Isaac Perlmutter was among the newcomers with an estimated fortune of $4 billion largely acquired in his sale of Marvel Entertainment to Disney.[36]\\r\\nA total of 1,011 people made the 2010 list. The United States accounted for 403 billionaires, followed by China with 89 and Russia with 62.[37] It was the first time China, while including Hong Kong, placed second.[36] A total of 55 countries were represented on the 2010 list, including Finland and Pakistan which claimed their first billionaires.[37] Eighty-nine women made the list, but only 14 of them were self-made.[37] The combined net worth of the list was $3.6 trillion, up 50 percent from 2009's $2.4 trillion, while the average net worth was $3.5 billion.[12]\\r\\nThe 2010 list featured 164 re-entries and 97 true newcomers.[12] Asia accounted for more than 100 of the new entrants. Overall, just 12 percent of the list lost wealth since 2009, and 30 people fell off the list. Thirteen others died.[36] Of the 89 women, 12 were newcomers in 2010. Steve Forbes said the growing number of billionaires was clear sign that the world's economy was recovering from 2009's global financial crisis.[12]\\r\\nIn June 2010, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates announce The Giving Pledge that is a promise to give the majority of their wealth to philanthropy. As of 2017, the pledge has 158 signatories, but some of the signatories have since died. Most of the signers of the pledge are billionaires, and their pledges total to over $365 billion.[38]\\r\\nIn the wake of the Financial crisis of 2007ÿ2008, the world's billionaires lose $2 trillion in net worth and the list becomes 30% smaller than the previous year's list.[39]\\r\\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, four years after starting the company, joins the list at 23 to become the youngest self-made billionaire.\\r\\nFree cash used by consumers from home equity extraction, known as the real estate bubble created a total of nearly $5?trillion in 2005, contributing to economic growth worldwide.[40]\\r\\nThe founders of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, become billionaires at age 30.\\r\\nOprah Winfrey becomes the first female African American billionaire.\\r\\nAs a result of the market crash caused by the Dot-com bubble, 83 billionaires drop off the list from the previous year.\\r\\nIn 2001, BET founder Robert L. Johnson became the first ever African-American billionaire.[41]\\r\\nBill Gates became the first American to take the top spot of the World's Billionaires in 1995 with a net worth of $12.5 billion and he remained there during the Dot-com bubble's height in 1999 when Gates' fortune peaked at $90 billion. After the dot-com bubble started to collapse in 2000, his wealth dropped to $60 billion although he remained at the top of the list.\\r\\nThe dot-com bubble created the most paper wealth for some billionaires. However, once the dotcom bubble burst the new rich saw their fortunes disappear.[42] Billionaires' fortunes were hit even harder by the global financial crisis; 2009 was the first time in five years that the world had a net loss in the number of billionaires.[43] The strong performance of the financial markets and global economic recovery have erased financial assets losses. Most of the richest people in the world have seen their fortunes soar in the early 2010s.[44][45]\\r\\nSource: Forbes.[6][47][46][48]","input":"Who is the top most richest person in the world?"},{"output":"(typically between 16 and 18 years of age)","context":"In the education systems of England, Northern Ireland, Wales and some other Commonwealth countries, sixth form (sometimes referred to as Key Stage 5) represents the final 1-3 years of secondary education (high school), where students (typically between 16 and 18 years of age) prepare for their A-level (or equivalent) examinations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term sixth form describes the school years numbered 12 and 13, which are called the Lower Sixth (L6) and Upper Sixth (U6) by many schools.\\r\\nThe term survives from an earlier system when the first five years of English secondary schooling were known as forms (which would originally have been long backless benches on which rows of pupils sat in the classroom). Pupils started their first year of secondary school in the first form or first year, and this was the academic year in which pupils would normally become 12 years of age. Pupils would move up a form each year before entering the fifth form in the academic year in which they would have their sixteenth birthday. Those who stayed on at school to study for A-levels moved up into the sixth form, which was divided into the Lower Sixth and the Upper Sixth. In some private schools, the term Middle Sixth was used in place of Upper Sixth, with the latter being used for those who stayed on for an extra term to take the entrance examinations that were previously set for candidates to Oxford or Cambridge universities. Other schools described these Oxbridge examination students as being in the Seventh Form or Third Year Sixth.\\r\\nThe system was changed for the 1990ÿ1991 academic year and school years are now numbered consecutively from primary school onwards. Year 1 is the first year of primary school after Reception. The first year of secondary school (the old first form) is now known as Year 7. The Lower Sixth is now Year 12 and the Upper Sixth is Year 13. However, the term \\"Sixth Form\\" has still been retained as a vestige of the old system and is used as a collective term for Years 12 and 13. Public (fee-charging) schools, along with some state schools, tend to use the old system of numbering.\\r\\nIn some parts of the country, special sixth form colleges were introduced beginning in a particularly important phase of student life. A large proportion of English secondary schools no longer have an integral sixth form. This is mainly related to reforms in the later 20th century, where different political areas became a factor in the introduction of colleges instead of the original sixth forms. There are now numerous sixth form colleges throughout England and Wales, and in areas without these, sixth form schools and specialist further education (FE) colleges called tertiary colleges may fill the same role.\\r\\nSixth form is not compulsory in England and Wales (although from 2013 onwards, people of sixth form age must remain in some form of education or training in England only, the school leaving age remains 16 in Wales); however, university entrance normally requires at least three A2-level qualifications and perhaps one AS-level. Students usually select three or four subjects from the GCSEs they have just taken, for one \\"AS\\" year, the AS exams being taken at the end of Lower Sixth. Three subjects are then carried into the A2 year (the dropped AS being \\"cashed in\\" as a qualification) and further exams are taken at the end of that year. The marks attained in both sets of exams are converted into UCAS points, which must meet the offer made by the student's chosen university.\\r\\nIn Northern Ireland, the equivalent of Reception is \\"P1\\", and the equivalent of the English Year 1 \\"P2\\", while the first year of secondary school is known as Year 8 or first year (rather than Year 7 as in England), and following that Lower and Upper Sixth are Year 13 and Year 14 respectively.\\r\\nIn the Scottish education system, the final year of school is known as Sixth Year or S6. During this year, students typically study Advanced Higher and/or Higher courses in a wide range of subjects, taking SQA exams at the end of both S5 and S6. Pupils in Scotland may leave once they have reached the age of 16; those who reach 16 before 30?September may leave after national examinations in May, whilst those who are 16 by the end of February may leave the previous Christmas.\\r\\nIt is not essential for candidates to do a sixth year if they wish to attend a Scottish university, as they have obtained adequate Higher grades in S5 they may apply and receive acceptance, but this is conditional on being successful in the examinations. However, the vast majority of Scottish students return for S6 if they plan to attend university. Some English universities will also accept Scottish students who have obtained adequate Higher grades in S5. It was announced in December 2008 that, as from 2010, UCAS will increase the number of points awarded to those who achieve Highers and Advanced Highers.[1]\\r\\nIn some cases, particularly in independent schools, the term sixth form is also used for the last two years of secondary education. An increasing number of independent schools are offering their students the International Baccalaureate Programme.\\r\\nIn some secondary schools in Hong Kong, Jamaica, Barbados, Sierra Leone and Trinidad and Tobago, the sixth and seventh years are called Lower and Upper Sixth respectively. In India and Nepal, it is the \\"+2\\" part of the \\"10+2\\" educational system.\\r\\nIn 2009, Malaysia, which previously used Tingkatan Enam Bawah dan Atas (Lower and Upper Sixth), switched to Pra-Universiti 1 (Pre-University 1, replacing Lower Sixth) and Pra-Universiti 2 (Pre-University 2, replacing Upper Sixth) to reflect that the sixth and seventh years prepare students for university.\\r\\nSimilarly, the term sixth form is also used to define the final two years of education before entering university in Malta.\\r\\nIn Singapore, however, the equivalent of a sixth form college would be called a junior college, where pupils take their Cambridge GCE A-levels after two years. Prior to the 1990s, these two years were known as \\"Pre-University\\" (Pre-U) 1 and 2.\\r\\nIn some college preparatory schools in the United States, such as The Hill School, Woodberry Forest School, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, Kent School, Pomfret School, The Church Farm School, The Haverford School, Portsmouth Abbey School and more, sixth form refers to the final year of education prior to college. It is the equivalent of twelfth grade in the US education system.\\r\\nIn New Zealand, under the old system of Forms, Standards and Juniors, Sixth Form was the equivalent of Year 12 in today's system. Year 13 was known as Seventh Form. Australia also sometimes uses the term for Year 12, though the Australian Year 12 is equivalent to the NZ Year 13?/ Seventh Form and the UK's Upper Sixth?/ Year 13.\\r\\nIn Brunei, sixth form comprises Year 12 and 13, which may also be referred to as Lower and Upper Six. At the end of the schooling, students sit for Brunei-Cambridge GCE A Level.[2] Students may also opt to take Advanced Subsidiary Level or AS Level halfway at the end of Lower Six or halfway through Upper Six. Sixth form is not compulsory, but a preferable choice for students wishing to continue in academic studies leading to university level.","input":"How old are you when you finish sixth form?"},{"output":"approximately 300,000","context":"300-Mile International Sweepstakes (1916)\\r\\nLiberty Sweepstakes (1919)\\r\\nThe Indianapolis 500 is an automobile race held annually at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, United States, an enclave suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana. The event is held over Memorial Day weekend in late May. It is contested as part of the Verizon IndyCar Series, the top level of American Championship Car racing, an open-wheel formula colloquially known as \\"Indy Car Racing\\". The name of the race is often shortened to Indy 500.\\r\\nThe event, billed as The Greatest Spectacle in Racing, is considered part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport, which comprises three of the most prestigious motorsports events in the world, also including the Monaco Grand Prix and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The official attendance is not disclosed by Speedway management, but the permanent seating capacity is upwards of 250,000, and infield patrons raise the race-day attendance to approximately 300,000.[1]\\r\\nThe inaugural race was held in 1911 and was won by Ray Harroun. The event celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011, and the 100th running was held in 2016. Will Power is the current champion. The most successful drivers are A. J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr., and Rick Mears, each of whom have won the race four times. The active driver with the most victories is Hlio Castroneves, with three. Rick Mears holds the record for most career pole positions with six. The most successful car owner is Roger Penske, owner of Team Penske, which has 17 total wins and 17 poles.\\r\\nThe event is steeped in tradition, in pre-race ceremonies, post-race celebrations, and race procedure. The most noteworthy and most popular traditions are the 33-car field, the annual singing of \\"Back Home Again in Indiana,\\" and the victory lane bottle of milk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indianapolis 500 is held annually at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a 2.5-mile (4.0?km) oval circuit. Drivers race 200 laps, counter-clockwise around the circuit, for a distance of 500 miles (800?km). Since its inception in 1911, the race has always been scheduled on or around Memorial Day. Since 1974, the race has been specifically scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. Practice and time trials are held in the two weeks leading up to the race. The Sunday of Memorial Day weekend is widely considered one of the most important days on the motorsports calendar, as it is the day of the Indianapolis 500, Coca-Cola 600, and (currently) the Monaco Grand Prix.\\r\\nTraditionally, the field consists of 33 starters, aligned in a starting grid of eleven rows of three cars apiece. The event is contested by \\"Indy cars\\", a formula of professional-level, single-seat, open cockpit, open-wheel, purpose-built race cars. As of 2018, all entrants utilize 2.2?L V6, twin-turbocharged engines, tuned to produce a range of 550ÿ700 horsepower (410ÿ520?kW). Chevrolet and Honda are the current engine manufacturers involved in the sport. Firestone, which has a deep history in the sport, dating back to the first 500, is currently the exclusive tire provider.\\r\\nThe race is the most prestigious event of the IndyCar calendar, and one of the oldest and most important automobile races. It has been avouched to be the largest single-day sporting event in the entire world. Likewise, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway itself is regarded as the world's largest sporting facility in terms of capacity. The total purse exceeded $13 million in 2011, with over $2.5 million awarded to the winner, making it one of the richest cash prize funds in sports.\\r\\nSimilar to NASCAR's Daytona 500, the Indianapolis 500 is typically held early in the IndyCar Series season. That is unique to most sports where major events are usually at the end of the respective season. Currently the Indy 500 is the sixth event of the 17-race IndyCar schedule. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Indianapolis was often the second or third race of the season, and as late as the 1950s, it was sometimes the first championship event of the year. Due to the high prestige of the Indianapolis 500rivaling or even surpassing the season championshipit is not uncommon for some teams and drivers to concentrate heavily on preparation for the 500 during the early part of the season, and not focus fully on the championship battle until after Indy.\\r\\nThe traditional 33-car starting field at Indianapolis is larger than the fields at the other IndyCar races. The field at Indy typically consists of all of the full-time IndyCar Series entries (roughly 20ÿ22 cars), along with 10ÿ15 part-time or \\"Indy-only\\" entries. The \\"Indy-only\\" entries may be an extra car added to an existing full-time team, or a part-time team altogether that does not enter any of the other races. The \\"Indy-only\\" drivers may come from a wide range of pedigrees, but are usually experienced Indy car drivers that either lack a full-time ride, are former full-time drivers that have elected to drop down to part-time status, or occasional one-off drivers from other racing disciplines. It is not uncommon for some drivers (particularly former Indy 500 winners), to quit full-time driving during the season, but race at Indy singly for numerous years afterwards before retirement.\\r\\nDue to safety issues such as aquaplaning, the race is not held in wet conditions. In the event of a rain delay, the race will be postponed until rain showers cease, and the track is sufficiently dried. If rain falls during the race, officials can end the race and declare the results official if more than half of the scheduled distance (i.e., 101 laps) has been completed. The Indianapolis 500, as well as other IndyCar Series races, does not utilize the greenÿwhiteÿchecker finish in case of a late race yellow. The race can, and in the past has, finished under caution. However, officials may call for a late race red flag to ensure a green flag finish, an option that was used in 2014.\\r\\nThe Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex was built in 1909 as a gravel-and-tar track and hosted a smattering of small events, including ones for motorcycles.[2] The first long-distance event, in \\"fearful conditions,\\" was the 100-lap Prest-O-Lite Trophy in 1909, won by Bob Burman in a Buick.[3] Breakup of the asphalt led to two fatal accidents in the first two long-distance events (a 250?mi (400?km) and 300?mi (480?km), which was shortened to 235?mi (378?km) after two severe wrecks).[4]\\r\\nThat these spectacles had attracted 15,000 paying customers (and crowds of up to 40,000)[5] persuaded principal owner Carl G. Fisher to spend US$155,000[6] on repaving the track with 3.2 million bricks;[7] he also added a 2-foot-9-inch (0.84?m) concrete wall around the track's circumference.[6] During the 1910 Decoration Day weekend, the first events on the newly paved circuit drew 60,000 spectators; Ray Harroun won the 200-mile (320?km) Wheeler-Schebler Trophy in a Marmon.[6]\\r\\nThe crowds grew progressively smaller for the rest of the season, however, so the track owners chose to focus on a single race. They considered a 24-hour contest, in the fashion of Le Mans, or a 1,000?mi (1,600?km).[6] They instead chose a 500-mile (800?km) contest, as the estimated distance a race car could run before dark descended on the track.[8] A spectacular purse of $US25,000, equivalent to 37.615?kg (82.93?lb) of pure gold.[6] The combination allowed the track to rapidly acquire a privileged status for automobile races.\\r\\nThe first \\"500\\" was held at the Speedway on Decoration Day (as Memorial Day was known from its inception in 1868 to 1967 when Federal Law made Memorial Day the official name), May 30, 1911,[9] run to a 600-cubic-inch (9,800?cc) maximum engine size formula.[6] It saw a field of 40 starters,[6] with Harroun piloting a Marmon Model 32-based Wasp raceroutfitted with his invention, the rear view mirror.[10] Harroun (with relief from Cyrus Patschke)[11] was declared the winner, although Ralph Mulford protested the official result. Eighty thousand spectators were in attendance, and an annual tradition had been established. Many considered Harroun to be a hazard during the race, as he was the only driver in the race driving without a riding mechanic, who checked the oil pressure and let the driver know when traffic was coming.[12]\\r\\nIn 1912, the purse was raised to US$50,000.[11] The field was limited to 33 (where it remains) and a riding mechanic was made mandatory.[13] This second event was won by Joe Dawson in a National,[14] after Ralph de Palma's Mercedes broke.[11] Although the first race was won by an American driver at the wheel of an American car, European makers such as the Italian Fiat or French Peugeot companies soon developed their own vehicles to try to win the event, which they did from 1912 to 1919. The 1913 event saw a change to a 450-cubic-inch (7,400?cc) maximum engine size.[11]\\r\\nAfter World War I, the native drivers and manufacturers regained their dominance of the race. Engineer Harry Miller set himself up as the most competitive of the post-war builders.[15] His technical developments allowed him to be indirectly connected to a history of success that would last into the mid-1970s.\\r\\nFor musical entertainment prior to the start of the race, the Purdue All-American Marching Band began performing on the track near the finish line in 1927 and has been the host band of the race ever since. In 1946, American operatic tenor and car enthusiast James Melton started the tradition of singing \\"Back Home Again in Indiana\\" with the Purdue Band before the race when asked to do so on the spur of the moment by Speedway president Tony Hulman. This tradition has continued through the years, notably by actor and singer Jim Nabors from 1972 until 2014.[16] Nabors announced in 2014, citing health-related reasons, that the 2014 Indy 500 would be the last at which he would sing the song. In 2015, the a cappella group Straight No Chaser sang the song before the race, and since Nabors' retirement (and before he became the regular singer), the singing of the song is done on a rotating basis.[17]\\r\\nFollowing the European trends, engine sizes were limited to 183?cu?in (3,000?cc) during 1920ÿ1922, 122?cu?in (2,000?cc) for 1923ÿ1925, and 91?cu?in (1,490?cc) in 1926ÿ1929.[11] The 1920 race was won by Gaston Chevrolet in a Frontenac, prepared by his brothers, powered by the first eight-cylinder engine to win the 500.[11] For 1923, riding mechanics were no longer required.[18] A supercharged car, ID, first won the race in 1924.[18] In 1925, Pete DePaolo was the first to win at an average over 100?mph (160?km/h), with a speed of 101.13?mph (162.75?km/h).[11]\\r\\nIn the early 1920s, Miller built his own 3.0-liter (183 in3) engine, inspired by the Peugeot Grand Prix engine which had been serviced in his shop by Fred Offenhauser in 1914, installing it in Jimmy Murphy's Duesenberg and allowing him to win the 1922 edition of the race.[15] Miller then created his own automobiles, which shared the 'Miller' designation, which, in turn, were powered by supercharged versions of his 2.0- and 1.5-liter (122 and 91 in3) engine single-seaters, winning four more races for the engine up to 1929 (two of them, 1926 and 1928, in Miller chassis).[19] The engines powered another seven winners until 1938 (two of them, 1930 and 1932, in Miller chassis), then ran at first with stock-type motors before later being adjusted to the international 3.0-liter formula.\\r\\nAfter purchasing the Speedway in 1927, Eddie Rickenbacker prohibited supercharging and increased the displacement limit to 366?cu?in (6,000?cc), while also re-introducing the riding mechanic.[18]\\r\\nIn 1935, Miller's former employees, Fred Offenhauser and Leo Goosen, had already achieved their first win with the soon-to-become famous 4-cylinder Offenhauser or \\"Offy\\" engine. This motor was forever connected with the Brickyard's history with a to-date record total of 27 wins, in both naturally aspirated and supercharged form, and winning a likewise record-holding 18 consecutive years between 1947 and 1964.[20]\\r\\nMeanwhile, European manufacturers, gone from the Indianapolis 500 for nearly two decades, made a brief return just before World War II, with the competitive Maserati 8CTF allowing Wilbur Shaw to become the first driver to win consecutively at Indianapolis, in 1939 and 1940.[21] With the 500 having been a part of the Formula One World Drivers' Championship between 1950 and 1960,[22][23] Ferrari made a discreet appearance at the 1952 event with Alberto Ascari,[24] but European entries were few and far between during those days. Among the Formula One drivers who did drive at the speedway was five-time world champion, Argentinian Juan Manuel Fangio, though he failed to qualify for the 1958 race.\\r\\nIn fact, it was not until the Indianapolis 500 was removed from the Formula One calendar that European entries made their return. In 1963, technical innovator Colin Chapman brought his Team Lotus to Indianapolis for the first time, attracted by the large monetary prizes, far bigger than the usual at a European event. Racing a mid-engined car, Scotsman Jim Clark was second in his first attempt in 1963,[25] dominating in 1964 until suffering suspension failure on lap 47, and completely dominating the race in 1965, a victory which also interrupted the success of the Offy, and giving the 4.2-liter Ford V8 its first success at the race.[26] The following year, 1966, saw another British win, this time Graham Hill in a Lola-Ford.[27]\\r\\nThe Offenhauser engine was also paired with a European maker, McLaren, obtaining three wins for the chassis, one with the Penske team in 1972 with driver Mark Donohue,[28] and two for the McLaren works team in 1974[29] and 1976 with Johnny Rutherford.[30] This was also the last time the Offy would win a race, its competitiveness steadily decreasing until its final appearance in 1983. American drivers continued to fill the majority of entries at the Brickyard in the following years, but European technology had taken over. Starting in 1978, most chassis and engines were European, with the only American-based chassis to win during the CART era being the Wildcat and Galmer[31] (which was actually built in Bicester, England) in 1982 and 1992, respectively. Ford and Chevrolet engines were built in the UK by Cosworth and Ilmor, respectively.\\r\\nFernando Alonso was the most recent active Formula One driver to race at the Indy 500-mile race, in 2017. Prior to that, no active F1 driver had competed in the Indy 500 since 1984.\\r\\nAfter foreign cars became the norm, foreign drivers began competing in the Indianapolis 500 on a regular basis, choosing the United States as their primary base for their motor racing activities. Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi, Italian Teo Fabi, and Colombian Roberto Guerrero, were able to obtain good outings in the 1980s, as was Dutchman Arie Luyendyk. However, it was not until 1993 that reigning Formula One World Champion Nigel Mansell shocked the racing world by moving to the United States, winning the CART PPG IndyCar World Series Championship and only losing the 500 in his rookie year because of inexperience with green-flag restarts.[32] Foreign-born drivers became a regular fixture of Indianapolis in the years to follow. Despite the increase in foreign drivers commonly being associated with the CART era, it should be noted that four of the first six Indianapolis 500 winners were non-American drivers.\\r\\nThe race was originally advertised as the \\"International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race\\"[9] from 1911 to 1916. However, from its inception, the race has been widely known as the Indianapolis 500 or, more simply as \\"the 500\\". In 1919, the race was referred to as the \\"Liberty Sweepstakes\\" following WWI.[33] From 1920 to 1980, the race officially reverted to the \\"International Sweepstakes\\" moniker, as printed on the tickets and other paraphernalia, with slight variations over the years.\\r\\nFollowing WWII, the race was commonly recognized as \\"The 500\\", \\"The 500-Mile Race\\", \\"Indianapolis 500-Mile Race\\", \\"Indianapolis 500\\", or the simple form \\"Indy 500\\". Usually the ordinal (e.g. \\"50th\\") preceded it. Often the race was also advertised on the radio as the \\"Annual Memorial Day race,\\" or similar variations.\\r\\nFor the 1981 race, the name \\"65th Indianapolis 500-Mile Race\\" was officially adopted, with all references as the \\"International Sweepstakes\\" dropped. Since 1981, the race has been formally advertised in this fashion, complete with a unique annual logo with the ordinal almost always included. Around that same time, in the wake of the 1979 entry controversy, and the formation of CART, the race changed to an invitational event, rather than an Open, rendering the \\"sweepstakes\\" description inappropriate.\\r\\nFor nearly a century, the race eschewed any sort of naming rights or title sponsor, a move, though uncommon in the modern sports world, that was well received by fans. This tradition finally ended in 2016 when a presenting sponsor, PennGrade, was added for the first time. In the 21st century, the facility has also slowly added sponsorship ads on the retaining walls and infield grass. The ESPN-produced ABC telecast of the event does not recognize this sponsorship, and instead had Firestone Tires as its presenting sponsorship.[34]\\r\\nThe Borg-Warner Trophy, introduced in 1936,[35] proclaims the event as the \\"Indianapolis 500-Mile Race\\", with no reference at all to the name \\"International Sweepstakes\\".\\r\\nIn 2009, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway began a three-year-long \\"Centennial Era\\" to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the opening of the track (1909), and the 100th anniversary of the first Indy 500 (1911).[36] As a gesture to the nostalgic Centennial Era celebration (2009ÿ2011), tickets for the 2009 race donned the moniker \\"93rd 500 Mile International Sweepstakes\\".[37] It is the first time since 1980 that the \\"Sweepstakes\\" title has been used. During the month of May 2009, the ordinal (93rd) was used very sparingly, and for the first time since 1981, was not identified on the annual logo. Instead, in most instances in print, television, and radio, the race was referred to as the \\"2009 Indianapolis 500\\". Since the race was not held during the United States' participation in the two World Wars (1917ÿ1918, 1942ÿ1945), the advertised Centennial Era occurred during the 93rd to 95th runnings. To avoid confusion between the 100th anniversary, and the actual number of times the race has been run, references to the ordinal during the Centennial Era were curtailed.\\r\\nSix years later, in 2016, the race celebrated its 100th running with about 350,000 in attendance.[38]\\r\\nFemale participation of any sort at Indianapolis was discouraged and essentially banned throughout the first several decades of competition. As such, female reporters were not even allowed in the pit area until 1971.[39] There have been nine female drivers to qualify, starting with Janet Guthrie in 1977.\\r\\nSarah Fisher has competed nine times, the most of any woman. Danica Patrick led 19 laps in the 2005 race and ten laps in the 2011 race, the only times a woman has led laps during the race. Pippa Mann has raced in Indy five consecutive times between 2013 and 2017.\\r\\nFrom 1911 to 1955, the race was organized under the auspices of the AAA Contest Board. Following the 1955 Le Mans disaster, AAA dissolved the Contest Board to concentrate on its membership program aimed at the general motoring public. Speedway owner Tony Hulman founded USAC in 1956, which took over sanctioning of the race and the sport of Championship racing.[40]\\r\\nFrom 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 also counted toward the FIA's World Championship of Drivers (now synonymous with Formula One), although few drivers participated in the other races of that series. Italian driver Alberto Ascari was the only European-based driver to actually race in the 500 during its World Championship years. His appearance in 1952 in a Ferrari was also the only time a Ferrari has ever appeared in the race. Juan Manuel Fangio practiced at the track in 1958 but declined an offer to race.\\r\\nControl issues of monetary prizes and squabbles over technical regulations caused conflict in the 1970s. Soon after the death of Tony Hulman in 1977, and the loss of several key USAC officials in a 1978 plane crash, several key team owners banded together and formed CART in late 1978[41] to sanction the sport of Indy car racing.\\r\\nThe Indianapolis 500 itself, however, remained under the sanctioning control of USAC. It became the lone top-level race the body still sanctioned, as it ultimately dropped all other Indy car races (as well as their stock car division) to concentrate on sprints and midgets. For the next three years, the race was not officially recognized on the CART calendar, but the CART teams and drivers comprised the field. By 1983, an agreement was made for the USAC-sanctioned Indy 500 to be recognized on the CART calendar, and the race awarded points towards the CART championship.\\r\\nDespite the CART/USAC divide, from 1983 to 1995 the race was run in relative harmony. CART and USAC occasionally quarreled over relatively minor technical regulations, but utilized the same machines and the CART-based teams and driver comprised the bulk of the Indy 500 entries each year.\\r\\nIn 1994, Speedway owner Tony George announced plans for a new series, to be called the Indy Racing League.[42] The Indy 500 would serve as its centerpiece. Opinions varied on his motivations, with his supporters sharing his disapproval of the race's lack of status within CART, the increasing number of foreign drivers (as American drivers were gravitating towards NASCAR), and the decreasing number of ovals in the season series. Detractors accused George of throwing his weight around and using the race as leverage to gain complete control of the sport of open wheel racing in the United States.\\r\\nIn 1995, and in response to a change in schedule by the CART series that put several races in direct conflict with Indy Racing League events, George announced that 25 of the 33 starting positions at the 1996 Indy 500 would be reserved for the top 25 cars in IRL points standings (similar in practice to NASCAR's Top 35 rule introduced years later). The move effectively left only eight starting positions open to the CART-regulars that chose not to participate in the IRL races. CART's reaction was to refuse to compromise on the schedule conflicts, skip the IRL races required to accumulate the qualifying points, boycott the race,[43] and stage a competing event, the U.S. 500, on the same day at Michigan. Veteran Buddy Lazier won a competitive but crash-filled 1996 Indy 500. Two CART teams, Walker Racing and Galles Racing, competed in the Indianapolis 500 to fulfill sponsor obligations and were welcomed without incident. The U.S. 500, meanwhile, failed to garner as much interest[citation needed] and was marred by a huge crash on the pace laps that forced ten teams to use backup cars. CART would run at Gateway International Raceway a 300-mile race in ensuing years (1997ÿ1999) instead.\\r\\nFor 1997, new rules for less expensive cars and \\"production-based\\" engines were put into place. The move made it such that the IRL utilized different and incompatible equipment; no CART-based teams would enter the Indy 500 for the next three years.\\r\\nIn 2000, Target Chip Ganassi Racing, still a CART-mainstay, made the decision to cross lines and compete at Indianapolis with drivers Jimmy Vasser and Juan Pablo Montoya. On race day, Montoya dominated the event, leading 167 of the 200 laps to victory.[44] In 2001, Penske Racing returned and won the race with driver Hlio Castroneves.[45] Penske and Castroneves repeated with a win in 2002.\\r\\nBy 2003, Ganassi, Penske and Andretti Green all defected to the IRL permanently. CART went bankrupt later in the year, and its rights and infrastructure were purchased by remaining car owners, and it became the Champ Car World Series. The two series continued to operate separately through 2007. In early 2008, the two series were unified to create a single open wheel championship after a 12-year split being run under Indy Racing League/IMS controlknown as the IndyCar Series.[46]\\r\\nThe 2012 race was the return of Turbocharged engines for the first time since 1996 with the use of the Dallara DW12 chassis and 2.2 L V-6 single turbo and twin turbocharged engines.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, the Indy 500 and the World 600 (now known as the Coca-Cola 600) at Charlotte Motor Speedway were held on different days of the week. A handful of NASCAR regulars participated in both events in the same year, including Bobby Allison, Donnie Allison, Cale Yarborough, and Lee Roy Yarbrough. From 1974 to 1992, the two events were scheduled for the same day and same starting time, making participation in both impossible. A few stock car drivers during that time, namely Neil Bonnett in 1979, nevertheless still attempted to qualify at Indy, even if that meant skipping Charlotte altogether.\\r\\nFrom 1994 to 2014,[47] several NASCAR drivers were able to compete in both the Indy 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte in the same day. Since 1993, the Coca-Cola 600 has been scheduled in the evening the same day as the Indy 500. The effort has been known as \\"Double Duty\\". At the conclusion of the Indy 500, drivers would catch a helicopter directly from the Speedway to the Indianapolis International Airport. From there they would fly to Concord Regional Airport, and ride a helicopter to the NASCAR race. John Andretti, Tony Stewart, and Robby Gordon attempted the feat, with Kurt Busch being the latest in 2014. In 2001, Tony Stewart became the first driver to complete the full race distance (1,100 miles) in both races on the same day.[48]\\r\\nFor 2005, the start of Indianapolis was pushed back to 1 p.m. EDT to improve television ratings. This significantly closed the window for a driver to be able to race both events in the same day. (The race's original starting time had been set at 11 a.m. EST to 12 noon EDTbecause in 1911, race promoters estimated it would take six hours to complete the event, and they did not want the race to finish too close to suppertime. Nowadays, the race is routinely completed in under three-and-a-half hours.)\\r\\nTwo drivers, Mario Andretti and A. J. Foyt, have won the Indianapolis 500 and the Daytona 500. Foyt also won the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring, America's premier endurance races, as well as the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Foyt won Le Mans in 1967, about one month after winning his third Indy 500. Andretti won the 1978 Formula One World Championship and is a three-time Sebring winner (he also won the 6-hour version of Daytona). Indianapolis 500 winner Johnny Rutherford once won one of the Daytona 500 qualifying races. In 2010, Chip Ganassi became the first car owner to win the Daytona and Indianapolis 500s in the same year, with Jamie McMurray winning the Daytona 500 and Dario Franchitti winning the Indianapolis 500.\\r\\nIn 2010, Bruton Smith (owner of Speedway Motorsports, Inc.), offered $20,000,000 to any driver, IndyCar or NASCAR, who can win both the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day starting in 2011a feat that has never been done before. For 2011, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway moved the start time of the Indy 500 back to 12:15 PM EDT (prior to 2005, the engines started at 10:52 AM EST; under the modern schedule, engines start around 12:05 PM for a start around 12:15 PM), which re-opened the window for travel. Brad Keselowski suggested that he would consider answering the challenge in 2014.[49] It was announced on March 4, 2014, that Kurt Busch would attempt to qualify for the 2014 Indianapolis 500, driving a fifth car for the Andretti Autosport team.[50] Busch completed all 500 miles at Indy to finish sixth but dropped out of the 600 with a blown engine just past the 400-mile mark.\\r\\nTechnical specifications for the Indianapolis 500 are currently written by IndyCar. Rules are generally the same as every other IndyCar race. In the past, particularly during the era in which USAC sanctioned the Indy 500 (but CART sanctioned the other Indy car races), rules at Indy slightly differed at times. The result, for example, would be a particular chassis or engine configuration being legal at Indy, but not so at the CART-sanctioned events. This was rather commonplace in the 1980s and early 1990s, when \\"stock-block\\" engines (namely the V-6 Buick) was allotted an increased level of turbocharger boost by USAC at Indy, compared to the purpose-built V-8 quad-cam engines. While the \\"stock block\\" engines were technically legal in CART competition, they were not given the increased boost advantage, which effectively rendered them uncompetitive, and precluded their use by teams. The most famous manifestation of the USAC rules disparity was the Ilmor-built Mercedes-Benz 500I engine fielded by Roger Penske in 1994.[51]\\r\\nTeams may enter up to two machines under a given car numberthe \\"primary\\" car and a \\"backup\\" car. The backup car is identified by the letter \\"T\\". For example, the two cars for the #2 team would be numbered #2 and #2T. Both cars may be practiced during the month, but due to engine lease rules, they must share the same engine. It is not uncommon for teams to prefer their backup car, if it is deemed faster, or for other strategic reasons. Additionally, as the month wears on, a \\"T car\\" may be split off into its own entry, and reassigned a new number, or be sold to another team.\\r\\nAll cars must pass a rigorous technical inspection before receiving a sticker signifying that the car is eligible to practice. Various criteria includes minimum weight, dimensions, and approved parts, particularly safety equipment. Prior to and following qualification attempts, cars must pass another inspection. The pre-qualifying inspection is focused on safety aspects and is done on the pit lane qualifying queue. It is relatively brief, due to the time constraints of the qualifying procedure. The post-qualifying inspection is much more stringent and lengthy, and takes place in the garage area. It is to detect deviations from the performance guidelines set forth by the league, and cars can and have been fined or outright disqualified if they fail inspection.\\r\\nThroughout the years, the race has used a number of different qualifying procedures. The current four-lap (ten-mile) qualifying distance was first introduced in 1920 and has been used every year since 1939.[52]\\r\\nIn 2014, the qualifying procedure was refined, such that the pole position winner and the starting grid would be determined over two days. On the weekend before the race (Saturday and Sunday), all cars are entered into a blind draw for the qualifying order.\\r\\nFor each attempt, cars are allowed two warm-up laps. At that time, a member of the team is stationed at the north end of the main stretch. He or she must wave a green flag, signaling an attempt, or else the car will be waved off. The attempt can be waved off during any of the four laps by the team, driver, or race officials. (The series will wave off the run if it is obvious the run will not be fast enough to qualify and it is getting late in the day.) If an attempt is waved off after the run starts, the attempt counts towards the three-attempt limit and the previous time is still forfeited, unless race officials waved off the attempt because of weather.\\r\\nMany people promote and share information about the Indianapolis 500 and its memorabilia collecting.[53] The National Indy 500 Collectors Club is an independent active organization that has been dedicated to support such activities. The organization was established January 1, 1985, in Indianapolis by its founder John Blazier and includes an experienced membership available for discussion and advice on Indy 500 memorabilia trading and Indy 500 questions in general.\\r\\nThe longest-running Indy racing memorabilia show is the National Auto Racing Memorabilia Show.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Indianapolis 500 has been the subject of several films and has been referenced many times in television, movies, and other media.\\r\\nLouis Meyer requested a glass of buttermilk after winning his second Indy 500 race in 1933. After winning his third title in 1936, he requested another glass but instead received a bottle. He was captured by a photographer in the act of swigging from the bottle while holding up three fingers to signify the third win. A local dairy company executive recognized the marketing opportunity in the image and, being unaware Meyer was drinking buttermilk, offered a bottle of milk to the winners of future races. Milk has been presented each year since then, apart from 1947 to 1955. Modern drivers are offered a choice of whole, 2%, and skim.[54]\\r\\nAt the 1993 Indianapolis 500, winner Emerson Fittipaldi, who owned and operated an orange grove, notoriously drank orange juice instead of milk during the televised winner's interview. He eventually relented and also drank from the milk bottle later in the post-race ceremonies after the broadcast was over, but the public relations damage had already been done.[55] The snub led to Fittipaldi being booed at the next ChampCar race, the Milwaukee Mile, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the heart of dairy country, and by some, as late as the 2008 Indianapolis 500 in which he drove the pace car. In the 2016 Indianapolis 500, as a promotion, the track gave out commemorative bottles of milk to 100,000 attendees to toast the winner with milk after the race.[56]\\r\\nRadio coverage of the race dates back to 1922. The race has been broadcast live on the radio in its entirety by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network since 1953.\\r\\nThe Hulmans were somewhat resistant to allow live television coverage of the 500, largely to maximize gate attendance. The race was briefly televised live in 1949 and 1950 on WFBM-TV, after which the practice was discontinued. From 1964 to 1970, the race was broadcast live on closed-circuit television in theaters around the country. From 1965 through 1970, a highlighted version of the race was shown on ABC's Wide World of Sports. From 1971 through 1985, an edited same-day, tape delay broadcast of the race was shown in prime time. The race broadcast was edited down to either two or three hours in duration (including commercials).\\r\\nFrom 1986 through 2018, ABC televised the race live in its entirety. However, at the request of the Speedway, Indianapolis affiliate WRTV was required to blackout the live broadcast and carry it on tape delay in prime time to encourage local race attendance. In 2007 (the first year in which the race was carried under the ESPN on ABC branding), the race was first aired in high-definition.[57] In 2016, the IMS declared a sell-out of race tickets for the 100th running of the event, meaning that WRTV would be allowed to air the race live for the first time since 1950.[58][59]\\r\\nCoverage of time trials on ABC dates back to 1961. ABC covered time trials in various live and in tape-delayed formats from 1961 to 2008 and since 2014. ESPN (and later along with ESPN2) carried various portions of time trials from 1987 to 2008. Versus (now NBCSN) covered time trials from 2009 to 2013. Practice sessions have been streamed live online dating back to at least 2001.[60]\\r\\nIn 2019, the Indianapolis 500 will move to NBC, as part of a new three-year contract that unifies the IndyCar Series' television rights with NBC Sports (the parent division of IndyCar's current cable partner NBCSN), and replaces the package of five races broadcast by ABC with an eight-race package on NBC. The Indianapolis 500 will be one of eight races, which ended ABC's 54-year tenure as broadcaster of the race.[61][62] WTHR will be the local broadcaster of the race under this contract; the existing blackout policy is expected to continue.[63]\\r\\nCoordinates: 394741N 861404W? / ?39.79472N 86.23444W? / 39.79472; -86.23444","input":"What is the attendance of the indianapolis 500?"},{"output":"Ali Mall","context":"Ali Mall is the first major shopping mall in the Philippines.

Job creation and unemployment are affected by factors such as economic conditions, global competition, education, automation, and demographics. These factors can affect the number of workers, the duration of unemployment, and wage levels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment generally falls during periods of economic prosperity and rises during recessions, creating significant pressure on public finances as tax revenue falls and social safety net costs increase. Government spending and taxation decisions (fiscal policy) and U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate adjustments (monetary policy) are important tools for managing the unemployment rate. There may be an economic trade-off between unemployment and inflation, as policies designed to reduce unemployment can create inflationary pressure, and vice versa. The U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) has a dual mandate to achieve full employment while maintaining a low rate of inflation. The major political parties debate appropriate solutions for improving the job creation rate, with liberals arguing for more government spending and conservatives arguing for lower taxes and less regulation. Polls indicate that Americans believe job creation is the most important government priority, with not sending jobs overseas the primary solution.[4]\\r\\nUnemployment can be measured in several ways. A person is defined as unemployed in the United States if they are jobless, but have looked for work in the last four weeks and are available for work. People who are neither employed nor defined as unemployed are not included in the labor force calcualation. For example, as of September 2017, the unemployment rate in the United States was 4.2%[5] or 6.8 million people,[6] while the government's broader U-6 unemployment rate, which includes the part-time underemployed was 8.3%.[7][8] Both of these rates were below the November 2007 level that preceded the Great Recession. These figures were calculated with a civilian labor force of approximately 159.6 million people,[9] relative to a U.S. population of approximately 326 million people.[10]\\r\\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes a monthly \\"Employment Situation Summary\\" with key statistics and commentary.[11] As of January 2018, approximately 125 million people in the United States have found full-time work (at least 35 hours a week in total).[12] In contrast, there are approximately 206 million working age people (people ages 15-64) in the United States.[13] The number of job openings as of the last business day of January 2018 was 6.3 million.[14]\\r\\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has defined the basic employment concepts as follows:[16]\\r\\nEmployed persons consist of:\\r\\nFull-time employed persons work 35 hours or more, considering all jobs, while part-time employed persons work less than 35 hours.\\r\\nWho is counted as unemployed?\\r\\nWho is not in the labor force?\\r\\nDuring the 1940s, the U.S Department of Labor, specifically the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), began collecting employment information via monthly household surveys. Other data series are available back to 1912. The unemployment rate has varied from as low as 1% during World War I to as high as 25% during the Great Depression. More recently, it reached peaks of 10.8% in November 1982 and 10.0% in October 2009. Unemployment tends to rise during recessions and fall during expansions. From 1948 to 2015, unemployment averaged about 5.8%. There is always some unemployment, with persons changing jobs and new entrants to the labor force searching for jobs. This is referred to as frictional unemployment. For this reason, the Federal Reserve targets the natural rate of unemployment or NAIRU, which was around 5% in 2015. A rate of unemployment below this level would be consistent with rising inflation in theory, as a shortage of workers would bid wages (and thus prices) upward.[17]\\r\\nVarious sources summarize the number of jobs created by Presidential term. The figures may include private or public job creation or combination. The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database contains the total nonfarm employment level, a measure of private sector job creation. For President Obama, between February 2009 and December 2015, the private sector added a total of 10 million jobs.[18] The Calculated Risk blog also reported the number of private sector jobs created by Presidential term. Over 10 million jobs were created in each of President Clinton's two terms during the 1990s, by far the largest number among recent Presidents. President Reagan averaged over 7 million in each term during the 1980s, while George W. Bush had negative job creation in the 2000s. Each of these Presidents added net public sector (i.e., government) jobs, except President Obama.[19]\\r\\nThere are a variety of measures used to track the state of the U.S. labor market. Each provides insight into the factors affecting employment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides a \\"chartbook\\" displaying the major employment-related variables in the economy.[20][21] Members of the Federal Reserve also give speeches and Congressional testimony that explain their views of the economy, including the labor market.[22]\\r\\nAs of September 2017, the employment recovery relative to the November 2007 (pre-recession) level was generally complete. Variables such as the unemployment rates (U-3 and U-6) and number of employed have improved beyond their pre-recession levels. However, measures of labor force participation (even among the prime working age group), and the share of long-term unemployed were worse than pre-crisis levels. Further, the mix of jobs has shifted, with a larger share of part-time workers than pre-crisis. For example:\\r\\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve tracks a variety of labor market metrics, which affect how it sets monetary policy. One \\"dashboard\\" includes nine measures, only three of which had returned to their pre-crisis (2007) levels as of June 2014.[49][50] The Fed also publishes a \\"Labor market conditions index\\" that includes a score based on 19 other employment statistics.[51][52]\\r\\nResearch indicates recovery from financial crises can be protracted relative to typical recessions, with lengthy periods of high unemployment and substandard economic growth.[53][54] Compared against combined financial crises and recessions in other countries, the U.S. employment recovery following the 2007ÿ2009 recession was relatively fast.[55]\\r\\nEmployment trends can be analyzed by any number of demographic factors individually or in combination, such as age, gender, educational attainment, and race. A major trend underlying the analysis of employment numbers is the aging of the white workforce, which is roughly 70% of the employment total by race as of November 2016. For example, the prime working age (25ÿ54) white population declined by 4.8 million between December 2007 and November 2016, roughly 5%, while non-white populations are increasing. This is a major reason why non-white and foreign-born workers are increasing their share of the employed. However, white prime-age workers have also had larger declines in labor force participation than some non-white groups, for reasons not entirely clear. Such changes may have important political implications.[57]\\r\\nBLS statistics indicate foreign-born workers have filled jobs dis-proportionally to their share in the population.\\r\\nThere are a variety of domestic, foreign, market and government factors that impact unemployment in the United States. These may be characterized as cyclical (related to the business cycle) or structural (related to underlying economic characteristics) and include, among others:\\r\\nEmployment is both cause and response to the economic growth rate, which can be affected by both government fiscal policy (spending and tax decisions) and monetary policy (Federal Reserve action.)\\r\\nThe U.S. ran historically large annual debt increases from 2008 to 2013, adding over $1 trillion in total national debt annually from fiscal year 2008 to 2012. The deficit expanded primarily due to a severe financial crisis and recession. With a U.S. GDP of approximately $17 trillion, the spending implied by this deficit comprises a significant amount of GDP. Keynesian economics argues that when the economic growth is slow, larger budget deficits are stimulative to the economy. This is one reason why the significant deficit reduction represented by the fiscal cliff was expected to result in a recession.[84][85]\\r\\nHowever, the deficit from 2014 to 2016 was in line with historical average, meaning it was not particularly stimulative. For example, CBO reported in October 2014: \\"The federal government ran a budget deficit of $486 billion in fiscal year 2014...$195 billion less than the shortfall recorded in fiscal year 2013, and the smallest deficit recorded since 2008. Relative to the size of the economy, that deficitat an estimated 2.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)was slightly below the average experienced over the past 40 years, and 2014 was the fifth consecutive year in which the deficit declined as a percentage of GDP since peaking at 9.8 percent in 2009. By CBO's estimate, revenues were about 9 percent higher and outlays were about 1 percent higher in 2014 than they were in the previous fiscal year.\\"[86]\\r\\nAs part of the economic policy of Barack Obama, the United States Congress funded approximately $800 billion in spending and tax cuts via the February 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to stimulate the economy. Monthly job losses began slowing shortly thereafter. By March 2010, employment again began to rise. From March 2010 to September 2012, over 4.3 million jobs were added, with consecutive months of employment increases from October 2010 to December 2015. As of December 2015, employment of 143.2 million was 4.9 million above the pre-crisis peak in January 2008 of 138.3 million.[87]\\r\\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) has a dual mandate to achieve full employment while maintaining a low rate of inflation. U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate adjustments (monetary policy) are important tools for managing the unemployment rate. There may be an economic trade-off between unemployment and inflation, as policies designed to reduce unemployment can create inflationary pressure, and vice versa. Debates regarding monetary policy during 2014ÿ2015 centered on the timing and extent of interest rate increases, as a near-zero interest rate target had remained in place since the 2007ÿ2009 recession. Ultimately, the Fed decided to raise interest rates marginally in December 2015.[88] The Fed describes the type of labor market analyses it performs in making interest rate decisions in the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, its policy governing body, among other channels.[89]\\r\\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has taken significant action to stimulate the economy after the 2007ÿ2009 recession. The Fed expanded its balance sheet significantly from 2008 to 2014, meaning it essentially \\"printed money\\" to purchase large quantities of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. treasury bonds. This bids up bond prices, helping keep interest rates low, to encourage companies to borrow and invest and people to buy homes. It planned to end its quantitative easing in October 2014 but was undecided on when it might raise interest rates from near record lows. The Fed also tied its actions to its outlook for unemployment and inflation for the first time in December 2012.[90]\\r\\nLiberals typically argue for government action or partnership with the private sector to improve job creation. Typical proposals involve stimulus spending on infrastructure construction, clean energy investment, unemployment compensation, educational loan assistance, and retraining programs. Liberals historically supported labor unions and protectionist trade policies. Liberals tend to be less concerned with budget deficits and debt and have a higher tolerance for inflation or currency devaluation to improve trade competitiveness, as a weaker currency makes exports relatively less expensive. During recessions, liberals generally advocate solutions based on Keynesian economics, which argues for additional government spending when the private sector is unable or unwilling to support sufficient levels of economic growth.[91][92]\\r\\nConservatives typically argue for free market solutions, with less government restriction of the private sector. Conservatives tend to oppose stimulus spending or bailouts, letting the free market determine success and failure. Typical proposals involve deregulation and income tax rate reduction. Conservatives historically have opposed labor unions and encouraged free trade agreements. Fiscal conservatives express concern that higher budget deficits and debt damage confidence, reducing investment and spending. Conservatives argue for policies that reduce or lower inflation. Conservatives generally advocate supply-side economics.[91]\\r\\nThe affluent are much less inclined than other groups of Americans to support an active role for government in addressing high unemployment. Only 19% of the wealthy say that Washington should insure that everyone who wants to work can find a job, but 68% of the general public support that proposition. Similarly, only 8% of the rich say that the federal government should provide jobs for everyone able and willing to work who cannot find a job in private employment, but 53% of the general public thinks it should. A September 2012 survey by The Economist found those earning over $100,000 annually were twice as likely to name the budget deficit as the most important issue in deciding how they would vote than middle- or lower-income respondents. Among the general public, about 40% say unemployment is the most important issue while 25% say that the budget deficit is.[93]\\r\\nA March 2011 Gallup poll reported: \\"One in four Americans say the best way to create more jobs in the U.S. is to keep manufacturing in this country and stop sending work overseas. Americans also suggest creating jobs by increasing infrastructure work, lowering taxes, helping small businesses, and reducing government regulation.\\" Further, Gallup reported that: \\"Americans consistently say that jobs and the economy are the most important problems facing the country, with 26% citing jobs specifically as the nation's most important problem in March.\\" Republicans and Democrats agreed that bringing the jobs home was the number one solution approach, but differed on other poll questions. Republicans next highest ranked items were lowering taxes and reducing regulation, while Democrats preferred infrastructure stimulus and more help for small businesses.[4]\\r\\nFurther, U.S. sentiment on free trade has been turning more negative. An October 2010 Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll reported that: \\"[M]ore than half of those surveyed, 53%, said free-trade agreements have hurt the U.S. That is up from 46% three years ago and 32% in 1999.\\" Among those earning $75,000 or more, 50% now say free-trade pacts have hurt the U.S., up from 24% who said the same in 1999. Across party lines, income, and job type, 76ÿ95% of Americans surveyed agreed that \\"outsourcing of production and manufacturing work to foreign countries is a reason the U.S. economy is struggling and more people aren't being hired\\".[94]\\r\\nThe Pew Center reported poll results in August 2012: \\"Fully 85% of self-described middle-class adults say it is more difficult now than it was a decade ago for middle-class people to maintain their standard of living. Of those who feel this way, 62% say \\"a lot\\" of the blame lies with Congress, while 54% say the same about banks and financial institutions, 47% about large corporations, 44% about the Bush administration, 39% about foreign competition and 34% about the Obama administration.\\"[95]\\r\\nThe debate around the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), the approximately $800 billion stimulus bill passed due to the subprime mortgage crisis, highlighted these views. Democrats generally advocated the liberal position and Republicans advocated the conservative position. Republican pressure reduced the overall size of the stimulus while increasing the ratio of tax cuts in the law.\\r\\nThese historical positions were also expressed during the debate around the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which authorized the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), an approximately $700 billion bailout package (later reduced to $430 billion) for the banking industry. The initial attempt to pass the bill failed in the House of Representatives due primarily to Republican opposition.[96] Following a significant drop in the stock market and pressure from a variety of sources, a second vote passed the bill in the House.\\r\\nSenator Dick Durbin proposed a bill in 2010 called the \\"Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act\\" that would have reduced tax advantages from relocating U.S. plants abroad and limited the ability to defer profits earned overseas. However, the bill was stalled in the Senate primarily due to Republican opposition. It was supported by the AFL-CIO but opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.[97][98]\\r\\nThe Congressional Research Service summarized the bill as follows: \\"Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring ActAmends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) exempt from employment taxes for a 24-month period employers who hire an employee who replaces another employee who is not a citizen or permanent resident of the United States and who performs similar duties overseas; (2) deny any tax deduction, deduction for loss, or tax credit for the cost of an American jobs offshoring transaction (defined as any transaction in which a taxpayer reduces or eliminates the operation of a trade or business in connection with the start-up or expansion of such trade or business outside the United States); and (3) eliminate the deferral of tax on income of a controlled foreign corporation attributable to property imported into the United States by such corporation or a related person, except for property exported before substantial use in the United States and for agricultural commodities not grown in the United States in commercially marketable quantities.\\"[99]\\r\\nPresident Barack Obama proposed the American Jobs Act in September 2011, which included a variety of tax cuts and spending programs to stimulate job creation. The White House provided a fact sheet which summarized the key provisions of the $447 billion bill.[100] However, neither the House nor the Senate has passed the legislation as of December 2012. President Obama stated in October 2011: \\"In the coming days, members of Congress will have to take a stand on whether they believe we should put teachers, construction workers, police officers and firefighters back on the job...They'll get a vote on whether they believe we should protect tax breaks for small business owners and middle-class Americans, or whether we should protect tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.\\"[101]\\r\\nDuring 2012, there was significant debate regarding approximately $560 billion in tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to go into effect in 2013, which would reduce the 2013 budget deficit roughly in half. Critics argued that with an employment crisis, such fiscal austerity was premature and misguided.[102] The Congressional Budget Office projected that such sharp deficit reduction would likely cause the U.S. to enter recession in 2013, with the unemployment rate rising to 9% versus approximately 8% in 2012, costing over 1 million jobs.[84][85] The fiscal cliff was partially addressed by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\\r\\nIt is unclear whether lowering marginal income tax rates boosts job growth, or whether increasing tax rates slows job creation. This is due to many other variables that impact job creation. Economic theory suggests that (other things equal) tax cuts are a form of stimulus (they increase the budget deficit)[103] and therefore create jobs, much like spending. However, tax cuts as a rule have less impact per additional deficit dollar than spending, as a portion of tax cuts can be saved rather than spent. Since income taxes are primarily paid by higher income taxpayers (the top 1% pay roughly half of them) and these taxpayers tend to save a higher portion of any incremental dollars returned to them via tax cuts than lower income taxpayers, income tax cuts are a less effective form of stimulus than payroll tax cuts, infrastructure investment, and unemployment compensation.[104][105]\\r\\nOne study indicated that tax cuts do create employment growth, particularly tax cuts for the lower earners.[106] However, the historical record indicates that marginal income tax rate changes have little impact on job creation, economic growth or employment.[107][108][109]\\r\\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) wrote in March 2009: \\"Small business employment rose by an average of 2.3 percent (756,000 jobs) per year during the Clinton years, when tax rates for high-income filers were set at very similar levels to those that would be reinstated under President Obama's budget. But during the Bush years, when the rates were lower, employment rose by just 1.0 percent (367,000 jobs).\\"[111] CBPP reported in September 2011 that both employment and GDP grew faster in the seven-year period following President Clinton's income tax rate increase of 1993, than a similar period after the Bush tax cuts of 2001.[112]\\r\\nConservatives typically argue for lower U.S. tax income rates, arguing that it would encourage companies to hire more workers. Liberals have proposed legislation to tax corporations that offshore jobs and to limit corporate tax expenditures.\\r\\nU.S. corporate after-tax profits were at record levels during 2012 while corporate tax revenue was below its historical average relative to GDP. For example, U.S. corporate after-tax profits were at record levels during the third quarter of 2012, at an annualized $1.75 trillion.[113] U.S. corporations paid approximately 1.2% GDP in taxes during 2011. This was below the 2.7% GDP level in 2007 pre-crisis and below the 1.8% historical average for the 1990ÿ2011 period.[114] In comparing corporate taxes, the Congressional Budget Office found in 2005 that the top statutory tax rate was the third highest among OECD countries behind Japan and Germany. However, the U.S. ranked 27th lowest of 30 OECD countries in its collection of corporate taxes relative to GDP, at 1.8% vs. the average 2.5%.[115]\\r\\nA variety of options for creating jobs exist, but these are strongly debated and often have tradeoffs in terms of additional government debt, adverse environmental impact, and impact on corporate profitability.[116] Examples include infrastructure investment, tax reform, healthcare cost reduction, energy policy and carbon price certainty, reducing the cost to hire employees, education and training, deregulation, and trade policy. Authors Bittle & Johnson of Public agenda explained the pros and cons of 14 job creation arguments frequently discussed, several of which are summarized below by topic. These are hotly debated by experts from across the political spectrum.[117]\\r\\nMany experts advocate infrastructure investment, such as building roads and bridges and upgrading the electricity grid. Such investments have historically created or sustained millions of jobs, with the offset to higher state and federal budget deficits. In the wake of the 2008ÿ2009 recession, there were over 2 million fewer employed housing construction workers.[117] The American Society of Civil Engineers rated U.S. infrastructure a \\"D+\\" on their scorecard for 2013, identifying an estimated $3.6 trillion in investment ideas by 2020.[118]\\r\\nCBO estimated in November 2011 that increased investment in infrastructure would create between 1 and 6 jobs per $1 million invested; in other words, a $100 billion investment would generate between 100,000 and 600,000 additional jobs. President Obama proposed the American Jobs Act in 2011, which included infrastructure investment and tax breaks offset by tax increases on high income earners.[119] However, it did not receive sufficient support in the Senate to receive a floor vote. During late 2015, the House and Senate, in rare bipartisan form, passed the largest infrastructure package in a decade, costing $305 billion over five years, less than the $478 billion in Obama's initial request. He signed the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act into law in December 2015.[120]\\r\\nLowering the costs of workers also encourages employers to hire more. This can be done via reducing existing Social Security or Medicare payroll taxes or by specific tax incentives for hiring additional workers. CBO estimated in 2011 that reducing employers' payroll taxes (especially if limited to firms that increase their payroll), increasing aid to the unemployed, and providing additional refundable tax credits to lower-income households, would generate more jobs per dollar of investment than infrastructure.[121]\\r\\nPresident Obama reduced the Social Security payroll tax on workers during the 2011ÿ2012 period, which added an estimated $100 billion to the deficit while leaving these funds with consumers to spend. The U.S. corporate tax rate is among the highest in the world, although U.S. corporations pay among the lowest amount relative to GDP due to loopholes. Reducing the rate and eliminating loopholes may make U.S. businesses more competitive, but may also add to the deficit.[117] The Tax Policy Center estimated during 2012 that reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% would add $1 trillion to the debt over a decade, for example.[122]\\r\\nBusinesses are faced with paying the significant and rising healthcare costs of their employees. Many other countries do not burden businesses, but instead tax workers who pay the government for their healthcare. This significantly reduces the cost of hiring and maintaining the work force.[117]\\r\\nVarious studies place the cost of environmental regulations in the thousands of dollars per employee. Americans are split on whether protecting the environment or economic growth is a higher priority. Regulations that would add costs to petroleum and coal may slow the economy, although they would provide incentives for clean energy investment by addressing regulatory uncertainty regarding the price of carbon.[117]\\r\\nPresident Obama advocated a series of clean energy policies during June 2013. These included: Reducing carbon pollution from power plants; Continue expanding usage of clean energy; raising fuel economy standards; and energy conservation through more energy-efficient homes and businesses.[123]\\r\\nRaising the minimum wage would provide households with more money to spend, in an era with record corporate profits and a reluctance of corporations to invest. Critics argue raising employment costs deters hiring. During 2009, the minimum wage was $7.25 per hour, or $15,000 per year, below poverty level for some families.[117] The New York Times editorial board wrote in August 2013: \\"As measured by the federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, low-paid work in America is lower paid today than at any time in modern memory. If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation or average wages over the past nearly 50 years, it would be about $10 an hour; if it had kept pace with the growth in average labor productivity, it would be about $17 an hour.\\"[124]\\r\\nPresident Obama advocated raising the minimum wage during February 2013: \\"The President is calling on Congress to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 in stages by the end of 2015 and index it to inflation thereafter, which would directly boost wages for 15 million workers and reduce poverty and inequality...A range of economic studies show that modestly raising the minimum wage increases earnings and reduces poverty without jeopardizing employment. In fact, leading economists like Lawrence Katz, Richard Freeman, and Laura Tyson and businesses like Costco, Wal-Mart, and Stride Rite have supported past increases to the minimum wage, in part because increasing worker productivity and purchasing power for consumers will also help the overall economy.\\"[125]\\r\\nThe Economist wrote in December 2013: \\"A minimum wage, providing it is not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs...America's federal minimum wage, at 38% of median income, is one of the rich world's lowest. Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none finds any serious damage.\\"[126]\\r\\nThe U.S. minimum wage was last raised to $7.25 per hour in July 2009.[127] As of December 2013, there were 21 states with minimum wages above the Federal minimum, with the State of Washington the highest at $9.32. Ten states index their minimum wage to inflation.[128]\\r\\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour between 2014 and 2016 would reduce employment by an estimated 500,000 jobs, while about 16.5 million workers would have higher pay. A smaller increase to $9.00 per hour would reduce employment by 100,000, while about 7.6 million workers would have higher pay.[129]\\r\\nRegulatory costs on business start-ups and going concerns are significant. Requiring laws to have sunset provisions (end-dates) would help ensure only worthwhile regulations are renewed. New businesses account for about one-fifth of new jobs added. However, the number of new businesses starting each year dropped by 17% after the recession. Inc. magazine published 16 ideas to encourage new startups, including cutting red tape, approving micro-loans, allowing more immigration, and addressing tax uncertainty.[117]\\r\\nEducation policy reform could make higher education more affordable and more attuned to job needs. Unemployment is considerably lower for those with a college education. However, college is increasingly unaffordable. Providing loans contingent on degrees focused on fields with worker shortages such as healthcare and accounting would address structural workforce imbalances (i.e., a skills mismatch).[117] Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen stated in 2014: \\"Public funding of education is another way that governments can help offset the advantages some households have in resources available for children. One of the most consequential examples is early childhood education. Research shows that children from lower-income households who get good-quality pre-Kindergarten education are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college as well as hold a job and have higher earnings, and they are less likely to be incarcerated or receive public assistance.\\"[130]\\r\\nIncome inequality, expressed by wage stagnation for middle- and lower-income families coupled with a shift in income growth to the top earners, can adversely affect economic growth, as wealthier families tend to save more. The quality or pay of the job matters, not just creating more jobs. The union movement has declined considerably, one factor contributing to more income inequality and off-shoring. Reinvigorating the labor movement could help create more higher-paying jobs, shifting some of the economic pie back to workers from owners. However, by raising employment costs, employers may choose to hire fewer workers.[117]\\r\\nCreating a level playing field with trading partners could help create more jobs in the U.S. Wage and living standard differentials and currency manipulation can make \\"free trade\\" something other than \\"fair trade.\\" Requiring countries to allow their currencies to float freely on international markets would reduce significant trade deficits, adding jobs in developed countries such as the U.S. and Western Europe.[117]\\r\\nCBO reported several options for addressing long-term unemployment during February 2012. Two short-term options included policies to: 1) Reduce the marginal cost to businesses of adding employees; and 2) Tax policies targeted towards people most likely to spend the additional income, mainly those with lower income. Over the long-run, structural reforms such as programs to facilitate re-training workers or education assistance would be helpful.[132]\\r\\nPresident Obama established the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in 2009. The Council released an interim report with a series of recommendations in October 2011. The report included five major initiatives to increase employment while improving competitiveness:\\r\\nAnalyzing the true state of the U.S. labor market is very complex and a challenge for leading economists, who may arrive at different conclusions. For example, the main gauge, the unemployment rate, can be falling (a positive sign) while the labor force participation rate is falling as well (a negative sign). Further, the reasons for persons leaving the labor force may not be clear, such as aging (more people retiring) or because they are discouraged and have stopped looking for work.[134] The extent to which persons are not fully utilizing their skills is also difficult to determine when measuring the level of underemployment.[135]\\r\\nA rough comparison of September 2014 (when the unemployment rate was 5.9%) versus October 2009 (when the unemployment rate peaked at 10.0%) helps illustrate the analytical challenge. The civilian population increased by roughly 10 million during that time, with the labor force increasing by about 2 million and those not in the labor force increasing by about 8 million. However, the 2 million increase in the labor force represents the net of an 8 million increase in those employed, partially offset by a 6 million decline in those unemployed. So is the primary cause of improvement in the unemployment rate due to: a) increased employment of 8 million; or b) the increase in those not in the workforce, also 8 million? Did the 6 million fewer unemployed obtain jobs or leave the workforce?\\r\\nCBO issued a report in February 2014 analyzing the causes for the slow labor market recovery following the 2007ÿ2009 recession. CBO listed several major causes:\\r\\nOne method of analyzing the impact of recessions on employment is to measure the period of time it takes to return to the pre-recession employment peak. By this measure, the 2008ÿ2009 recession was considerably worse than the five other U.S. recessions from 1970 to present. By May 2013, U.S. employment had reached 98% of its pre-recession peak after approximately 60 months.[137] Employment recovery following a combined recession and financial crisis tends to be much longer than a typical recession. For example, it took Norway 8.5 years to return to its pre-recession peak employment after its 1987 financial crisis and it took Sweden 17.8 years after its 1991 financial crisis. The U.S. is recovering considerably faster than either of these countries.[54]\\r\\nThe ratio of full-time workers was 86.5% in January 1968 and hit a historical low of 79.9% in January 2010. There is a long-term trend of gradual reduction in the share of full-time workers since 1970, with recessions resulting in a decline in the full-time share of the workforce faster than the overall trend, with partial reversal during recovery periods. For example, as a result of the 2007ÿ2009 recession, the ratio of full-time employed to total employed fell from 83.1% in December 2007 to a trough of 79.9% in January 2010, before steadily rising to 81.6% by April 2016. Stated another way, the share of part-time employed to total employed rose from 16.9% in December 2007 to a peak of 20.1% in January 2010, before steadily falling to 18.4% in April 2016.[44]\\r\\nThere is a trend towards more workers in alternative (part-time or contract) work arrangements rather than full-time; the percentage of workers in such arrangements rose from 10.1% in 2005 to 15.8% in late 2015. This implies all of the net employment growth in the U.S. economy (9.1 million jobs between 2005 and 2015) occurred in alternative work arrangements, while the number in traditional jobs slightly declined.[47][82]\\r\\nEstimates vary for the number of jobs that must be created to absorb the inflow of persons into the labor force, to maintain a given rate of unemployment. This number is significantly affected by demographics and population growth. For example, economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson estimated this figure at 125,000 jobs per month during 2011.[138]\\r\\nEconomist Paul Krugman estimated it around 90,000 during 2012, mentioning also it used to be higher.[139] One method of calculating this figure follows, using data as of September 2012: U.S. population 314,484,000 x 0.90% annual population growth x 63% of population is working age x 63% work force participation rate / 12 months per year = 93,614 jobs/month. This approximates the Krugman figure.\\r\\nWells Fargo economists estimated the figure around 150,000 in January 2013: \\"Over the past three months, labor force participation has averaged 63.7 percent, the same as the average for 2012. If the participation rate holds steady, how many new jobs are needed to lower the unemployment rate? The steady employment gains in recent months suggest a rough answer. The unemployment rate has been 7.9 percent, 7.8 percent and 7.8 percent for the past three months, while the labor force participation rate has been 63.8 percent, 63.6 percent and 63.6 percent. Meanwhile, job gains have averaged 151,000. Therefore, it appears that the magic number is something above 151,000 jobs per month to lower the unemployment rate.\\"[140] Reuters reported a figure of 250,000 in February 2013, stating sustained job creation at this level would be needed to \\"significantly reduce the ranks of unemployed.\\"[141]\\r\\nFederal Reserve analysts estimated this figure around 80,000 in June 2013: \\"According to our analysis, job growth of more than about 80,000 jobs per month would put downward pressure on the unemployment rate, down significantly from 150,000 to 200,000 during the 1980s and 1990s. We expect this trend to fall to around 35,000 jobs per month from 2016 through the remainder of the decade.\\"[142]\\r\\nDuring the 41 months from January 2010 to May 2013, there were 19 months where the unemployment rate declined. On average, 179,000 jobs were created in those months. The median job creation during those months was 166,000.[143]\\r\\nThe U.S. civilian labor force was approximately 155 million people during October 2012.[9] This was the world's third largest, behind China (795.5 million) and India (487.6 million). The entire European Union employed 228.3 million.[144]\\r\\nThe number of people receiving Social Security disability benefits (SSDI) increased from 7.1 million in December 2007 to 8.7 million in April 2012, a 22% increase. Recipients are excluded from the labor force. Economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley estimated this explained as much as 0.5 of the 2.0 percentage point decline in the U.S. labor-force participation rate during the period.[145]\\r\\nUnemployment can have adverse health effects. One study indicated that a 1% increase in the unemployment rate can increase mortality among working-aged males by 6%. Similar effects were not noted for women or the elderly, who had lower workforce attachment. The mortality increase was mainly driven by circulatory health issues (e.g., heart attacks).[146] Another study concluded that: \\"Losing a job because of an establishment closure increased the odds of fair or poor health by 54%, and among respondents with no preexisting health conditions, it increased the odds of a new likely health condition by 83%. This suggests that there are true health costs to job loss, beyond sicker people being more likely to lose their jobs.\\"[147] Extended job loss can add the equivalent of ten years to a persons age.[148]\\r\\nStudies have also indicated that worsening economic conditions can be associated with lower mortality across the entire economy, with slightly lower mortality in the much larger employed group offsetting higher mortality in the unemployed group. For example, recessions might include fewer drivers on the road, reducing traffic fatalities and pollution.[148]\\r\\nCBO estimated in December 2015 that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known colloquially as \\"Obamacare\\") would reduce the labor supply by approximately 2 million full-time worker equivalents (measured as a combination of persons and hours worked) by 2025, relative to a baseline without the law. This is driven by the law's health insurance coverage expansions (e.g., subsidies and Medicaid expansion) plus taxes and penalties. With access to individual marketplaces, fewer persons are dependent on health insurance offered by employers.[149]\\r\\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on October 24, 2017 its projections of job growth by industry and job type over the 2016ÿ2026 period. Healthcare was the industry expected to add the most jobs, driven by demand from an aging population. The top three occupations were: personal care aides with 754,000 jobs added or a 37% increase; home health aids with 425,600 or 47%; and software developers at 253,400 or 30.5%.[150]\\r\\nBLS also reported that: \\"About 9 out of 10 new jobs are projected to be added in the service-providing sector from 2016 to 2026, resulting in more than 10.5 million new jobs, or 0.8 percent annual growth. The goods-producing sector is expected to increase by 219,000 jobs, growing at a rate of 0.1 percent per year over the projections decade.\\" BLS predicted that manufacturing jobs would decline by over 700,000 over that period.[150]\\r\\nU.S. employment statistics are reported by government and private primary sources monthly, which are widely quoted in the news media. These sources use a variety of sampling techniques that yield different measures.\\r\\nSeveral secondary sources also interpret the primary data released.\\r\\nThe FRED database contains a variety of employment statistics organized as data series. It can be used to generate charts or download historical information. Data series include labor force, employment, unemployment, labor force participation, etc. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also releases employment statistics. Some popular data series include:\\r\\nJob creation in the U.S. is typically measured by changes in the \\"Total Non-Farm\\" employees.\\r\\nFRED has gathered many of the employment statistics on one page for easy access:\\r\\nThe Congressional Budget Office provides an unemployment rate forecast in its long term budget outlook. During August 2012, it projected that the unemployment rate would be 8.8% in 2013 and 8.7% in 2014. CBO projected the rate would then begin falling steadily to 5.5% by 2018 and remain around that level through 2022. This forecast assumes annual real GDP growth will exceed 3% between 2014 and 2018.[154] During December 2012, Wells Fargo Economics forecast that the unemployment rate would be 7.8% in 2013 and 7.6% in 2014. This forecast assumes real GDP growth would be 1.4% in 2013 and 2.5% in 2014.[155]\\r\\nThe Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) prepares an annual report on those petitioning for trade adjustment assistance, due to jobs lost from international trade. This represents a fraction of jobs actually off-shored and does not include jobs that are placed overseas initially or the collateral impact on surrounding businesses when, for example, a manufacturing plant moves overseas. During 2011, there were 98,379 workers covered by petitions filed with ETA.[156] The figure was 280,873 in 2010,[157] 201,053 in 2009 and 126,633 in 2008.[158]","input":"When did the us have the highest unemployment rate?"},{"output":"2 June 1967","context":"","input":"When was sergeant pepper released in the us?"},{"output":"Raleigh","context":"The North Carolina State Capitol is the former seat of the legislature of the U.S. state of North Carolina. Currently housing the offices of the Governor of North Carolina, it is located in the state capital of Raleigh on Union Square at One East Edenton Street.

Often credited solely to that team, the design of the capitol was actually the result of a sequence of work by William Nichols, Sr. and his son William Nichols, Jr., Town and Davis, and then David Paton.[5] The Capitol housed the entire state government until 1888, and the North Carolina General Assembly met in the capitol building until 1961.

The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. The Warriors play their home games at the Oracle Arena in Oakland. The Warriors have reached ten NBA Finals, winning six NBA championships in 1947,[b] 1956, 1975, 2015, 2017, and 2018. Golden State's six NBA championships are tied for third-most in NBA history with the Chicago Bulls, and behind only the Boston Celtics (17) and Los Angeles Lakers (16).\\r\\nThe team was established in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a founding member of the Basketball Association of America (BAA). In 1962, the franchise relocated to the Bay Area and was renamed the San Francisco Warriors. In 1971, the team changed its geographic moniker to Golden State, California's state nickname.[7][c] The team is nicknamed the Dubs as a shortening of \\"W's\\".[8][9]\\r\\nWilt Chamberlain and Stephen Curry have both been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player while playing for the Warriors, for a total of three MVP awards. 18 Hall of Famers have played for the Warriors, while four have coached the team. Golden State holds the NBA records for best regular season with 73ÿ9 and most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined) with 88 in 2015ÿ16, as well as best postseason with 16ÿ1 (.941 winning percentage) in 2016ÿ17.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors, a charter member of the Basketball Association of America. They were owned by Peter A. Tyrrell, who also owned the Philadelphia Rockets of the American Hockey League.[10] Tyrrell hired Eddie Gottlieb, a longtime basketball promoter in the Philadelphia area, as coach and general manager.[11] The owners named the team after the Philadelphia Warriors, an old basketball team who played in the American Basketball League in 1925.[12]\\r\\nLed by early scoring sensation Joe Fulks, the team won the championship in the league's inaugural 1946ÿ47 season by defeating the Chicago Stags, four games to one. The NBA, which was created by a 1949 merger, officially recognizes that as its own first championship.[b] Gottlieb bought the team in 1951.\\r\\nThe Warriors won its next championship in Philadelphia in the 1955ÿ56 season, defeating the Fort Wayne Pistons four games to one. The Warrior stars of this era were future Hall of Famers Paul Arizin, Tom Gola and Neil Johnston. In 1959, the team signed draft pick Wilt Chamberlain. Known as \\"Wilt the Stilt\\", he led the team in scoring six times, quickly began shattering NBA scoring records and changed the NBA style of play forever. On March 2, 1962, in a Warrior \\"home\\" game played on a neutral court in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Chamberlain scored 100 points against the New York Knicks, a single-game record the NBA ranks among its finest moments.[13]\\r\\nIn 1962, Franklin Mieuli purchased the majority shares of the team and relocated the franchise to the San Francisco Bay Area, renaming them the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors played most of their home games at the Cow Palace in Daly City (the facility lies just south of the San Francisco city limits) from 1962 to 1964 and the San Francisco Civic Auditorium from 1964 to 1966, though occasionally playing home games in nearby cities such as Oakland and San Jose.\\r\\nPrior to the 1963ÿ64 NBA season, the Warriors drafted big man Nate Thurmond to go along with Chamberlain. The Warriors won the Western Division crown that season, but lost the 1964 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics, four games to one. In the 1964ÿ65 season, the Warriors traded Chamberlain to the Philadelphia 76ers for Connie Dierking, Lee Shaffer, Paul Neumann and $150,000 and won only 17 games. In 1965, they drafted Rick Barry in the first round who went on to become NBA Rookie of the Year that season and then led the Warriors to the NBA finals in the 1966ÿ67 season, losing (four games to two) to Chamberlain's new team that had replaced the Warriors in Philadelphia, the 76ers.\\r\\nAngered by management's failure to pay him certain incentive bonuses he felt were due him, Barry sat out the 1967ÿ68 season and signed with the Oakland Oaks of the rival American Basketball Association for the following year, but after four seasons in the ABA rejoined the Warriors in 1972. During Barry's absence, the Warriors were no longer title contenders, and the mantle of leadership fell to Thurmond, Jeff Mullins and Rudy LaRusso. They began scheduling more home games in Oakland with the opening of the Oakland Coliseum Arena in 1966 and the 1970ÿ71 season would be the team's last as the San Francisco Warriors.\\r\\nThe franchise adopted its brand name Golden State Warriors prior to the 1971ÿ72 season, in order to suggest that the team represented the entire state of California.[7][c] Almost all home games were played in Oakland that season; six were played in San Diego, but none in San Francisco or Daly City. Oakland Arena became the team's exclusive home court in 1971.\\r\\nThe Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 except in 1974, and won their first NBA championship on the West Coast in 1974ÿ75. In what many consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Golden State not only defeated the heavily favored Washington Bullets but humiliated them in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior Al Attles, and led on the court by Rick Barry and Jamaal Wilkes. Barry was named MVP of the finals.[14]\\r\\nAt 59-23, the Warriors had the league's best record during the 1975ÿ76 season. They were upset, however, by the 42-40 Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\\r\\nBecause of the loss of key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward Purvis Short (1978), former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll (1980) and center Robert Parish (1976), who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll. In 1983, the Warriors matched the New York Knicks' offer for free-agent Bernard King, but, unable to pay his high salary, quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard Micheal Ray Richardson, whom they soon shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard Eric \\"Sleepy\\" Floyd, and journeyman forward Mickey Johnson. (Floyd once scored 29 points for the Warriors in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Lakers, though he was later traded to the Houston Rockets).\\r\\nThe departure of these players for various reasons symbolized the franchise's futility during this period, as head coach Attles moved up to the front office as general manager in 1980 and the team made several coaching changes. New owners Jim Fitzgerald and Dan Finane finally managed to return the team to respectability by hiring former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach George Karl as head coach in 1986 after selecting St. John's small forward Chris Mullin in the 1985 NBA draft.\\r\\nAfter a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence under coach Karl, culminating in a 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers which is still shown on TV in the NBA's Greatest Games series. In the game, Warriors' All-Star point guard Sleepy Floyd's performance in the second half still stands as the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39). His six consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter led to a 51-point finish for him and a victory for the Warriors.\\r\\nThe \\"Sleepy Floyd game\\" was a catalyst for increased interest in the NBA in the Bay Area which was furthered by new coach Don Nelson, who engineered another successful string of wins in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the high-scoring trio of point guard Tim Hardaway, guard Mitch Richmond and forward Chris Mullin (collectively known as \\"Run TMC\\" after the rap group Run-D.M.C.). But \\"Run TMC\\" stayed together for only two seasons (winning only one playoff series), when coach Nelson, in a move to get a promising young front-court player to complement his run-and-gun system, sent Richmond to the Sacramento Kings for rookie power forward Billy Owens. Nelson had been brought to the Warriors from the Milwaukee Bucks by Jim Fitzgerald, who along with Dan Finnane owned the team between 1986 and 1995. In 1993ÿ94, with first-round draft pick and Rookie of the Year power forward Chris Webber playing alongside off-guard Latrell Sprewell, the Warriors made the playoffs.\\r\\nAt the start of the next season, however, a rift formed between Webber and Sprewell on the one hand and Nelson on the other. All three soon left the team, and the organization went into a tailspin. 1994ÿ95 was the first season under new team owner Chris Cohan, who had bought out Fitzgerald and Finnane. The Warriors selected power forward prospect Joe Smith as their first overall draft pick in 1995 and hired Rick Adelman as the new head coach. They sent Tim Hardaway and Chris Gatling to the Miami Heat for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles midway through the 1995ÿ96 season, and ended up with a 36ÿ46 record, three wins short of making the playoffs. While their home court, the Oakland Coliseum Arena, was being extensively renovated, the 1996ÿ97 Warriors played their home games in the San Jose Arena and struggled to a 30ÿ52 finish.[15]\\r\\nLongtime Seton Hall college coach P. J. Carlesimo, who had been recently fired by the Portland Trail Blazers, replaced Adelman as head coach for 1997ÿ98. Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the 1997ÿ98 season for losing his temper and choking Carlesimo during a team practice in December, generating the glaring newspaper headline \\"WARRIORS HIT ROCK BOTTOM\\" and the declaration by general manager Garry St. Jean that Sprewell would never play for the Warriors again. He would not play in the NBA again until he was dealt in January 1999 to the New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings.\\r\\nSt. Jean had become the new Warriors' general manager in July 1997; he and his predecessor Dave Twardzik received much of the blame for the Warriors' struggles early in Cohan's turbulent tenure as owner in addition to Cohan himself.[16] St. Jean brought in players such as Terry Cummings, John Starks and Mookie Blaylock who were well past their primes. Twardzik drafted several flops, such as Todd Fuller (while Kobe Bryant was still available as well as Steve Nash and Jermaine O'Neal) and Steve Logan (who never played an NBA game). In the following draft, the team selected Adonal Foyle while Tracy McGrady was still available. St. Jean did, however, draft future two-time NBA slam dunk champion off-guard Jason Richardson (from Michigan State), a Warriors' star scorer through the 2006ÿ07 season.\\r\\nFor a few years, with rising stars Richardson, small forward Antawn Jamison and point guard Gilbert Arenas leading the team, the Warriors seemed like a team on the rise; but the young Warriors did not have enough in the competitive Western Conference to make the playoffs. After the 2002ÿ03 season, St. Jean's earlier mistakes of committing money to players like Danny Fortson, Adonal Foyle and Erick Dampier were painfully felt by Warriors' fans when the team was unable to re-sign Arenas despite his desire to stay in the Bay Area. A new rule was implemented in response to second-round draft picks who quickly become superstars. Chris Mullin succeeded St. Jean with the title of Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations in 2004. He hoped to build a winning team around Jason Richardson, Mike Dunleavy Jr and Troy Murphy, and drafted 7-foot center Andris Biedri?? from Latvia (11th overall). At the 2005 trading deadline, he bolstered to the team with the acquisition of point guard Baron Davis, bringing to the team its first superstar since Mullin himself. The Warriors enjoyed a great start to the 2005ÿ06 season, entering the new year with a plus .500 winning percentage for the first time since 1994, but managed to win only 13 more games through the end of March due to injuries. Davis often found himself at odds with new head coach Mike Montgomery (used to dealing with college players in his long tenure at Stanford) and failed to remain healthy, playing in just 54 games. On April 5, 2006, the Warriors were officially eliminated from playoff contention in a 114ÿ109 overtime loss to the Hornets, extending their playoff drought to 12 seasons.\\r\\nEntering the 2006ÿ07 season, the Warriors held the active record (12) for the most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance (see Active NBA non-playoff appearance streaks). During the 2006 off-season, Golden State announced that it had bought out the remaining two years of coach Montgomery's contract and hired previous Golden State and former Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson to take over for him. During training camp, small forward Matt Barnes established himself in the rotation. On January 17, 2007, the Warriors traded the disappointing Murphy and Dunleavy with promising young power forward Ike Diogu and Keith McLeod to the Indiana Pacers for forward Al Harrington, forward/guard Stephen Jackson, guard ?arnas Jasikevi?ius and forward Josh Powell.[17] This trade allowed the Warriors to \\"run and gun\\" their way to the playoffs with a more athletic and talented team. On March 4, 2007, the Warriors suffered a 106ÿ107 loss in Washington, the Wizards handing them their 6th straight loss when former Warrior Arenas hit a technical free throw with less than one second remaining after Nelson had protested a controversial call with the Warriors ahead by a slim margin. The loss dropped them to 26ÿ35.\\r\\nMarch 4 marked the turning point for the Warriors. The Warriors closed out the regular season (42ÿ40) at 16ÿ5 in their last 21 games.[18] \\"We Believe\\" became the Warriors' slogan for the last two months of the season and the playoffs.[19]\\r\\nLed by a healthy Baron Davis, an ever-improving Jason Richardson and young future star off-guard Monta Ellis as well as center Biedri??, the Warriors immediately dashed the highly favored top-seed Dallas Mavericks' expectations of a short and easy series win with a Game 1 victory in Dallas thanks to Davis' frantic style of play. The Mavericks came back to win Game 2 easily to tie the series at a game apiece, but the Warriors won both Games 3 & 4 with a huge lift from the home crowd at Oracle Arena. A close Game 5 saw the Mavericks eke out a 118ÿ112 victory with a last-minute surge led by superstar forward Dirk Nowitzki to send the series back to California at 3ÿ2. In Game 6, the Warriors engineered a third-quarter 18ÿ0 run to eliminate the Mavericks and become the NBA's first No.?8 seed to beat a No.?1 seed in a seven-game series (and the first NBA No.?8 seed to beat the top seed since 1999 when the New York Knicks eliminated the Miami Heat). It was an upset in name only, given the fact that the Warriors had swept the Mavericks in the regular season series.\\r\\nThe Warriors went on to play the Utah Jazz in the second round of the 2006ÿ07 playoffs, where they dropped two close games at EnergySolutions Arena to open the series. The series then shifted to the Oracle Arena, where the Warriors won Game 3 in a convincing blowout. Davis scored 32 points and electrified the crowd with a monster dunk on Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko late in the fourth quarter, but they lost Game 4 at home, their first loss in Oakland in well over a month and the Jazz closed them out in Game 5 in Salt Lake City.\\r\\nThe Warriors faced early difficulties in their attempt to return to the playoffs. Richardson was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for rookie Brandan Wright. To make things even worse, Jackson was suspended for seven games over a firearm incident. They opened the 2007ÿ08 season with six straight losses, but Ellis' rise, Davis' solid injury-free season (21.6 points, 8 assists, 4.6 rebounds per game),[20] and an overall improvement in team chemistry brought them back to playoff contention; but in the end the Warriors failed to make the playoffs despite a 48ÿ34 season, which is the best record in NBA history for a non-playoff team since the NBA playoffs had expanded to eight teams per conference. The Western Conference was very strong that season; every playoff team won 50 games, leaving the Warriors two games out of the last playoff spot. The Warriors sold out nearly every home game during the season averaging 19,631 per game, the highest in team history.\\r\\nIn the offseason, Baron Davis opted to return to his home town and sign with the Los Angeles Clippers. With the 14th pick of the 2008 NBA draft, the Warriors selected and signed Anthony Randolph out of LSU. To compensate for the loss of Davis, the Warriors signed free agents Corey Maggette and Ronny Turiaf and re-signed Ellis and Andris Biedri?? to long-term contracts.\\r\\nThe Warriors had a disappointing 2008ÿ2009 season, finishing 29ÿ53. Ellis was injured in a moped accident, and suspended for 30 games for riding the vehicle against the terms of his contract, depriving the Warriors of their top player. They traded disenchanted forward Al Harrington to the New York Knicks for guard Jamal Crawford, and were undone by injuries and the minimal experience of their young players such as Anthony Morrow and Brandan Wright. Coach Nelson often had to make adjustments to the starting lineups since many of the original starters missed games due to injuries. Despite the team's losing record, the Warriors were hard to beat when they had a healthy lineup and a strong bench. With leadership and improvement in their young players, they were sometimes able to defeat powerhouse teams such as the Boston Celtics, 99-89.\\r\\nDuring the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Mullin. Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach,[21] was promoted in his place and drafted Stephen Curry as an outstanding 7th lottery pick, but dubiously traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.\\r\\nThe Warriors had another injury-prone year in 2009ÿ10.[22] as they were consistently unable to field their ideal starting lineup. In November, a malcontented Stephen Jackson and seldom-used Acie Law were traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for Raja Bell (out for the season with an injury) and Vladimir Radmanovic. Four days later, they signed center Chris Hunter. Starting in January 2010, they issued multiple 10-day contracts, most notably to power forward Anthony Tolliver from the Idaho Stampede. Due to their multiple injuries, they were granted an exception allowing them to sign Reggie Williams from the Sioux Falls Skyforce to a 10-day contract on March 2, making it their fifth D-League call-up that season, tying an NBA record. They eventually waived the injured Bell to sign Williams for the rest of the year, and finished the season 26ÿ56, fourth in the Pacific Division.\\r\\nOn June 24, the Warriors selected Ekpe Udoh, a power forward from Baylor, as the 6th pick of the 2010 NBA draft. They also introduced a modernized version of their \\"The City\\" logo depicting the new eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and switched to a simplified color scheme of royal blue and gold. They also introduced new uniforms reminiscent of the 1969ÿ71 \\"The City\\" uniforms. The Warriors made an offseason trade that sent Turiaf, Randolph and Kelenna Azubuike to the New York Knicks in return for star high-scoring power forward David Lee via a sign-and-trade. Lee agreed to a six-year, $80?million deal, on a framework contingent on the decision of superstar forward LeBron James to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat that same day. Following Morrow's departure after he signed the New Jersey Nets' offer sheet, the Warriors signed Dorell Wright, formerly with the Miami Heat, to a three-year, $11?million deal.\\r\\nOn July 15, owner Chris Cohan sold the Warriors to Peter Guber of Mandalay Entertainment and his partner Joe Lacob for a then-record $450?million.[23] On November 15, the Warriors announced the new 19-person ownership group composed of Joe Lacob, Peter Guber, Vivek Ranadiv, Erika Glazer, Fred Harman, Bob Piccinini, Larry Bowman, Danny German, Marty Glick, Chad Hurley, Craig R. Johnson, Bruce Karsh, Jeffrey A. Miller, Paul Schaeffer, David Scially, Nick Swinmurn, Harry Tsao, John Walecka and Dennis Wong.[24]\\r\\nThe Warriors continued their signing spree by adding Harvard guard Jeremy Lin to their roster with a one-year partially guaranteed contract containing a second-year team option, the first Taiwanese-American player in NBA history. Louis Amundson was then added for little under $5?million in mid-September. Keith Smart was hired as head coach that same month after Nelson had resigned before the start of training camp.\\r\\nIn February 2011, the Warriors traded Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric for Troy Murphy and a 2011 second-round pick. On February 27, Murphy and the Warriors reached a buyout agreement and he was waived.[25][26]\\r\\nDuring a steady season without making any real ground in the playoff race, the Warriors broke franchise records with 21 made 3's in a win against the Orlando Magic. In April 2011, Dorell Wright made a franchise record of 184 3's in a season in a home win versus Los Angeles Lakers, surpassing Richardson's 183 in 2005ÿ06. He then broke another NBA record, as the first player to have scored more points in his seventh season than in all his first six seasons combined in a win against the Portland Trail Blazers. He ended the season with the most three-pointers made in the NBA that season with 194, as well as the most 3s attempted with 516, both of which set new Warrior franchise records.\\r\\nThe Warriors failed to make the playoffs after a 36-win season in 2010ÿ11, and coach Smart was dismissed on April 27 due to the change in ownership.[27] 17-year NBA veteran and former ABC and ESPN commentator Mark Jackson replaced him as head coach on June 6.[28] On December 19, they traded Amundson to the Indiana Pacers for small forward Brandon Rush.\\r\\nThe Warriors did not improve in the 2011ÿ12 NBA season under coach Jackson, finishing the lockout-shorted season with a 23ÿ43 record, 13th in the conference. The team suffered several injuries to key players, and due to the lockout, Jackson could not establish his system in training camp. They then entered into another chaotic rebuilding phase.\\r\\nTeam leader Monta Ellis was traded in mid-March 2012, along with Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh, to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut (out injured for the season) and former Warrior small forward Stephen Jackson, who without playing a game for the Warriors was quickly traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Richard Jefferson and a conditional first-round pick on March 15. These moves saw the rise of Stephen Curry and David Lee to team co-captains, and saw off-guard Klay Thompson, the 11th overall pick of the 2011 NBA draft, move into a starting role. On July 11, they acquired point guard Jarrett Jack from the New Orleans Hornets in a three-team trade also including the Philadelphia 76ers, who received Dorell Wright from Golden State. On August 1, they signed forward Carl Landry on the termination of his one-year contract with the Hornets. In the 2012 NBA draft, they selected small forward Harrison Barnes with the 7th overall pick, center Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, small forward Draymond Green 35th overall, and 7-foot 1-inch center Ognjen Kuzmic 52nd overall. In early November, swingman Rush was lost for the year with a torn ACL after falling awkwardly on the court early in the second game of the season, and less than a month later the team announced that Bogut was out indefinitely with a foot injury that was more serious than originally reported. Bogut did not return to regular play until late in the season.\\r\\nComing out of this maelstrom of trades and injuries with a team starting two rookies (Barnes and Ezeli), the Warriors had one of their best starts in decades, earning their 20th win before hitting the 30-game mark for the first time since 1992. The Warriors also achieved a milestone by completing their first ever 6ÿ1 road trip in franchise history, including a 97ÿ95 win over the defending champion Heat in Miami. On April 9, 2013, with a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Warriors clinched the playoffs for the second time in 19 years and the first time since the 2006ÿ07 \\"We Believe\\" Warriors. This time, the local battlecry was \\"We Belong\\".\\r\\nThe team finished the season with a record of 47ÿ35, earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference, and defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs by winning four out of six games. They lost in the second round to the San Antonio Spurs, four games to two. This was the first playoff experience for all of the starters of this group except for Andrew Bogut.[29]\\r\\nOther highlights of the season included Stephen Curry's 272 three-point baskets to set an NBA single-season record, giving him the nickname \\"baby-faced assassin\\", and the naming of forward David Lee to the 2013 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve, ending the team's 16-year drought without an All Star selection, dating back to Latrell Sprewell in the 1997 season. Curry and Klay Thompson, dubbed the \\"Splash Brothers\\"[30] by team employee Brian Witt [31] for their backcourt shooting prowess, combined for 483 three-pointers during the season, easily besting the prior record of 435 set by the Orlando Magic's Nick Anderson and Dennis Scott in 1995ÿ96.\\r\\nWith their lone selection in the 2013 NBA draft, the Warriors made 22-year-old Serbian combo-guard Nemanja Nedovic the 30th and final pick of the first round.[32] In early July 2013, Golden State signed former Denver Nuggets swingman and free agent Andre Iguodala to a four-year, $48 million deal. To make room under their salary cap, the Warriors traded Richard Jefferson, Andris Biedri?? and Brandon Rush, along with multiple draft picks, including their 2014 and 2017 first-round picks, to the Utah Jazz.[33] The Warriors lost free-agent guard Jarrett Jack, who departed for the Cleveland Cavaliers, and free agent power forward Carl Landry, who went to the Sacramento Kings. To help fill the void left by Landry, the Warriors signed forward-center Marreese Speights to a three-year, $10 million contract.[34] The team also signed one-year deals with veteran center Jermaine O'Neal ($2 million) and point guard Toney Douglas ($1.6 million).[35] On August 21, the Warriors signed 7?ft 1 in Serbian center Ognjen Kuzmic, who had been playing in Europe since his selection in the 2012 NBA draft, to a guaranteed two-year deal.[36][37][38]\\r\\nThe Warriors began the 2013ÿ14 season showing flashes of brilliance and also plenty of lapses. In early December their record was 12ÿ9, as compared to 17ÿ4 the year before. One challenging factor was a tough starting schedule that saw them play 14 of their first 22 games on the road, including 10 games against teams holding playoff spots in the standings. A stream of injuries also held the team back, including injuries to Festus Ezeli (off-season surgery to repair the right knee, out for the season), Toney Douglas (left tibia stress reaction, out nearly a month from mid-November to December), and Jermaine O'Neal (right wrist injury and surgery, out from mid-November to early February). Stephen Curry and Harrison Barnes were also out for at least four games before the all-star break, each with minor injuries. Most prominently of all, Iguodala suffered a hamstring pull in late November that kept him out for over a month, during which time the Warriors' performance suffered significantly on both the defensive and offensive ends of the court, and the team posted a losing 5ÿ7 record while revealing a lack of depth on their bench. With Iguodala back in the lineup, the Warriors went on a 10-game winning streak, which included six consecutive wins on a single road trip, tying an NBA record. The winning streak was the longest for the franchise since the 1975 championship year, and just one short of the team record of 11 consecutive wins, set in the 1971ÿ72 season.\\r\\nTo strengthen their underperforming bench, the Warriors made a three-team trade on January 15, sending Douglas to the Miami Heat and picking up guards Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks from the Boston Celtics[39] and then, a day before the trade deadline, trading Kent Bazemore and Brooks to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for veteran point guard Steve Blake.[40] Thanks in part to the improved effectiveness of their backup squad, boosted by the additions of Blake and Crawford and the play of 35-year-old Jermaine O'Neal (who returned sooner than expected from wrist surgery), the Warriors were one of the winningest teams in the NBA after the all-star break. Nonetheless, and despite several victories over top contenders, the team displayed a pattern of losing games to inferior teams even at their home arena. On April 11, in a 112ÿ95 stomping of the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center, the Warriors clinched a playoff berth in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. However, just one day earlier in a loss against the Portland Trail Blazers, Andrew Bogut suffered a cracked rib that would keep him out of the post-season, a big blow to the sixth-seed Warriors' playoff hopes.\\r\\nThe Warriors ended the season 51ÿ31, winning more than 50 games for only the fourth time in franchise history, finishing 20 games over .500 for the first time in 22 years, and tying the 1991ÿ92 squad for the franchise's all-time mark of 24 wins on the road. Even without Bogut, in the first round of the playoffs the Warriors battled the third-seed Los Angeles Clippers to a seventh and deciding game, which the Warriors lost, bringing their 2013ÿ14 season to an end. It was season of many thrilling moments in which the Warriors' played in 17 regular-season games decided by 2 points or less, 6 games with winning shots in the final 3 seconds, and 7 comeback wins in which the Warriors had been behind by 15 points or more.[41]\\r\\nIn other noteworthy occurrences for the season, Curry was named to the starting lineup for the 2014 NBA All-Star Game. For Curry, the only Warrior named to the team, this was his first all-star appearance in five seasons as an NBA player. Curry hit another notable milestone in posting 4 triple-doubles for the season, tying a franchise record unequaled since Wilt Chamberlain in 1963ÿ64. Curry also averaged career-bests in points and assists; averaging 24.0 points and 8.5 assists in the season. Curry and Klay Thompson continued to set league records in three-point shooting. On February 7, in a 102ÿ87 win over the Chicago Bulls, the backcourt duo became the first teammates to each make a three-pointer in 30 consecutive games.[42] Curry, who finished the season with 261 threes, set an individual record for most three-pointers in a span of two seasons with 533, surpassing the previous mark of 478 set by Seattle Supersonic Ray Allen in 2004ÿ05 and 2005ÿ06. Together, Thompson and Curry combined for 484 threes on the year, besting by one the NBA record they had set the year before.\\r\\nEven as the team rolled towards the post-season, signs emerged of trouble in the Warriors' front office. On March 25, the team reassigned assistant coach Brian Scalabrine to the team's NBA Development League Affiliate in Santa Cruz because of what head coach Mark Jackson called a \\"difference in philosophies\\"[43] and what unnamed league sources cited by Yahoo! Sports called \\"an increasingly dysfunctional atmosphere\\" on the Warriors' coaching staff.[44] Fewer than two weeks later, assistant coach Darren Erman was fired for secretly recording conversations between coaches, staff and players.[45] During the post season, rumors persisted in the press that Mark Jackson's job as head coach was in jeopardy, leading the players to make a unanimous declaration of support for Jackson's return only minutes after the Warriors' first-round, game seven playoff loss to the Clippers.[46] Nonetheless, three days later, on May 6, the team announced the firing of Mark Jackson as head coach.[47] In his three-season tenure as head coach, Jackson compiled a 121-109 (.526) record, overseeing a terrific turnaround. When Jackson took the helm in 2011, the franchise had made the playoffs only one time over the prior 17 seasons, averaging 30.2 wins per season during that period.[48] Jackson, 49, became just the third head coach in franchise history to lead a team to at least 50 wins in a season, joining Don Nelson and Alvin Attles, who both hit the mark twice with the Warriors. With 121 wins overall, Jackson ranks fourth on the franchise's all-time wins list, trailing Attles (557), Nelson (422) and Eddie Gottlieb (263).[49] On May 14, 2014, the Golden State Warriors named Steve Kerr the team's head coach, in a reported $25 million deal over five years.[50] It was a first-time head-coaching position for Kerr, 48, a five-time NBA champion point guard who holds the all-time career record for accuracy in three-point shooting (.454). Kerr formerly served as president and general manager for the Phoenix Suns basketball team (2007 to 2010), and had most recently been working as an NBA broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT).\\r\\nThe Warriors completed the regular season with a record of 67-15, the best in the league and the most wins in franchise history.[51] The Warriors also finished with a home record of 39ÿ2, the second best in NBA history. They were first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014ÿ15 NBA Most Valuable Player, the first Warrior to do so since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960. In the first round of the playoffs, they swept the New Orleans Pelicans, defeated Memphis Grizzlies in the second round in six games and defeated Houston Rockets in five games of the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975, where they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games to win their fourth NBA title, and their first in 40 years. Andre Iguodala was named Finals MVP.[52]\\r\\nOther highlights of the season included Stephen Curry breaking his own record for three-pointers made in a single season with 286. He and Klay Thompson made a combined 525 three-pointers, the most by a duo in NBA history. In the postseason, Curry shattered Reggie Miller's record of 58 made three-pointers in a single postseason with 98. On January 23, 2015, Klay Thompson broke an NBA record for points in a quarter with 37 in the third. Curry was also the leader in the voting polls for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, won the 2014ÿ15 NBA Most Valuable Player award and the 2015 ESPYs Best Male Athlete award.\\r\\nThe Warriors began the season by winning their first 24 games, eclipsing the previous best start in NBA history, set by the 1993ÿ94 Houston Rockets and the 1948ÿ49 Washington Capitols at 15ÿ0.[53][54] The Warriors surpassed the 1969ÿ70 New York Knicks for the best road start in NBA history at 14ÿ0, which is also the joint-third longest road win streak.[55] Their record-setting start ended when they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks on December 12, 2015.[56] The Warriors broke a 131-year-old record of 20ÿ0 set by the 1884 St. Louis Maroons baseball team, to claim the best start to a season in all of the major professional sports in America. Golden State also won 28 consecutive regular-season games dating back to the 2014ÿ15 season, eclipsing the 2012ÿ13 Miami Heat for the second longest winning streak in NBA history.[54] The team set an NBA record 54-straight regular season home game winning streak, which spanned from January 31, 2015 to March 29, 2016. The previous record of 44 was held by the 1995ÿ96 Chicago Bulls team led by Michael Jordan.[57]\\r\\nStephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were all named to the All-Star Game, the first time the Warriors have had three All-Stars since 1976. Green broke the Golden State franchise record of nine triple-doubles in a season. Curry broke numerous three-point records during the season, including his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season of 286; he finished the season with 402 three pointers. He made a three-pointer in 151 consecutive games, which broke the NBA record of 127 set by Kyle Korver in 2014. On February 27, 2016, Curry also tied the NBA record of twelve three-pointers made in a single game, jointly holding it with Donyell Marshall and Kobe Bryant.[58]\\r\\nOn April 13, 2016, Golden State set the record for most wins in a single season, beating Memphis, and finishing 73ÿ9.[59] On May 10, 2016, Stephen Curry was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. Curry is the 11th player to win back-to-back MVP honors and became the first player in NBA history to win the MVP award by unanimous vote, winning all 131 first-place votes.[60] The Golden State Warriors went to their second consecutive appearance in the finals with a rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers.[61] The Warriors went to a 3ÿ1 advantage but the Cavaliers made a comeback to tie the series at 3 wins apiece.[62] In Game 7 the Golden State Warriors lost the championship series on their homecourt, and earned the unfortunate distinction of becoming the first team to give up a 3ÿ1 lead in the NBA finals.[63]\\r\\nOn July 4, 2016, Kevin Durant announced he would leave the Oklahoma City Thunder in order to sign a two-year contract with the Golden State Warriors.[64] On July 7, Durant signed his contract, which gave the Warriors a fourth All-NBA player on their team.[65] The Durant signing made the Warriors the prohibitive favorites to win the NBA championship, according to oddsmakers.[66]\\r\\nThe Warriors posted many notable achievements during the 2016ÿ17 regular season. On November 7, 2016, Stephen Curry set the NBA record for most 3-pointers in a game with 13, in a 116ÿ106 win over the Pelicans.[67] On December 5, 2016, Klay Thompson scored 60 points in 29 minutes, in a 142ÿ106 victory over the Pacers. In doing so, Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score 60 or more points in fewer than 30 minutes of playing time.[68] Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, making the Warriors only the eighth team in NBA history to have four All-Stars.[69] On February 10, 2017, Draymond Green recorded a triple-double with 12 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals, becoming the first player in NBA history to post a triple-double with fewer than 10 points.[70] On March 2, 2017, the Warriors' streak for most games without back-to-back losses ended at 146 with a 94ÿ87 loss to the Chicago Bulls. The streak eclipsed the previous record of 95 held by the Utah Jazz.[71]\\r\\nThe Warriors earned home-court advantage throughout the 2017 playoffs, thanks to a 2016ÿ17 regular season record of 67ÿ15. They were the first team in NBA playoff history to start 12ÿ0, defeating in order the Trail Blazers, the Jazz, and the Spurs. The 2017 Finals once again pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers, becoming the first time in NBA history that two teams met in the Finals for three consecutive years. The Warriors won the championship after going 4ÿ1 in the Finals, and their 16ÿ1 playoff record garnered the best winning percentage (.941) in NBA playoffs history.[72] After the Warriors announced that they were uncertain if they would make the customary visit to the White House by playoff champions, President Donald Trump rescinded his invitation.[73] The team still planned to travel to Washington, D.C. to \\"celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion.\\" Planned activities included meeting with local youth and a visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture.[74]\\r\\nThe Warriors went into the 2018 playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference after earning a 2017ÿ18 regular season record of 58ÿ24. After defeating both the Spurs and the Pelicans 4-1, the Warriors came up against the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. Despite reaching a 3-2 disadvantage against the Rockets after Game 5, the Warriors were able to stave off elimination and came back to win the series 4-3. The 2018 Finals once again pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers, becoming the first time in NBA history that two teams met in the Finals for four consecutive years. The Warriors won their second-straight NBA championship after going 4ÿ0 in the Finals, marking the first NBA Finals sweep since 2007.[75]\\r\\nIn April 2014, the Warriors began the purchase process for a 12-acre (4.9 ha) site in Mission Bay, San Francisco, to hold a new 18,000-seat arena which is expected to be ready for the 2019ÿ20 NBA season,[76][77] with construction to begin in early 2016.[78] The sale was finalized in October 2015.[79] The location was selected after an original proposal to construct the arena on Piers 30 and 32, just south of the Bay Bridge, met with vocal opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views.[80] The new location, which still faces some vocal opposition in San Francisco, apparently eliminates the need for any voter approval, which would have been required with the original site.[81] Some type of waterfront park is planned across from the projected arena, which will be located at an already-existing Muni T-Third stop. The Central Subway, planned to open in 2018, may provide a direct connection between the new site and the downtown Powell Street Muni/BART station. Although the Warriors considered a name change, possibly returning to their former name of San Francisco Warriors,[82] it was ultimately decided that they would remain the Golden State Warriors upon their return back to San Francisco.[83] On January 27, 2016, it was announced that the Warriors' new arena would be called Chase Center as part of an agreement with JPMorgan Chase.[84]\\r\\nBob Fitzgerald has done television play-by-play, and former Warrior guard Jim Barnett has done color commentary for the Warriors for more than 15 years, currently on NBC Sports Bay Area, where they telecast more than 70 Warrior games a year.[85] They also host Roundtable Live, a half-hour pre-game show leading up to the broadcast of select Golden State home games. Fitzgerald is in his 20th season as the Warriors' play-by-play man, while Barnett is in his 32nd season as color man. Greg Papa, Garry St. Jean, and Kelenna Azubuike are also members of the telecast team, specializing in in-game, halftime and post-game analysis, while Kerith Burke serves as the sideline reporter.[86]\\r\\nTim Roye has done the radio play-by-play for Warrior games since 1995. He is joined in the booth by former Warriors forward Tom Tolbert for home games only. On August 25, 2016, the Warriors announced they were leaving long time station KNBR and all of their games will be broadcast on KGMZ.[87] After each game, Roye, Fitzgerald and Barnett get together for post-game radio analysis and a next-game preview.\\r\\nRoster ?

A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee, who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[89] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\\r\\n[90]\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\nArizin, Fulks, Gola, Johnston and Phillip played all or most of their tenure with the Warriors in Philadelphia.

Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and (usually) a source of heat, in most cases an open flame. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. Unlike gas balloons, the envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air near the bottom of the envelope is at the same pressure as the surrounding air. In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric and the inlet of the balloon (closest to the burner flame) is made from a fire resistant material such as Nomex. Modern balloons have been made in all kinds of shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial, and many commercial, applications.\\r\\nThe hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying flight technology. The first untethered manned hot air balloon flight was performed by Jean-Fran?ois Pilatre de Rozier and Fran?ois Laurent d'Arlandes on November 21, 1783, in Paris, France,[1] in a balloon created by the Montgolfier brothers.[2] The first hot-air balloon flown in the Americas was launched from the Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia on January 9, 1793 by the French aeronaut Jean Pierre Blanchard.[3] Hot air balloons that can be propelled through the air rather than simply drifting with the wind are known as thermal airships.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly unmanned hot air balloons were used in China. Zhuge Liang of the Shu Han kingdom, during the Three Kingdoms era (220ÿ280 AD), used airborne lanterns for military signaling. These lanterns are known Chinese lanterns (simplified Chinese: ^]; traditional Chinese: ^]??).[4]\\r\\nThe brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-tienne Montgolfier developed a hot air balloon in Annonay, Ardeche, France, and demonstrated it publicly on September 19, 1783, making an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes. After experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals, the first balloon flight with humans aboard, a tethered flight, performed on or around October 15, 1783, by Jean-Francois pilatre de Rozier who made at least one tethered flight from the yard of the Reveillon workshop in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Later that same day, Pilatre de Rozier became the second human to ascend into the air, reaching an altitude of 26?m (85?ft), the length of the tether.[5][6] The first free flight with human passengers was made a few weeks later, on November 21, 1783.[7] King Louis XVI had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but de Rozier, along with Marquis Fran?ois d'Arlandes, petitioned successfully for the honor.[8][9][10] The first military use of a hot air balloon happened in 1794 during the battle of Fleurus, when the French used the balloon l'Entreprenant for observation.[11]\\r\\nModern hot air balloons, with an onboard heat source, were developed by Ed Yost, beginning during the 1950s; his work resulted in his first successful flight, on October 22, 1960.[12] The first modern hot air balloon to be made in the United Kingdom (UK) was the Bristol Belle, built in 1967. Presently, hot air balloons are used primarily for recreation. Hot air balloons are able to fly to extremely high altitudes. On November 26, 2005 Vijaypat Singhania set the world altitude record for highest hot air balloon flight, reaching 21,027?m (68,986?ft). He took off from downtown Mumbai, India, and landed 240?km (150?mi) south in Panchale.[13] The previous record of 19,811?m (64,997?ft) had been set by Per Lindstrand on June 6, 1988, in Plano, Texas.\\r\\nOn January 15, 1991, the 'Virgin Pacific Flyer' balloon completed the longest flight in a hot air balloon when Per Lindstrand (born in Sweden, but resident in the UK) and Richard Branson of the UK flew 7,671.91?km (4,767.10?mi) from Japan to Northern Canada. With a volume of 74 thousand cubic meters (2.6 million cubic feet), the balloon envelope was the largest ever built for a hot air craft. Designed to fly in the trans-oceanic jet streams, the Pacific Flyer recorded the fastest ground speed for a manned balloon at 245?mph (394?km/h). The longest duration record was set by Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard, Auguste Piccard's grandson; and Briton Brian Jones, flying in the Breitling Orbiter 3. It was the first nonstop trip around the world by balloon. The balloon left Chateau-d'Oex, Switzerland, on March 1, 1999, and landed at 1:02?a.m. on March 21 in the Egyptian desert 300 miles (480?km) south of Cairo. The two men exceeded distance, endurance, and time records, traveling 19 days, 21 hours, and 55 minutes. Steve Fossett, flying solo, exceeded the record for briefest time traveling around the world on 3 July 2002 on his sixth attempt,[14] in 320 h 33 min.[15] Fedor Konyukhov flew solo round the world on his first attempt in a hybrid hot-air/helium balloon from 11 to 23 July 2016[16] for a round-the world time of 272h 11m, as of 17 September 2016[update] awaiting official confirmation as the new record.[15]\\r\\nA hot air balloon for manned flight uses a single-layered, fabric gas bag (lifting \\"envelope\\"), with an opening at the bottom called the mouth or throat. Attached to the envelope is a basket, or gondola, for carrying the passengers. Mounted above the basket and centered in the mouth is the \\"burner\\", which injects a flame into the envelope, heating the air within. The heater or burner is fueled by propane, a liquefied gas stored in pressure vessels, similar to high pressure forklift cylinders.[17][18]\\r\\nModern hot air balloons are usually made of materials such as ripstop nylon or dacron (a polyester).[19]\\r\\nDuring the manufacturing process, the material is cut into panels and sewn together, along with structural load tapes that carry the weight of the gondola or basket. The individual sections, which extend from the throat to the crown (top) of the envelope, are known as gores or gore sections. Envelopes can have as few as 4 gores or as many as 24 or more.[20]\\r\\nEnvelopes often have a crown ring at their very top. This is a hoop of smooth metal, usually aluminium, and approximately 1?ft (0.30?m) in diameter. Vertical load tapes from the envelope are attached to the crown ring.\\r\\nAt the bottom of the envelope the vertical load tapes are sewn into loops that are connected to cables (one cable per load tape). These cables, often referred to as flying wires, are connected to the basket by carabiners.\\r\\nThe most common technique for sewing panels together is called the French felled, French fell, or double lap seam.[21][22][23][24] The two pieces of fabric are folded over on each other at their common edge, possibly with a load tape as well, and sewn together with two rows of parallel stitching. Other methods include a flat lap seam, in which the two pieces of fabric are held together simply with two rows of parallel stitching, and a zigzag, where parallel zigzag stitching holds a double lap of fabric.[23]\\r\\nThe fabric (or at least part of it, the top 1/3 for example) may be coated with a sealer, such as silicone or polyurethane, to make it impermeable to air.[25] It is often the degradation of this coating and the corresponding loss of impermeability that ends the effective life of an envelope, not weakening of the fabric itself. Heat, moisture, and mechanical wear-and-tear during set-up and pack-up are the primary causes of degradation. Once an envelope becomes too porous to fly, it may be retired and discarded or perhaps used as a 'rag bag': cold inflated and opened for children to run through. Products for recoating the fabric are becoming available commercially.[26]\\r\\nA range of envelope sizes is available. The smallest, one-person, basket-less balloons (called \\"Hoppers\\" or \\"Cloudhoppers\\") have as little as 600?m3 (21,000?cu?ft) of envelope volume;[27] for a perfect sphere the radius would be around 5?m (16?ft). At the other end of the scale, balloons used by commercial sightseeing operations may be able to carry well over two dozen people, with envelope volumes of up to 17,000?m3 (600,000?cu?ft).[27] The most-used size is about 2,800?m3 (99,000?cu?ft), and can carry 3 to 5 people.\\r\\nThe top of the balloon usually has a vent of some sort, enabling the pilot to release hot air to slow an ascent, start a descent, or increase the rate of descent, usually for landing. Some hot air balloons have turning vents, which are side vents that, when opened, cause the balloon to rotate. Such vents are particularly useful for balloons with rectangular baskets, to facilitate aligning the wider side of the basket for landing.[28]\\r\\nThe most common type of top vent is a disk-shaped flap of fabric called a parachute vent, invented by Tracy Barnes.[29] The fabric is connected around its edge to a set of \\"vent lines\\" that converge in the center. (The arrangement of fabric and lines roughly resembles a parachutethus the name.) These \\"vent lines\\" are themselves connected to a control line that runs to the basket. A parachute vent is opened by pulling on the control line. Once the control line is released, the pressure of the remaining hot air pushes the vent fabric back into place. A parachute vent can be opened briefly while in flight to initiate a rapid descent. (Slower descents are initiated by allowing the air in the balloon to cool naturally.) The vent is pulled open completely to collapse the balloon after landing.\\r\\nAn older, and presently less commonly used, style of top vent is called a \\"Velcro-style\\" vent. This too is a disk of fabric at the top of the balloon. However, rather than having a set of \\"vent lines\\" that can repeatedly open and close the vent, the vent is secured by \\"hook and loop\\" fasteners (such as Velcro) and is only opened at the end of the flight. Balloons equipped with a Velcro-style vent typically have a second \\"maneuvering vent\\" built into the side (as opposed to the top) of the balloon. Another common type of top design is the \\"Smart Vent,\\" which, rather than lowering a fabric disc into the envelope as in the \\"parachute\\" type, gathers the fabric together in the center of the opening. This system can theoretically be used for in-flight maneuvering, but is more commonly used only as a rapid-deflation device for use after landing, of particular value in high winds. Other designs, such as the \\"pop top\\" and \\"MultiVent\\" systems, have also attempted to address the need for rapid deflation on landing, but the parachute top remains popular as an all-around maneuvering and deflation system.\\r\\nBesides special shapes, possibly for marketing purposes, there are several variations on the traditional \\"inverted tear drop\\" shape. The simplest, often used by home builders, is a hemisphere on top of a truncated cone. More-sophisticated designs attempt to minimize the circumferential stress on the fabric, with different degrees of success depending on whether they take fabric weight and varying air density into account. This shape may be referred to as \\"natural\\".[30] Finally, some specialized balloons are designed to minimize aerodynamic drag (in the vertical direction) to improve flight performance in competitions.[31]\\r\\nBaskets are commonly made of woven wicker or rattan. These materials have proven to be sufficiently light, strong, and durable for balloon flight. Such baskets are usually rectangular or triangular in shape. They vary in size from just big enough for two people to large enough to carry thirty.[32] Larger baskets often have internal partitions for structural bracing and to compartmentalize the passengers. Small holes may be woven into the side of the basket to act as foot holds for passengers climbing in or out.[33]\\r\\nBaskets may also be made of aluminium, especially a collapsible aluminium frame with a fabric skin, to reduce weight or increase portability.[34] These may be used by pilots without a ground crew or who are attempting to set altitude, duration, or distance records. Other specialty baskets include the fully enclosed gondolas used for around-the-world attempts,[35] and baskets that consist of little more than a seat for the pilot and perhaps one passenger.\\r\\nThe burner unit gasifies liquid propane,[36] mixes it with air, ignites the mixture, and directs the flame and exhaust into the mouth of the envelope. Burners vary in power output; each will generally produce 2 to 3 MW of heat (7 to 10 million BTUs per hour), with double, triple, or quadruple burner configurations installed where more power is needed.[37][38] The pilot actuates a burner by opening a propane valve, known as a blast valve. The valve may be spring-loaded so that it closes automatically, or it may stay open until closed by the pilot. The burner has a pilot light to ignite the propane and air mixture. The pilot light may be lit by the pilot with an external device, such as a flint striker or a lighter, or with a built-in piezo electric spark.[39]\\r\\nWhere more than one burner is present, the pilot can use one or more at a time depending on the desired heat output. Each burner is characterized by a metal coil of propane tubing the flame shoots through to preheat the incoming liquid propane. The burner unit may be suspended from the mouth of the envelope, or supported rigidly over the basket. The burner unit may be mounted on a gimbal to enable the pilot to aim the flame and avoid overheating the envelope fabric. A burner may have a secondary propane valve that releases propane more slowly and thereby generates a different sound. This is called a whisper burner and is used for flight over livestock to lessen the chance of spooking them. It also generates a more yellow flame and is used for night glows because it lights up the inside of the envelope better than the primary valve.\\r\\nPropane fuel tanks are usually cylindrical pressure vessels made from aluminium, stainless steel, or titanium with a valve at one end to feed the burner and to refuel. They may have a fuel gauge and a pressure gauge. Common tank sizes are 10 (38), 15 (57), and 20 (76) US gallons (liters).[25] They may be intended for upright or horizontal use, and may be mounted inside or outside the basket.\\r\\nThe pressure necessary to force the fuel through the line to the burner may be supplied by the vapor pressure of the propane itself, if warm enough, or by the introduction of an inert gas such as nitrogen.[39] Tanks may be preheated with electrical heat tapes to produce sufficient vapor pressure for cold weather flying.[40] Warmed tanks will usually also be wrapped in an insulating blanket to preserve heat during the setup and flight.\\r\\nA balloon may be outfitted with a variety of instruments to aid the pilot. These commonly include an altimeter, a rate of climb (vertical speed) indicator known as a variometer, envelope (air) temperature, and ambient (air) temperature.[41] A GPS receiver can be useful to indicate ground speed (traditional aircraft air speed indicators would be useless) and direction.\\r\\nThe combined mass of an average system can be calculated as follows:[25]\\r\\nusing a density of 0.9486?kg/m3 for dry air heated to 210?F (99?C).\\r\\nIncreasing the air temperature inside the envelope makes it less dense than the surrounding (ambient) air. The balloon floats because of the buoyant force exerted on it. This force is the same force that acts on objects when they are in water and is described by Archimedes' principle. The amount of lift (or buoyancy) provided by a hot air balloon depends primarily upon the difference between the temperature of the air inside the envelope and the temperature of the air outside the envelope. For most envelopes made of nylon fabric, the maximum internal temperature is limited to approximately 120?C (250?F).[42]\\r\\nIt should be noted that the melting point of nylon is significantly greater than this maximum operating temperature  about 230?C (450?F)  but higher temperatures cause the strength of the nylon fabric to degrade more quickly over time. With a maximum operating temperature of 120?C (250?F), balloon envelopes can generally be flown for between 400 and 500 hours before the fabric needs to be replaced. Many balloon pilots operate their envelopes at temperatures significantly less than the maximum to extend envelope fabric life.\\r\\nThe lift generated by 100,000?ft3 (2831.7?m3) of dry air heated to various temperatures may be calculated as follows:\\r\\nThe density of air at 20?C, 68?F is about 1.2?kg/m3. The total lift for a balloon of 100,000?ft3 heated to (99?C, 210?F) would be 1595?lb, 723.5?kg. This is just enough to generate neutral buoyancy for the total system mass (not including the heated air trapped in the envelope, of course) stated in the previous section. Liftoff would require a slightly greater temperature, depending on the desired rate of climb. In reality, the air contained in the envelope is not all the same temperature, as the accompanying thermal image shows, and so these calculations are based on averages.\\r\\nFor typical atmospheric conditions (20?C, 68?F), a hot air balloon heated to (99?C, 210?F) requires about 3.91?m3 of envelope volume to lift 1?kilogram (62.5?ft3/lb). The precise amount of lift provided depends not only upon the internal temperature mentioned above, but the external temperature, altitude above sea level, and humidity of the air surrounding. On a warm day, a balloon cannot lift as much as on a cool day, because the temperature required for launch will exceed the maximum sustainable for nylon envelope fabric. Also, in the lower atmosphere, the lift provided by a hot air balloon decreases about 3% for each 1,000?meters (1% per 1,000?ft) of altitude gained.[43]\\r\\nStandard hot air balloons are known as Montgolfier balloons and rely solely on the buoyancy of hot air provided by the burner and contained by the envelope.[44] This style of balloon was developed by the Montgolfier brothers, and had its first public demonstration on 4 June 1783 with an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes, followed later that year with manned flights.[45]\\r\\nThe 1785 Rozire balloon, a type of hybrid balloon, named after its creator, Jean-Fran?ois Pilatre de Rozier, has a separate cell for a lighter than air gas (typically helium,) as well as a cone below for hot air (as is used in a hot air balloon) to heat the helium at night. Hydrogen gas was used in the very early stages of development but was quickly abandoned due to the obvious danger of introducing an open flame near the gas. All modern Roziere balloons now use helium as a lifting gas.[46]\\r\\nSolar balloons are hot air balloons that use just solar energy captured by a dark envelope to heat the air inside.[47]\\r\\nTo help ensure the safety of pilot and passengers, a hot air balloon may carry several pieces of safety equipment.\\r\\nTo relight the burner if the pilot light goes out and the optional piezo ignition fails, the pilot should have ready access to a means of backup ignition, such as a flint spark lighter. Many systems, especially those that carry passengers, have completely duplicate fuel and burner systems: two fuel tanks, connected to two separate hoses, which feed two distinct burners. This enables a safe landing in the case of a blockage somewhere in one system or if a system must be disabled because of a fuel leak.\\r\\nA fire extinguisher suitable for extinguishing propane fires is useful. Most balloons carry a 1 or 2 ?kg AB:E type fire extinguisher.\\r\\nA handling or drop line is mandatory safety equipment in many countries. This is a rope or webbing of 20ÿ30 meters in length attached to the balloon basket with a quick release connection at one end. In very calm winds the balloon pilot can throw the handling line from the balloon so that the ground crew can guide the balloon safely away from obstructions on the ground.\\r\\nFor commercial passenger balloons, a pilot restraint harness is mandatory in some countries. This consists of a hip belt and a webbing line that together allow for some movement while preventing the pilot from being ejected from the basket during a hard landing.\\r\\nFurther safety equipment may include a first-aid kit, a fire blanket and a strong rescue knife.\\r\\nAt a minimum, the pilot should wear leather or flame-retardant fiber (such as nomex) gloves, so that they may shut off a gas valve in the case of a leak, even if there is a flame present; quick action in this regard can turn a potential catastrophe into a mere inconvenience. The pilot should additionally wear flame-resistant clothing covering their arms and legs; either natural fiber, such as cotton, linen, hemp, or wool, or engineered flame-retardant fiber, such as nomex, is acceptable in this capacity. Most engineered fibers (with the exception of rayon, which is also safe to wear) are thermoplastic; many are also hydrocarbons. This makes such fabrics very much unsuitable to wear near high temperatures, since non-flame-retardant thermoplastics will melt onto the wearer, and most hydrocarbons, whether fibrous or not, are suitable to use as fuels. Natural fiber will singe rather than melt or burn readily, and flame-retardant fiber generally has a very high melting point and is intrinsically non-flammable. Many pilots also advise their passengers to wear similar protective clothing that covers their arms and legs, as well as strong shoes or boots that offer good ankle support. Finally, some balloon systems, especially those that hang the burner from the envelope instead of supporting it rigidly from the basket, require the use of helmets by the pilot and passengers.\\r\\nThe ground crew should wear gloves whenever there is a possibility of handling ropes or lines. The mass and exposed surface to air movement of a medium-sized balloon is sufficient to cause rope friction burns to the hands of anyone trying to stop or prevent movement. The ground crew should also wear sturdy shoes and at least long pants in case of the need to access a landing or landed balloon in rough or overgrown terrain.\\r\\nAs with aircraft, hot air balloons require regular maintenance to remain airworthy. As aircraft made of fabric and that lack direct horizontal control, hot air balloons may occasionally require repairs to rips or snags. While some operations, such as cleaning and drying, may be performed by the owner or pilot, other operations, such as sewing, must be performed by a qualified repair technician and recorded in the balloon's maintenance log book.\\r\\nTo ensure long life and safe operation, the envelope should be kept clean and dry. This prevents mold and mildew from forming on the fabric and abrasion from occurring during packing, transport, and unpacking due to contact with foreign particles. In the event of a landing in a wet (because of precipitation or early morning or late evening dew) or muddy location (farmer's field), the envelope should be cleaned and laid out or hung to dry.\\r\\nThe burner and fuel system must also be kept clean to ensure safe operation on demand. Damaged fuel hoses need to be replaced. Stuck or leaky valves must be repaired or replaced. The wicker basket may require occasional refinishing or repair. The skids on its bottom may require occasional replacement.\\r\\nBalloons in most parts of the world are maintained in accordance with a fixed manufacturer's maintenance schedule that includes regular (100 flight hours or 12 month) inspections, in addition to maintenance work to correct any damage. In Australia, balloons used for carrying commercial passengers must be inspected and maintained by approved workshops.[48]\\r\\nIn the case of a snag, burn, or rip in the envelope fabric, a patch may be applied or the affected panel completely replaced. Patches may be held in place with glue, tape, stitching, or a combination of these techniques. Replacing an entire panel requires the stitching around the old panel to be removed, and a new panel to be sewn in with the appropriate technique, thread, and stitch pattern.\\r\\nDepending on the size of the balloon, location, and intended use, hot air balloons and their pilots need to comply with a variety of regulations.\\r\\nAs with other aircraft in the USA, balloons must be registered (have an N-number), have an airworthiness certificate, and pass annual inspections. Balloons below a certain size (empty weight of less than 155?pounds or 70?kg including envelope, basket, burners and empty fuel tanks) can be used as an ultralight aircraft.\\r\\nIn Australia, private balloon pilots are managed by the Australian Ballooning Federation[49] and typically become members of regional hot air ballooning clubs. Commercial operations carrying fare paying passengers or charging for promotional flights must operate under an Air Operators Certificate from the Australian Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) with a nominated Chief Pilot. Pilots must have different degrees of experience before they are allowed to progress to larger balloons. Hot air balloons must be registered aircraft with CASA and are subject to regular airworthiness checks by authorised personnel.[50]\\r\\nIn the UK, the person in command must hold a valid Private Pilot's Licence issued by the Civil Aviation Authority specifically for ballooning; this is known as the PPL(B). There are two types of commercial balloon licences: CPL(B) Restricted and CPL(B) (Full). The CPL(B) Restricted is required if the pilot is undertaking work for a sponsor or being paid by an external agent to operate a balloon. The pilot can fly a sponsored balloon with everything paid for with a PPL unless asked to attend any event. Then a CPL(B) Restricted is required. The CPL(B) is required if the pilot is flying passengers for money. The balloon then needs a transport category C of A (certificate of air worthiness). If the pilot is only flying sponsor's guests, and not charging money for flying other passengers, then the pilot is exempted from holding an AOC (air operator's certificate) though a copy of it is required.[clarification needed] For passenger flying the balloon also requires a maintenance log.\\r\\nIn the United States, a pilot of a hot air balloon must have a pilot certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and it must carry the rating of \\"Lighter-than-air free balloon\\", and unless the pilot is also qualified to fly gas balloons, will also carry this limitation: \\"Limited to hot air balloons with airborne heater\\". A pilot does not need a license to fly an ultralight aircraft, but training is highly advised, and some hot air balloons meet the criteria.\\r\\nTo carry paying passengers for hire (and attend some balloon festivals), a pilot must have a commercial pilot certificate. Commercial hot air balloon pilots may also act as hot air balloon flight instructors. While most balloon pilots fly for the pure joy of floating through the air, many are able to make a living as a professional balloon pilot. Some professional pilots fly commercial passenger sightseeing flights, while others fly corporate advertising balloons.[51]\\r\\nThe largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is Cameron Balloons company of Bristol, England, which also owns Lindstrand Balloons of Oswestry, England. Cameron Balloons, Lindstrand Balloons and another English balloon manufacturing company, Thunder and Colt (since acquired by Cameron), have been innovators and developers of special shaped balloons. These hot air balloons use the same principle of lift as conventional inverted teardrop shaped balloons but often sections of the special balloon envelope shape do not contribute to the balloon's ability to stay aloft.\\r\\nThe second largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is Ultramagic company, based in Spain, which produces from 80 to 120 balloons per year. Ultramagic can produce very large balloons, such as the N-500 that accommodates as many as 27 persons in the basket, and has also produced many balloons with special shapes, as well as cold-air inflatables.\\r\\nIn the USA Aerostar International, Inc. of Sioux Falls, South Dakota was North America's largest balloon manufacturer and a close second in world manufacturing before ceasing to build balloons in January 2007. The oldest U.S. certified manufacture is now Adams Balloons out of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Firefly Balloons, formerly The Balloon Works, is a manufacturer of hot-air balloons in Statesville, North Carolina. Another manufacturer is Head Balloons, Inc. of Helen, Georgia.\\r\\nThe major manufacturers in Canada are Sundance Balloons and Fantasy Sky Promotions. Other manufacturers include Kavanagh Balloons of Australia, Schroeder Fire Balloons of Germany, and Kubicek Balloons of the Czech Republic.","input":"When was the first hot air balloon launched?"},{"output":"Battle of Cajamarca","context":" Spanish Empire\\r\\n Spanish conquistadors\\r\\n Viceroyalty of Peru\\r\\nNative allies\\r\\nThe Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire was one of the most important campaigns in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. After years of preliminary exploration and military skirmishes, 180 Spanish soldiers under conquistador Francisco Pizarro, his brothers, and their native allies captured the Sapa Inca Atahualpa in the 1532 Battle of Cajamarca. It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory in 1572 and colonization of the region as the Viceroyalty of Peru. The conquest of the Inca Empire led to spin-off campaigns into present-day Chile and Colombia, as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin.\\r\\nWhen the Spanish arrived at the borders of the Inca Empire in 1528, it spanned a considerable area; by far the largest of the four grand pre-Columbian civilizations. Extending southward from the Ancomayo, which is now known as the Pata River, in southern present-day Colombia to the Maule River in what would later be known as Chile, and eastward from the Pacific Ocean to the edge of the Amazonian jungles, the empire covered some of the most mountainous terrain on Earth. In less than a century, the Inca had expanded their empire from about 400,000 km2 (155,000 sq mi) in 1448, to 1,800,000 km2 (690,000 sq mi) in 1528, just before the arrival of the Spanish. This vast area of land varied greatly in cultures and in climate. Because of the diverse cultures and geography, the Inca allowed many areas of the empire to be governed under the control of local leaders, who were watched and monitored by Inca officials. However, under the administrative mechanisms established by the Inca, all parts of the empire answered to, and were ultimately under the direct control of, the Emperor.[1] Scholars estimate that the population of the Inca Empire numbered more than 16,000,000.[2]\\r\\nSome scholars, such as Jared Diamond, believe that while the Spanish conquest was undoubtedly the proximate cause of the collapse of the Inca Empire, it may very well have been past its peak and already in the process of decline. In 1528, Emperor Huayna Capac ruled the Inca Empire. He could trace his lineage back to a \\"stranger king\\" named Manco Cpac, the mythical founder of the Inca clan,[3]:144 who according to tradition emerged from a cave in a region called Pacariqtambo.\\r\\nHuayna Capac was the son of the previous ruler, T~pac Inca, and the grandson of Pachacuti, the Emperor who, by conquest, had commenced the dramatic expansion of the Inca Empire from its cultural and traditional base in the area around Cuzco. On his accession to the throne, Huayna Capac had continued the policy of expansion by conquest, taking Inca armies north into what is today Ecuador.[3]:98 While he had to put down a number of rebellions during his reign, by the time of his death, his legitimacy was as unquestioned as was the primacy of Inca power.\\r\\nHowever, expansion had resulted in its own problems. Many parts of the empire maintained distinctive cultures and these were at best resistive participants in the imperial project. The large extent of the empire, the extremely difficult terrain of much of it, and the fact that all communication and travel had to take place on foot or by boat, seems to have caused increasing difficulty in the Incas' effective administration of the empire.\\r\\nHuayna Capac relied on his sons to support his reign. While he had many legitimate and illegitimate children (legitimate meaning born of his sister-wife, under the Inca system), two sons are historically important. Prince T~pac Cusi Hualpa, also known as Huscar, was the son of Coya Mama Rahua Occllo of the royal line. The second was Atahualpa, an illegitimate son who was likely born of a daughter of the last independent King of Quitu, one of the states conquered by Huayna Capac during the expansion of the Inca Empire.[2] These two sons would play pivotal roles in the final years of the Inca Empire.\\r\\nThe Spanish conquistador Pizarro and his men were greatly aided in their enterprise by invading when the Inca Empire was in the midst of a war of succession between the princes Huscar and Atahualpa.[3]:143 Atahualpa seems to have spent more time with Huayna Capac during the years when he was in the north with the army conquering Ecuador. Atahualpa was thus closer to, and had better relations with the army and its leading generals. When both Huayna Capac and his eldest son and designated heir, Ninan Cuyochic, died suddenly in 1528 from what was probably smallpox, a disease introduced by the Spanish into the Americas, the question of who would succeed as emperor was thrown open. Huayna had died before he could nominate the new heir.\\r\\nAt the time of Huayna Capac's death, Huscar was in the capital Cuzco, while Atahualpa was in Quitu with the main body of the Inca army. Huscar had himself proclaimed Sapa Inca (i.e. \\"Only Emperor\\") in Cuzco, but the army declared loyalty to Atahualpa. The resulting dispute led to the Inca Civil War.[3]:146ÿ149\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe civil war between Atahualpa and Huascar weakened the empire immediately prior to its struggle with the Spanish. Historians are unsure of whether a united Inca Empire could have defeated the Spanish in the long term due to factors such as the high mortality from disease and its related social disruption, and the superior military technology of the conquistadors, who possessed horses, dogs, metal armor, swords, cannons, and primitive, but effective, firearms.[5] Atahualpa appeared to be more popular with the people than his brother, and he was certainly more valued by the army, the core of which was based in the recently conquered northern province of Quitu.\\r\\nAt the outset of the conflict, each brother controlled his respective domains, with Atahualpa secure in the north, and Huscar controlling the capital of Cuzco and the large territory to the south, including the area around Lake Titicaca. This region had supplied large numbers of troops for Huscar's forces. After a period of diplomatic posturing and jockeying for position, open warfare broke out. Huscar seemed poised to bring the war to a rapid conclusion, as troops loyal to him took Atahualpa prisoner, while he was attending a festival in the city of Tumibamba. However, Atahualpa quickly escaped and returned to Quitu. There, he was able to amass what is estimated to be at least 30,000 soldiers. While Huscar managed to muster about the same number of soldiers, they were less experienced.\\r\\nAtahualpa sent his forces south under the command of two of his leading generals, Challcuchima and Quisquis, who won an uninterrupted series of victories that soon brought them to the very gates of Cuzco. On the first day of the battle for Cuzco, the forces loyal to Huscar gained an early advantage. However, on the second day, Huscar personally led an ill-advised \\"surprise\\" attack, of which the generals Challcuchima and Quisquis had advance knowledge. In the ensuing battle, Huscar was captured, and resistance completely collapsed. The victorious generals sent word north by chasqui messenger to Atahualpa, who had moved south from Quitu to the royal resort springs outside Cajamarca. The messenger arrived with news of the final victory on the same day that Pizarro and his small band of adventurers, together with some indigenous allies, descended from the Andes into the town of Cajamarca.\\r\\nFrancisco Pizarro and his brothers (Gonzalo, Juan, and Hernando) were attracted by the news of a rich and fabulous kingdom. They had left the then impoverished Extremadura, like many migrants after them.[3]:136\\r\\nIn 1529, Francisco Pizarro obtained permission from the Spanish Monarchy to conquer the land they called Peru.[3]:133\\r\\nAccording to historian Ra~l Porras Barrenechea, Peru is not a Quechuan nor Caribbean word, but Indo-Hispanic or hybrid. Unknown to Pizarro, as he was lobbying for permission to mount an expedition, his proposed enemy was being devastated by the diseases brought to the American continents during earlier Spanish contacts.\\r\\nWhen Pizarro arrived in Peru in 1532, he found it vastly different from when he had been there just five years before. Amid the ruins of the city of Tumbes, he tried to piece together the situation before him. From two young local boys whom he had taught how to speak Spanish in order to translate for him, Pizarro learned of the civil war and of the disease that was destroying the Inca Empire.[4]\\r\\nAfter four long expeditions, Pizarro established the first Spanish settlement in northern Peru, calling it San Miguel de Piura.[3]:153ÿ154\\r\\nWhen first spotted by the natives, Pizarro and his men were thought to be viracocha cuna or \\"gods\\". The Indians described Pizarro's men to the Inca. They said that capito was tall with a full beard and was completely wrapped in clothing. The Indians described the men's swords and how they killed sheep with them. The men did not eat human flesh, but rather sheep, lamb, duck, pigeons, and deer, and cooked the meat. Atahualpa was fearful of what the white men were capable of. If they were runa quicachac or \\"destroyers of peoples,\\" then he should flee. If they were viracocha cuna runa allichac or \\"gods who are benefactors of the people,\\" then he should not flee, but welcome them. The messengers went back to Tangarala, and Atahualpa sent Cinquinchara, an Orejon warrior, to the Spanish to serve as an interpreter.\\r\\nAfter traveling with the Spanish, Cinquinchara returned to Atahualpa; they discussed whether or not the Spanish men were gods. Cinquinchara decided they were men because he saw them eat, drink, dress, and have relations with women. He saw them produce no miracles. Cinquinchara informed Atahualpa that they were small in number, about 170ÿ180 men, and had bound the Indian captives with \\"iron ropes\\". When Atahualpa asked what to do about the strangers, Cinquinchara said that they should be killed because they were evil thieves who took whatever they wanted, and were supai cuna or \\"devils\\". He recommended trapping the men inside of their sleeping quarters and burning them to death.[6]\\r\\nAt this point, Pizarro had 168 men under his command: 106 on foot and 62 on horses. Pizarro sent his captain Hernando de Soto to invite Atahualpa to a meeting. Soto rode to meet Atahualpa on his horse, an animal that Atahualpa had never seen before. With one of his young interpreters, Soto read a prepared speech to Atahualpa telling him that they had come as servants of God to teach them the truth about God's word.[7] He said he was speaking to them so that they might\\r\\n\\"lay the foundation of concord, brotherhood, and perpetual peace that should exist between us, so that you may receive us under your protection and hear the divine law from us and all your people may learn and receive it, for it will be the greatest honor, advantage, and salvation to them all.\\"\\r\\nAtahualpa responded only after Hernando Pizarro arrived. He replied with what he had heard from his scouts, saying that Pizarro and his men were killing and enslaving countless numbers on the coast. Pizarro denied the report and Atahualpa, with limited information, reluctantly let the matter go. At the end of their meeting, the men agreed to meet the next day at Cajamarca.[4]\\r\\nAfter his victory and the death of his brother Huscar, Atahualpa was fasting in the Inca baths outside Cajamarca. Pizarro and his men reached that city on 15 November 1532.\\r\\nPizarro sent Hernando de Soto and Hernando Pizarro to the Inca leader's camp. Hernando Pizarro and De Soto explained they were emissaries of Emperor Charles I of Spain, to offer their services, and \\"impart to him the doctrines of the true faith.\\" Additionally, they invited the Incan leader to visit Pizarro at his quarters along the Cajamarca plaza. Atahuallpa replied that his fast would end the next day, when he would visit Pizarro. When De Soto noticed Atahualpa's interest in his horse, he put on a display of \\"excellent horsemanship\\" in close proximity. Atahualpa displayed hospitality by serving refreshments.[3]:166ÿ170[8]\\r\\nThe next morning, Pizarro had arranged an ambuscade around the Cajamarca plaza, where they were to meet. When Atahualpa arrived with about 6,000 unarmed followers, Friar Vincente de Valverde and Felipillo met them and proceeded to \\"expound the doctrines of the true faith\\" and seek his tribute as a vassal of King Charles. The unskilled translator likely contributed to problems in communication. The friar offered Atahualpa the Bible as the authority of what he had just stated. Atahualpa stated, \\"I will be no man's tributary.\\"[3]:173ÿ177\\r\\nThe friar urged attack, starting the Battle of Cajamarca on 16 November 1532. Though the historical accounts relating to these circumstances vary, the true Spanish motives for the attack seemed to be a desire for loot and flat-out impatience. The Inca likely did not adequately understand the conquistadors' demands.[9]\\r\\nAt the signal to attack, the Spaniards unleashed volleys of gunfire at the vulnerable mass of Incas and surged forward in a concerted action. The effect was devastating, the shocked Incas offered such feeble resistance that the battle has often been labeled a massacre, with the Inca losing 2,000 dead. Pizarro also used cavalry charges against the Inca forces, which stunned them in combination with gunfire.[3]:177ÿ179\\r\\nThe majority of Atahualpa's troops were in the Cuzco region along with Rumi?awi, Quisquis and Challcuchima, the two generals he trusted the most. This was a major disadvantage for the Inca. Their undoing also resulted from a lack of self-confidence, and a desire to make public demonstration of fearlessness and godlike command of situation.[8] The main view is that the Inca were eventually defeated due to inferior weapons, 'open battle' tactics, disease, internal unrest, the bold tactics of the Spanish, and the capture of their emperor. While Spanish armour was very effective against most of the Andean weapons, it was not impenetrable to maces, clubs, or slings.[10][11] However, ensuing hostilities such as the Mixt܇n Rebellion, Chichimeca War, and Arauco War would require that the conquistadors ally with friendly tribes in these later expeditions.\\r\\nThe battle began with a shot from a cannon and the battle cry \\"Santiago!\\"[8] Many of the guns used by the Spaniards were hard to use in the frequent close-combat situations. Most natives adapted in 'guerrilla fashion' by only shooting at the legs of the conquistadors if they happened to be unarmored.[12]\\r\\nDuring Atahualpa's captivity, the Spanish, although greatly outnumbered, forced him to order his generals to back down by threatening to kill him if he did not. According to the Spanish envoy's demands, Atahualpa offered to fill a large room with gold and promised the Spanish twice that amount in silver. While Pizarro ostensibly accepted this offer and allowed the gold to pile up, he had no intention of releasing the Inca; he needed Atahualpa's influence over his generals and the people in order to maintain the peace.\\r\\nWhen Atahualpa was captured at the massacre at Cajamarca, he was treated with respect, allowed his wives to join him, and the Spanish soldiers taught him the game of chess.[13]:215,234 Francisco Pizarro sent his brother Hernando to gather gold and silver from the temples in Pachacamac in January 1533, and on his return in March,[13]:237 captured Chalcuchimac in the Jauja Valley. Francisco Pizzaro sent a similar expedition to Cuzco, bringing back many gold plates from the Temple of the Sun. By February 1533, Almagro had joined Pizarro in Cajamarca with an additional 150 men with 50 horses.[3]:186ÿ194\\r\\nPizarro held Atahualpa for a ransom of gold and silver; the treasure began to be delivered from Cuzco on 20 December 1532 and flowed steadily from then on. By 3 May 1533 Pizarro received all the treasure he had requested; it was melted, refined, and made into bars.[8]\\r\\nThe question eventually came up of what to do with Atahualpa; both Pizarro and Soto were against killing him, but the other Spaniards were loud in their demands for death. False interpretations from the interpreter Felipillo made the Spaniards paranoid. They were told that Atahualpa had ordered secret attacks and his warriors were hidden in the surrounding area. Soto went with a small army to look for the hidden army, but a trial for Atahualpa was held in his absence. Among the charges were polygamy, incestuous marriage, and idolatry, all frowned upon in Catholicism but common in Inca culture and religion.\\r\\nThe men who were against Atahualpa's conviction and murder argued that he should be judged by King Charles since he was the sovereign prince. Atahualpa agreed to accept baptism to avoid being burned at the stake and in the hopes of one day rejoining his army and killing the Spanish; he was baptized as Francisco. On 29 August 1533 Atahualpa was garrotted and died a Christian. He was buried with Christian rites in the church of San Francisco at Cajamarca, but was soon disinterred. His body was taken, probably at his prior request, to its final resting place in Quito. Upon de Soto's return, he was furious; he had found no evidence of any secret gathering of Atahualpa's warriors.[8]\\r\\nPizarro advanced with his army of 500 Spaniards toward Cuzco, accompanied by Chalcuchimac. The latter was burned alive in the Jauja Valley, accused of secret communication with Quizquiz, and organizing resistance. Manco Inca Yupanqui joined Pizarro after the death of T~pac Huallpa. Pizarro's force entered the heart of the Tawantinsuyu on 15 November 1533.[3]:191,210,216\\r\\nBenalczar, Pizarro's lieutenant and fellow Extremaduran, had already departed from San Miguel with 140-foot soldiers and a few horses on his conquering mission to Ecuador. At the foot of Mount Chimborazo, near the modern city of Riobamba (Ecuador) he met and defeated the forces of the great Inca warrior Rumi?awi with the aid of Ca?ari tribesmen who served as guides and allies to the conquering Spaniards. Rumi?ahui fell back to Quito, and, while in pursuit of the Inca army, Benalczar was joined by five hundred men led by Guatemalan Governor Pedro de Alvarado. Greedy for gold, Alvarado had set sail for the south without the crown's authorization, landed on the Ecuadorian coast, and marched inland to the Sierra. Finding Quito empty of its treasures, Almagro soon joined the combined Spanish force. Alvarado agreed to sell his fleet of twelve ships, his forces, plus arms and ammunition, and returned to Guatemala.[3]:224ÿ227[13]:268ÿ284\\r\\nAfter Atahualpa's execution, Pizarro installed Atahualpa's brother, T~pac Huallpa, as a puppet Inca ruler, but he soon died unexpectedly, leaving Manco Inca Yupanqui in power. He began his rule as an ally of the Spanish and was respected in the southern regions of the empire, but there was still much unrest in the north near Quito where Atahualpa's generals were amassing troops. Atahualpa's death meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders. Led by Atahualpa's generals Rumi?ahui, Zope-Zupahua and Quisquis, the native armies were finally defeated, effectively ending any organized rebellion in the north of the empire.[3]:221ÿ223,226\\r\\nArchaeological evidence of the rebellion incident exists. The remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway near Lima in 2007. Forensic evidence suggests that the natives were killed by European weapons, probably during the uprising in 1536.[14]\\r\\nManco Inca initially had good relations with Francisco Pizarro and several other Spanish conquistadors. However, in 1535 he was left in Cuzco under the control of Pizarro's brothers, Juan and Gonzalo, who so mistreated Manco Inca that he ultimately rebelled. Under the pretense of recovering a statue of pure gold in the nearby Yucay valley, Manco was able to escape Cuzco.[3]:235ÿ237\\r\\nManco Inca hoped to use the disagreement between Almagro and Pizarro to his advantage and attempted the recapture of Cuzco starting in Feb. 1536. The siege of Cuzco was waged until the following spring, and during that time Manco's armies managed to wipe out four relief columns sent from Lima, but was ultimately unsuccessful in its goal of routing the Spaniards from the city. The Inca leadership did not have the full support of all its subject peoples and furthermore, the degrading state of Inca morale coupled with the superior Spanish siege weapons soon made Manco Inca realize his hope of recapturing Cuzco was failing. Manco Inca eventually withdrew to Tambo.[3]:239ÿ247\\r\\nAfter the Spanish regained control of Cuzco, Manco Inca and his armies retreated to the fortress at Ollantaytambo where he, for a time, successfully launched attacks against Pizarro based at Cuzco and even managed to defeat the Spanish in an open battle.[3]:247ÿ249\\r\\nWhen it became clear that defeat was imminent, Manco Inca retreated further to the mountainous region[3]:259 of Vilcabamba and established the small Neo-Inca State, where Manco Inca and his successors continued to hold some power for several more decades. His son, T~pac Amaru, was the last Inca. After deadly confrontations, he was murdered by the Spanish in 1572.\\r\\nIn total, the conquest took about forty years to complete. Many Inca attempts to regain the empire had occurred, but none had been successful. Thus the Spanish conquest was achieved through relentless force, and deception, aided by factors like smallpox and a great communication and cultural divide. The Spaniards destroyed much of the Incan culture and introduced the Spanish culture to the native population.\\r\\nA struggle for power resulted in a long civil war between Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro in which Almagro was killed. Almagro's loyal followers and his descendants later avenged his death by killing Pizarro in 1541. This was done inside the palace of Francisco Pizarro in a fight to the death by these assassins, most of which were former soldiers of Diego de Almagro who were stripped of title and belongings after his death.[15]\\r\\nDespite the war, the Spaniards did not neglect the colonizing process. Spanish royal authority on these territories was consolidated by the creation of an Audiencia Real, a type of appellate court. In January 1535, Lima was founded, from which the political and administrative institutions were to be organized. In 1542, the Spanish created the Viceroyalty of New Castile, that shortly after would be called Viceroyalty of Peru. Nevertheless, the Viceroyalty of Peru was not organized until the arrival of a later Viceroy Francisco de Toledo in 1572. Toledo ended the indigenous Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba, executing the Inca T~pac Amaru. He promoted economic development using commercial monopoly and built up the extraction from the silver mines of Potos, using slavery based on the Inca institution of forced labor for mandatory public service called mita.\\r\\nThe integration of Spanish culture into Peru was carried out not only by Pizarro and his other captains, but also by the many Spanish who also came to Peru to exploit its riches and inhabit its land. These included many different kinds of immigrants such as Spanish merchants, peasants, artisans, and Spanish women. Another element that the Spanish brought with them were African slaves to work alongside captive Incas for use in labor with things such as agriculture and mining for silver.[16] These people all brought with them their own pieces of Spanish culture to integrate into Peruvian society.\\r\\nThe arrival of the Spanish even had effects on the coastal geography of Peru, since the shores were uninhabited after the Incas that previously lived there were either killed or relocated to another area by the Spanish.[17]\\r\\nAlmost nothing was left of the Inca civilizations after the conquest by the Spanish, as culture was not as significant as gold to the new conquerors. The unique indigenous road and communications systems were essentially lost. The only things that persisted of the original culture are the very few artifacts that remained and the minute cultural aspects, such as language, that was left behind by the small percentage of Incas who persisted.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe long-term effects of the arrival of the Spanish on the population of South America were simply catastrophic. While this is the case for every group of Native-Americans that encountered Europeans from the fifteenth century onwards, the Incan population suffered a dramatic and quick decline following contact. It is estimated that parts of the empire, notably the Central Andes, suffered a population decline ratio of 58:1 during the years of 1520ÿ1571.[18]\\r\\nThe single greatest cause of the decimation of native populations was infectious disease. Old World Eurasian diseases, which had long been endemic on the Continent, were carried unknowingly by colonists and conquistadors. As these were new to the natives, they had no acquired immunity and suffered very high rates of death. More died of disease than any army or armed conflict.[19] As the Inca did not have as strong a writing tradition as the Aztec or Maya, it is difficult for historians to estimate population decline or any events after conquest. But, it is apparent that the Inca began to contract the diseases several years before the Spanish appeared in the region, as it was likely carried to their empire by traders and travelers. The outbreak, believed to be hemorrhagic smallpox, reached the Andes in 1524. While numbers are unavailable, Spanish records indicate that the population was so devastated by disease that they could hardly resist the foreign forces.\\r\\nHistorians differ as to whether the illness of the 1520s was smallpox; a minority of scholars claim that the epidemic was due to an indigenous illness called Carrion's disease. In any case, a 1981 study by N. D. Cook the shows that the Andes suffered from three separate population declines during colonization. The first was of 30ÿ50 percent during the first outbreak of smallpox. When a measles outbreak occurred, there was another decline of 25ÿ30 percent. Finally, when smallpox and measles epidemics occurred together, which occurred from 1585 to 1591, a decline of 30ÿ60 percent occurred. Collectively these declines amounted to a decline of 93 percent from the pre-contact population in the Andes region.[20]\\r\\nBeyond the devastation of the local populations by disease, they suffered considerable enslavement, pillaging and destruction from warfare. The Spanish took thousands of women from the local natives to use as servants and concubines. As Pizarro and his men took over portions of South America, they plundered and enslaved countless people. Some local populations entered into vassalage willingly, to defeat the Inca. Native groups such as the Huanca, Ca?ari and Chachapoya fought alongside the Spanish as they opposed Inca rule. The basic policy of the Spanish towards local populations was that voluntary vassalage would yield safety and coexistence, while continued resistance would result in more deaths and destruction.[21]\\r\\nAnother significant effect on the people in South America was the spread of Christianity. As Pizarro and the Spanish subdued the continent and brought it under their control, they forcefully converted many to Christianity, claiming to have educated them in the ways of the \\"one true religion.\\" With the depopulation of the local populations along with the capitulation of the Inca Empire, the Spanish missionary work after colonization began was able to continue unimpeded. It took just a generation for the entire continent to be under Christian influence.[2]\\r\\nPeter Shaffer's play The Royal Hunt of the Sun (1964) dramatizes the conquest of the Incas. In the play, Pizarro, Atahualpa, Valverde and other historical figures appear as characters.\\r\\nMatthew Reilly's novel Temple, is set at the siege of Cuzco. Many historical figures are mentioned, and a (fictional) brother of Pizarro is noted to be in pursuit of the protagonist. The conquest is also used as a \\"starting point of the cat.\\"\\r\\nThe Inca are featured in the third Campaign in Age of Empires 3, having a Lost City hidden in the Andes. They are also in the Multiplayer, found primarily in the areas making up Chile and Argentina.\\r\\nThe conquest is parodied in The Simpsons TV series, in the chapter \\"Lost Verizon\\", written by John Frink.[22]\\r\\nPizarro and his fellow conquistadors feature as antagonists in the 1982 animated serial The Mysterious Cities of Gold.\\r\\nI wish Your Majesty to understand the motive that moves me to make this statement is the peace of my conscience and because of the guilt I share.

And to think that God should have permitted something so great to remain hidden from the world for so long in history, unknown to men, and then let it be found, discovered and won all in our own time!\\r\\nThe houses are more than two hundred paces in length, and very well built, being surrounded by strong walls, three times the height of a man. The roofs are covered with straw and wood, resting on the walls. The interiors are divided into eight rooms, much better built than any we had seen before. Their walls are of very well cut stones and each lodging is surrounded by its masonry wall with doorways, and has its fountain of water in an open court, conveyed from a distance by pipes, for the supply of the house. In front of the plaza, towards the open country, a stone fortress is connected with it by a staircase leading from the square to the fort. Towards the open country there is another small door, with a narrow staircase, all within the outer wall of the plaza. Above the town, on the mountain side, where the houses commence, there is another fort on a hill, the greater part of which is hewn out of the rock. This is larger than the other, and surrounded by three walls, rising spirally.","input":"What led to the downfall of the incan empire?"},{"output":"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child is a two-part stage play written by Jack Thorne based on an original story by Thorne, J.

The slogan is printed on the tickets for the play and badges with the slogan are handed out for free during intervals. People buying their tickets online are emailed a video after the play from J.K. Rowling asking them to support the campaign.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the opening scene, set during the epilogue of Deathly Hallows in the year 2017, Harry Potter and Ginny Potter send their second son, Albus Severus Potter, on the Hogwarts Express to begin his first year at Hogwarts. Harry is now working in a desk job as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Magic, while Ginny is the editor of the sports section of The Daily Prophet. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger also send their daughter Rose Granger-Weasley on the train. Hermione is now Minister of Magic, while Ron manages Weasley's Wizard Wheezes in Diagon Alley. Albus makes an unlikely friendship in Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Harry's former nemesis Draco Malfoy and Astoria Malfoy (ne  Greengrass). The school is stunned when, in a break with the tradition of Potters being sorted into Gryffindor, Albus is sorted into Slytherin alongside Scorpius.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth boys are bullied by other students over the next few years, Albus due to his perceived failure to live up to his parents, Scorpius due to unproven rumours that he is the son of Lord Voldemort. In addition, Albus and Harry begin to drift apart, owing to Albus's struggles with his father's shadow and Harry's uncertainty on how to deal with his son's issues. Albus also drifts apart from Rose, with whom he was friends before meeting Scorpius and was sorted into Gryffindor. Prior to Albus and Scorpius's fourth year, Albus gets into a fight with his father after he is given Harry's baby blanket and a love potion from Ron. During the fight, Harry accidentally says that he sometimes wishes Albus was not his son, and Albus spills the potion on the blanket.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry obtains a prototype of a more powerful version of the Time-Turner, built by a Slytherin contemporary of Harry's, Theodore Nott, that allows one to travel back several years into the past and change history. Simultaneously, Harry's scar begins to hurt again, causing him to become concerned that Voldemort may somehow be returning. Amos Diggory, who has become old and is cared for by his niece, Delphi Diggory, asks Harry to use the Time-Turner to prevent the death of his son, Cedric Diggory. After overhearing Harry refuse to help the Diggorys, Albus is inspired to do so himself and convinces Scorpius to help him. The two escape from the Hogwarts Express and the trolley operator, who is revealed to be a monster placed on the train to prevent students from escaping. The two arrive at St.?Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards in Yorkshire, where Amos lives, and team up with Delphi to steal the Time-Turner from Hermione's office, in the Ministry of Magic, while disguised with Polyjuice Potion.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowing that Cedric's death was the result of him winning the Triwizard Tournament alongside Harry, the boys use the Time-Turner to travel back to the first challenge of the Triwizard Tournament in 1994 and sabotage Cedric during the tournament's first task in the hope of preventing his victory. Instead, they only succeed in creating an alternate reality in which Ron and Hermione never married, and thus Rose was never born, and Albus was sorted into Gryffindor. Albus discovers that this was because they chose to disguise themselves as Durmstrang students, causing Hermione to become suspicious of Viktor Krum and go to the Yule Ball with Ron instead of Viktor. As a result, Ron never experienced the jealousy fundamental to his relationship with Hermione, fell in love with Padma Patil at the Ball, and eventually became married to her, having a son named Panju. Hermione, in turn, became a frustrated and mean professor at Hogwarts, teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt around the same time, Harry's fear increases that Voldemort may return as his scar continues to hurt and as he has Voldemort-related nightmares. After speaking with a portrait of Dumbledore, and being told by centaur Bane that a \\"dark cloud\\" is around Albus, he becomes convinced that Scorpius is a threat to Albus and tries to have the boys kept apart at Hogwarts by forcing a reluctant Minerva McGonagall, now Headmistress of Hogwarts, to keep tabs on Albus using the Marauder's Map, threatening to shut down the school otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus and Scorpius's friendship is destroyed, but the two eventually reconcile after Albus steals Harry's old Invisibility Cloak from James Sirius (Albus older brother), and after McGonagall refuses to enforce Harry's request. Harry himself is persuaded to relent after a conversation with Draco and Ginny. Meanwhile, Albus and Scorpius decide to make another attempt to use the Time-Turner to change Cedric's fate, this time by humiliating him during the Triwizard Tournament's second task. When Scorpius returns to the present day, however, Albus is not with him, and Scorpius finds himself in a reality in which Harry is dead, and Lord Voldemort rules the wizarding world.\\r\\n\\r\\nScorpius discovers that ÿ as a result of his actions ÿ an embittered Cedric joined the Death Eaters and killed Neville Longbottom during the events of Deathly Hallows, preventing him from killing Nagini and allowing Voldemort to win the Battle of Hogwarts. With Harry now dead, Albus subsequently never existed, while Voldemort was able to completely consolidate power and transform the Ministry of Magic into a dictatorial regime. In the new timeline, Scorpius became a popular Head Boy and Quidditch star, helping the staff and students torment Muggle-borns. Dolores Umbridge became the new Headmistress of Hogwarts, and patrols the school with Dementors and a revived Inquisitorial Squad led by Scorpius. Draco Malfoy occupies Harry's old position as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement, using his post to encourage routine attacks on Muggles and bribe the Prime Minister to remain silent on the actions of the Death Eaters.\\r\\n\\r\\nA powerful dark figure called \\"The Augurey\\" leads the Ministry of Magic. With help from Ron, Hermione, and Severus Snape, now the final members of a dwindling anti-Voldemort resistance movement, Scorpius is able to use the Time-Turner to prevent the interference of Albus and his past self and restore the events of the original timeline, the alternate Ron, Hermione, and Snape sacrificing themselves to the Dementors in order to allow him to do so. Scorpius reunites with Albus, and the two boys are eventually found by their parents, as well as Ron and Hermione. Following these events, Harry scolds Albus for his actions, but the two nevertheless begin to reconcile.\\r\\n\\r\\nRealising the danger the Time-Turner poses and deciding their parents will continue to keep it (as Hermione had done in the Ministry of Magic), Scorpius and Albus attempt to destroy it themselves, but they are joined by Delphi Diggory. Scorpius realizes that Delphi was in charge of the Ministry of Magic in the alternate timeline (from her tattoo of the wings of a magical bird, which she says is called an Augurey), and she takes them captive, later revealing her intention of restoring the alternate timeline.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the adults learn Albus and Scorpius were seen disappearing with Delphi, they confront Amos, only to discover Delphi is not his niece, but the daughter of Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange. Delphi had placed Amos under a \\"confundus\\" charm.  Searching her room, they discover she is following a prophecy that, if fulfilled, would lead to Lord Voldemort's return. Delphi takes the boys to the final challenge of the Triwizard Tournament, but Albus and Scorpius prevent her from acting, and Delphi uses the Time-Turner again to travel further back in time. She inadvertently takes the boys with her and then destroys the Time-Turner to leave them all stranded in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbandoned by Delphi, Albus and Scorpius discover they have been taken back to the night before Harry's parents were killed at Godric's Hollow (30?October 1981), and assume Delphi is planning to kill Harry before Voldemort attempts to do so (which severely weakens Voldemort). Albus and Scorpius write an invisible message on Harry's baby blanket, knowing in the present (which is now also the night of the anniversary of the death of Harry's parents, when he often looks for his blanket as it is the only physical memento he has), the blanket would become stained with love potion and expose the message to Harry.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Draco reveals the Time-Turner was actually a prototype for a perfected model owned by him (it was made for his father), but they remain unable to rescue the boys due to their uncertainty over which time period they have entered. After Harry receives the message from the boys, he and his allies use Draco's Time-Turner to travel back in time to save them and stop Delphi. While waiting for Delphi, they deduce she intends to convince Voldemort to abandon his doomed attempt to kill Harry, ensuring her father's survival and allowing her to be with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry disguises himself as Voldemort using Transfiguration to distract Delphi, and after a struggle, the group manages to subdue her. Rather than killing Delphi, it is decided that she will be brought to Azkaban Prison. Lord Voldemort then appears and is oblivious to the presence of Harry and the group. The group allows the murder of Harry's parents to play out again, unwilling to risk the consequences of altering the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all stand with Harry to watch the sad event replay. After returning to the present day, Delphi is sent to Azkaban. Albus and Scorpius now decide to be more active at Hogwarts, with Scorpius expressing interest in trying out for Quidditch and asking Rose on a date. Harry and Albus visit Cedric's grave, with Harry apologizing for his role in Cedric's death. Albus has also witnessed the death of a fellow student, Craig Bowker?Jr. (the only current timeline murder in the play), who tried to intervene when Delphi held Albus and Scorpius captive on the Quidditch pitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child, a two-part play, was written by British playwright Jack Thorne based on an original story by Thorne, John Tiffany and Rowling. Some websites were listing all three as authors of the script[22] but by 26 July 2016, the official web site for the play[23] and many others (including the BBC)[24] were listing Thorne as the sole script writer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child is directed by John Tiffany[25][26] with choreography by Steven Hoggett,[27] set design by Christine Jones,[28] costume design by Katrina Lindsay,[29] lighting design by Neil Austin,[30] music by Imogen Heap,[31] and sound design by Gareth Fry.[32] In addition, special effects were created by Jeremy Chernick,[33] with illusions by Jamie Harrison, and musical supervision by Martin Lowe.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviews at the West End Palace Theatre, London began on 7 June 2016,[2] with the official opening night for both parts on 30 July,[35] and originally booking until 18?September 2016.[36] Tickets went on sale to pre-registered priority bookers on 28?October 2015, with a public sale scheduled to commence on 30?October.[37] In just under 8?hours of priority booking 175,000 tickets were sold for the world premiere production,[38] with the play's booking period extended to January 2017.[39] On commencement of the public sale booking was extended until 30?April 2017,[40] with a further extension issued the same day to 27?May 2017.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nTickets for the opening performance were priced from S30 up to S130 for a ticket for both parts,[42] although ticket resale agencies were selling seats for up to S3,000.[38] Ticket resale has been banned by the producers, with tickets no longer valid if sold on.[43] In mid-July?2016, the theatre began holding a ticket lottery at 1?pm each Friday, releasing 40 for sale on their website for some of the best seats in the theatre for the lowest price, advertised at S20?per part. For example, the \\"Friday Forty\\" tickets sold on 29?July 2016 were for performances on 3, 5, 6, and 7?August.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 20?December 2015, initial casting was announced with Jamie Parker playing Harry Potter, Noma Dumezweni playing Hermione Granger and Paul Thornley playing Ron Weasley.[45][46][47] The casting of the dark-skinned Noma Dumezweni as Hermione sparked fervent discussion, to which Rowling responded that Hermione's skin was never specified as white.[48][49] Further notable casting includes Poppy Miller as Ginny Potter, Alex Price as Draco Malfoy, Sam Clemmett as Albus Severus Potter and Anthony Boyle as Scorpius Malfoy.[50] The production features an overall cast of 42.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production began previews on 16 March 2018, officially opening on 22 April at the Lyric Theatre. Clemmett, Boyle, Dumezweni, Miller, Parker, Price and Thornley reprised their roles, from the West End.[53][54] The theatre removed 400 seats from the auditorium and moved the entrance to 43rd Street.[55] The production is produced by Sonia Friedman Productions,?Sir Colin Callender, and Harry Potter Theatrical Productions. Tickets initially went on sale through Ticketmaster Verified Fan on 18 October 2017, for performances from 16 March through 18 November 2018.[56]  The New York Times estimates that it is the most expensive non-musical Broadway play ever, incurring $68 million in opening costs.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 24 October 2017, the Michael Cassel Group announced that it will be producing the Australian premiere of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The show will open on 16 January 2019 in Melbourne's Princess Theatre, where it will reportedly have an exclusive two-year residency.[58][59] Presale tickets were released on 2 August 2018, selling more than 200,000 tickets in just four days, before the public sale tickets were released.[60][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 35 original Australian adult cast was revealed on 2 September and includes Gareth Reeves as Harry Potter, Paula Arundell as Hermione Granger, Gyton Grantley as Ron Weasley, Lucy Goleby as Ginny Potter, Sean Rees-Wemyss as Albus Potter, Tom Wren as Draco Malfoy and William McKenna as Scorpius Malfoy. The roles of the remaining supporting cast will remain unannounced until the show opens to \\"honour its 'keep the secret' message (and) to ensure the storyline doesn't slip out\\".[61] The production will also feature seven child performers. Four boys will alternate the roles of Young Harry and three girls will portray Luna Potter.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth parts of the stage play's script have been released in print and digital formats as Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts I & II.[67][68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first edition, entitled \\"Special Rehearsal Edition\\", corresponded to the script used in the preview shows and was scheduled to be published on 31 July 2016,[69] the date of Harry's birthday in the series and Rowling's birthday, as well.[70] Since revisions to the script continued after the book was printed, an edited version was released on 25 July 2017, as the \\"Definitive Collector's Edition\\".[71] According to CNN, this was the most preordered book of 2016.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States and Canada, the book sold over 2 million copies in its first two days of release.[73] 847,885 copies were sold during the book's first week of release in the United Kingdom. By June 2017, the book had sold over 4.5 million copies in the United States.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child has received critical acclaim. Some audiences and critics have complimented the casting and performances, while many debate the quality of the piece and how it compares to entries in the main Harry Potter series.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublications awarding five star ratings included The Independent, the London Evening Standard, The Stage and WhatsOnStage.com.[75][76][77][78] The Telegraph also gave five, although \\"there are some quibbles,\\" while The Guardian's Michael Billington awarded four stars.[79][80]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthony Boyle's performance as Scorpius Malfoy garnered particular acclaim. WhatsOnStage.com wrote that \\"Boyle gives a career-making performance,\\" while The Wall Street Journal described him as \\"the break-out performance\\".[78][81] Variety's critic, Matt Trueman, agreed, writing, \\"it's Boyle who really stands out\\", and both Trueman and Henry Hitchings, in the Evening Standard, noted that his performance was sure to be a fan favourite.[76][82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe response to the play from the Harry Potter fandom was mixed. Some fans said the story seemed \\"like a work of fan fiction\\" and claimed that it diverged from previously established rules of the universe, criticising the script's characterisation.[83][84][85] Some also took issue with the style and plot of the script, complaining that the Time-Turner storylines had already been used, as had Cedric Diggory's death, and that the writers were rehashing old storylines.[86][87] These criticisms have led to some of the fandom rejecting the play as separate from the Potter canon.[88] Some potential plot holes in the story have been highlighted, such as the likelihood of Lord Voldemort's infertility, the speed at which the Polyjuice Potion is created, the unexplained non-operation of the Fidelius Charm,[89][90] and Cedric Diggory's dramatic turn to becoming a Death Eater.[91][92]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, some fans responded positively to the play and its characters, with Scorpius Malfoy being particularly popular.[93] Some fans commented that the dialogue between the familiar characters was \\"spot on\\",[94] celebrating it as a faithful continuation of the books.[95][96] Others have noted that the play sheds light on some of the relationships between the characters, such as Harry and Dumbledore's.[97] The response had been particularly positive among fans who watched the play on stage.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe play never explicitly states who the \\"Cursed Child\\" is. There are several possible answers, including Delphi, who is cursed by her parentage; Harry himself, whose difficult childhood is the subject of several flashbacks in the play and who must accept and relive the death of his parents to conquer Lord Voldemort; Albus, who at one stage Harry says he wished \\"was not his son\\" and can do no right in this father's eyes being \\"cursed\\" by the Potter reputation; Scorpius, who is rumoured to be Lord Voldemort's child and whose mother dies during the play; and Cedric Diggory, whose tragic death is a focus of the play, and whose death is also finally accepted as a necessary condition for future peace.[99]","input":"What is the new harry potter book called?"},{"output":"between 1886 and 1894","context":"Coordinates: 513020N 00432W? / ?51.50556N 0.07556W? / 51.50556; -0.07556\\r\\nTower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London built between 1886 and 1894. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of London, resulting in it sometimes being confused with London Bridge, situated some 0.5?mi (0.80?km) upstream. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges now owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. It is the only one of the Trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in Tower Hamlets.\\r\\nThe bridge consists of two bridge towers tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal tension forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. Before its restoration in the 2010s, the bridge's colour scheme dated from 1977, when it was painted red, white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. Its colours were subsequently restored to blue and white.[1][2]\\r\\nThe bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made. The nearest London Underground tube stations are Tower Hill on the Circle and District lines, London Bridge on the Jubilee and Northern lines and Bermondsey on the Jubilee line, and the nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway.[3] The nearest National Rail stations are at Fenchurch Street and London Bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second half of the 19th century, an advertisement in the East End of London led to a hiring for a new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by sailing ships to the port facilities in the Pool of London, between London Bridge and the Tower of London.\\r\\nA Special Bridge or Subway Committee was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution to the river crossing problem. It opened the design of the crossing to public competition.[citation needed] Over 50 designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. Bazalgette's design was rejected because of a lack of sufficient headroom, and design was not approved until 1884, when it was decided to build a bascule bridge. Sir John Wolfe Barry was appointed engineer with Sir Horace Jones as architect[4] (who was also one of the judges).[5] An Act of Parliament was passed in 1885 authorising the bridge's construction. It specified the opening span must give a clear width of 200 feet (61?m) and a headroom of 135 feet (41?m). Construction had to be in a Gothic style.[4]\\r\\nBarry designed a bascule bridge with two bridge towers built on piers. The central span was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways.[4]\\r\\nConstruction started in 1886 and took eight years with five major contractors ÿ Sir John Jackson (foundations), Baron Armstrong (hydraulics), William Webster, Sir H.H. Bartlett, and Sir William Arrol & Co.[6] ÿ and employed 432 construction workers. E W Crutwell was the resident engineer for the construction.[7]\\r\\nTwo massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete,[5] were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction. Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways.[5] This was then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone, both to protect the underlying steelwork and to give the bridge a pleasing appearance.\\r\\nJones died in 1886 and George D. Stevenson took over the project.[5] Stevenson replaced Jones's original brick fa?ade with the more ornate Victorian Gothic style, which makes the bridge a distinctive landmark, and was intended to harmonise the bridge with the nearby Tower of London.[7] The total cost of construction was S1,184,000[7] (equivalent to S122?million in 2015).[8]\\r\\nThe bridge was officially opened on 30 June 1894 by The Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII), and his wife, The Princess of Wales (Alexandra of Denmark).[9]\\r\\nThe bridge connected Iron Gate, on the north bank of the river, with Horselydown Lane, on the south ÿ now known as Tower Bridge Approach and Tower Bridge Road, respectively.[7] Until the bridge was opened, the Tower Subway ÿ 400?m to the west ÿ was the shortest way to cross the river from Tower Hill to Tooley Street in Southwark. Opened in 1870, Tower Subway was among the world's earliest underground (\\"tube\\") railways, but it closed after just three months and was re-opened as a pedestrian foot tunnel. Once Tower Bridge was open, the majority of foot traffic transferred to using the bridge, there being no toll to pay to use it. Having lost most of its income, the tunnel was closed in 1898.[10]\\r\\nThe high-level open air walkways between the towers gained an unpleasant reputation as a haunt for prostitutes and pickpockets; as they were only accessible by stairs they were seldom used by regular pedestrians, and were closed in 1910.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring the Second World War and as a precaution against the existing engines being damaged by enemy action, a third engine was installed in 1942: a 150?hp horizontal cross-compound engine, built by Vickers Armstrong Ltd. at their Elswick works in Newcastle upon Tyne. It was fitted with a flywheel having a 9-foot (2.7?m) diameter and weighing 9 tons, and was governed to a speed of 30 rpm. The engine became redundant when the rest of the system was modernised in 1974, and was donated to the Forncett Industrial Steam Museum by the Corporation of the City of London.[11]\\r\\nIn 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new electro-hydraulic drive system, designed by BHA Cromwell House, with the original final pinions driven by modern hydraulic motors and gearing. In 1982, the Tower Bridge Exhibition opened, housed in the bridge's twin towers, the long-closed high-level walkways and the Victorian engine rooms. The latter still house the original steam engines and some of the original hydraulic machinery.[12][13][14]\\r\\nA computer system was installed in 2000 to control the raising and lowering of the bascules remotely. It proved unreliable, resulting in the bridge being stuck in the open or closed positions on several occasions during 2005 until its sensors were replaced.[15]\\r\\nIn April 2008 it was announced that the bridge would undergo a 'facelift' costing S4?million, and taking four years to complete. The work entailed stripping off the existing paint down to bare metal and repainting in blue and white.[1][2] Each section was enshrouded in scaffolding and plastic sheeting to prevent the old paint falling into the Thames and causing pollution. Starting in mid-2008, contractors worked on a quarter of the bridge at a time to minimise disruption, but some road closures were inevitable. It is intended that the completed work will stand for 25 years.[16]\\r\\nThe renovation of the walkway interior was completed in mid-2009. Within the walkways a versatile new lighting system has been installed, designed by Eleni Shiarlis, for when the walkways are in use for exhibitions or functions. The new system provides for both feature and atmospheric lighting, the latter using bespoke RGB LED luminaires, designed to be concealed within the bridge superstructure and fixed without the need for drilling (these requirements as a result of the bridge's Grade I status).[17]\\r\\nThe renovation of the four suspension chains was completed in March 2010 using a state-of-the-art coating system requiring up to six different layers of 'paint'.[18]\\r\\nThe bridge featured in publicity for the 2012 Summer Olympics being held in London. In June 2012 a set of Olympic rings was suspended from the bridge to mark one month to go until the start of the games. The rings cost S259,817 to make, measured 25 by 11.5 metres (82 by 38?ft) and weighed 13 tonnes (14 short tons).[19]\\r\\nOn 8 July 2012, the west walkway was transformed into a 200-foot-long (61?m) Live Music Sculpture by the British composer Samuel Bordoli. 30 classical musicians were arranged along the length of the bridge 138 feet (42?m) above the Thames behind the Olympic rings. The sound travelled backwards and forwards along the walkway, echoing the structure of the bridge.[20][21]\\r\\nFollowing the Olympics, the rings were removed from Tower Bridge and replaced by the emblem of the Paralympic Games for the 2012 Summer Paralympics.[22]\\r\\nTower Bridge was closed to all road traffic for almost three months in late 2016 (1 October to 30 December).[23] This was to allow structural maintenance work to take place. The work included:\\r\\nDuring this time the bridge was still open to water borne traffic as required by Act of Parliament. The bridge was open to pedestrians for all but three weekends, where a free ferry service was in operation.\\r\\nThe bridge is 800 feet (240?m) in length with two towers each 213 feet (65?m) high, built on piers. The central span of 200 feet (61?m) between the towers is split into two equal bascules or leaves, which can be raised to an angle of 86 degrees to allow river traffic to pass. The bascules, weighing over 1,000 tons each, are counterbalanced to minimise the force required and allow raising in five minutes.\\r\\nThe two side-spans are suspension bridges, each 270 feet (82?m) long, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways. The pedestrian walkways are 143 feet (44?m) above the river at high tide.[7]\\r\\nThe main bridge deck carries two lanes of road traffic between two low-level pedestrian walkways across both suspension spans and the opening bascule section of the bridge, with the walkways separated from the roadway by fences. The roadway passes through each of the two towers, whereas the low-level walkways pass around the outside of the towers.\\r\\nOne of the chimneys on the bridge, which are often confused as lamp posts, connects up to an old fireplace in a guardroom of the Tower of London. It is long-disused.[24]\\r\\nThe original raising mechanism was powered by pressurised water stored in several hydraulic accumulators.[25] The system was designed and installed by Hamilton Owen Rendel[26] while working for Sir W. G. Armstrong Mitchell & Company of Newcastle upon Tyne. Water, at a pressure of 750?psi (5.2?MPa), was pumped into the accumulators by two 360?hp (270?kW) horizontal twin-tandem compound stationary steam engines, fitted with Meyer expansion slide valves. Each engine drove a force pump from its piston tail rod. The accumulators each comprise a 20-inch (51?cm) ram on which sits a very heavy weight to maintain the desired pressure.\\r\\nThe entire hydraulic system along with the gas lighting system was installed by William Sugg & Co Ltd., the well known Westminster gas engineers. The gas lighting was initially by open flame burners within the lanterns but soon after was updated to the later incandescent system.[27]\\r\\nIn 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new electro-hydraulic drive system, designed by BHA Cromwell House.[12] The only components of the original system still in use are the final pinions, which engage with the racks fitted to the bascules. These are driven by modern hydraulic motors and gearing, using oil rather than water as the hydraulic fluid.[13] Some of the original hydraulic machinery has been retained, although it is no longer in use. It is open to the public and forms the basis for the bridge's museum, which resides in the old engine rooms on the south side of the bridge. The museum includes the steam engines, two of the accumulators and one of the hydraulic engines that moved the bascules, along with other related artefacts.\\r\\nTo control the passage of river traffic through the bridge, a number of different rules and signals were employed. Daytime control was provided by red semaphore signals, mounted on small control cabins on either end of both bridge piers. At night, coloured lights were used, in either direction, on both piers: two red lights to show that the bridge was closed, and two green to show that it was open. In foggy weather, a gong was sounded as well.[7]\\r\\nVessels passing through the bridge had to display signals too: by day, a black ball at least 2 feet (0.61?m) in diameter was to be mounted high up where it could be seen; by night, two red lights in the same position. Foggy weather required repeated blasts from the ship's steam whistle. If a black ball was suspended from the middle of each walkway (or a red light at night) this indicated that the bridge could not be opened. These signals were repeated about 1,000 yards (910?m) downstream, at Cherry Garden Pier, where boats needing to pass through the bridge had to hoist their signals/lights and sound their horn, as appropriate, to alert the Bridge Master.[7]\\r\\nSome of the control mechanism for the signalling equipment has been preserved and may be seen working in the bridge's museum.\\r\\nTower Bridge is still a busy crossing of the Thames: it is crossed by over 40,000 people (motorists, cyclists and pedestrians) every day.[15] The bridge is on the London Inner Ring Road, and is on the eastern boundary of the London congestion charge zone. (Drivers do not incur a charge by crossing the bridge.)\\r\\nTo maintain the integrity of the structure, the City of London Corporation has imposed a 20-mile-per-hour (32?km/h) speed restriction, and an 18 tonnes (20 short tons) weight limit on vehicles using the bridge. A camera system measures the speed of traffic crossing the bridge, using a number plate recognition system to send fixed penalty charges to speeding drivers.[29]\\r\\nA second system monitors other vehicle parameters. Induction loops and piezoelectric sensors are used to measure the weight, the height of the chassis above ground level, and the number of axles of each vehicle.[29]\\r\\nThe bascules are raised around 1000 times a year.[30] River traffic is now much reduced, but it still takes priority over road traffic. Today, 24 hours' notice is required before opening the bridge, and opening times are published in advance on the bridge's website.[31] There is no charge for vessels to open the bridge.\\r\\nWhen needing to be raised for the passage of a vessel the bascules are only raised to an angle sufficient for the vessel to safely pass under the bridge, except in the case of a vessel with the Monarch on board in which case they are raised fully no matter the size of the vessel.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Tower Bridge Exhibition is a display housed in the bridge's twin towers, the high-level walkways and the Victorian engine rooms. It uses films, photos and interactive displays to explain why and how Tower Bridge was built. Visitors can access the original steam engines that once powered the bridge bascules, housed in a building close to the south end of the bridge.[14]\\r\\nThe exhibition charges an admission fee. Entrance is from the west side of the bridge deck to the northern tower, from where visitors ascend to level 4 by lift before crossing the high-level walkways to the southern tower. In the towers and walkways is an exhibition on the history of the bridge. The walkways also provide views over the city, the Tower of London and the Pool of London, and include a glass-floored section. From the south tower, visitors can visit the engine rooms, with the original steam engines, which are situated in a separate building beside the southern approach to the bridge.[32]\\r\\nAlthough the bridge is an undoubted landmark, professional commentators in the early 20th century were critical of its aesthetics. \\"It represents the vice of tawdriness and pretentiousness, and of falsification of the actual facts of the structure\\", wrote Henry Heathcote Statham,[33] while Frank Brangwyn stated that \\"A more absurd structure than the Tower Bridge was never thrown across a strategic river\\".[34]\\r\\nArchitectural historian Dan Cruickshank selected the bridge as one of his four choices for the 2002 BBC television documentary series Britain's Best Buildings.[35]\\r\\nTower Bridge is often mistaken for London Bridge,[36] the next bridge upstream. A popular urban legend is that in 1968, Robert P. McCulloch, the purchaser of the old London Bridge that was later shipped to Lake Havasu City in Arizona, believed that he was in fact buying Tower Bridge. This was denied by McCulloch himself and has been debunked by Ivan Luckin, the vendor of the bridge.[37]\\r\\nA partial replica of Tower Bridge has been built in the city of Suzhou in China. The replica differs from the original in having no lifting mechanism and having four separate towers.[38]\\r\\nIn December 1952, the bridge opened while a number 78 double-decker bus was crossing from the south bank. At that time, the gateman would ring a warning bell and close the gates when the bridge was clear before the watchman ordered the raising of the bridge. The process failed while a relief watchman was on duty. The bus was near the edge of the south bascule when it started to rise; driver Albert Gunter made a split-second decision to accelerate, clearing a 3-foot (0.91?m) gap to drop 6 feet (1.8?m) onto the north bascule, which had not yet started to rise. There were no serious injuries.[39][40] Gunter was given S10 (equivalent to S260 in 2015[8]) by the City Corporation to honour his act of bravery.[41]\\r\\nThe Hawker Hunter Tower Bridge incident occurred on 5 April 1968 when a Royal Air Force Hawker Hunter FGA.9 jet fighter from No. 1 Squadron, flown by Flt Lt Alan Pollock, flew through Tower Bridge. Unimpressed that senior staff were not going to celebrate the RAF's 50th birthday with a fly-past, Pollock decided to do something himself. Without authorisation, Pollock flew the Hunter at low altitude down the Thames, past the Houses of Parliament, and continued on toward Tower Bridge. He flew the Hunter beneath the bridge's walkway, remarking afterwards that it was an afterthought when he saw the bridge looming ahead of him. Pollock was placed under arrest upon landing, and discharged from the RAF on medical grounds without the chance to defend himself at a court martial.[42][43]\\r\\nIn the summer of 1973, a single-engined Beagle Pup was twice flown under the pedestrian walkway of Tower Bridge by 29-year-old stockbroker's clerk Paul Martin. Martin was on bail following accusations of stockmarket fraud. He then \\"buzzed\\" buildings in The City, before flying north towards the Lake District where he died when his aircraft crashed some two hours later.[44]\\r\\nIn May 1997,[45] the motorcade of United States President Bill Clinton was divided by the opening of the bridge. The Thames sailing barge Gladys, on her way to a gathering at St Katharine Docks, arrived on schedule and the bridge was opened for her. Returning from a Thames-side lunch at Le Pont de la Tour restaurant with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, President Clinton was less punctual and arrived just as the bridge was rising. The bridge opening split the motorcade in two, much to the consternation of security staff. A spokesman for Tower Bridge is quoted as saying: \\"We tried to contact the American Embassy, but they wouldn't answer the phone.\\"[46]\\r\\nOn 19 August 1999, Jef Smith, a Freeman of the City of London, drove a flock of two sheep across the bridge. He was exercising a claimed ancient permission, granted as a right to Freemen, to make a point about the powers of older citizens and the way in which their rights were being eroded.[47]\\r\\nBefore dawn on 31 October 2003, David Crick, a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner, climbed a 100-foot (30?m) tower crane near Tower Bridge at the start of a six-day protest dressed as Spider-Man.[48] Fearing for his safety, and that of motorists should he fall, police cordoned off the area, closing the bridge and surrounding roads and causing widespread traffic congestion across the City and east London. The Metropolitan Police were later criticised for maintaining the closure for five days when this was not strictly necessary in the eyes of some citizens.[49][50]\\r\\nOn 11 May 2009, six people were trapped and injured after a lift fell 10 feet (3?m) inside the north tower.[51]\\r\\nCitations\\r\\nSources","input":"When was the tower bridge in london built?"},{"output":"The Avengers (2012)","context":"Thanos (UK: /?Ĳ?n?s/, US: /?Ĳ?no?s/) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Mike Friedrich and writer-artist Jim Starlin, the character first appeared in The Invincible Iron Man #55 (cover dated February 1973).\\r\\nThe character appears in various Marvel Cinematic Universe films, including The Avengers (2012), portrayed by Damion Poitier, and Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and its untitled sequel (2019), portrayed by Josh Brolin through voice and motion capture. The character has appeared in various comic adaptations, including animated television series, arcade, and video games.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWriter-artist Jim Starlin originally conceived of Thanos of Titan during college psychology classes. As Starlin described:\\r\\nI went to college between doing U.S. military service and getting work in comics, and there was a psych class and I came up with Thanos?... and Drax the Destroyer, but I'm not sure how he fit into it, just anger management probably. So I came up to Marvel and [editor] Roy [Thomas] asked if I wanted to do an issue of Iron Man. I felt that this may be my only chance ever to do a character, not having the confidence that my career was going to last anything longer than a few weeks. So they got jammed into it. Thanos was a much thinner character and Roy suggested beefing him up, so he's beefed up quite a bit from his original sketches?... and later on I liked beefing him up so much that he continued to grow in size.[2]\\r\\nStarlin has admitted the character's look was influenced by Jack Kirby's Darkseid:\\r\\nKirby had done the New Gods, which I thought was terrific. He was over at DC at the time. I came up with some things that were inspired by that. You'd think that Thanos was inspired by Darkseid, but that was not the case when I showed up. In my first Thanos drawings, if he looked like anybody, it was Metron. I had all these different gods and things I wanted to do, which became Thanos and the Titans. Roy took one look at the guy in the Metron-like chair and said: \\"Beef him up! If you're going to steal one of the New Gods, at least rip off Darkseid, the really good one!\\"[3]\\r\\nThanos' first appearance was in The Invincible Iron Man #55 (February 1973), featuring a story by Jim Starlin that was scripted by Mike Friedrich. The storyline from that issue continued through Captain Marvel #25ÿ33 (bi-monthly: March 1973 ÿ Jan. 1974), Marvel Feature #12 (Nov. 1973), Daredevil #107 (Jan. 1974), and Avengers #125 (July 1974). He returned in an extended storyline that spanned Strange Tales #178ÿ181 (Feb.ÿAug. 1975), Warlock #9-11 (Oct. 1975 ÿ Jan. 1976), Marvel Team Up #55 (March 1977), and the 1977 Annuals for Avengers and Marvel Two-in-One (Thanos does not actually appear until the end of Warlock #9). He was also featured in a short backup story in Logan's Run #6 (June 1977) and had a small role in the Death of Captain Marvel graphic novel (April 1982).\\r\\nThe character was revived in Silver Surfer vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990) and guest-starred until issue #59 (November 1991), while simultaneously appearing in The Thanos Quest #1ÿ2 (Sept.ÿOct. 1990) and The Infinity Gauntlet #1ÿ6 (JulyÿDec. 1991). After an appearance in Spider-Man #17 (Dec. 1991), Thanos had a recurring role in Warlock and the Infinity Watch #1ÿ42 (Feb. 1992 ÿ Aug. 1995). This was followed by crossover appearances in Infinity War #1ÿ6 (June?ÿ Nov. 1992), Infinity Crusade #1ÿ6 (June?ÿ Nov. 1993), Silver Surfer vol. 3, #86ÿ88 (Nov. 1993?ÿ Jan. 1994), Warlock Chronicles #6ÿ8, Thor #468ÿ471 (Nov. 1993?ÿ Feb. 1994), Namor The Sub-Mariner #44 (Nov. 1993), Secret Defenders #11ÿ14 (Jan.ÿApril 1994), Cosmic Powers #1ÿ6 (MarchÿJuly 1994), and Cosmic Powers Unlimited #1 (May 1995).\\r\\nThanos appeared in a connected storyline in Ka-Zar vol. 2, #4ÿ11 (Aug. 1997?ÿ March 1998), Ka-Zar Annual (1997), and the X-Man and Hulk Annual (1998), before featuring in Thor vol. 2, #21ÿ25 (MarchÿJuly 2000) and the 2000 Annual. The character was next used in Captain Marvel vol. 4, #17ÿ19 (JuneÿAug. 2001), Avengers: Celestial Quest #1ÿ8 (Nov. 2001?ÿ June 2002), Infinity Abyss #1ÿ6 (Aug.ÿOct. 2002) and Marvel: The End #1ÿ6 (MayÿAug 2003).\\r\\nIn 2004 Thanos received an eponymous title that ran for 12 issues. In 2006, the character played an important role in Annihilation: Silver Surfer #1ÿ4 (June?ÿ Sept. 2006) and Annihilation #1ÿ6 (Oct. 2006?ÿ March 2007). The character was re-introduced in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, #24ÿ25 (AprilÿMay 2010) and played a major role in The Thanos Imperative: Ignition (June 2010) and The Thanos Imperative #1ÿ6 (JulyÿDec. 2010).\\r\\nThe character returned in Avengers Assemble #1 (March 2012).[4] A mini-series titled Thanos: Son of Titan by Joe Keatinge was planned for publication in August 2012, but was cancelled.[5]\\r\\nThe character's origin was expanded in the five-issue Thanos Rising miniseries by Jason Aaron and Simone Bianchi which was published monthly beginning in April 2013.[6] Later that same year, Thanos played a central role in the Infinity miniseries written by Jonathan Hickman and drawn by Jim Cheung, Jerome Ope?a, and Dustin Weaver.\\r\\nIn May 2014, Jim Starlin and Ron Lim worked together on the one-shot Thanos Annual, which is a prelude to a new trilogy of original graphic novels. The first, Thanos: The Infinity Revelation, was released the following August.[7][8] Beginning in February 2015, Starlin also penned a four-issue miniseries titled Thanos vs. Hulk, which was set prior to the graphic novels. The second installment in the trilogy, Thanos: The Infinity Relativity, was released in June, 2015.[9] The third graphic novel, Thanos: The Infinity Finale, as well as the connected mini-series The Infinity Entity were published in 2016.[10]\\r\\nAt the same time Starlin was writing these graphic novels and tie-ins, the character also appeared in New Avengers #23ÿ24 (OctÿNov 2014),[11] Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, #18ÿ20 (OctÿDec 2014), Legendary Star-Lord #4 (Dec 2014), a six-issue miniseries titled Thanos: A God Up There Listening (Dec 2014), Avengers vol. 5, #40ÿ41 (MarÿApr 2015), and Deadpool vol. 3, #45 (\\"#250\\") (Jun 2015). Thanos also played a major role in the five-issue miniseries The Infinity Guantlet vol. 2, (July 2015 ÿ Jan 2016), a tie-in of the cross-over Secret Wars (2015).\\r\\nThanos was born on Saturn's moon Titan as the son of Eternals Mentor and Sui-San, and his brother is Eros of Titan, also known as Starfox. Thanos carries the Deviants gene, and as such, shares the physical appearance of the Eternals' cousin race. At birth, his mother was shocked by his appearance and attempted to kill him, due to believing that her son would annihilate all life in the universe, but was stopped by A'Lars, Thanos' father. During his school years, Thanos was a pacifist[12] and would only play with his brother Eros (Starfox) and pets. By adolescence, Thanos had become fascinated with nihilism and death, worshipping and eventually falling in love with the physical embodiment of death, Mistress Death.[13] As an adult, Thanos augmented his physical strength and powers through his superior scientific knowledge. He also attempted to create a new life for himself by siring many children as well as becoming a pirate. He finds no fulfillment in either until he is visited again by Mistress Death, for whom he murders his offspring and his pirate captain.[14]\\r\\nWishing to impress Mistress Death, Thanos gathers an army of villainous aliens and begins a nuclear bombardment of Titan that kills millions of his race.[15] Seeking universal power in the form of the Cosmic Cube, Thanos travels to Earth. Prior to landing, his vessel destroys a nearby car as a family witnesses his arrival.[16] Unbeknownst to Thanos, two of the family members in the vehicle survive: the father's spirit is preserved by the Titanian cosmic entity Kronos and is given a new form as Drax the Destroyer while the daughter is found by Thanos' father, Mentor, and is raised to become the heroine Moondragon. Thanos eventually locates the Cube, and also attracts the attention of Mistress Death. Willing the Cube to make him omnipotent, Thanos then discards the Cube. He imprisons Kronos and taunts Kree hero Captain Marvel, who, with the aid of superhero team the Avengers and ISAAC (a super-computer based on Titan), is eventually able to defeat Thanos by destroying the Cube.[17]\\r\\nThanos later comes to the aid of Adam Warlock in a war against the Magus and his religious empire.[18][19] During this alliance Thanos cultivates a plan to reunite with Mistress Death, and secretly siphons off the energies of Warlock's Soul Gem, combining these with the power of the other Infinity Gems to create a weapon capable of destroying a star. Warlock summons the Avengers and Captain Marvel to stop Thanos, although the plan is foiled when Thanos kills Warlock. The Titan regroups and captures the heroes, who are freed by Spider-Man and the Thing. Thanos is finally stopped by Warlock, whose spirit emerges from the Soul Gem and turns the Titan to stone.[15][20] Thanos's spirit eventually reappears to accompany a dying Captain Marvel's soul into the realm of Death.[21]\\r\\nThanos is eventually resurrected,[22] and collects the Infinity Gems once again.[23] He uses the gems to create the Infinity Gauntlet, making himself omnipotent, and erases half the living things in the universe to prove his love to Death.[24] This act and several other acts are soon undone by Adam Warlock.[25] Warlock reveals that Thanos has always allowed himself to be defeated because the Titan secretly knows he is not worthy of ultimate power. Thanos joins Warlock as part of the Infinity Watch and helps him to defeat first his evil[26] and then good[27] personas, and cure Thor of \\"warrior Madness\\".[28]\\r\\nThanos later recruits a team of Earth-bound super-villains and puts them under the field leadership of Geatar in a mission to capture an ancient robot containing the obscure knowledge of a universal library and extract its data.[29] Thanos uses information from the robot to plot against and battle Tyrant, the first creation of Galactus turned destroyer.[30] When trapped in an alternate dimension, Thanos employs the aid of the brother of Ka-Zar, Parnival Plunder[31] and later the Hulk[32] to escape, although both attempts are unsuccessful. Thanos is eventually freed and comes into conflict with Thor, aligning himself with Mangog in a scheme to obtain powerful mystical and cosmic talismans which will allow him to destroy all life in the universe,[33] and during their battles Thanos decimates the planet Rigel-3.[34]\\r\\nThanos then uses the heroes Thor and Genis-Vell (Captain Marvel's son) against the death god Walker, who attempts to woo Mistress Death and then destroy the entity after being rejected.[35] Thanos then devises a plan to become the All-Father of a new pantheon of gods created by himself. Thanos, however, finds himself opposed by the Avengers' former member Mantis and her son Quoi, who apparently is destined to be the Celestial Messiah. Thanos abandons this plan after having to unite with Mistress Death to destroy the \\"Rot\\", a cosmic aberration in deep space caused by Thanos's incessant love for Death.[36] Thanos also once conducted extensive research on genetics, and after studying many of the universe's heroes and villains cloned them and gene-spliced his own DNA into the subjects. Although he later abandons the project, five clones survive, being versions of Professor X, Iron Man, Gladiator, Doctor Strange, and Galactus respectively. A sixth and unnamed version of Thanos also appears, and it is revealed the incarnations of Thanos encountered in the past by Thor and Ka-Zar were actually clones. The true Thanos?ÿ with the aid of Adam Warlock, Gamora, Pip the Troll, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and Dr. Strange?ÿ destroys the remaining clones.[37]\\r\\nWhen the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten uses a source of cosmic power, the Heart of the Universe, to seize power in present-day Earth (killing most of Earth's heroes in the process), Thanos uses a time-travel stratagem to defeat him. Thanos then uses the Heart of the Universe to reverse Akhenaten's actions and was also compelled to correct a flaw in the universe. Changed by the experience, Thanos advises confidant Adam Warlock he will no longer seek universal conquest.[38]\\r\\nThanos decides to atone for the destruction of Rigel-3, and agrees to aid a colony of Rigellians in evacuating their planet before Galactus can consume it. During the course of this mission Thanos learns Galactus is collecting the Infinity Gems in an effort to end his unyielding hunger. Thanos later learns Galactus is being manipulated into releasing a multiversal threat called Hunger, which feeds on entire universes. Despite opposition from Thanos, Galactus unwittingly frees the entity, and when its intentions are revealed, the pair team up and attempt to destroy it.[39]\\r\\nEn route to the Kyln, an intergalactic prison, Thanos meets Death, who for the first time speaks to the Titan. Death claims to be worth wooing, but says Thanos must offer something other than death. At the Kyln Thanos encounters Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord, and the Shi'ar warrior Gladiator, who are both prisoners, and the Beyonder, who has been rendered amnesiac by its choice to assume a humanoid female form. Thanos battles the Beyonder, causing its mind to shut down and leaving its power trapped within a comatose physical form. Thanos then instructs the Kyln officers to keep the Beyonder on life support indefinitely in order to prevent the entity from being reborn.[40] Thanos departs the Kyln in the company of Skreet, a chaos-mite freed from the prison. Thanos then meets the Fallen, revealed to be the true first Herald of Galactus. Thanos defeats the former Herald and places him under complete mental control.[41] He later appears in Wisconsin attempting to charge a weapon called the Pyramatrix with the life force of everyone on Earth until he is defeated by Squirrel Girl. After the battle, Uatu the Watcher appears and confirms to Squirrel Girl that she defeated the real Thanos, not a clone or copy.[42]\\r\\nDuring the Annihilation War Thanos allies himself with the genocidal villain Annihilus. When the Annihilation Wave destroys the Kyln, Thanos sends the Fallen to check on the status of the Beyonder, whose mortal form he finds has perished. Before the Fallen can report back to Thanos it encounters Tenebrous and Aegis: two of Galactus's ancient foes. Thanos convinces Tenebrous and Aegis to join the Annihilation Wave in order to get revenge on Galactus, and they subsequently defeat the World Devourer and the Silver Surfer. Annihilus desires the secret of the Power Cosmic and asks Thanos to study Galactus. Once Thanos learns Annihilus's true goal is to use the Power Cosmic to destroy all life and remain the sole survivor, he decides to free Galactus. Drax the Destroyer kills Thanos before he can do so but discovers that Thanos had placed a failsafe device to allow Silver Surfer to free Galactus in the event that Annihilus betrayed him.[43] During a climactic battle with Annihilus, Nova is near death and sees Thanos standing with Mistress Death.[44]\\r\\nA cocoon protected by the Universal Church of Truth is revealed to be hiding Thanos, who has been chosen by Oblivion to be the new Avatar of Death.[45] Resurrected before his mind could be fully formed, Thanos goes on a mindless rampage before being captured by the Guardians of the Galaxy.[46] Thanos pretends to aid the Guardians against the invading Cancerverse, and after discovering its origin kills an alternate version of Mar-Vell, the self-proclaimed Avatar of Life. This causes the collapse of the Cancerverse, and Nova sacrifices himself in an attempt to contain Thanos inside the imploding reality.[47] Thanos escapes[48] and returns to Earth seeking an artificial cosmic cube. He forms an incarnation of the criminal group Zodiac to retrieve it, but he is defeated by the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy and remanded to the custody of the Elders of the Universe.[49]\\r\\nThanos soon invades Earth again after being informed that most of the Avengers have temporarily left the planet.[50] He launches an assault on Attilan, which he offers to spare in exchange for the deaths of all Inhumans between the ages of 16 and 22. Black Bolt later informs the Illuminati that the true purpose of the invasion is to find and kill Thane, an Eternal/Inhuman hybrid that Thanos had secretly fathered years earlier.[51] Thanos is trapped in a pocket limbo of stasis by his son.[52] Thanos is freed by Namor and was among the villains that joined his Cabal to destroy other worlds.[53] Thanos later meets his end on Battleworld, where he is easily killed by God Emperor Doom during an attempted insurrection.[54]\\r\\nThanos is unintentionally brought back to life by Galactus.[55] When Thanos prepares to raid a Project Pegasus facility to steal a Cosmic Cube, he is ambushed and defeated by a team of Avengers. During their battle, he mortally wounds War Machine and critically injures She-Hulk.[56][57][58] After his defeat, he is imprisoned in the Triskelion,[59] and manipulates Anti-Man into facilitating his escape.[60] Thanos goes on a killing spree, but Black Panther, Blue Marvel and Monica Rambeau are able to stop him by devising a device that blocks the electrical synapses in his brain.[61]\\r\\nThanos somehow later recovers and escapes captivity, and reclaims his Black Order forces from Corvus Glaive. After retaking command of his Black Quadrant outpost, Thanos discovers that he is dying.[62] Thanos tries to force Mentor to find a cure for his malady, but kills him when he is unable to.[63] Soon after Thanos would be battered and detained by the Shi'ar Imperial Guard after he invaded the very planet station of his fathers facility sitting in their territory.[64] A quick jump into the future shows Thanos' estranged son Thane having bested his mad father with the personification of death at his side.[65]\\r\\nPresently locked within a maximum security cosmic Alcatraz, Thanos sits alone within a cell as his sickness ravages his body. All while being mocked by its prison warden whom he lured into a false sense of security in order to escape; ripping off his arm for escape access and murdering half his personal staff in a bid for freedom.[66] Having narrowly escaped his imprisonment before its self-destruction, Thanos retreats to a hidden outpost where a roving mercenary colony loyal only to him was once stationed. Only to find it decimated at the hand of the new lover of Mistress Death; who reveals that she'd stricken her former avatar with his fatal sickness, being his son Thane, now boasting the power of the Phoenix Force. Whom under her coaxing, had banished the mad titan back to the decimated Moon of Titan now entirely stripped of his godlike powers.[67]\\r\\nFor the next few months, Thanos would survive alone and all but powerless in the ruins of his home city. Surviving off the flesh of mutated vermin and being accosted by local scavengers who preyed upon him in his weakened condition, he is soon picked up by the unlikely crew of Thane's betrayed cohorts Tryco Slatterus, his adopted daughter Nebula and his brother Eros of Titan.[68] Having heard of their plight, the three were dismayed to find Thanos stripped of all he was and had ever been; his second daughter only agreeing to come along so she could kill her father, immediately assaulted him.[volume?&?issue?needed]\\r\\nStarfox was able to preempt her attempt at patricide while inviting his wayward tyrant of a brother aboard their vessel. Thanos mentioned the only way for him to be relived of his mortality was to seek out the God Quarry heralded by The Witches of Infinity. Starfox initially wrote this off as fable and folklore. Now on the path to the cosmic coven set at the edge of the known universe, Thanos and crew stop short of a black hole, knowing full well that it is where the witches make their home. The Mad Titan jumps into the pinhole of nothingness alongside his brother, whom not trusting his butcherous sibling with the supposed infinite power of said collective; having survived the crushing force of the singularity they dove into, Thanos and Eros are greeted by the Coven at the godly graveyard.[69]\\r\\nThanos demands the three that are one to return his godhood to him. Starfox tries his best charm the enchantresses only to be rebuked by them, much to Thanos's joy when they prematurely aged him. Seeing as it was neither their place to destroy nor turn away those seeking them, The Witches profess the only way for the warlord to be made whole again was to climb down into the God Quarry and await a trial that would test his soul. Immediately after setting foot within the graveyard of old gods, Thanos is subsumed into the bedrock within which they rest.[70]\\r\\nAs his journey of the core being commenced, Thanos's trial began with him as leader of earth and the universes greatest champions, the Avengers. But he's unable to escape the nagging feeling he's forgotten something, till the quarry itself wearing the guise of Falcon reminds him of who he used to be; tempting him to live as a hero and a man at peace for the first time in his immortal life. But Thanos laughs maniacally as he coldly rebukes such a path, ruthlessly killing his would be friends and allies while choosing to remain whom he always was. His cosmic might returned to him, Thanos is freed from the God Quarry, wherein he immediately accosts his brother Eros and threatens the coven to release him from their domain so that he might do away with Thane once and for all.[71]\\r\\nAround the time of the New Thor's appearance, Thanos is approached by a mysterious hooded woman, who proposes an alliance. He tasks her with bringing him the hammer of the deceased Ultimate Thor.[72] The woman fails, but removes her disguise to reveal herself as Hela, the Norse goddess of death. She tells Thanos that she needs his help to reclaim Hel, and in exchange, offers to give him the one thing he has been searching for his entire life: death. After this, the two kiss.[73]\\r\\nThanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the Titanian Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, but amplified to a higher degree through a combination of his mutantÿEternal heritage, bionic amplification, mysticism, and power bestowed by the abstract entity, Death. Demonstrating enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina, immortality and invulnerability among other qualities, Thanos can absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy, and is capable of telekinesis and telepathy. He can manipulate matter and live indefinitely without food, air or water, cannot die of old age, is immune to all terrestrial diseases, and has high resistance to psychic assaults. Thanos is also an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in the art of war on Titan.\\r\\nThanos has proven himself capable of briefly holding his own in battle against Odin,[74] and of blasting Galactus off his feet.[75]\\r\\nThanos is a supergenius in virtually all known fields of advanced science and has created technology far exceeding that which is found on contemporary Earth. He often employs a transportation chair capable of space flight, force field projection, teleportation, time travel, and movement through alternate universes. Thanos is also a master strategist and uses several space vessels, at least three under the name \\"Sanctuary\\", as a base of operations.\\r\\nDuring the 1996 Amalgam Comics crossover between DC Comics and Marvel, Thanos merged with Darkseid to become \\"Thanoseid\\".[76]\\r\\nIn the alternate universe limited series Earth X, Thanos dwelled in the Realm of the Dead with the entity Death.[77] It is revealed his mother was a Skrull and Death used her secret to make him believe that Death was his mother. When the deception is revealed, he uses the Ultimate Nullifier on Death.[78]\\r\\nThe Ultimate Marvel imprint title Ultimate Fantastic Four features an alternate universe version of Thanos who is the ruler of Acheron (and has a son called Ronan the Accuser, who is in possession of a Cosmic Cube[79]), a vast empire consisting of thousands of worlds on another plane of existence.[80]\\r\\nThanos features in the limited series Marvel Zombies 2, set in the alternate universe of Earth-2149. Having been \\"zombified\\", the character is killed by the cosmic-powered Hulk after an altercation over food.[81]\\r\\nA number of the stories featuring Thanos have been republished into trade paperbacks and other collected editions:\\r\\nThanos was ranked number 47 on IGN's top 100 comic book villains of all time,[110] 22nd on Wizard's Top 100 Greatest Villains list,[citation needed] and number 21 on Complex's 25 Greatest Comic Book Villains List.[111]","input":"What was the first movie thanos was in?"},{"output":"10 miles","context":"","input":"How far is pasadena ca from los angeles ca?"},{"output":"through most of history","context":"","input":"How long has child labor been going on?"},{"output":"Central America","context":"\\r\\nCoordinates: 10N 84W? / ?10N 84W? / 10; -84\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica (/?k?st? ?ri?k?/?(?listen); Spanish:?[?kosta ?rika]; \\"Rich Coast\\"), officially the Republic of Costa Rica (Spanish: Rep~blica de Costa Rica), is a country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Ecuador to the south of Cocos Island. It has a population of around 4.9 million,[3] in a land area of 51,060 square kilometers (19,714 square miles); over 300,000 live in the capital and largest city, San Jos,[7] which had a population of an estimated 333,980 in 2015.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica has been known for its stable democracy, in a region that has had some instability, and for its highly educated workforce, most of whom speak English.[8] The country spends roughly 6.9% of its budget (2016) on education, compared to a global average of 4.4%.[8] Its economy, once heavily dependent on agriculture, has diversified to include sectors such as finance, corporate services for foreign companies, pharmaceuticals, and ecotourism. Many foreign companies (manufacturing and services) operate in Costa Rica's Free Trade Zones (FTZ) where they benefit from investment and tax incentives.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of impressive growth in the gross domestic product (GDP), low inflation, moderate interest rates and an acceptable unemployment level, Costa Rica in 2017 was facing a liquidity crisis due to a growing debt and budget deficit.[10] By August 2017, the Treasury was having difficulty paying its obligations.[11][12] Other challenges facing the country in its attempts to improve the economy by increasing foreign investment include a poor infrastructure and a need to improve public sector efficiency.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica was sparsely inhabited by indigenous peoples before coming under Spanish rule in the 16th century. It remained a peripheral colony of the empire until independence as part of the short-lived First Mexican Empire, followed by membership in the United Provinces of Central America, from which it formally declared independence in 1847. Since then, Costa Rica has remained among the most stable, prosperous, and progressive nations in Latin America. Following the brief Costa Rican Civil War, it permanently abolished its army in 1949, becoming one of only a few sovereign nations without a standing army.[15][16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country has consistently performed favorably in the Human Development Index (HDI), placing 69th in the world as of  2015[update], among the highest of any Latin American nation.[18] It has also been cited by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as having attained much higher human development than other countries at the same income levels, with a better record on human development and inequality than the median of the region.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica also has progressive environmental policies. It is the only country to meet all five UNDP criteria established to measure environmental sustainability.[20] It was ranked 42nd in the world, and third in the Americas, in the 2016 Environmental Performance Index,[21] and was twice ranked the best performing country in the New Economics Foundation's (NEF) Happy Planet Index, which measures environmental sustainability,[22][23] and was identified by the NEF as the greenest country in the world in 2009.[24] Costa Rica plans to become a carbon-neutral country by 2021.[25][26][27] By  2016, 98.1% of its electricity was generated from green sources[28] particularly hydro, solar, geothermal and biomass.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorians have classified the indigenous people of Costa Rica as belonging to the Intermediate Area, where the peripheries of the Mesoamerican and Andean native cultures overlapped. More recently, pre-Columbian Costa Rica has also been described as part of the Isthmo-Colombian Area.\\r\\n\\r\\nStone tools, the oldest evidence of human occupation in Costa Rica, are associated with the arrival of various groups of hunter-gatherers about 10,000 to 7,000 years BCE in the Turrialba Valley. The presence of Clovis culture type spearheads and arrows from South America opens the possibility that, in this area, two different cultures coexisted.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAgriculture became evident in the populations that lived in Costa Rica about 5,000 years ago. They mainly grew tubers and roots. For the first and second millennia BCE there were already settled farming communities. These were small and scattered, although the timing of the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture as the main livelihood in the territory is still unknown.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest use of pottery appears around 2,000 to 3,000 BCE. Shards of pots, cylindrical vases, platters, gourds and other forms of vases decorated with grooves, prints, and some modelled after animals have been found.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impact of indigenous peoples on modern Costa Rican culture has been relatively small compared to other nations, since the country lacked a strong native civilization to begin with. Most of the native population was absorbed into the Spanish-speaking colonial society through inter-marriage, except for some small remnants, the most significant of which are the Bribri and Boruca tribes who still inhabit the mountains of the Cordillera de Talamanca, in the southeastern part of Costa Rica, near the frontier with Panama.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name la costa rica, meaning \\"rich coast\\" in the Spanish language, was in some accounts first applied by Christopher Columbus, who sailed to the eastern shores of Costa Rica during his final voyage in 1502,[33] and reported vast quantities of gold jewelry worn by natives.[34] The name may also have come from conquistador Gil Gonzlez Dvila, who landed on the west coast in 1522, encountered natives, and appropriated some of their gold.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring most of the colonial period, Costa Rica was the southernmost province of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, nominally part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. In practice, the captaincy general was a largely autonomous entity within the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica's distance from the capital of the captaincy in Guatemala, its legal prohibition under Spanish law from trade with its southern neighbor Panama, then part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada (i.e. Colombia), and lack of resources such as gold and silver, made Costa Rica into a poor, isolated, and sparsely-inhabited region within the Spanish Empire.[36] Costa Rica was described as \\"the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America\\" by a Spanish governor in 1719.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother important factor behind Costa Rica's poverty was the lack of a significant indigenous population available for encomienda (forced labor), which meant most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land, preventing the establishment of large haciendas (plantations). For all these reasons, Costa Rica was, by and large, unappreciated and overlooked by the Spanish Crown and left to develop on its own. The circumstances during this period are believed to have led to many of the idiosyncrasies for which Costa Rica has become known, while concomitantly setting the stage for Costa Rica's development as a more egalitarian society than the rest of its neighbors. Costa Rica became a \\"rural democracy\\" with no oppressed mestizo or indigenous class. It was not long before Spanish settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a milder climate than that of the lowlands.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the rest of Central America, Costa Rica never fought for independence from Spain. On September 15, 1821, after the final Spanish defeat in the Mexican War of Independence (1810ÿ21), the authorities in Guatemala declared the independence of all of Central America. That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in Costa Rica even though, technically, under the Spanish Constitution of 1812 that had been readopted in 1820, Nicaragua and Costa Rica had become an autonomous province with its capital in Le܇n.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon independence, Costa Rican authorities faced the issue of officially deciding the future of the country. Two bands formed, the Imperialists, defended by Cartago and Heredia cities which were in favor of joining the Mexican Empire, and the Republicans, represented by the cities of San Jos and Alajuela who defended full independence. Because of the lack of agreement on these two possible outcomes, the first civil war of Costa Rica occurred. The battle of Ochomogo?(es) took place on the Hill of Ochomogo, located in the Central Valley in 1823. The conflict was won by the Republicans and, as a consequence, the city of Cartago lost its status as the capital, which moved to San Jos.[39][40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1838, long after the Federal Republic of Central America ceased to function in practice, Costa Rica formally withdrew and proclaimed itself sovereign. The considerable distance and poor communication routes between Guatemala City and the Central Plateau, where most of the Costa Rican population lived then and still lives now, meant the local population had little allegiance to the federal government in Guatemala. From colonial times to now, Costa Rica's reluctance to become economically tied with the rest of Central America has been a major obstacle to efforts for greater regional integration.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoffee was first planted in Costa Rica in 1808,[43] and by the 1820s, it surpassed tobacco, sugar, and cacao as a primary export.  Coffee production remained Costa Rica's principal source of wealth well into the 20th century, creating a wealthy class of growers, the so-called Coffee Barons.[44] The revenue helped to modernize the country.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the coffee exported was grown around the main centers of population in the Central Plateau and then transported by oxcart to the Pacific port of Puntarenas after the main road was built in 1846.[46] By the mid-1850s the main market for coffee was Britain.[47] It soon became a high priority to develop an effective transportation route from the Central Plateau to the Atlantic Ocean. For this purpose, in the 1870s, the Costa Rican government contracted with U.S. businessman Minor C. Keith to build a railroad from San Jos to the Caribbean port of Lim܇n. Despite enormous difficulties with construction, disease, and financing, the railroad was completed in 1890.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Afro-Costa Ricans descend from Jamaican immigrants who worked in the construction of that railway and now make up about 3% of Costa Rica's population.[49] U.S. convicts, Italians and Chinese immigrants also participated in the construction project. In exchange for completing the railroad, the Costa Rican government granted Keith large tracts of land and a lease on the train route, which he used to produce bananas and export them to the United States. As a result, bananas came to rival coffee as the principal Costa Rican export, while foreign-owned corporations (including the United Fruit Company later) began to hold a major role in the national economy and eventually became a symbol of the exploitative export economy.[50] The major labor dispute between the peasants and the United Fruit Company (The Great Banana Strike) was a major event in the country's history and was an important step that would eventually lead to the formation of effective trade unions in Costa Rica, as the company was required to sign a collective agreement with its workers in 1938.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, Costa Rica has generally enjoyed greater peace and more consistent political stability than many of its fellow Latin American nations. Since the late 19th century, however, Costa Rica has experienced two significant periods of violence. In 1917ÿ19, General Federico Tinoco Granados ruled as a military dictator until he was overthrown and forced into exile. The unpopularity of Tinoco's regime led, after he was overthrown, to a considerable decline in the size, wealth, and political influence of the Costa Rican military. In 1948, Jos Figueres Ferrer led an armed uprising in the wake of a disputed presidential election between Rafael ngel Calder܇n Guardia (who had been president between 1940 and 1944) and Otilio Ulate Blanco.[53] With more than 2,000 dead, the resulting 44-day Costa Rican Civil War was the bloodiest event in Costa Rica during the 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe victorious rebels formed a government junta that abolished the military altogether, and oversaw the drafting of a new constitution by a democratically elected assembly.[54] Having enacted these reforms, the junta transferred power to Ulate on November 8, 1949. After the coup d'tat, Figueres became a national hero, winning the country's first democratic election under the new constitution in 1953. Since then, Costa Rica has held 14 presidential elections, the latest in 2018.  With uninterrupted democracy dating back to at least 1948, the country is the region's most stable.\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica is located on the Central American isthmus, lying between latitudes 8 and 12N, and longitudes 82 and 86W. It borders the Caribbean Sea (to the east) and the Pacific Ocean (to the west), with a total of 1,290 kilometres (800?mi) of coastline, 212?km (132?mi) on the Caribbean coast and 1,016?km (631?mi) on the Pacific. Costa Rica also borders Nicaragua to the north (309?km or 192?mi of border) and Panama to the south-southeast (330?km or 210?mi of border). In total, Costa Rica comprises 51,100 square kilometres (19,700?sq?mi) plus 589 square kilometres (227?sq?mi) of territorial waters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest point in the country is Cerro Chirrip܇, at 3,819 metres (12,530?ft); it is the fifth highest peak in Central America. The highest volcano in the country is the Iraz~ Volcano (3,431?m or 11,257?ft) and the largest lake is Lake Arenal. There are 14 known volcanoes in Costa Rica, and six of them have been active in the last 75 years.[55]  The country has also experienced at least ten earthquakes of magnitude 5.7 or higher (3 of magnitude 7.0 or higher) in the last century.\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica also comprises several islands. Cocos Island (24 square kilometres or 9.3 square miles) stands out because of its distance from the continental landmass, 480 kilometres (300?mi) from Puntarenas, but Isla Calero is the largest island of the country (151.6 square kilometres or 58.5 square miles). Over 25% of Costa Rica's national territory is protected by SINAC (the National System of Conservation Areas), which oversees all of the country's protected areas. Costa Rica also possesses the greatest density of species in the world.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Costa Rica is located between 8 and 12 degrees north of the Equator, the climate is tropical year round. However, the country has many microclimates depending on elevation, rainfall, topography, and by the geography of each particular region.\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica's seasons are defined by how much rain falls during a particular period. The year can be split into two periods, the dry season known to the residents as summer (verano), and the rainy season, known locally as winter (invierno). The \\"summer\\" or dry season goes from December to April, and \\"winter\\" or rainy season goes from May to November, which almost coincides with the Atlantic hurricane season, and during this time, it rains constantly in some regions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location receiving the most rain is the Caribbean slopes of the Cordillera Central mountains, with an annual rainfall of over 5,000?mm (196.9?in). Humidity is also higher on the Caribbean side than on the Pacific side. The mean annual temperature on the coastal lowlands is around 27?C (81?F), 20?C (68?F) in the main populated areas of the Cordillera Central, and below 10?C (50?F) on the summits of the highest mountains.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica is home to a rich variety of plants and animals. While the country has only about 0.03% of the world's landmass, it contains 5% of the world's biodiversity.[59][60] Around 25% of the country's land area is in protected national parks and protected areas,[61][62] the largest percentage of protected areas in the world (developing world average 13%, developed world average 8%).[63][64][65] Costa Rica has successfully managed to diminish deforestation from some of the worst rates in the world from 1973 to 1989, to almost zero by 2005.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne national park, the Corcovado National Park, is internationally renowned among ecologists for its biodiversity (including big cats and tapirs) and is where visitors can expect to see an abundance of wildlife.[66][67] Corcovado is the one park in Costa Rica where all four Costa Rican monkey species can be found.[68] These include the white-headed capuchin, the mantled howler, the endangered Geoffroy's spider monkey,[68][69] and the Central American squirrel monkey, found only on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and a small part of Panama, and considered endangered until 2008, when its status was upgraded to vulnerable. Deforestation, illegal pet-trading, and hunting are the main reasons for its threatened status.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nTortuguero National Park ÿ the name Tortuguero can be translated as \\"Full of Turtles\\" ÿ is home to spider, howler, and white-throated capuchin monkeys; the three-toed sloth and two-toed sloth; 320 species of birds; and a variety of reptiles. The park is recognized for the annual nesting of the endangered green turtle, and is the most important nesting site for the species. Giant leatherback, hawksbill, and loggerhead turtles also nest there. The Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is home to about 2,000 plant species,[71] including numerous orchids. Over 400 types of birds and more than 100 species of mammals can be found there.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 840 species of birds have been identified in Costa Rica. As is the case in much of Central America, the avian species in Costa Rica are a mix of North and South American species. The country's abundant fruit trees, many of which bear fruit year round, are hugely important to the birds, some of whom survive on diets that consist only of one or two types of fruit. Some of the country's most notable avian species include the resplendent quetzal, scarlet macaw, three-wattled bellbird, bare-necked umbrellabird, and the keel-billed toucan.[72] The Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad is allowed to collect royalties on any biological discoveries of medical importance. Costa Rica is a center of biological diversity for reptiles and amphibians, including the world's fastest running lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura similis).[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country has been considered economically stable with moderate inflation, estimated at 2.6% in 2017,[74] and moderately high growth in GDP, which increased from US$41.3 billion in 2011 to US$52.6 billion in 2015.[75] The estimated GDP for 2017 is US$61.5 billion and the estimated GDP per capita (purchasing power parity) is US$12,382.[74] The growing debt and budget deficit are the country's primary concerns.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is a primary reason why  the major credit rating agencies ÿ Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch ÿ have downgraded Costa Ricas risk ratings. For example, Moody's Investors Service in early 2017 reduced the rating to Ba2 from Ba1, with a negative outlook due to the \\"rising government debt burden and persistently high fiscal deficit, which was 5.2% of GDP in 2016\\" and   the \\"lack of political consensus to implement measures to reduce the fiscal deficit [which] will result in further pressure on the government's debt ratios\\".[76]  The country is currently debating major fiscal reform legislation to cut the budget deficits and stop the growth in debt,[2] one of the highest in Latin America.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany foreign companies (manufacturing and services) operate in Costa Rica's Free Trade Zones (FTZ) where they benefit from investment and tax incentives.[9] Well over half of that type of investment has come from the U.S.[77] According to the government, the zones supported over 82 thousand direct jobs and 43 thousand indirect jobs in 2015.[78] Companies with facilities in the America Free Zone in Heredia, for example, include Intel, Dell, HP, Bayer, Bosch, DHL, IBM and Okay Industries.[79][80]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the GDP, 5.5% is generated by agriculture, 18.6% by industry and 75.9% by services.(2016)[74] Agriculture employs 12.9% of the labor force, industry 18.57%, services 69.02% (2016)[81] For the region, its unemployment level is moderately high (8.2% in 2016, according to the IMF).[74] Although 20.5% of the population lives below the poverty line (2017),[82] Costa Rica has one of the highest standards of living in Central America.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh quality health care is provided by the government at low cost to the users.[84] Housing is also very affordable. Costa Rica is recognized in Latin America for the quality of its educational system. Because of its educational system, Costa Rica has one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America, 97%.[85] General Basic Education is mandatory and provided without cost to the user.[86] A US government report confirms that the country has \\"historically placed a high priority on education and the creation of a skilled work force\\" but notes that the high school drop-out rate is increasing. As well, Costa Rica would benefit from more courses in languages such as English, Portuguese, Mandarin and French and also in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM).[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Monetary Fund stated in June 2017 that annual growth in the economy was just over 4% and that the financial system was sound.[87][88] The IMF expressed concern however, about increasing deficits and public debt as well as the heavy dollarization of bank assets and liabilities. Costa Rica's public debt is problematic, especially as a percentage of the GDP, increasing from 29.8% in 2011 to 40.8% in 2015.[75] Of the proposed 2017 budget (US$15.9 billion), debt payments account for one-third of the total and a full 46% of the budget will require financing. That will increase the deficit and the debt owed to foreign entities.[89] The value of the Costa Rican colone per US$1 was 526.46? on March 27, 2015. At the end of July 2017, the value was 563?.[90]\\r\\n[91][92]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2017 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned that reducing the foreign debt must be a very high priority for the government. Other fiscal reforms were also recommended to moderate the budget deficit.[13] The IMF also recommended debt reduction, with specific suggestions.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early August 2017, President Luis Guillermo Sols admitted that the country was facing a \\"liquidity crisis\\" and promised that a higher VAT tax and higher income tax rates were being considered by his government. Such steps are essential, Luis Guillermo Sols told the nation, because it was facing difficulties in paying its obligations and guaranteeing the provision of services.[93] Sols explained that the Treasury will prioritize payments on the public debt first, then salaries, and then pensions. The subsequent priorities include transfers to institutions \\"according to their social urgency\\". All other payments will be made only if funds are available.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica has free trade agreements with many countries, including the US. There are no significant trade barriers that would affect imports and the country has been lowering its tariffs in accordance with other Central American countries.[94] The country's Free Trade Zones provide incentives for manufacturing and service industries to operate in Costa Rica. In 2015, the zones supported over 82 thousand direct jobs and 43 thousand indirect jobs in 2015 and average wages in the FTZ were 1.8 times greater than the average for private enterprise work in the rest of the country.[78] In 2016, Amazon.com for example, had some 3,500 employees in Costa Rica and planned to increase that by 1,500 in 2017, making it an important employer.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central  location provides access to American markets and direct ocean access to Europe and Asia. The most important exports in 2015 (in order of dollar value) were medical instruments, bananas, tropical fruits, integrated circuits and orthopedic appliances.[95] Total imports in that year were US$15 billion. The most significant products imported in 2015 (in order of dollar value) were refined petroleum, automobiles, packaged medications, broadcasting equipment and computers. The total exports were US$12.6 billion for a trade deficit of US$2.39 billion in 2015.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nPharmaceuticals, financial outsourcing, software development, and ecotourism have become the prime industries in Costa Rica's economy. High levels of education among its residents make the country an attractive investing location. Since 1999, tourism earns more foreign exchange than the combined exports of the country's three main cash crops: bananas and pineapples especially,[96] but also other crops, including coffee.[97] Coffee production played a key role in Costa Rica's history and in 2006, was the third cash crop export.[97] As a small country, Costa Rica now provides under 1% of the worlds coffee production.[46] In 2015, the value of coffee exports was US$305.9 million, a small part of the total agricultural exports of US$2.7 billion.[96] Coffee production increased by 13.7% percent in 2015-16, declined by 17.5% in 2016ÿ17, but was expected to increase by about 15% in the subsequent year.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica has developed a system of payments for environmental services.[63] Similarly, Costa Rica has a tax on water pollution to penalize businesses and homeowners that dump sewage, agricultural chemicals, and other pollutants into waterways.[99] In May 2007, the Costa Rican government announced its intentions to become 100% carbon neutral by 2021.[100]  By 2015, 93 percent of the country's electricity came from renewable sources.[101] In 2016, the country produced 98% of its electricity from renewable sources and ran completely on renewable sources for 110 continuous days.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, the Forest Law was enacted to provide direct financial incentives to landowners for the provision of environmental services.[63] This helped reorient the forestry sector away from commercial timber production and the resulting deforestation, and helped create awareness of the services it provides for the economy and society (i.e., carbon fixation, hydrological services such as producing fresh drinking water, biodiversity protection, and provision of scenic beauty).[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2016 report by the U.S. government report identifies other challenges facing Costa Rica as it works to expand its economy by working with companies from the US (and probably from other countries).[85] The major concerns identified were as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica is the most visited nation in the Central American region,[104] with 2.9 million foreign visitors in 2016, up 10% from 2015.[105] In 2015, the tourism sector was responsible for 5.8% of the country's GDP, or $3.4 billion.[106] In 2016, the highest number of tourists came from the United States, with 1,000,000 visitors, followed by Europe with 434,884 arrivals.[107] According to Costa Rica Vacations, once tourists arrive in the country, 22% go to Tamarindo, 18% go to Arenal, 17% pass through Liberia (where the Daniel Oduber Quir܇s International Airport is located), 16% go to San Jos, the countrys capital (passing through Juan Santamara International Airport), while 18% choose Manuel Antonio and 7% Monteverde.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2004, tourism was generating more revenue and foreign exchange than bananas and coffee combined.[97][109] In 2016, the World Travel & Tourism Council's estimates indicated a direct contribution to the GDP of 5.1% and 110,000 direct jobs in Costa Rica; the total number of jobs indirectly supported by tourism was 271,000.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nA pioneer of ecotourism, Costa Rica draws many tourists to its extensive series of national parks and other protected areas.[111] In the 2011 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index, Costa Rica ranked 44th in the world and second among Latin American countries after Mexico in 2011.[112] By the time of the 2017 report, the country had reached 38th place, slightly behind Panama.[113] The Ethical Traveler group's ten countries on their 2017 list of The Worlds Ten Best Ethical Destinations includes Costa Rica. The country scored highest in environmental protection among the winners.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica is composed of seven provinces, which in turn are divided into 81 cantons (Spanish: cant܇n, plural cantones), each of which is directed by a mayor. Mayors are chosen democratically every four years by each canton. There are no provincial legislatures. The cantons are further divided into 473 districts (distritos). The provinces are:\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica is an active member of the United Nations and the Organization of American States. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the United Nations University of Peace are based in Costa Rica. It is also a member of many other international organizations related to human rights and democracy, such as the Community of Democracies. A main foreign policy objective of Costa Rica is to foster human rights and sustainable development as a way to secure stability and growth.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica is a member of the International Criminal Court, without a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States military (as covered under Article 98). Costa Rica is an observer of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 10, 1961, some months after Fidel Castro declared Cuba a socialist state, Costa Rican President Mario Echandi ended diplomatic relations with Cuba through Executive Decree Number 2. This freeze lasted 47 years until President ܇scar Arias Snchez re-established normal relations on 18 March 2009, saying, \\"If we have been able to turn the page with regimes as profoundly different to our reality as occurred with the USSR or, more recently, with the Republic of China, how would we not do it with a country that is geographically and culturally much nearer to Costa Rica?\\" Arias announced that both countries would exchange ambassadors.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica has a long-term disagreement with Nicaragua over the San Juan River, which defines the border between the two countries, and Costa Rica's rights of navigation on the river.[117] In 2010, there was also a dispute around Isla Calero, and the impact of Nicaraguan dredging of the river in that area.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 14, 2009, the International Court of Justice in the Hague upheld Costa Rica's navigation rights for commercial purposes to subsistence fishing on their side of the river. An 1858 treaty extended navigation rights to Costa Rica, but Nicaragua denied passenger travel and fishing were part of the deal; the court ruled Costa Ricans on the river were not required to have Nicaraguan tourist cards or visas as Nicaragua argued, but, in a nod to the Nicaraguans, ruled that Costa Rican boats and passengers must stop at the first and last Nicaraguan port along their route. They must also have an identity document or passport. Nicaragua can also impose timetables on Costa Rican traffic. Nicaragua may require Costa Rican boats to display the flag of Nicaragua, but may not charge them for departure clearance from its ports. These were all specific items of contention brought to the court in the 2005 filing.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 1, 2007, Costa Rica broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan, switching recognition to the People's Republic of China. Costa Rica was the first of the Central American nations to do so. President ܇scar Arias Snchez admitted the action was a response to economic exigency.[120] In response, the PRC built a new, $100 million, state-of-the-art football stadium in Parque la Sabana, in the province of San Jos. Approximately 600 Chinese engineers and laborers took part in this project, and it was inaugurated in March 2011, with a match between the national teams of Costa Rica and China.\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica finished a term on the United Nations Security Council, having been elected for a nonrenewable, two-year term in the 2007 election. Its term expired on December 31, 2009; this was Costa Rica's third time on the Security Council. Elayne Whyte G܇mez is the Permanent Representative of Costa Rica to the UN Office at Geneva (2017) and President of the United Nations Conference to Negotiate a Legally Binding Instrument to Prohibit Nuclear Weapons.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2011 census counted a population of 4.3 million people[122] distributed among the following groups: 83.6% whites or mestizos, 6.7% mulattoes, 2.4% Native American, 1.1% black or Afro-Caribbean; the census showed 1.1% as Other, 2.9% (141,304 people) as None, and 2.2% (107,196 people) as unspecified.[1] By 2016, the UN estimation for the population was around 4.9 million.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, there were over 104,000 Native American or indigenous inhabitants, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: Quitirris?(es) (in the Central Valley), Matamb~ or Chorotega (Guanacaste), Maleku (northern Alajuela), Bribri (southern Atlantic), Cabcar (Cordillera de Talamanca), [[]] (southern Costa Rica, along the Panam border), Boruca (southern Costa Rica) and Trraba?(es) (southern Costa Rica).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe population includes European Costa Ricans (of European ancestry), primarily of Spanish descent,[2] with significant numbers of Italian, German, English, Dutch, French, Irish, Portuguese, and Polish families, as well a sizable Jewish community. The majority of the Afro-Costa Ricans are Creole English-speaking descendants of 19th century black Jamaican immigrant workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2011 census classified 83.6% of the population as white or Mestizo; the latter are persons of combined European and Amerindian descent. The Mulatto segment (mix of white and black) represented 6.7% and indigenous people made up 2.4% of the population.[2] Native and European mixed blood populations are far less than in other Latin American countries. Exceptions are Guanacaste, where almost half the population is visibly mestizo, a legacy of the more pervasive unions between Spanish colonists and Chorotega Amerindians through several generations, and Lim܇n, where the vast majority of the Afro-Costa Rican community lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica hosts many refugees, mainly from Colombia and Nicaragua. As a result of that and illegal immigration, an estimated 10ÿ15% (400,000ÿ600,000) of the Costa Rican population is made up of Nicaraguans.[123][124] Some Nicaraguans migrate for seasonal work opportunities and then return to their country. Costa Rica took in many refugees from a range of other Latin American countries fleeing civil wars and dictatorships during the 1970s and 1980s, notably from Chile and Argentina, as well as people from El Salvador who fled from guerrillas and government death squads.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the World Bank, in 2010 about 489,200 immigrants lived in the country, many from Nicaragua, Panama, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize, while 125,306 Costa Ricans live abroad in the United States, Panama, Nicaragua, Spain, Mexico, Canada, Germany, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, and Ecuador.[126] The number of migrants declined in later years but in 2015, there were some 420,000 immigrants in Costa Rica[127] and the number of asylum seekers (mostly from Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua) rose to more than 110,000, a fivefold increase from 2012.[128] In 2016, the country was called a \\"magnet\\" for migrants from South and Central America and other countries who were hoping to reach the U.S.[129][130]\\r\\n\\r\\nReligion in Costa Rica[131][132]\\r\\n\\r\\nChristianity is Costa Rica's predominant religion, with Roman Catholicism being the official state religion according to the 1949 Constitution, which at the same time guarantees freedom of religion. It is the only state in the Americas which established Roman Catholicism as its state religion; other such countries are microstates in Europe: Liechtenstein, Monaco, the Vatican City and Malta.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the most recent nationwide survey of religion, conducted in 2007 by the University of Costa Rica, 70.5% of Costa Ricans are Roman Catholics (44.9% practicing Catholics), 13.8% are Evangelical Protestants (almost all are practicing), 11.3% report that they do not have a religion, and 4.3% belong to another religion. The rate of secularism is high by Latin American standards.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to small, but continuous, immigration from Asia and the Middle East, other religions have grown, the most popular being Buddhism, with about 100,000 practitioners (over 2% of the population).[132] Most Buddhists are members of the Han Chinese community of about 40,000 with some new local converts. There is also a small Muslim community of about 500 families, or 0.001% of the population.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sinagoga Shaarei Zion synagogue[134] is near La Sabana Metropolitan Park in San Jos. Several homes in the neighborhood east of the park display the Star of David and other Jewish symbols.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claims more than 35,000 members, and has a temple in San Jos that served as a regional worship center for Costa Rica.[136] However, they represent less than 1% of the population.[137][138]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary language spoken in Costa Rica is Spanish, which features characteristics distinct to the country, a form of Central American Spanish. Costa Rica is a linguistically diverse country and home to at least five living local indigenous languages spoken by the descendants of pre-Columbian peoples: Malku, Cabcar, Bribri, Guaym, and Buglere.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf native languages still spoken, primarily in indigenous reservations, the most numerically important are the Bribri, Malku, Cabcar and Ng?bere languages; some of these have several thousand speakers in Costa Rica while others have a few hundred. Some languages, such as Teribe and Boruca, have fewer than a thousand speakers. The Buglere language and the closely related Guaym are spoken by some in southeast Puntarenas.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Creole-English language, Jamaican patois (also known as Mekatelyu), is an English-based Creole language spoken by the Afro-Carib immigrants who have settled primarily in Lim܇n Province along the Caribbean coast.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 10.7% of Costa Rica's adult population (18 or older) also speaks English, 0.7% French, and 0.3% speaks Portuguese or German as a second language.[140]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica was the point where the Mesoamerican and South American native cultures met. The northwest of the country, the Nicoya peninsula, was the southernmost point of Nahuatl cultural influence when the Spanish conquerors (conquistadores) came in the 16th century. The central and southern portions of the country had Chibcha influences. The Atlantic coast, meanwhile, was populated with African workers during the 17th and 18th centuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the immigration of Spaniards, their 16th-century Spanish culture and its evolution marked everyday life and culture until today, with Spanish language and the Catholic religion as primary influences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department of Culture, Youth, and Sports is in charge of the promotion and coordination of cultural life. The work of the department is divided into Direction of Culture, Visual Arts, Scenic Arts, Music, Patrimony and the System of Libraries. Permanent programs, such as the National Symphony Orchestra of Costa Rica and the Youth Symphony Orchestra, are conjunctions of two areas of work: Culture and Youth.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDance-oriented genres, such as soca, salsa, bachata, merengue, cumbia and Costa Rican swing are enjoyed increasingly by older rather than younger people. The guitar is popular, especially as an accompaniment to folk dances; however, the marimba was made the national instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2017, National Geographic magazine named Costa Rica as the happiest country in the world.[141] The article included this summary: \\"Costa Ricans enjoy the pleasure of living daily life to the fullest in a place that mitigates stress and maximizes joy\\".[142] It is not surprising then that one of the most recognizable phrases among \\"Ticos\\" is \\"Pura Vida\\", pure life in a literal translation. It reflects the inhabitant's philosophy of life,[143] denoting a simple life, free of stress, a positive, relaxed feeling.[144] The  expression is used in various contexts in conversation.[145] Often, people walking down the streets, or buying food at shops say hello by saying Pura Vida. It can be phrased as a question or as an acknowledgement of one's presence. A recommended response to \\"How are you?\\" would be \\"Pura Vida.\\"[146] In that usage, it might be translated as \\"awesome\\", indicating that all is very well.[147] When used as a question, the connotation would be \\"everything is going well?\\" or \\"how are you?\\".[143]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica rates 12th on the 2017 Happy Planet Index in the World Happiness Report by the UN[148] but the country is said to be the happiest in Latin America. Reasons include the high level of social services, the caring nature of its inhabitants, long life expectancy and relatively low corruption.[149][150]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rican cuisine is a blend of Native American, Spanish, African and many other cuisine origins. Dishes such as the very traditional tamale and many others made of corn are the most representative of its indigenous inhabitants, and similar to other neighboring Mesoamerican countries. Spaniards brought many new ingredients to the country from other lands, especially spices and domestic animals. And later in the 19th century, the African flavor lent its presence with influence from other Caribbean mixed flavors. This is how Costa Rican cuisine today is very varied, with every new ethnic group who had recently become part of the country's population influencing the country's cuisine.[151][unreliable source?]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica entered the Summer Olympics for the first time in 1936 with the fencer Bernardo de la Guardia and the Winter Olympics for the first time in 1980 with the skier Arturo Kinch. All four of Costa Rica's Olympic medals were won by the sisters Silvia and Claudia Poll in swimming, with Claudia winning the only gold medal in 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\nFootball is the most popular sport in Costa Rica. The national team has played in four FIFA World Cup tournaments and reached the quarter-finals for the first time in 2014.[152][153] Its best performance in the regional CONCACAF Gold Cup was runner-up in 2002. Paulo Wanchope, a forward who played for three clubs in England's Premier League in the late 1990s and early 2000s, is credited with enhancing foreign recognition of Costa Rican football.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe literacy rate in Costa Rica is approximately 97 percent and English is widely spoken primarily due to Costa Ricas tourism industry.[85] When the army was abolished in 1949, it was said that the \\"army would be replaced with an army of teachers\\".[154] Universal public education is guaranteed in the constitution; primary education is obligatory, and both preschool and high school are free. Students who finish 11th grade receive a Costa Rican Bachillerato Diploma accredited by the Costa Rican Ministry of Education.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are both state and private universities. The University of Costa Rica has been awarded the title \\"Meritorious Institution of Costa Rican Education and Culture\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2016 report by the U.S. government report identifies the current challenges facing the education system, including the high dropout rate among high school students. The country needs even more workers who are fluent in English and languages such as Portuguese, Mandarin and French. It would also benefit from more graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs, according to the report.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the UNDP, in 2010 the life expectancy at birth for Costa Ricans was 79.3 years.[155] The Nicoya Peninsula is considered one of the Blue Zones in the world, where people commonly live active lives past the age of 100 years.[156][157] The New Economics Foundation (NEF) ranked Costa Rica first in its 2009 Happy Planet Index, and once again in 2012. The index measures the health and happiness they produce per unit of environmental input.[22][23] According to NEF, Costa Rica's lead is due to its very high life expectancy which is second highest in the Americas, and higher than the United States. The country also experienced well-being higher than many richer nations and a per capita ecological footprint one-third the size of the United States.[158]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, there were 0.58 new general practitioner (medical) consultations and 0.33 new specialist consultations per capita, and a hospital admission rate of 8.1%. Preventive health care is also successful. In 2002, 96% of Costa Rican women used some form of contraception, and antenatal care services were provided to 87% of all pregnant women. All children under one have access to well-baby clinics, and the immunization coverage rate in 2002 was above 91% for all antigens.[citation needed] Costa Rica has a very low malaria incidence of 48 per 100,000 in 2000 and no reported cases of measles in 2002. The perinatal mortality rate dropped from 12.0 per 1000 in 1972 to 5.4 per 1000 in 2001.[159]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica has been cited in various journals as Central America's great health success story.[citation needed] Its healthcare system is ranked higher than that of the United States, despite having a fraction of its GDP.[160] Prior to 1940, government hospitals and charities provided most health care. But since the 1941 creation of the Social Insurance Administration (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social ÿ CCSS), Costa Rica has provided universal health care to its wage-earning residents, with coverage extended to dependants over time. In 1973, the CCSS took over administration of all 29 of the country's public hospitals and all health care, also launching a Rural Health Program (Programa de Salud Rural) for primary care to rural areas, later extended to primary care services nationwide. In 1993, laws were passed to enable elected health boards that represented health consumers, social insurance representatives, employers, and social organizations. By the year 2000, social health insurance coverage was available to 82% of the Costa Rican population. Each health committee manages an area equivalent to one of the 83 administrative cantons of Costa Rica. There is limited use of private, for-profit services (around 14.4% of the national total health expenditure). About 7% of GDP is allocated to the health sector, and over 70% is government funded.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimary health care facilities in Costa Rica include health clinics, with a general practitioner, nurse, clerk, pharmacist and a primary health technician. In 2008, there were five specialty national hospitals, three general national hospitals, seven regional hospitals, 13 peripheral hospitals, and 10 major clinics serving as referral centers for primary care clinics, which also deliver biopsychosocial services, family and community medical services and promotion and prevention programs. Patients can choose private health care to avoid waiting lists.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rica is among the Latin America countries that have become popular destinations for medical tourism.[161][162] In 2006, Costa Rica received 150,000 foreigners that came for medical treatment.[161][162][163] Costa Rica is particularly attractive to Americans due to geographic proximity, high quality of medical services, and lower medical costs.[162]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2012, smoking in Costa Rica is subject to some of the most restrictive regulations in the world.","input":"What part of the world is costa rica in?"},{"output":"Babasaheb B.R.

Iron ore was the third-highest-value metal mined in the United States, after gold and copper.[1] Iron ore was mined from nine active mines and three reclamation operations in Michigan, Minnesota, and Utah. Most of the iron ore was mined in northern Minnesotas Mesabi Range. Net exports (exports minus imports) were 3.9 million tons. US iron ore made up 2.5 percent of the total mined worldwide in 2015. Employment as of 2014 was 5,750 in iron mines and iron ore treatment plants.[2]\\r\\nUS iron ore mining is dominated by the Precambrian banded iron formation deposits around Lake Superior, in Minnesota and Michigan; such deposits were also formerly mined in Wisconsin. For the past 50 years, more than 90 percent of US iron ore production has been mined from the Lake Superior deposits. None of the iron ore now mined in the US is direct shipping ore ready to be fed into the iron- and steel-making process. The ore is concentrated to raise the iron content before use. All the iron ore currently mined is from open pits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMinnesota provides the great bulk of the iron ore mined in the US. Iron ore comes from seven open-pit mines, and two tailings reclamation operations, one in St. Louis County, and one in Itasca County. Three of the mines are operated by Cleveland Cliffs, two by U. S. Steel, and one each by Mesabi Nugget Delaware LLC and Arcelor Mittal S.A. The two reclamation projects are operated by Magnetation, Inc.\\r\\nMichigan iron ore came from two active mines on the Marquette Iron Range: the Tilden Mine, and the Empire Mine, both operated by Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company. In 2014, the two mines produced 12.1 million tons of pelletized iron ore concentrate.[3]\\r\\nThe only recently operating iron mine in the US outside the Lake Superior area was the Iron Mountain mine, formerly called the Comstock-Mountain Lion mine, west of Cedar City, in Iron County, Utah. The mine shut down in October 2014.[4] Operated by CML Metals, Inc. the mine produced ore with 54% iron. The ore was treated onsite, producing a concentrate containing 65% iron. The concentrate was transported by rail to California, then shipped to China.[5]\\r\\nIn common with other commodities, the history of iron mining in the United States includes a shift to larger but lower-grade ore deposits, a shift from underground to open-pit mining, and a shift from labor-intensive mining to highly mechanized mining.\\r\\nAlthough in 2014, the US mined only 1.8 percent of all iron ore mined worldwide, the US was previously a much larger factor in the world iron ore market. From 1937 through 1953, US iron ore made up more than a third of the world's iron ore production; the proportion of world iron ore mined in the US peaked in 1945 at 56 percent.\\r\\nIron mining in the United States began in 1608, when a ship returning from the Jamestown Colony in Virginia carried a load of iron ore back to England. The manufacture of iron from ore apparently began in 1622, in what is now Chesterfield County, Virginia, but was halted when Native Americans killed everyone in the establishment. John Winthrop, Jr. established an iron furnace at Braintree, Massachusetts, which started making iron in 1644, but closed when it ran out of nearby ore in 1647. A more successful effort was established at Saugus, Massachusetts.[6]\\r\\nIron production in the 1700s was done with charcoal, of which American forests could provide a seemingly endless supply. Numerous small iron mines supplied iron furnaces scattered throughout the colonies in the 1700s. Bog iron ore common around the Chesapeake Bay fed numerous iron furnaces in Maryland and Virginia set up to export to Britain.[7]\\r\\nAlthough the bog iron ores mined in colonial days were widespread, the deposits were also small, and quickly exhausted. In the late 1700s the iron furnaces moved away from the bog iron ore of the coastal swamps, to larger iron ore deposits further inland. Inland locations also allowed the furnaces to be closer to sources of limestone, which was used as a flux in iron smelting. The proximity to larger ore deposits favored larger, more permanent iron smelters.[8]\\r\\nMost US iron mining before 1850 took place in eastern Pennsylvania, New York, and northern New Jersey.[9] New Jersey's principal iron ore district, at Dover, began mining in 1710. The Cornwall iron mine, the largest iron-producer in Pennsylvania, began mining in 1740. The Adirondack district of New York began mining in 1775.[10]\\r\\nStarting about 1820, coke from coal replaced charcoal as the fuel and reducing agent in iron furnaces. Coke has a higher crushing strength than charcoal, allowing larger smelting furnaces.[11] Because iron and steel-making at the time consumed more coal than iron ore, the steel mills moved closer to the coal mines to minimize transportation costs. Although later overshadowed by production from the Lake Superior mines, iron ore mining in New Jersey and New York continued until the 1960s. Iron mining in Pennsylvania ended in 1973.\\r\\nIron ore was discovered on the Marquette Range in 1844, and mining started in 1848. Mining increased after the opening of the ship canal at Sault Ste. Marie provided cheap water transportation between the iron mines to the lower Great Lakes. The Lake Superior iron deposits were the largest ever discovered in the United States, and by the late 1800s, dominated American iron mining.\\r\\nThe Lake Superior iron ores occur in Precambrian banded iron formation, in long, linear belts called iron ranges. After the Marquette Range in Michigan, iron ore was discovered in the Menominee Range (Michigan) in 1867, the Gogebic Range (Michigan and Wisconsin) in 1884, Vermillion Range (Minnesota) in 1885, Mesabi Range (Minnesota) in 1890, and the Cuyuna Range (Minnesota) in 1903.\\r\\nPrior to the start of iron mining on the Lake Superior iron ranges, US iron mining was done close to the iron furnaces. The large size of the Lake Superior deposits, and the access to cheap Great Lakes water transportation, enabled iron mining on a massive scale, located far from the iron furnaces. The Lake Superior iron ores, however, are located far from coal deposits, and the greater tonnage of coal required in steelmaking favored the location of furnaces closer to the coal mines. Favorable locations for steelworks using Lake Superior ore included Great Lakes ports such as Chicago, Cleveland, and Gary, as well as cities close to coal and with good water transportation, such as Pittsburgh. Although Lake Superior provides cheap shipping most of the year, from ports such as Duluth and Marquette, shipping by water halts in the winter months, and most ore is stockpiled until shipping resumes in the spring.\\r\\nIn the 1950s, the Lake Superior mines were running out of the high-grade direct-shipping ore. Experiments in concentrating the ores had been ongoing since the 1915. In 1954 the hematite ore (jasper, or jaspilite) began to be concentrated, and in 1956, the magnetite ore (taconite) was concentrated on a large scale. The concentrated ore is commonly formed into pellets for ease of handling.\\r\\nThrough 1965, the Lake Superior iron ranges had produced 3.66 billion tons of ore, about 70 percent of which came from the Mesabi Range. Totals through 1965 were:[12]\\r\\nThe largest production of US iron ore outside the Great Lakes districts was the Birmingham, Alabama district. Sedimentary iron ore in the Red Mountain formation of Silurian age was first used to make iron in 1864. Production was small until 1881, when major steelmaking began in Birmingham.[13]\\r\\nThe last iron mine shut down in 1975, after the district had produced 376 million long tons of ore.[14]","input":"Where is iron ore mined in the us?"},{"output":"before 2 January 1915","context":"The use of toxic chemicals as weapons dates back thousands of years, but the first large scale use of chemical weapons was during World War I.[1][2] They were primarily used to demoralize, injure, and kill entrenched defenders, against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow-moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective. The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals, such as tear gas, to lethal agents like phosgene, chlorine, and mustard gas. This chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century. The killing capacity of gas was limited, with about ninety thousand fatalities from a total of 1.3 million casualties caused by gas attacks. Gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop countermeasures, such as gas masks. In the later stages of the war, as the use of gas increased, its overall effectiveness diminished. The widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare, and wartime advances in the composition of high explosives, gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of World War I as \\"the chemist's war\\" and also the era where weapons of mass destruction were created.[3][4]\\r\\nThe use of poison gas by all major belligerents throughout World War I constituted war crimes as its use violated the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which prohibited the use of \\"poison or poisoned weapons\\" in warfare.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest military uses of chemicals during World War I were tear-inducing irritants rather than fatal or disabling poisons. During World War I, the French army was the first to employ gas, using 26?mm grenades filled with tear gas (ethyl bromoacetate) in August 1914. The small quantities of gas delivered, roughly 19?cm3 per cartridge, were not even detected by the Germans. The stocks were rapidly consumed and by November a new order was placed by the French military. As bromine was scarce among the Entente allies, the active ingredient was changed to chloroacetone.[7]\\r\\nIn October 1914, German troops fired fragmentation shells filled with a chemical irritant against British positions at Neuve Chapelle; the concentration achieved was so small that it too was barely noticed.[8] None of the combatants considered the use of tear gas to be in conflict with the Hague Treaty of 1899, which prohibited the launching of projectiles containing asphyxiating or poisonous gas.[9]\\r\\nThe first instance of large-scale use of gas as a weapon was on 31 January 1915, when Germany fired 18,000 artillery shells containing liquid xylyl bromide tear gas on Russian positions on the Rawka River, west of Warsaw during the Battle of Bolimov. Instead of vaporizing, the chemical froze and failed to have the desired effect.[8]\\r\\nThe first killing agent used by the German military was chlorine. Chlorine is a powerful irritant that can inflict damage to the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. At high concentrations and prolonged exposure it can cause death by asphyxiation.[10] German chemical companies BASF, Hoechst and Bayer (which formed the IG Farben conglomerate in 1925) had been making chlorine as a by-product of their dye manufacturing.[11] In cooperation with Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, they began developing methods of discharging chlorine gas against enemy trenches.[12][13]\\r\\nAccording to the fieldpost letter of Major Karl von Zingler, the first chlorine gas attack by German forces took place before 2 January 1915: \\"In other war theatres it does not go better and it has been said that our Chlorine is very effective. 140 English officers have been killed. This is a horrible weapon?...\\".[14]\\r\\nBy 22 April 1915, the German Army had 168 tons of chlorine deployed in 5,730 cylinders from LangemarkÿPoelkapelle, north of Ypres. At 17:30, in a slight easterly breeze, the gas was released, forming a grey-green cloud that drifted across positions held by French Colonial troops from Martinique, as well as the 1st Tirailleurs and the 2nd Zouaves from Algeria.[15] Faced with an unfamiliar threat these troops broke ranks, abandoning their trenches and creating an 8,000-yard (7?km) gap in the Allied line. The German infantry were also wary of the gas and, lacking reinforcements, failed to exploit the break before the 1st Canadian Division and assorted French troops reformed the line in scattered, hastily prepared positions 1,000ÿ3,000 yards (910ÿ2,740?m) apart.[8] The Entente governments claimed the attack was a flagrant violation of international law but Germany argued that the Hague treaty had only banned chemical shells, rather than the use of gas projectors.[16]\\r\\nIn what became the Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans used gas on three more occasions; on 24 April against the 1st Canadian Division,[17] on 2 May near Mouse Trap Farm and on 5 May against the British at Hill 60.[18] The British Official History stated that at Hill 60, \\"90 men died from gas poisoning in the trenches or before they could be got to a dressing station; of the 207 brought to the nearest dressing stations, 46 died almost immediately and 12 after long suffering.\\"[19]\\r\\nOn 6 August, German troops used chlorine gas against Russian troops defending the Fortress of Osowiec. Surviving defenders drove back the attack and retained the fortress.\\r\\nGermany used chemical weapons on the eastern front in an attack at Rawka, south of Warsaw. The Russian army took 9,000 casualties, with more than 1,000 fatalities. In response, the artillery branch of the Russian army organised a commission to study the delivery of poison gas in shells.[20]\\r\\nIt quickly became evident that the men who stayed in their places suffered less than those who ran away, as any movement worsened the effects of the gas, and that those who stood up on the fire step suffered lessindeed they often escaped any serious effectsthan those who lay down or sat at the bottom of a trench. Men who stood on the parapet suffered least, as the gas was denser near the ground. The worst sufferers were the wounded lying on the ground, or on stretchers, and the men who moved back with the cloud.[21] Chlorine was less effective as a weapon than the Germans had hoped, particularly as soon as simple countermeasures were introduced. The gas produced a visible greenish cloud and strong odour, making it easy to detect. It was water-soluble, so the simple expedient of covering the mouth and nose with a damp cloth was effective at reducing the effect of the gas. It was thought to be even more effective to use urine rather than water, as it was known at the time that chlorine reacted with urea (present in urine) to form dichloro urea.[22]\\r\\nChlorine required a concentration of 1,000 parts per million to be fatal, destroying tissue in the lungs, likely through the formation of hydrochloric acid when dissolved in the water in the lungs (2Cl2 + 2H2O L 4HCl + O2).[23] Despite its limitations, chlorine was an effective psychological weaponthe sight of an oncoming cloud of the gas was a continual source of dread for the infantry.[24]\\r\\nCountermeasures were quickly introduced in response to the use of chlorine. The Germans issued their troops with small gauze pads filled with cotton waste, and bottles of a bicarbonate solution with which to dampen the pads. Immediately following the use of chlorine gas by the Germans, instructions were sent to British and French troops to hold wet handkerchiefs or cloths over their mouths. Simple pad respirators similar to those issued to German troops were soon proposed by Lieutenant-Colonel N. C. Ferguson, the A.D.M.S. of the 28th Division. These pads were intended to be used damp, preferably dipped into a solution of bicarbonate kept in buckets for that purpose; other liquids were also used. Because such pads could not be expected to arrive at the front for several days, army divisions set about making them for themselves. Locally available muslin, flannel and gauze were used, officers were sent to Paris to buy more and local French women were employed making up rudimentary pads with string ties. Other units used lint bandages manufactured in the convent at Poperinge. Pad respirators were sent up with rations to British troops in the line as early as the evening of 24 April.[25]\\r\\nIn Britain the Daily Mail newspaper encouraged women to manufacture cotton pads, and within one month a variety of pad respirators were available to British and French troops, along with motoring goggles to protect the eyes. The response was enormous and a million gas masks were produced in a day. The Mail's design was useless when dry and caused suffocation when wetthe respirator was responsible for the deaths of scores of men. By 6 July 1915, the entire British army was equipped with the more effective \\"smoke helmet\\" designed by Major Cluny MacPherson, Newfoundland Regiment, which was a flannel bag with a celluloid window, which entirely covered the head. The race was then on between the introduction of new and more effective poison gases and the production of effective countermeasures, which marked gas warfare until the armistice in November 1918.[25]\\r\\nThe British expressed outrage at Germany's use of poison gas at Ypres and responded by developing their own gas warfare capability. The commander of II Corps, Lieutenant General Sir Charles Ferguson, said of gas:\\r\\nIt is a cowardly form of warfare which does not commend itself to me or other English soldiers?... We cannot win this war unless we kill or incapacitate more of our enemies than they do of us, and if this can only be done by our copying the enemy in his choice of weapons, we must not refuse to do so.[26]\\r\\nThe first use of gas by the British was at the Battle of Loos, 25 September 1915, but the attempt was a disaster. Chlorine, codenamed Red Star, was the agent to be used (140 tons arrayed in 5,100 cylinders), and the attack was dependent on a favourable wind. On this occasion the wind proved fickle, and the gas either lingered in no man's land or, in places, blew back on the British trenches.[8] This was compounded when the gas could not be released from all the British canisters because the wrong turning keys were sent with them. Subsequent retaliatory German shelling hit some of those unused full cylinders, releasing gas among the British troops.[27] Exacerbating the situation were the primitive flannel gas masks distributed to the British. The masks got hot, and the small eye-pieces misted over, reducing visibility. Some of the troops lifted the masks to get fresh air, causing them to be gassed.[28]\\r\\nThe deficiencies of chlorine were overcome with the introduction of phosgene, which was prepared by a group of French chemists led by Victor Grignard and first used by France in 1915.[29] Colourless and having an odour likened to \\"mouldy hay,\\" phosgene was difficult to detect, making it a more effective weapon. Phosgene was sometimes used on its own, but was more often used mixed with an equal volume of chlorine, with the chlorine helping to spread the denser phosgene.[30] The Allies called this combination White Star after the marking painted on shells containing the mixture.[31]\\r\\nPhosgene was a potent killing agent, deadlier than chlorine. It had a potential drawback in that some of the symptoms of exposure took 24 hours or more to manifest. This meant that the victims were initially still capable of putting up a fight; this could also mean that apparently fit troops would be incapacitated by the effects of the gas on the following day.[32]\\r\\nIn the first combined chlorineÿphosgene attack by Germany, against British troops at Wieltje near Ypres, Belgium on 19 December 1915, 88 tons of the gas were released from cylinders causing 1069 casualties and 69 deaths.[30] The British P gas helmet, issued at the time, was impregnated with sodium phenolate and partially effective against phosgene. The modified PH Gas Helmet, which was impregnated with phenate hexamine and hexamethylene tetramine (urotropine) to improve the protection against phosgene, was issued in January 1916.[30][33][34]\\r\\nAround 36,600 tons of phosgene were manufactured during the war, out of a total of 190,000 tons for all chemical weapons, making it second only to chlorine (93,800 tons) in the quantity manufactured:[35]\\r\\nPhosgene was never as notorious in public consciousness as mustard gas, but it killed far more people, about 85% of the 100,000 deaths caused by chemical weapons during World War I.\\r\\nOn 29 June 1916, Austrian forces attacked the Italian lines on Monte San Michele with a mix of phosgene and chlorine gas.[36] Thousands of Italian soldiers died in this first chemical weapons attack on the Italian Front.\\r\\nThe most widely reported and, perhaps, the most effective chemical agent of the First World War was sulfur mustard, known as \\"mustard gas\\". It is a volatile oily liquid. It was introduced as a vesicant by Germany in July 1917 prior to the Third Battle of Ypres.[8] The Germans marked their shells yellow for mustard gas and green for chlorine and phosgene; hence they called the new gas Yellow Cross. It was known to the British as HS (Hun Stuff), and the French called it Yperite (named after Ypres).[37]\\r\\nMustard gas is not an effective killing agent (though in high enough doses it is fatal) but can be used to harass and disable the enemy and pollute the battlefield. Delivered in artillery shells, mustard gas was heavier than air, and it settled to the ground as an oily liquid. Once in the soil, mustard gas remained active for several days, weeks, or even months, depending on the weather conditions.[38]\\r\\nThe skin of victims of mustard gas blistered, their eyes became very sore and they began to vomit. Mustard gas caused internal and external bleeding and attacked the bronchial tubes, stripping off the mucous membrane. This was extremely painful. Fatally injured victims sometimes took four or five weeks to die of mustard gas exposure.[39]\\r\\nOne nurse, Vera Brittain, wrote: \\"I wish those people who talk about going on with this war whatever it costs could see the soldiers suffering from mustard gas poisoning. Great mustard-coloured blisters, blind eyes, all sticky and stuck together, always fighting for breath, with voices a mere whisper, saying that their throats are closing and they know they will choke.\\"[40]\\r\\nThe polluting nature of mustard gas meant that it was not always suitable for supporting an attack as the assaulting infantry would be exposed to the gas when they advanced. When Germany launched Operation Michael on 21 March 1918, they saturated the Flesquires salient with mustard gas instead of attacking it directly, believing that the harassing effect of the gas, coupled with threats to the salient's flanks, would make the British position untenable.[citation needed]\\r\\nGas never reproduced the dramatic success of 22 April 1915; it became a standard weapon which, combined with conventional artillery, was used to support most attacks in the later stages of the war. Gas was employed primarily on the Western Frontthe static, confined trench system was ideal for achieving an effective concentration. Germany also used gas against Russia on the Eastern Front, where the lack of effective countermeasures resulted in deaths of over 56,000 Russians,[41] while Britain experimented with gas in Palestine during the Second Battle of Gaza.[42] Russia began manufacturing chlorine gas in 1916, with phosgene being produced later in the year. Most of the manufactured gas was never used.[20]\\r\\nThe British Army first used mustard gas in November 1917 at Cambrai, after their armies had captured a stockpile of German mustard gas shells. It took the British more than a year to develop their own mustard gas weapon, with production of the chemicals centred on Avonmouth Docks.[43][44] (The only option available to the British was the DespretzÿNiemannÿGuthrie process). This was used first in September 1918 during the breaking of the Hindenburg Line with the Hundred Days' Offensive.\\r\\nThe Allies mounted more gas attacks than the Germans in 1917 and 1918 because of a marked increase in production of gas from the Allied nations. Germany was unable to keep up with this pace despite creating various new gases for use in battle, mostly as a result of very costly methods of production. Entry into the war by the United States allowed the Allies to increase mustard gas production far more than Germany.[45][46] Also the prevailing wind on the Western Front was blowing from west to east,[47] which meant the British more frequently had favourable conditions for a gas release than did the Germans.\\r\\nWhen the United States entered the war, it was already mobilizing resources from academic, industry and military sectors for research and development into poison gas. A Subcommittee on Noxious Gases was created by the National Research Committee, a major research centre was established at Camp American University, and the 1st Gas Regiment was recruited.[46] The 1st Gas Regiment eventually served in France, where it used phosgene gas in several attacks.[48][46] The Artillery used mustard gas with significant effect during the Meuse Argonne Offensive on at least three occasions.[49] The United States began large-scale production of an improved vesicant gas known as Lewisite, for use in an offensive planned for early 1919. By the time of the armistice on 11 November, a plant near Willoughby, Ohio was producing 10 tons per day of the substance, for a total of about 150 tons. It is uncertain what effect this new chemical would have had on the battlefield, as it degrades in moist conditions.[50][51]\\r\\nBy the end of the war, chemical weapons had lost much of their effectiveness against well trained and equipped troops. At that time, chemical weapon agents inflicted an estimated 1.3 million casualties.[52]\\r\\nNevertheless, in the following years, chemical weapons were used in several, mainly colonial, wars where one side had an advantage in equipment over the other. The British used poison gas, possibly adamsite, against Russian revolutionary troops beginning on 27 August 1919[53] and contemplated using chemical weapons against Iraqi insurgents in the 1920s; Bolshevik troops used poison gas to suppress the Tambov Rebellion in 1920, Spain used chemical weapons in Morocco against Rif tribesmen throughout the 1920s[54] and Italy used mustard gas in Libya in 1930 and again during its invasion of Ethiopia in 1936.[55] In 1925, a Chinese warlord, Zhang Zuolin, contracted a German company to build him a mustard gas plant in Shenyang,[54] which was completed in 1927.\\r\\nPublic opinion had by then turned against the use of such weapons which led to the Geneva Protocol, an updated and extensive prohibition of poison weapons. The Protocol, which was signed by most First World War combatants in 1925, bans the use (but not the stockpiling) of lethal gas and bacteriological weapons. Most countries that signed ratified it within around five years; a few took much longer ÿ Brazil, Japan, Uruguay, and the United States did not do so until the 1970s, and Nicaragua ratified it in 1990.[56] The signatory nations agreed not to use poison gas in the future, stating \\"the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices, has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilized world.\\"[57]\\r\\nChemical weapons have been used in at least a dozen wars since the end of the First World War;[55] they were not used in combat on a large scale until Iraq used mustard gas and the more deadly nerve agents in the Halabja chemical attack near the end of the 8-year IranÿIraq War. The full conflict's use of such weaponry killed around 20,000 Iranian troops (and injured another 80,000), around a quarter of the number of deaths caused by chemical weapons during the First World War.[58]\\r\\nAll major combatants stockpiled chemical weapons during the Second World War, but the only reports of its use in the conflict were the Japanese use of relatively small amounts of mustard gas and lewisite in China,[59][60] and very rare occurrences in Europe (for example some mustard gas bombs were dropped on Warsaw on 3 September 1939, which Germany acknowledged in 1942 but indicated had been accidental).[54] Mustard gas was the agent of choice, with the British stockpiling 40,719 tons, the Soviets 77,400 tons, the Americans over 87,000 tons and the Germans 27,597 tons.[54] The destruction of an American cargo ship containing mustard gas led to many casualties in Bari, Italy, in December 1943.\\r\\nIn both Axis and Allied nations, children in school were taught to wear gas masks in case of gas attack. Germany developed the poison gases tabun, sarin, and soman during the war, and used Zyklon B in their extermination camps. Neither Germany nor the Allied nations used any of their war gases in combat, despite maintaining large stockpiles and occasional calls for their use.[nb 1] Poison gas played an important role in the Holocaust.\\r\\nBritain made plans to use mustard gas on the landing beaches in the event of an invasion of the United Kingdom in 1940.[61][62] The United States considered using gas to support their planned invasion of Japan.[63]\\r\\nThe contribution of gas weapons to the total casualty figures was relatively minor. British figures, which were accurately maintained from 1916, recorded that 3% of gas casualties were fatal, 2% were permanently invalid and 70% were fit for duty again within six weeks.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt was remarked as a joke that if someone yelled 'Gas', everyone in France would put on a mask.?... Gas shock was as frequent as shell shock.\\r\\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!  An ecstasy of fumbling,\\r\\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time;\\r\\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling,\\r\\nAnd flound'ring like a man in fire or lime?...\\r\\nDim, through the misty panes and thick green light,\\r\\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning.\\r\\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight,\\r\\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.\\r\\nDeath by gas was often slow and painful. According to Denis Winter (Death's Men, 1978), a fatal dose of phosgene eventually led to \\"shallow breathing and retching, pulse up to 120, an ashen face and the discharge of four pints (2 litres) of yellow liquid from the lungs each hour for the 48 of the drowning spasms.\\"\\r\\nA common fate of those exposed to gas was blindness, chlorine gas or mustard gas being the main causes. One of the most famous First World War paintings, Gassed by John Singer Sargent, captures such a scene of mustard gas casualties which he witnessed at a dressing station at Le Bac-du-Sud near Arras in July 1918. (The gases used during that battle (tear gas) caused temporary blindness and/or a painful stinging in the eyes. These bandages were normally water-soaked to provide a rudimentary form of pain relief to the eyes of casualties before they reached more organized medical help.)\\r\\nThe proportion of mustard gas fatalities to total casualties was low; 2% of mustard gas casualties died and many of these succumbed to secondary infections rather than the gas itself. Once it was introduced at the third battle of Ypres, mustard gas produced 90% of all British gas casualties and 14% of battle casualties of any type.\\r\\nMustard gas was a source of extreme dread. In The Anatomy of Courage (1945), Lord Moran, who had been a medical officer during the war, wrote:\\r\\nAfter July 1917 gas partly usurped the role of high explosive in bringing to head a natural unfitness for war. The gassed men were an expression of trench fatigue, a menace when the manhood of the nation had been picked over.[64]\\r\\nMustard gas did not need to be inhaled to be effective  any contact with skin was sufficient. Exposure to 0.1 ppm was enough to cause massive blisters. Higher concentrations could burn flesh to the bone. It was particularly effective against the soft skin of the eyes, nose, armpits and groin, since it dissolved in the natural moisture of those areas. Typical exposure would result in swelling of the conjunctiva and eyelids, forcing them closed and rendering the victim temporarily blind. Where it contacted the skin, moist red patches would immediately appear which after 24 hours would have formed into blisters. Other symptoms included severe headache, elevated pulse and temperature (fever), and pneumonia (from blistering in the lungs).\\r\\nMany of those who survived a gas attack were scarred for life. Respiratory disease and failing eyesight were common post-war afflictions. Of the Canadians who, without any effective protection, had withstood the first chlorine attacks during Second Ypres, 60% of the casualties had to be repatriated and half of these were still unfit by the end of the war, over three years later.\\r\\nMany of those who were fairly soon recorded as fit for service were left with scar tissue in their lungs. This tissue was susceptible to tuberculosis attack. It was from this that many of the 1918 casualties died, around the time of the Second World War, shortly before sulfa drugs became widely available for its treatment.\\r\\nA British nurse treating mustard gas cases recorded:\\r\\nThey cannot be bandaged or touched. We cover them with a tent of propped-up sheets. Gas burns must be agonizing because usually the other cases do not complain even with the worst wounds but gas cases are invariably beyond endurance and they cannot help crying out.[65]\\r\\nA postmortem account from the British official medical history records one of the British casualties:\\r\\nThe distribution of gas cloud casualties was not limited to the front. Nearby towns were at risk from winds blowing the poison gases through. Civilians rarely had a warning system to alert their neighbours of the danger and often did not have access to effective gas masks. When the gas came to the towns it could easily get into houses through open windows and doors. An estimated 100,000-260,000 civilian casualties were caused by chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands (along with military personnel) died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. Many commanders on both sides knew that such weapons would cause major harm to civilians as wind would blow poison gases into nearby civilian towns but nonetheless continued to use them throughout the war. British Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig wrote in his diary: \\"My officers and I were aware that such weapon would cause harm to women and children living in nearby towns, as strong winds were common on the battlefront. However, because the weapon was to be directed against the enemy, none of us were overly concerned at all.\\"[67][68][69][70]\\r\\nNone of the First World War's combatants were prepared for the introduction of poison gas as a weapon. Once gas was introduced, development of gas protection began and the process continued for much of the war producing a series of increasingly effective gas masks.[46]\\r\\nEven at Second Ypres, Germany, still unsure of the weapon's effectiveness, only issued breathing masks to the engineers handling the gas. At Ypres a Canadian medical officer, who was also a chemist, quickly identified the gas as chlorine and recommended that the troops urinate on a cloth and hold it over their mouth and nose. The first official equipment issued was similarly crude; a pad of material, usually impregnated with a chemical, tied over the lower face. To protect the eyes from tear gas, soldiers were issued with gas goggles.\\r\\nThe next advance was the introduction of the gas helmet  basically a bag placed over the head. The fabric of the bag was impregnated with a chemical to neutralize the gas  the chemical would wash out into the soldier's eyes whenever it rained. Eye-pieces, which were prone to fog up, were initially made from talc. When going into combat, gas helmets were typically worn rolled up on top of the head, to be pulled down and secured about the neck when the gas alarm was given. The first British version was the Hypo helmet, the fabric of which was soaked in sodium hyposulfite (commonly known as \\"hypo\\"). The British P gas helmet, partially effective against phosgene and with which all infantry were equipped with at Loos, was impregnated with sodium phenolate. A mouthpiece was added through which the wearer would breathe out to prevent carbon dioxide build-up. The adjutant of the 1/23rd Battalion, The London Regiment, recalled his experience of the P helmet at Loos:\\r\\nThe goggles rapidly dimmed over, and the air came through in such suffocatingly small quantities as to demand a continuous exercise of will-power on the part of the wearers.[71]\\r\\nA modified version of the P Helmet, called the PH Helmet, was issued in January 1916, and was impregnated with hexamethylenetetramine to improve the protection against phosgene.[30]\\r\\nSelf-contained box respirators represented the culmination of gas mask development during the First World War. Box respirators used a two-piece design; a mouthpiece connected via a hose to a box filter. The box filter contained granules of chemicals that neutralised the gas, delivering clean air to the wearer. Separating the filter from the mask enabled a bulky but efficient filter to be supplied. Nevertheless, the first version, known as the Large Box Respirator (LBR) or \\"Harrison's Tower\\", was deemed too bulky  the box canister needed to be carried on the back. The LBR had no mask, just a mouthpiece and nose clip; separate gas goggles had to be worn. It continued to be issued to the artillery gun crews but the infantry were supplied with the \\"Small Box Respirator\\" (SBR).\\r\\nThe Small Box Respirator featured a single-piece, close-fitting rubberized mask with eye-pieces. The box filter was compact and could be worn around the neck. The SBR could be readily upgraded as more effective filter technology was developed. The British-designed SBR was also adopted for use by the American Expeditionary Force. The SBR was the prized possession of the ordinary infantryman; when the British were forced to retreat during the German Spring Offensive of 1918, it was found that while some troops had discarded their rifles, hardly any had left behind their respirators.\\r\\nHorses and mules were important methods of transport that could be endangered if they came into close contact with gas. This was not so much of a problem until it became common to launch gas great distances. This caused researchers to develop masks that could be used on animals such as dogs, horses, mules, and even carrier pigeons.[72]\\r\\nFor mustard gas, which could cause severe damage by simply making contact with skin, no effective countermeasure was found during the war. The kilt-wearing Scottish regiments were especially vulnerable to mustard gas injuries due to their bare legs. At Nieuwpoort in Flanders some Scottish battalions took to wearing women's tights beneath the kilt as a form of protection.\\r\\nGas alert procedure became a routine for the front-line soldier. To warn of a gas attack, a bell would be rung, often made from a spent artillery shell. At the noisy batteries of the siege guns, a compressed air strombus horn was used, which could be heard nine miles (14?km) away. Notices would be posted on all approaches to an affected area, warning people to take precautions.\\r\\nOther British attempts at countermeasures were not so effective. An early plan was to use 100,000 fans to disperse the gas. Burning coal or carborundum dust was tried. A proposal was made to equip front-line sentries with diving helmets, air being pumped to them through a 100?ft (30 m) hose.\\r\\nThe effectiveness of all countermeasures is apparent. In 1915, when poison gas was relatively new, less than 3% of British gas casualties died. In 1916, the proportion of fatalities jumped to 17%. By 1918, the figure was back below 3%, though the total number of British gas casualties was now nine times the 1915 levels.\\r\\nThe first system employed for the mass delivery of gas involved releasing the gas cylinders in a favourable wind such that it was carried over the enemy's trenches. The Hague Convention of 1899 prohibited the use of poisons gasses delivered by projectiles. The main advantage of this method was that it was relatively simple and, in suitable atmospheric conditions, produced a concentrated cloud capable of overwhelming the gas mask defences. The disadvantages of cylinder releases were numerous. First and foremost, delivery was at the mercy of the wind. If the wind was fickle, as was the case at Loos, the gas could backfire, causing friendly casualties. Gas clouds gave plenty of warning, allowing the enemy time to protect themselves, though many soldiers found the sight of a creeping gas cloud unnerving. Gas clouds had limited penetration, only capable of affecting the front-line trenches before dissipating.\\r\\nFinally, the cylinders had to be emplaced at the very front of the trench system so that the gas was released directly over no man's land. This meant that the cylinders had to be manhandled through communication trenches, often clogged and sodden, and stored at the front where there was always the risk that cylinders would be prematurely breached during a bombardment. A leaking cylinder could issue a telltale wisp of gas that, if spotted, would be sure to attract shellfire.\\r\\nA British chlorine cylinder, known as an \\"oojah\\", weighed 190?lb (86?kg), of which 60?lb (27?kg) was chlorine gas, and required two men to carry. Phosgene gas was introduced later in a cylinder, known as a \\"mouse\\", that weighed 50?lb (23?kg).\\r\\nDelivering gas via artillery shell overcame many of the risks of dealing with gas in cylinders. The Germans, for example, used 5.9-inch (150?mm) artillery shells. Gas shells were independent of the wind and increased the effective range of gas, making anywhere within reach of the guns vulnerable. Gas shells could be delivered without warning, especially the clear, nearly odourless phosgene  there are numerous accounts of gas shells, landing with a \\"plop\\" rather than exploding, being initially dismissed as dud HE or shrapnel shells, giving the gas time to work before the soldiers were alerted and took precautions.\\r\\nThe main flaw associated with delivering gas via artillery was the difficulty of achieving a killing concentration. Each shell had a small gas payload and an area would have to be subjected to a saturation bombardment to produce a cloud to match cylinder delivery. Mustard gas did not need to form a concentrated cloud and hence artillery was the ideal vehicle for delivery of this battlefield pollutant.\\r\\nThe solution to achieving a lethal concentration without releasing from cylinders was the \\"gas projector\\", essentially a large-bore mortar that fired the entire cylinder as a missile. The British Livens projector (invented by Captain W.H. Livens in 1917) was a simple device; an 8-inch (200?mm) diameter tube sunk into the ground at an angle, a propellant was ignited by an electrical signal, firing the cylinder containing 30 or 40?lb (14 or 18?kg) of gas up to 1,900 metres. By arranging a battery of these projectors and firing them simultaneously, a dense concentration of gas could be achieved. The Livens was first used at Arras on 4 April 1917. On 31 March 1918 the British conducted their largest ever \\"gas shoot\\", firing 3,728 cylinders at Lens.\\r\\nOver 16,000,000 acres (65,000?km2) of France had to be cordoned off at the end of the war because of unexploded ordnance. About 20% of the chemical shells were duds, and approximately 13 million of these munitions were left in place. This has been a serious problem in former battle areas from immediately after the end of the War until the present. Shells may be, for instance, uncovered when farmers plough their fields (termed the 'iron harvest'), and are also regularly discovered when public works or construction work is done.[73]\\r\\nAnother difficulty is the current stringency of environmental legislation. In the past, a common method of getting rid of unexploded chemical ammunition was to detonate or dump it at sea; this is currently prohibited in most countries.[74][nb 2]\\r\\nThe problems are especially acute in some northern regions of France. The French government no longer disposes of chemical weapons at sea. For this reason, piles of untreated chemical weapons accumulated. In 2001, it became evident that the pile stored at a depot in Vimy was unsafe; the inhabitants of the neighbouring town were evacuated, and the pile moved, using refrigerated trucks and under heavy guard, to a military camp in Suippes.[75] The capacity of the plant is meant to be 25 tons per year (extensible to 80 tons at the beginning), for a lifetime of 30 years.[76]\\r\\nGermany has to deal with unexploded ammunition and polluted lands resulting from the explosion of an ammunition train in 1919.[76]\\r\\nAside from unexploded shells, there have been claims that poison residues have remained in the local environment for an extended period, though this is unconfirmed; well known but unverified anecdotes claim that as late as the 1960s trees in the area retained enough mustard gas residue to injure farmers or construction workers who were clearing them.[77]\\r\\nSoldiers who claimed to have been exposed to chemical warfare have often presented with unusual medical conditions which has led to much controversy. The lack of information has left doctors, patients, and their families in the dark in terms of prognosis and treatment. Nerve agents such as sarin, tabun, and soman are believed to have the most significant long-term health effects.[80] Chronic fatigue and memory loss have been reported to last up to three years after exposure. In the years following World War One, there were many conferences held in attempts to abolish the use of chemical weapons all together, such as the Washington Naval Conference (1921ÿ22), Geneva Conference (1923ÿ25) and the World Disarmament Conference (1933). The United States was an original signatory of the Geneva Protocol in 1925, but the US Senate did not ratify it until 1975.\\r\\nAlthough the health effects are generally chronic in nature, the exposures were generally acute. A positive correlation has been proven between exposure to mustard agents and skin cancers, other respiratory and skin conditions, leukemia, several eye conditions, bone marrow depression and subsequent immunosuppression, psychological disorders and sexual dysfunction.[81] Chemicals used in the production of chemical weapons have also left residues in the soil where the weapons were used. The chemicals that have been detected can cause cancer and can affect the brain, blood, liver, kidneys and skin.[82]\\r\\nDespite the evidence in support of long-term health effects, there are studies that show just the opposite. Some US veterans who were closely affected by chemical weapons showed no neurological evidence in the following years. These same studies showed that one single contact with chemical weapons would be enough to cause long-term health effects.[83]","input":"When was chlorine gas first used in ww1?"},{"output":"1968 film adaptation, Planet of the Apes","context":"Original series\\r\\nRemake\\r\\nReboot series\\r\\nPlanet of the Apes is an American science fiction media franchise consisting of films, books, television series, comics, and other media about a world in which humans and intelligent apes clash for control. The franchise is based on French author Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel La Plante des singes, translated into English as Planet of the Apes or Monkey Planet. Its 1968 film adaptation, Planet of the Apes, was a critical and commercial hit, initiating a series of sequels, tie-ins, and derivative works. Arthur P. Jacobs produced the first five Apes films through APJAC Productions for distributor 20th Century Fox; since his death in 1973, Fox has controlled the franchise.\\r\\nFour sequels followed the original film from 1970 to 1973: Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, and Battle for the Planet of the Apes. They did not approach the critical acclaim of the original, but were commercially successful, spawning two television series in 1974 and 1975. Plans for a film remake stalled in \\"development hell\\" for over ten years before Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes was released in 2001. A reboot film series commenced in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which was followed by Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in 2014 and War for the Planet of the Apes in 2017. The films have grossed a total of over $2 billion worldwide, against a combined budget of $567.5 million. Along with further narratives in various media, franchise tie-ins include video games, toys, and planned theme park rides.\\r\\nPlanet of the Apes has received particular attention among film critics for its treatment of racial issues. Cinema and cultural analysts have also explored its Cold War and animal rights themes. The series has influenced subsequent films, media, and art, as well as popular culture and political discourse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series began with French author Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel La Plante des singes. Boulle wrote the novel in six months after the \\"humanlike expressions\\" of gorillas at the zoo inspired him to contemplate the relationship between man and ape. La Plante des singes was heavily influenced by 18th- and 19th-century fantastical travel narratives, especially Jonathan Swift's satirical Gulliver's Travels. It is one of several of Boulle's works to use science fiction tropes and plot devices to comment on the failings of human nature and mankind's overreliance on technology, though Boulle rejected the science fiction label, instead terming his genre \\"social fantasy\\".[1]\\r\\nThe novel is a satire that follows French journalist Ulysse Mrou, who participates in a voyage to a distant planet where speechless, animalistic humans are hunted and enslaved by an advanced society of apes. Eventually Mrou discovers that humans once dominated the planet until their complacency allowed the more industrious apes to overthrow them. Each of the apes is sorted into their classes: the gorillas are police and military officers, the chimpanzees are scientists, and the orangutans are politicians. The story's central message is that human intelligence is not a fixed quality and could atrophy if taken for granted.[1][2] Boulle considered the novel one of his minor works, though it proved to be a bestseller. British author Xan Fielding translated it into English; it was published in the United Kingdom as Monkey Planet and in the United States as Planet of the Apes.[3]\\r\\nBoulle's literary agent, Allain Bernheim, brought the novel to the attention of American film producer Arthur P. Jacobs, who had come to Paris looking for properties to adapt with his new company, APJAC Productions. To explain his interests, Jacobs would tell agents, \\"I wish King Kong hadn't been made so I could make it.\\" Bernheim initially approached him about a Fran?oise Sagan novel, which Jacobs turned down. Remembering Jacobs' earlier comment about King Kong, Bernheim mentioned La Plante des singes, not expecting he would be interested. However, the story intrigued Jacobs, who bought the film rights immediately.[4]\\r\\nAfter optioning the novel's film rights, Jacobs spent over three years trying to convince filmmakers to take on the project. He hired a succession of artists to create test sketches, and hired veteran television writer Rod Serling, creator of The Twilight Zone, to pen the screenplay.[5][6] Serling's script changed elements of Boulle's novel, introducing Cold War themes; notably, he devised a new twist ending that revealed the planet to be a future Earth where humans had destroyed themselves through nuclear warfare.[7] Production costs were estimated at over $10 million, a risk no studio in either Hollywood or Europe would assume. Jacobs and associate producer Mort Abrahams persevered, and eventually persuaded Charlton Heston to star; Heston in turn recommended director Franklin J. Schaffner. The team recorded a brief screen test featuring Heston, which ultimately convinced 20th Century Fox the film could succeed.[5]\\r\\nFox insisted on changes to reduce the budget to a more manageable $5.8 million.[8] The producers hired veteran writer Michael Wilson, who had previously adapted Boulle's novel The Bridge over the River Kwai, to rewrite Serling's script.[9][10] To save on special effects costs, Wilson's script described an ape society more primitive than that which appeared in the novel.[10][11] The new version changed much of the plot and dialogue, but retained the Cold War themes and Serling's ending.[11][12] John Chambers created the makeup effects.[13]\\r\\nHeston played 20th-century American astronaut George Taylor, who travels to a strange planet where intelligent apes dominate mute, primitive humans. Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall played the sympathetic chimpanzees Zira and Cornelius, and Linda Harrison portrayed Taylor's love interest Nova. Maurice Evans played the villain, orangutan science minister Dr. Zaius.[14] The finale, in which Taylor comes upon a ruined Statue of Liberty and realizes he has been on Earth all along, became the series' defining scene and one of the most iconic images in 1960s film.[15] Planet of the Apes was released on February 8, 1968, and was a smash success with both critics and audiences. It was one of the year's ten biggest money makers in North America, taking in an estimated $22 million (nearly four times its budget), and earned rave reviews.[16][17] John Chambers received an honorary Oscar at the 41st Academy Awards for his make-up effects, the first ever given to a make-up artist.[13] Jerry Goldsmith's score and Morton Haack's costume design also earned Oscar nominations.[18] Fox approached Jacobs and Abrahams about filming a sequel. Though they had not made the film with sequels in mind, its success led them to consider the prospect.[19]\\r\\nPlanning for the sequel, eventually titled Beneath the Planet of the Apes, began two months after the original film's release. Jacobs and Abrahams considered several treatments by Serling and Boulle, eventually rejecting them.[20] In late 1968, the producers hired Paul Dehn to write the script; he would become the primary writer for the franchise.[21][22] Charlton Heston was uninterested in a sequel, but agreed to shoot a few scenes if his character were killed off and his salary donated to charity.[23] In one of many major rewrites, Dehn altered the script to center on a new character, Brent, played by James Franciscus.[24] With Shaffner unavailable, owing to his work on Patton, the producers hired Ted Post as director on January 8, 1969.[25] Post struggled with the material, especially after the studio cut the budget to $3.4 million.[26]\\r\\nThe story follows Franciscus's character, an astronaut who while searching for Taylor inadvertently follows him into the future. After encountering the apes from the first film, Brent finds Taylor imprisoned by a colony of subterranean human mutants who worship an ancient nuclear bomb. Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, and Linda Harrison returned as Zira, Zaius, and Nova.[27] David Watson replaced Roddy McDowall as Cornelius, as McDowall was unavailable due to a scheduling conflict.[28] James Gregory played gorilla General Ursus and Paul Richards played mutant leader Mndez. The film opened on May 26, 1970.[27] Unlike its predecessor, Beneath was poorly reviewed; critics typically regard it as the worst of the Apes sequels other than the last, Battle for the Planet of the Apes.[29] Nonetheless, it was a major box office hit, nearing the original's numbers. Despite a conclusion depicting the planet's nuclear destruction, Fox requested another sequel, creating a series.[30][31]\\r\\nFollowing the financial success of Beneath, Arthur P. Jacobs recruited Paul Dehn to write a new script with a brief telegram: \\"Apes exist, Sequel required.\\" Dehn immediately started work on what became Escape from the Planet of the Apes. The producers hired a new director, Don Taylor.[31] Fox gave the production a greatly diminished budget of $2.5 million, which required a tight production schedule.[32]\\r\\nTo work around the budget, as well as Beneath's seemingly definitive ending, the film took the series in a new direction by transporting Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall, returning to the role after being absent from Beneath) back in time to the contemporary United States, reducing the need for expensive sets and ape make-up effects.[26] In the film, Zira and Cornelius are initially accepted by American society, but fears that their child will bring about the domination of the human race by evolved apes leads to conflict. Jacobs' wife, Natalie Trundy, who appeared as a mutant in Beneath and would play the ape Lisa in the next two sequels, was cast as Dr. Stephanie Branton.[33] Bradford Dillman played Dr. Lewis Dixon, Ricardo Montalbn played Armando, and Eric Braeden portrayed the villain, the president's science advisor Otto Hasslein.[34]\\r\\nCompared to its predecessors, Escape dwelt more heavily on themes of racial conflict, which became a primary focus through the rest of the series.[35] The film opened on May 21, 1971, less than a year after Beneath. It was well received by critics.[36] From this point critics began seeing the films less as independent units and more as installments in a greater work; Cinefantastique editor Frederick S. Clarke wrote that the burgeoning series had \\"the promise of being the first epic of filmed science fiction.\\"[37] It also performed well at the box office, though not as strongly as its predecessors. Fox ordered a third sequel.[38]\\r\\nBased on the strong positive response to Escape, Fox ordered Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, though it provided a comparatively low budget of $1.7 million.[38] Paul Dehn returned as the scriptwriter, and producer Jacobs hired J. Lee Thompson to direct. Thompson had worked with Jacobs on two earlier films as well as during the initial stages of Planet, but scheduling conflicts had made him unavailable during its long development process.[39] For Conquest, Thompson and Dehn focused heavily on the racial conflict theme, an ancillary concern in the early films that became a central focus in Escape.[40] In particular, Dehn associated the apes with African-Americans and modeled the plot after the 1966 Watts Riots and other episodes from the Civil Rights Movement.[39] Roddy McDowall signed on to play Caesar, the son of his previous character Cornelius.[41] Ricardo Montalban returned as Armando, while Don Murray played Governor Breck, Severn Darden played Kolp, and Hari Rhodes played MacDonald.[42]\\r\\nFollowing Escape, Conquest is set in a near future where humans have turned apes into slaves; Caesar rises from bondage to lead an ape rebellion. The film opened on June 30, 1972.[42] Reviews were mixed, but the ending left the series open to another sequel, and Conquest was successful enough at the box office that Fox commissioned another film.[43]\\r\\nFox approved Battle for the Planet of the Apes with a $1.2 million budget, the lowest of the series.[44] The filmmakers went into the project knowing it would be the last of the series.[45] J. Lee Thompson returned as director. Series writer Paul Dehn submitted a treatment, but illness forced him to leave the film before completing the script. The producers subsequently hired John William Corrington and Joyce Hooper Corrington to write the screenplay.[46][47] Battle continued Conquest's focus on racial conflict and domination, but, likely based in part on the studio's wishes, the Corringtons discarded Dehn's pessimistic treatment in favor of a story with a more hopeful, though ambiguous, resolution.[48]\\r\\nBattle follows Caesar as he leads the apes and their human subjects after a devastating war that destroyed much of the planet. He contends with both an attack by radiation-scarred human mutants and a coup attempt as he attempts to build a better society for both apes and humans. McDowall returned as Caesar, and Severn Darden returned as Kolp. Paul Williams played the orangutan Virgil, Austin Stoker played MacDonald (the brother of Hari Rhodes' character), and Claude Akins played the evil gorilla general Aldo. John Huston played the orangutan Lawgiver in a frame narrative.[49] The film opened on May 2, 1973. It made a profit over production costs, but received poor reviews from critics, who regard it as the weakest of the five films.[50]\\r\\nCritics have offered various interpretations of the film's message and its significance for the series. Particular attention has been paid to the ambiguous imagery in the ending: set 700 years after the main events, the last scene depicts a statue of Caesar shedding a single tear as the Lawgiver recounts Caesar's story to an integrated audience of ape and human children. By one interpretation, the statue cries tears of joy because the species have broken the cycle of oppression, giving the series an optimistic finale. By another, the statue weeps because racial strife still exists, implying the dystopian future of Planet and Beneath is unavoidable.[51]\\r\\nAs well as their profitable returns at the box office, the films earned very high ratings on television after their theatrical runs. To capitalize on this success, Arthur P. Jacobs conceived of an hour-long live action television series to follow the films. He first had the idea in 1971 during the production of Conquest, which he then anticipated would be the final film, but he shelved the project once Fox ordered a fifth installment. Jacobs died on June 27, 1973, bringing an end to the APJAC Productions era of the Planet of the Apes franchise. Former Fox executive Stan Hough took over as producer for the television project, titled Planet of the Apes. CBS picked up the series for its 1974 autumn lineup.[52]\\r\\nRon Harper and James Naughton played Alan Virdon and Peter Burke, two 20th-century American astronauts who pass through a time warp to a future where apes subjugate humans (unlike the original film, the humans can speak). Roddy McDowall returned to the franchise as Galen, a chimpanzee who joins the astronauts. Booth Coleman played orangutan Councillor Zaius and Mark Lenard played gorilla General Urko. The episodes portray Virdon, Burke, and Galen as they search for a way home, aid downtrodden humans and apes, and avoid the authorities.[53] The show premiered on September 13, 1974, filling CBS's 8ÿ9 p.m. time slot on Fridays. It earned low ratings during its run, a fact the production team attributed to repetitive storytelling and too little screen time for the apes who made the franchise famous. Given the considerable production costs, CBS cancelled the show after 14 episodes, the last airing on December 20, 1974.[54][55][56]\\r\\nIn 1981, Fox reedited ten of the episodes into five television films. Each film combined two episodes and (in some markets) added new introductory and concluding segments starring McDowall as an aged Galen. The films were given what scholar Eric Greene calls \\"the most outlandish titles of the Apes corpus\\": Back to the Planet of the Apes; Forgotten City of the Planet of the Apes; Treachery and Greed on the Planet of the Apes; Life, Liberty and Pursuit on the Planet of the Apes; and Farewell to the Planet of the Apes.[57]\\r\\nGreene finds the show's position in the Apes timeline significant: set in 3085, it occurs about 900 years before Taylor's crash in the original film, and 400 years after the Lawgiver's sermon in Battle. By depicting a future where apes dominate humans, it implies the Lawgiver's message of equality between man and ape has failed, giving weight to the more pessimistic interpretation of Battle's ending.[58] Greene argues that the show emphasized the theme of racial conflict less than the films had, though the episodes \\"The Trap\\" and \\"The Liberator\\" made it a central focus.[59]\\r\\nIn 1975, after the failure of the live-action series, NBC and 20th Century Fox agreed to adapt Planet of the Apes for an animated series. The network contracted DePatie-Freleng Enterprises to produce a half-hour Saturday-morning cartoon titled Return to the Planet of the Apes. Doug Wildey, co-creator of Jonny Quest, took on most creative control as associate producer, storyboard director, and supervising director.[60] Wildey had only watched the original film and Beneath, and thus based his interpretation on them. As such, the show relied less on the themes and plot developments from Escape, Conquest, and Battle and instead returned to the Vietnam War and Cold War themes prominent in the first two films.[61]\\r\\nThe plot concerns three American astronauts, Bill Hudson (Tom Williams), Jeff Allen (Austin Stoker, who played MacDonald in Battle), and Judy Franklin (Claudette Nevins), who inadvertently journey to Earth's far future. They find the world populated by three groups: mute humans who inhabit desert caves, subterranean human \\"Underdwellers\\" fashioned after the mutants of Beneath, and civilized apes who subjugate the humans. Through the show, the astronauts become increasingly involved in the planet's affairs and in defending the humans against an ape invasion. The cast featured characters based on those from the previous films and TV series, including Nova (Nevins again), General Urko (Henry Cordin), Zira (Philippa Harris), Cornelius (Edwin Mills), and Dr. Zaius (Richard Blackburn).[62] NBC broadcast thirteen episodes between September 6 and November 21, 1975.[63] The show did not achieve particularly strong ratings. The network considered producing a second, three-episode season to complete the story, but this never materialized.[64]\\r\\nFox initiated plans to relaunch the Planet of the Apes series in the 1980s, but the project fell into a drawn-out and fruitless development phase\\"development hell\\"for over ten years, one of the most protracted development periods in film history. It began in 1988, when Fox announced that Adam Rifkin, then a 21-year-old independent film director, would develop a new Apes movie. At a Fox executive's invitation, Rifkin pitched a concept for Return to the Planet of the Apes, an alternative sequel to Planet that ignored the other four films. In Rifkin's initial concept, Taylor's descendant Duke launches a Spartacus-like uprising against Roman-inspired ape oppressors led by General Izan. Days before the project was scheduled to enter pre-production, Fox brought in new studio executives who sent it back to development.[65] They commissioned Rifkin to write several redrafts, but found them unsatisfactory and ultimately scrapped the project.[66]\\r\\nAfter several years in limbo, Fox returned to the Apes concept, this time with Oliver Stone as a producer. Stone brought in Terry Hayes as screenwriter, and they developed a script titled Return of the Apes.[67] In their script, humanity is threatened by an ailment encoded in their DNA, so two scientists go back in time thousands of years to stop it at its origin. They discover the disease was engineered by advanced apes to ensure humanity's eventual destruction.[68] Arnold Schwarzenegger committed to star as scientist Will Robinson, and Philip Noyce agreed to direct. The draft impressed Fox president Peter Chernin, but other executives were ambivalent about the action script, believing it should be lighter. At one point, executive Dylan Sellers insisted the script include a comic scene involving apes playing baseball as his \\"stamp\\" on the film, and fired Hayes when he left it out. This move caused Noyce to quit as well, and subsequently almost everyone involved in the project left for one reason or another.[67]\\r\\nAfter the collapse of the Stone-Hayes project, Fox brought on Chris Columbus to develop a new Apes concept. Columbus hired Sam Hamm to write a screenplay taking elements from Boulle's novel and various unused treatments. In Hamm's script, an ape astronaut from a distant planet unleashes a devastating virus on Earth. Scientists go to the astronaut's planet, where apes hunt humans; they locate a cure, but return to find Earth overrun by simians. Schwarzenegger remained attached, but Fox found the script underwhelming. Columbus left the project in 1995 after his mother's death, and James Cameron stepped in to produce. Cameron intended to go in a \\"very different direction\\" with the script, but following the critical and financial success of his film Titanic, he dropped out of the project. Fox approached a series of directors to take over, without success.[69]\\r\\nIn 1999, Fox hired William Broyles, Jr. to write a new script. Fox insisted on a July 2001 release date, but otherwise offered Broyles considerable creative license.[69] This prospect attracted director Tim Burton, who hoped to do a \\"re-imagining\\" of Planet of the Apes. Burton found the production arduous, largely due to Fox's strict release schedule. The studio budgeted the film at $100 million, meaning Broyles' ambitious script had to be altered to reduce costs; Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal worked on rewrites even as the film entered production. The tight schedule meant all stages of production were rushed.[70]\\r\\nThe film stars Mark Wahlberg as astronaut Leo Davidson, who accidentally travels through a wormhole to a distant planet where talking apes enslave humans. He leads a human revolt and upends ape civilization by discovering that the apes evolved from the normal earth primates who had accompanied his mission, and arrived years before. Helena Bonham Carter played chimpanzee Ari, while Tim Roth played the human-hating chimpanzee General Thade. The film received mixed reviews; most critics believed it failed to compare to the original. Much of the negative commentary focused on the confusing plot and twist ending, though many reviewers praised the special effects.[71][72] The film succeeded at the box office, taking in $362 million worldwide.[73] Fox had initially hoped for a sequel, but the difficult production left Burton unenthusiastic about participating, and the film failed to generate enough interest for the studio to pursue a follow-up.[70]\\r\\nIn 2005, screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver developed a concept for a new Planet of the Apes film, eventually titled Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Inspired by news articles on apes raised as humans and advances in genetics, Jaffa conceived an idea for a film about a genetically enhanced chimp raised in a human household. He and Silver pitched the concept to Fox as a way to reboot the Apes franchise by reinventing the story of the chimpanzee Caesar, the lead character of Conquest. Fox was impressed and bought the pitch, but development struggled for five years as the production cycled through scripts, writers, directors, and producers. In 2010, producers Peter Chernin and Dylan Clark of Chernin Entertainment stepped in to move the film forward, retaining Jaffa and Silver as writers.[74][75]\\r\\nIn the final script, Caesar receives enhanced cognition from a viral drug created by Will Rodman, who raises him. After being imprisoned in a primate sanctuary, Caesar uses his ingenuity to launch an uprising.[76] The screenplay contains complex connections to other entries in the series, causing some confusion as to its exact relation to them. Oliver Lindler writes that while the film's premise might identify it as a remake of Conquest, official dispatches and professional reviewers typically avoided the term, instead calling the film a prequel or \\"origin story\\" to the original Planet of the Apes film, and/or a reboot of the series; fans and bloggers were more apt to refer to it as a \\"remake\\".[77][78][79] The completed script attracted director Rupert Wyatt. To portray ape characters realistically, the production avoided practical effects in favor of performance capture acting, partnering with New Zealand visual effects company Weta Digital. Wyatt cast James Franco as Will Rodman, while veteran performance capture actor Andy Serkis signed on to star as Caesar.[80]\\r\\nRise debuted on August 5, 2011. Critics reviewed it positively, especially praising the visual effects and Serkis's performance.[81] It was a major box office hit, taking in $482 million globally, more than five times its $93 million budget.[82] Weta's special effects earned the film two Visual Effects Society Awards and an Oscar nomination at the 84th Academy Awards, among other accolades. The strength of Serkis's performance also inspired Fox to promote him for Oscar consideration; he was not nominated by Academy voters.[83] Following the movie's success, Fox immediately planned for a sequel.[84]\\r\\nProducers Peter Chernin and Dylan Clark started planning the film eventually titled Dawn of the Planet of the Apes just after Rise's release in 2011. Fox allocated a budget of $170 million.[85][86] Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver returned to pen the script and produce, and the studio quickly signed Andy Serkis to reprise his role as Caesar. Director Rupert Wyatt withdrew from the project due to production and scheduling issues, and was replaced by Matt Reeves.[85][87]\\r\\nSet ten years after Rise, the film establishes that the \\"simian flu\\" that increased the intelligence of the apes has killed most humans. Caesar struggles to maintain peace as his ape community is drawn into violent clashes with nearby human survivors. Weta Digital again provided special effects work, which combined practical sets, digitally manipulated backgrounds, and performance capture ape characters.[88] The lead human characters were played by Jason Clarke, as Malcolm; Keri Russell, as Ellie; and Gary Oldman, as Dreyfus.[89] Released on July 11, 2014, the film was very well received by critics, who found it a strong follow-up to Rise and lauded the combination of an engaging script with impressive special effects.[90][91] It also performed very strongly at the box office, taking in $707 million in worldwide grosses.[86] Its special effects received several honors, including three Visual Effects Society Awards and an Oscar nomination at the 87th Academy Awards.[92]\\r\\nFox was confident enough in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes that the studio started planning for the next installment months before the film debuted. After Fox and Chernin Entertainment screened Matt Reeves' cut of Dawn, he was contracted to return as director; he also wrote the script with Mark Bomback. Peter Chernin, Dylan Clark, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver again served as producers.[93][94] Given a $150 million budget, War for the Planet of the Apes was released on July 14, 2017.[95][96]\\r\\nThe film depicts the apes and humans in armed conflict, and follows Caesar and his followers as they track down the mysterious Colonel, a human paramilitary leader, and search for a new home. Serkis returned as Caesar, Woody Harrelson played the villainous Colonel, and Steve Zahn played Bad Ape.[97][98] It earned widespread critical acclaim; reviewers praised the effects and narrative, and found the film a fitting conclusion to Caesar's story.[99][100] It earned $491 million around the globe.[96] In October 2016, it was reported that a fourth film in the new series was being discussed.[101][102]\\r\\nPierre Boulle's novel La Plante des singes was translated and reprinted several times after its original publication in 1963.[103] All of the original sequels spawned novelizations by established science fiction writers of the day, each of which went through multiple reprintings of their own. Michael Avallone wrote the novelization for Beneath the Planet of the Apes in 1970. Jerry Pournelle, who later co-authored Lucifer's Hammer and The Mote in God's Eye, wrote the Escape from the Planet of the Apes novelization. John Jakes, former Science Fiction Writers of America president, wrote Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. David Gerrold, scriptwriter for the Star Trek episode \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\", novelized Battle for the Planet of the Apes. Novelizations of the live action and animated television series were also produced.[104] William T. Quick novelized the 2001 Planet of the Apes; he also wrote two prequel novels, and several other book tie-ins were published.[105]\\r\\nPlanet of the Apesÿbased comics have been published regularly since 1968. Among the most notable is Marvel Comics' Planet of the Apes magazine, published from 1974 to 1977. The black-and-white series featured adaptations of each of the films, new Apes stories by Doug Moench, series news, essays, interviews, and other material. It became one of Marvel's most successful titles, attracting 300 to 400 fan letters with every issue, so many that the studio had to suspend its practice of writing personal responses. Marvel also published the monthly title Adventures on the Planet of the Apes from 1975 to 1976, comprising color reprints of the Planet and Beneath adaptations.[106]\\r\\nIn 1990, during a resurgence of interest in the franchise, Malibu Comics launched a new monthly black-and-white Planet of the Apes comic through its Adventure Comics studio. The debut issue sold 40,000, a record for black-and-white comics, leading to a successful run of 24 issues over two years. The series follows Caesar's grandson and heir Alexander as he struggles to govern ape civilization. The comic's success led Malibu to publish five four-issue spin-off miniseries: Ape City, Planet of the Apes: Urchak's Folly, the Alien Nation crossover Ape Nation, Planet of the Apes: Blood of the Apes, and Planet of the Apes: The Forbidden Zone. Malibu also published two one-shot comics, A Day on the Planet of the Apes and Planet of the Apes: Sins of the Fathers, a prequel story to the original film; a trade paperback collecting the first four issues of the main series, titled Monkey Planet; and reissues of stories from Marvel's earlier Apes series.[107]\\r\\nGold Key Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and Boom! Studios have also produced Planet of the Apes comic books. The Boom! releases include crossovers with other properties: 2014's Star Trek/Planet of the Apes: The Primate Directive[108] and 2017's King Kong story Kong on the Planet of the Apes.[109]\\r\\nThe series, and particularly the live-action Apes television show and the Return to the Planet of the Apes cartoon, generated numerous toy and merchandising tie-ins. During the 1970s, Fox licensed around 60 companies to produce about 300 different Apes products, including action figures and playsets, model building kits, coloring books, book-and-record sets, trading cards, toy weapons, costumes, apparel, branded tableware, and lunch boxes. This level of merchandising was unusual for the time, and the success of Apes merchandise may have inspired the campaigns that later became commonplace for films and television series.[110] The action figures, sold by Mego beginning in 1973, were the first such toys sold as film tie-ins; they proved popular and inspired the rise of action figure series based on popular culture franchises.[111] Eric Greene writes that Apes toys were popular enough to lead some contemporary children to engage in apes-vs.-humans role-playing make believe games that simulated the series' conflicts in a manner similar to \\"Cowboys and Indians\\".[110] With the release of the 21st-century films, Fox licensed several companies to manufacture new Apes toys, including detailed action figures of new and \\"classic\\" characters sold as collectibles.[112]\\r\\nA Planet of the Apes ride is planned for the 20th Century Fox World theme parks under construction in Dubai and Malaysia.[113][114]\\r\\nIn 1983, 20th Century Fox Videogames developed a Planet of the Apes game for the Atari 2600, which was to be the first computer game based on the series. The game was still in the prototype phase when Fox shuttered its game division during the video game crash of 1983, and never saw release. It was assumed lost until 2002, when collectors identified a prototype, found earlier in a case labeled Alligator People, as the missing Apes game.[115][116] Independent designers Retrodesign completed and released the game as Revenge of the Apes in 2003.[116] In the game, the player controls Taylor as he fights apes across several levels inspired by the film to reach the Statue of Liberty.[115]\\r\\nA video game based on the series did not appear until 2001. Fox Interactive began developing a Planet of the Apes game in 1998 for PC and PlayStation as a tie-in to the long-gestating remake project. Fox and developer Visiware proceeded with the game when the project went into limbo, creating their own story based on Boulle's novel and the original films.[117][118] The game is an action-adventure in which players control astronaut Ulysses as he explores an ape-ruled future Earth. Fox Interactive's decision to co-publish with another company, Ubisoft, further delayed the game's release. Despite its long development, the game missed the debut of Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes film by two months;[119] it finally appeared on September 20, 2001, to mostly negative reviews.[120][121][122] Additionally, Ubisoft produced a substantially different Planet of the Apes game for Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color, a side-scroller following the first two films.[118][123]\\r\\nIn 2014, Fox partnered with Ndemic Creations on a substantial Dawn of the Planet of the Apesÿthemed update to the mobile game Plague Inc. Players create and spread a \\"simian flu\\" virus to eradicate humans while helping apes survive.[124] In 2017, Fox commissioned an adventure game to accompany War for the Planet of the Apes called Planet of the Apes: Last Frontier.[125] Andy Serkis's digital effects company The Imaginarium worked on the game, and Serkis performed motion capture.[126] It was released on PlayStation 4 on November 21, 2017, to mixed reviews.[127]\\r\\nCritics consider race to be the Planet of the Apes series' primary theme.[6] Eric Greene, author of a book on the role of race in the original films and spinoff material, writes that \\"when seen as one epic work, the Apes saga emerges as a liberal allegory of racial conflict.\\"[37] In Greene's interpretation, the central dynamic of the franchise's plot arc, rooted in the conflict between humans and apes, is their alternating subjugation of one another in a destructive cycle.[128] Difference between human and ape manifests primarily in physical appearance, and dominance derives from social power rather than innate superiority. Each film shifts the power balance so that the audience identifies sometimes with the humans, and other times with the apes.[129] According to Greene, this arc's central message is that unresolved racial discord inevitably leads to cataclysm.[128] Other critics have adopted or echoed Greene's interpretation.[130][131] Producers Abrahams and Jacobs did not consciously intend the first film's racial undertones, and did not appreciate them until Sammy Davis Jr. pointed them out in 1968.[132][133][134] Subsequently, the filmmakers incorporated the theme more overtly in later installments; as a result, race moves from being a secondary motif in the first two films, to becoming the major concern of the last three.[135]\\r\\nSeveral critics have written that the reboot films downplay this theme from the original series, removing the racial subtext of conflict between humans and apes. These critics generally argue that this is to the films' detriment, writing that it softens the series' edge,[136] leaves it thematically shallow,[137] and marginalizes non-white characters;[138] several critics have written that the films appear to invoke a \\"post-racial America\\" rather than exploring issues of race.[136][137][138] Others write that the films incorporate racial themes in subtler ways, but that their presentation oversimplifies a complex message to the point of reinforcing racial norms rather than challenging them.[138][139]\\r\\nThe Cold War and the threat of nuclear holocaust are major themes introduced in Rod Serling's original Planet of the Apes script.[7] The films are apocalyptic and dystopian, suggesting the era's tensions could well lead to world destruction.[140][141] The films critique both sides of the war, with the oppressive ape society and the underground mutant city featuring traits of both Western culture and the Soviet bloc.[140][142] According to Greene, Cold War motifs were central to the first two films and some spinoff media, but were less significant in the later sequels, which foregrounded racial conflict instead.[143]\\r\\nQuestions of animal rights also figure heavily in the series; Greene considers this related to the racial themes.[144] The first film portrays Taylor treated cruelly by apes who consider him an animal; in later films humans abuse apes for the same reason.[145] The idea of primate rights is much more dominant in the reboot films, which directly invoke the question of great ape personhood in portraying Caesar and his friends struggling for their rights in a society that does not consider them legal persons.[146]\\r\\nPlanet of the Apes received popular and critical attention well after production ended on the original films and television series.[18] Fans' interest in the franchise continued through publications like Marvel Comics' Planet of the Apes magazine[106] and science fiction conventions, where the series was sufficiently popular to inspire \\"apecons\\"conventions devoted entirely to films involving apesin the 1970s.[147] The series' distinctive ape costumes were employed in live appearances, including by musician Paul Williams (Virgil from Battle) on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and by Mike Douglas on The Mike Douglas Show.[18] In the 1970s, fans Bill Blake and Paula Crist created Cornelius and Zira costumes; their routine was convincing enough that Fox licensed them to portray the characters at events.[148] The films earned strong ratings when they aired on television after their releases, and various stations rebroadcast them together in marathons in later years.[149] The live-action television series was reformatted into five TV movies for further broadcast in 1981,[57] and the Sci-Fi Channel ran both it and the cartoon in the 1990s.[103]\\r\\nPlanet of the Apes had a wide impact on subsequent popular media. In terms of production, the series' success with sequelization, spinoffs, and merchandising established a new model of media franchising in Hollywood filmmaking, in which studios develop films specifically to generate multimedia franchises.[150] In terms of content, the series influenced various films and television productions during the 1970s and 1980s that used science fiction settings and characters to explore race relations, including Alien Nation, Enemy Mine, and V. More direct influence can be seen in DC Comics' 1972ÿ1978 series Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth and the Japanese franchise Time of the Apes, which concern human protagonists in post-apocalyptic worlds ruled by talking animals.[57] Mel Brooks' 1987 science fiction spoof Spaceballs lampooned the original Planet's Statue of Liberty ending.[151]\\r\\nInterest in the series resurged in the 1990s, as plans for a new film and other media circulated. Greene attributes this renewed interest to a combination of \\"pop culture nostalgia and baby boomer economics\\", as well as a \\"political ferment\\" rising at the time that hearkened back to the period when the films were first released.[152] Inspired particularly by the publication of the Malibu Comics series, during this period fans founded new clubs, websites, and fanzines active in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and other countries.[153] Companies began producing new branded merchandise, including clothing, toys, and costumes.[154]\\r\\nEspecially after the 1990s, artists in diverse media referenced, incorporated, or were otherwise influenced by the series. Planet of the Apes turned up in songs by various musicians, allusions in films, comedy bits by Dennis Miller and Paul Mooney, and an episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Charlton Heston. The Simpsons parodied the series several times.[151] In particular, the episode \\"A Fish Called Selma\\" features the washed-up actor Troy McClure starring in a Broadway musical adaptation called Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off![155] Artist Martha Rosler incorporated footage of Cornelius and Zira's interrogation from Escape in her installation \\"Global Taste: A Meal in Three Courses\\", while Guillermo G܇mez-Pe?a and Coco Fusco employed video from Planet in a 1993 performance art piece at the Whitney Museum of American Art.[156]\\r\\nThe series' impact has extended to the political sphere, and groups of various leanings have employed its themes and imagery in their discourse.[157] The phrase \\"planet of the apes\\" has been used for an overturning of the political or racial status quo.[158] Eric Greene writes that it is especially popular among racial nationalists and reactionaries of different stripes.[159] According to Greene, white supremacists liken minority advancement to the films' world in which supposed \\"inferiors\\" seize control, while black nationalists subvert the reference to celebrate the \\"racial apocalypse\\"; in this spirit, gangsta rap group Da Lench Mob titled their 1994 album Planet of da Apes. Greene writes that these uses invert the anti-racist message of the films.[160] Planet's final image of the ruined Statue of Liberty has become a common political reference; for example, Greenpeace used it in an advertising campaign against nuclear testing. The series' themes and imagery have been invoked in political discussions on topics as varied as Sixties culture, urban decay, contemporary wars, and gun violence.[161]\\r\\nThe following table shows the cast members who played the primary characters in the nine films to date.","input":"What was the first planet of the apes?"},{"output":"November 3, 1956","context":"MGM's 1939 musical fantasy film The Wizard of Oz was first shown in theatres that year, then re-released nationwide in 1949 and again in 1955. It was first broadcast on television on Saturday, November 3, 1956. The film was shown as the last installment of the CBS anthology series Ford Star Jubilee. Since that telecast, it has been shown respectively by CBS, NBC, the WB Network, and several of Ted Turner's national cable channels. It has never been licensed to any local affiliate broadcast TV station. From 1959 until 1991, it was an annual tradition on American commercial network television. During these years, and for several afterwards, it was always shown as a television special.\\r\\nAfter the film was shown on television for the second time, network telecasts of it became a much-anticipated family event in the United States, drawing large audiences annually for many years.[1] Between 1956 and 1980, commercial broadcast television was virtually the only means by which families were able to see The Wizard of Oz, unless they attended the MGM Children's Matinees in the early 1970s.\\r\\nUntil 1999, the film had been shown in the U.S. only on commercial broadcast television. After the film went to cable that year, TV showings of the movie became increasingly more frequent, and the tradition of televising it only once a year ended, at least in the U.S.[2]\\r\\nThe Wizard of Oz has become perhaps the most famous film to be shown regularly on U.S. television, and one of the most cherished.[3] Of the many family-oriented musical fantasies broadcast after the successful 1955 version of the Mary Martin Peter Pan, The Wizard of Oz is the only one which is still shown regularly. Following the 1956 premiere, there were no rebroadcasts of the film until 1959. The 1959-1962 broadcasts occurred in autumn between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Beginning with the 1963-64 season, these special presentations were seen in the first quarter of the year. The film was not broadcast in the U.S. in 1963, 1992, 1995, or 1997.\\r\\nThe film was first issued on home video formats in 1980.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wizard of Oz, which had been a critical but only modest financial success during its theatrical run, was chosen to be the first Hollywood film to be shown uncut in prime time on a coast to coast television network. [5] The first telecast took place on Saturday November 3, 1956 as part of the final program in the canceled CBS anthology series Ford Star Jubilee . A rotating potpourri of highly budgeted but low rated specials including a well publicized debut hour hosted by Judy Garland.[6] The original asking price of $250,000 was negotiated by MGM attorney, later company president, Frank Rosenfelt. The network paid MGM $225,000 for the rights to televise the film twice with an option to re-broadcast it if the telecast was a success.[7]\\r\\nThis 1956 broadcast shown as CBS's response to the successful color telecast of the Broadway musical Peter Pan with Mary Martin, which had been restaged especially for TV at NBC Studios as part of the anthology series Producers' Showcase. Peter Pan had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \\"fad\\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as Aladdin (1958, and no relation to the Disney film), Alice in Wonderland (1955) (a live-action version), Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella (1957), The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957), and Pinocchio (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast The Wizard of Oz.\\r\\nFor the first TV broadcast of The Wizard of Oz, the normally 90-minute Ford Star Jubilee was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity hosted. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.[8]\\r\\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host it: Bert Lahr, who had played both the Cowardly Lion and farmhand Zeke in the film, appeared alongside then 10-year-old Liza Minnelli, and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. Lorna Luft, Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other Oz telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.[9] The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \\"hosting\\" The Wizard of Oz lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\\r\\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),[citation needed] and the tracking shot of Munchkinland was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day. Variety magazine prophetically suggested that the film could be telecast annually and at an earlier time.[10]\\r\\nThe film was not rebroadcast in 1957 or 1958. For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone TV special instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when Angela Lansbury, star of CBS' Murder She Wrote, hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current prime time lineup. In 1959, the host was Red Skelton (The Red Skelton Show); in 1960 it was Richard Boone (Have Gun, Will Travel), in 1961 and 1962 it was Dick Van Dyke (The Dick Van Dyke Show), and from 1964 through 1967, it was Danny Kaye (The Danny Kaye Show). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\\r\\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on video tape in advance of the telecasts.[11] Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\\r\\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series Have Gun, Will Travel, in a \\"living room\\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,[11] and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop toadstool against a painted backdrop of the Yellow Brick Road and the Emerald City.[12] The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\\r\\nSome humor as sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a Victorian-era storyteller who introduced L. Frank Baum's original 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\\r\\nThe Wizard of Oz did not become an annual television tradition immediately  only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before. The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic John Crosby, who commented in the New York Herald Tribune, \\"Television  any television  looks awfully ordinary after The Wizard of Oz\\".[13] From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\\r\\nWISN-TV in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly Oz telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running Green Bay Packers football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00?p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.[14]\\r\\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated WBBM-TV in Chicago accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's Oz telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.[citation needed] Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.[citation needed] For several hours thereafter, the WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times newspapers.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound opening and closing credits segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \\"wraparound\\" credits, the title The Wizard of Oz and the names of its five leading actors, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, and Jack Haley, were first shown in CBS's own format and font, while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \\"This portion of The Wizard of Oz is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment  the Danny Kaye one  was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \\"wraparound\\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\\r\\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 opening credits (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM Leo the Lion logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's main title music heard.\\r\\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\\r\\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \\"The End\\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card The Wizard of Oz, this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the soundtrack, and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \\"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\\"\\r\\nFrom the beginning The Wizard of Oz was telecast in color, although few people owned color television sets in 1956. Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.[15][16] Between 1956 and 1965, the Wizard of Oz showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by RCA, which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.\\r\\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBCs daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\\r\\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when The Wizard of Oz went to NBC in 1968, where no \\"wraparound\\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous NBC peacock was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer Mel Brandt saying that \\"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the sepia tone in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor Gregory Peck paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by Oz producer Mervyn LeRoy, marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC Oz telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the Easter and Passover seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on CBS.\\r\\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price  fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity  for renewal of the rights to telecast it.[17] The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \\"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\\".[18]\\r\\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \\"wraparound\\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title The Wizard of Oz was shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic and years later retitled The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. Jack Haley, Jr., the documentary's director, was nominated for an Emmy Award for his work.\\r\\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, The Wizard of Oz is usually hosted by TCM host Robert Osborne.\\r\\nOn June 3, 2007, Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants, hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of Essentials, Jr., a special summer series of family movies.\\r\\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on Turner Network Television without a host, but with commercials, and with \\"pop-up\\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\\r\\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on the Cartoon Network by television actor Robert Wu, who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the Family Guy episode, \\"Tiegs for Two\\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\\r\\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian Bill Hader, again as part of the Essentials, Jr. summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\\r\\nBeing a presentation of network TV, \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\\r\\nThe first telecast of \\"Oz\\" was a presentation of Ford Star Jubilee and thus sponsored by Ford Motor Company and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by Procter and Gamble and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by Singer Manufacturing Company as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969.\\r\\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\\r\\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special. In the first nine showings, all on CBS, The Wizard of Oz gained at least 49% of the television audience.[19] In 1966, it ranked No. 1 in the ratings for the week that it was shown.[20] Between 1960 and 1968, the film even beat out episodes of ABC-TV's Walt Disney Presents (in 1960) and NBC's Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color (from 1961 to 1968), which aired opposite the film.[21] When the film moved temporarily from CBS to NBC, it always preempted the Disney program altogether, except for once, when NBC showed Oz on a Saturday in 1968. When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.[22]\\r\\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in high-definition, the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.[23]\\r\\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \\"clock in\\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written foreword to the film.[11]\\r\\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.[9] However, The Wizard of Oz is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\\r\\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the Library of Congress and the National Film Preservation Board. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \\"microcutting\\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07?p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.[24]\\r\\nIn the 1980s, Ted Turner purchased the film from MGM, alongside Gone with the Wind. Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for Oz in exchange for relinquishing its rights to Gone with the Wind.[25] In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.[citation needed] 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, The Wizard of Oz made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.[26]\\r\\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer. In 2002, it was shown five times.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn November 6, 2011, TBS became the American television channel on which The Wizard of Oz has been shown most often, when the film had its 32nd showing on that channel, finally breaking CBS' record 31 showings. As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\\r\\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on NBC Saturday Night at the Movies or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.[11]\\r\\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.[citation needed] On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \\"CBS Movie Special\\" or an \\"NBC Movie Special\\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply The Wizard of Oz.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the Academy-standard aspect-ratio film.\\r\\nWhen shown in HDTV, the film is pillarboxed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.[27] On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.[28][28][29]\\r\\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in Great Britain, Canada and is shown every year in Australia, but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.[30] In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on Indonesian television network RCTI in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s. In Japan, the film has aired on the Japanese version of The Magical World of Disney, although Disney had nothing to do with its production or release.[31]\\r\\nBroadcast Television Airdates Eastern Time (taken from TV Guide and from The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History).\\r\\nThe reason that the film did not air in December 1963 has never been stated, but some say that it was because of John F. Kennedy's assassination, others say room needed to be made for more Christmas themed specials and that the movie fit in better during January. For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s.\\r\\nLast airing on CBS until 1976. Moved to NBC in 1968, at this time, the showings were moved from midwinter to late winter/early spring.\\r\\nFirst showing by NBC, in Spring rather than Winter. The first time that the film was shown at 7:00 P.M instead of 6:00 P.M.\\r\\nThe first time that the film aired in the middle of the week, rather than on a weekend.\\r\\nThe year that The Wizard Of Oz returned to CBS. It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted 60 Minutes, so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with 60 Minutes. (As of 2017, 60 Minutes continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\\r\\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\\r\\nThe last time that the film pre-empted 60 Minutes.\\r\\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\\r\\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.

It is a stratovolcano composed of many layers of lava alternating with hardened volcanic ash and other pyroclastic rocks. Nevado del Ruiz has been active for about two million years, since the Early Pleistocene or Late Pliocene, with three major eruptive periods. The current volcanic cone formed during the present eruptive period, which began 150 thousand years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe volcano usually generates Plinian eruptions, which produce swift-moving currents of hot gas and rock called pyroclastic flows. These eruptions often cause massive lahars (mud and debris flows), which pose a threat to human life and the environment.  The impact of such an eruption is increased as the hot gas and lava melt the mountain's snowcap, adding large quantities of water to the flow. On November 13, 1985, a small eruption produced an enormous lahar that buried and destroyed the town of Armero in Tolima, causing an estimated 25,000 deaths. This event later became known as the Armero tragedythe deadliest lahar in recorded history. Similar but less deadly incidents occurred in 1595 and 1845, consisting of a small explosive eruption followed by a large lahar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe volcano is part of Los Nevados National Natural Park, which also contains several other volcanoes. The summit of Nevado del Ruiz is covered by large glaciers.  The volcano continues to pose a threat to the nearby towns and villages, and it is estimated that up to 500,000 people could be at risk from lahars from future eruptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevado del Ruiz, which lies about 129 kilometers (80?mi) west of Bogot, is part of the Andes mountain range. The volcano is part of the RuizÿTolima volcanic massif (or Cordillera Central), a group of five ice-capped volcanoes which includes the Tolima, Santa Isabel, Quindio and Machin volcanoes.[6][7] The massif is located at the intersection of four faults, some of which still are active.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nNevado del Ruiz lies within the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region that encircles the Pacific Ocean and contains some of the world's most active volcanoes. It is the third most northerly of the volcanoes lying in the North Volcanic Zone of the Andean Volcanic Belt, which contains 75 of the 204 Holocene-age volcanoes in South America.[9] The Andean Volcanic Belt is produced by the eastward subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate beneath the South American continental plate.[10] As is the case for many subduction-zone volcanoes, Nevado del Ruiz can generate explosive Plinian eruptions with associated pyroclastic flows that can melt snow and glaciers near the summit, producing large and sometimes devastating lahars (mud and debris flows).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many other Andean volcanoes, Nevado del Ruiz is a stratovolcano: a voluminous, roughly conical volcano consisting of many strata of hardened lava and tephra including volcanic ash.[11] Its lavas are andesiticÿdacitic in composition.[1] The modern volcanic cone comprises five lava domes, all constructed within the caldera of an ancestral Ruiz volcano: Nevado El Cisne, Alto de la Laguna, La Olleta, Alto la Pirana, and Alto de Santano.[12]  It covers an area of more than 200 square kilometers (77?sq?mi), stretching 65 kilometers (40?mi) from east to west.[13] The mountain's broad summit includes the Arenas crater, which is 1 kilometre (0.62?mi) in diameter and 240 meters (790?ft) deep.[1] Nevado del Ruiz, as its neighbours to the southwest Nevado El Cisne and Nevado de Santa Isabel is located over the Palestina Fault that crosscuts the underlying El Bosque Batholith, dated at 49.1 I 1.7 Ma.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe summit of the volcano has steep slopes inclining from 20 to 30 degrees. At lower elevations, the slopes become less steep; their inclination is about 10 degrees. From there on, foothills stretch almost to the edge of the Magdalena River, north of the volcano and the Cauca River to the west.[15] On the two major sides of the summit, headwalls show where past rock avalanches occurred. At times, ice on the summit has melted, generating devastating lahars, including the continent's deadliest eruption in 1985.[5][1][16] On the volcano's southwest flank is the pyroclastic cone La Olleta, which is not currently active, but may have erupted in historical times.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe summit of Nevado del Ruiz is covered by glaciers (nevado means \\"snow-covered\\" in Spanish), which formed over many thousands of years, and have generally retreated since the last glacial maximum. From 28,000 to 21,000 years ago, glaciers occupied about 1,500 square kilometers (600?sq?mi) of the RuizÿTolima massif. As late as 12,000 years ago, when the ice sheets from the last glacial period were retreating, they still covered 800 square kilometers (300?sq?mi). During the Little Ice Age, which lasted from about 1600 to 1900?CE, the ice cap covered approximately 100 square kilometers (40?sq?mi).[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then the glaciers have retreated further because of atmospheric warming.[8] By 1959, the massif's glaciated area had dropped to 34 square kilometers (13?sq?mi).[18] Since the 1985 eruption, which destroyed about 10% of the summit ice cover, the area of Nevado del Ruiz covered by glaciers has halvedfrom 17 to 21 square kilometers (6.6 to 8.1?sq?mi) just after the eruption to about 10 square kilometers (3.9?sq?mi) in 2003. The glaciers reached altitudes as low as 4,500 meters (14,800?ft) in 1985 but have now retreated to elevations of 4,800ÿ4,900 meters (15,700ÿ16,100?ft).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ice cap is approximately 50 meters (160?ft) thick on average. It is thickest in parts of the summit plateau and under the Nereides Glacier on the southwestern slopes, where it is as deep as 190 meters (620?ft). Glaciers on the northern and, to a lesser extent, the eastern slopes lost the most ice in the 1985 eruption,[19] and therefore reach only up to 30 meters (100?ft) deep.[20] The deep ice covering the summit plateau may hide a caldera. Five domes ringing the summit plateau have emerged as the ice has retreated.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meltwater from the glaciers drains primarily to the Cauca River and Magdalena River via the western and eastern flanks of the volcano, respectively.[15] Runoff from these glaciers and those on the surrounding volcanoes is a source of fresh water for forty surrounding towns, and Colombian scientists and government officials are concerned about the towns' water supply should the glaciers melt completely.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nNevado del Ruiz is generally poorly forested because of its high elevation, and its forest cover decreases with increasing elevation. At lower elevations, well-developed mesic forests (20ÿ35?meters / 66ÿ110?ft high) are present. Above these but below the tree line, parts of the volcano are covered with dwarf forests 3ÿ8 meters (10ÿ30?ft) high. Above the tree line, in the Pramo zone, the vegetation is dominated by plants such as bunchgrass and Espeletia.[22] Regional vegetation consists of different families of woody plants, including Rubiaceae, Leguminosae, Melastomataceae, Lauraceae, and Moraceae. Flowers such as Polypodiaceae s.l., Araceae, Poaceae, Asteraceae, Piperaceae, and Orchidaceae are also present in the region.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimals living on the volcano include the mountain tapir and spectacled bear, both of which are designated as threatened.[22] Other animals inhabiting the surrounding region include the rufous-fronted parakeet, bearded helmetcrest, and Herveo plump toad. The volcano is home to 27 species of birds endemic to Colombia, with 14 of these species confined to the region around the volcano. 15 bird species in the area are considered threatened.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nNevado del Ruiz is one of several stratovolcanoes within Los Nevados National Natural Park, a national park located west of Bogot in the centre of the Colombian Andes. The park is a popular tourist destination and contains several tourist shelters. The slopes of the volcano are used for winter sports, and nearby Lake Ot~n offers trout fishing.[22] A number of commercially operated spas can be found nearby.[22]\\r\\nIn 1868ÿ1869, German geologists Wilhelm Reiss and Alphons Stbel were the first to attempt to climb Ruiz. In 1936, W. Cunet and Augusto Gansser-Biaggi made the first successful ascent, partly by ski; they repeated the ascent in 1939.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first eruptions of Nevado del Ruiz occurred about 1.8 million years ago at the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch.[8] Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two million years ago, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created.[7] Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5ÿ10?km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present period began about 150,000?years ago and involved the development of the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas.[8] During the past 11,000?years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes.[7][8] During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the RuizÿTolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene.[7] Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring recorded history, eruptions have consisted primarily of a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660?BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245?BC?I?150?years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850?BC, 200?BC?I?100 years, 350?AD?I?300 years, 675?AD?I?50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps),[nb 1] 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps),[b] 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps),[b] 1845, 1916, December 1984 ÿ March 1985, September 1985 ÿ July 1991, and possibly in April 1994.[b] Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a phreatic (steam) explosion.[23] Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after Galeras.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning of March 12, 1595, Nevado del Ruiz erupted. The episode consisted of three Plinian eruptions, which were heard up to 100 kilometers (62?mi) from the summit of the volcano. A large amount of ash was ejected, which completely darkened the surrounding area. The volcano also erupted lapilli (a form of tephra) and pumice bombs. In total, the eruption produced 0.16?km3 of tephra.[23] The eruption was preceded by a large precursor earthquake three days before.[25] The eruption caused lahars, which traveled down the valleys of the nearby Gual and Lagunillas rivers, clogging up the water, killing fish and destroying vegetation. More than 600?people died as a result of the lahar.[26] The 1595 eruption was the last major eruption of Nevado del Ruiz before 1985. The 1595 and 1985 eruptions were similar in many respects, including in the chemical composition of the erupted material.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning of February 19, 1845, a large earthquake resulted in a substantial mudflow.[28] This mudflow flowed down the valley of the Lagunillas River for approximately 70 kilometers (43?mi),[5] spilling out of the river channel and killing much of the local population.[28] After reaching an alluvial fan, the mudflow split into two branches. The larger portion of it joined the Lagunillas River and flowed into the nearby Magdalena River, while the smaller portion was diverted by hills in front of Lagunillas Canyon, turned 90?degrees to the north until it reached the Sabandija River, and then flowed east with the Sabandija River, until it rejoined the other branch of the mudflow at the junction of the Sabandija and the Magdalena. It is estimated that 1000?people were killed in the mudflows.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning November 1984, geologists observed an increasing level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz.[27] Other signs of a forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on the summit of the volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985.[27] The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985.[27] The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Italian volcanological mission analyzed gas samples from fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and proved them to be a mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. The mission's report, delivered on October 22, 1985, judged the risk of lahars to be very high. The report proposed various simple preparedness techniques to local authorities.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1985, volcanic activity once again increased[27] as magma neared the surface. The volcano began releasing increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elementary sulfur. The water content of the fumaroles' gases decreased, and water springs in the vicinity of Nevado del Ruiz became enriched in magnesium, calcium and potassium, which were leached from the magma.[27]  The thermodynamic equilibration (stationary heat energy) temperatures, corresponding to the chemical composition of the discharged gases, were from 200?C (400?F) to 600?C (1,000?F). The extensive degassing of the magma caused pressure to build up inside the volcano, which eventually resulted in the explosive eruption.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 3:06?pm, on November 13, 1985,[31] Nevado del Ruiz began to erupt, ejecting dacitic tephra more than 30 kilometres (19?mi) into the atmosphere.[27] The total mass of the erupted material (including magma) was 35?million tonnes[27]only 3% of the amount that erupted from Mount St. Helens in 1980.[32]  The eruption reached a value of 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index.[33] The mass of the ejected sulfur dioxide was about 700,000?tonnes, or about 2% of the mass of the erupted solid material,[27] making the eruption atypically sulfur-rich.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eruption produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks.[35] It also destroyed a small lake that was observed in Arenas crater several months before the eruption.[27] Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty and contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice; this effect was confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the lahar flow.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lahars, formed of water, ice, pumice, and other rocks,[35] mixed with clay as they travelled down the volcano's flanks.[36] They ran down the volcano's sides at an average speed of 60?km per hour, eroding soil, dislodging rock, and destroying vegetation. After descending thousands of meters down the side of the volcano, the lahars were directed into all of the six river valleys leading from the volcano. While in the river valleys, the lahars grew to almost 4 times their original volume. In the Gual River, a lahar reached a maximum width of 50 meters (200?ft).[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the lahars virtually erased the town of Armero in Tolima, which lay in the Lagunilla River valley. Only one quarter of its 28,700 inhabitants survived.[35] The second lahar, which descended through the valley of Chinchin River, killed about 1,800 people and destroyed about 400 homes in the town of Chinchin, in the department of Caldas.[37] In total, over 23,000 people were killed and approximately 5,000 were injured.[35] More than 5,000 homes were destroyed.[35] The Armero tragedy, as the event came to be known, was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster in the 20th century, being surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pele,[38] and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic eruption in recorded history.[39] It is also the deadliest known lahar,[8] and Colombia's worst natural disaster.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of life during the 1985 eruption was due partly to the fact that scientists did not know precisely when the eruption would occur, and the authorities would not take costly preventative measures without clear warnings of imminent danger.[41] Because the volcano's last substantial eruption occurred more than 140 years earlier, it was also hard for many to accept the danger the volcano presented; locals even called it the \\"Sleeping Lion\\".[26] Hazard maps showing Armero would be completely flooded after an eruption were distributed more than a month before the eruption, but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering. Local authorities failed to alert people to the seriousness of the situation, with Armero's mayor and a priest both reassuring the populace after an ash eruption on the afternoon of November 13 and the consequent ashfall early that evening.[42] Another factor was the storm that hit that evening, causing electrical outages and hindering communications. Civil defense officials from four nearby towns tried to warn Armero the lahar was approaching in the hour or so before it reached Armero, but failed to make radio contact.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists later looked back to the hours before the eruption and noticed that several long-period earthquakes, which start out strong and then slowly die out, had occurred in the final hours before the eruption. Volcanologist Bernard Chouet said that, \\"the volcano was screaming 'I'm about to explode'\\", but the scientists who were studying the volcano at the time of the eruption were not able to read this signal.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe volcano continues to pose a serious threat to nearby towns and villages. The most likely hazard is small-volume eruptions, which might destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars.[7] Despite the significant retrenchment of the volcano's glaciers, the volume of ice atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the RuizÿTolima massif remains large. Melting merely 10% of the ice would produce mudflows with a volume of up to 2,000,000 cubic meters (70,629,333?cu?ft)similar to the mudflow that destroyed Armero in 1985.[8] Such lahars can travel up to 100 kilometers (62?mi) along river valleys in a matter of few hours.[8] Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchin, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are in danger, and 100,000 of these are considered to be at high risk.[7][nb 2] Lahars poses a threat to nearby towns of Honda, Mariquita, Ambalema, Chinchin, Herveo, Villa Hermosa, Salgar and La Dorada.[46] Although small eruptions are more likely, the two million-year eruptive history of the RuizÿTolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that the threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored.[7]\\r\\nA large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogot's airport due to ashfall.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Armero tragedy was exacerbated by the lack of early warnings,[41] unwise land use,[47] and the unpreparedness of nearby communities,[41] the government of Colombia created a special program (Oficina Nacional para la Atencion de Desastres, 1987) to prevent such incidents in the future. All Colombian cities were directed to promote prevention planning in order to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters,[47] and evacuations due to volcanic hazards have been carried out. About 2,300 people living along five nearby rivers were evacuated when Nevado del Ruiz erupted again in 1989.[48] When another Colombian volcano, the Nevado del Huila, erupted in April 2008, thousands of people were evacuated because volcanologists worried that the eruption could be another \\"Nevado del Ruiz\\".[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, heavy rains on Ruiz sent a mudslide down the Chinchin River, killing nine youths aged 12ÿ19 on a scouting expedition near the volcano.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring September and October 2010, INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) noted gradual increases in seismic activity near the Arenas crater. Sulfurous odors and phreatic eruptions reported at Nevado del Ruiz prompted an alert level of Yellow on October 1.[nb 3] Chemical analysis of the volcano demonstrated deformative changes and geochemical alterations.[52] Over the next four months a smattering of long-period earthquakes, considered pseudo-Tornillo events, raised worries that the volcano might erupt.[51] In 2010, tilt increased, and on average 890 volcanic tremors were recorded monthly, roughly eight times as many as had been recorded from 2009ÿ2010.[51] 2010 marked the beginning of increases in sulfur dioxide emissions accompanying small eruptions at the volcano, which both peaked in February 2012 correspondent to a dramatic increase in earthquakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists flying over the volcano on March 8, 2012 noted fresh ash deposits on the east flank of the volcano near the crater, likely from an phreatic eruption on February 22.[51]  Later that day, a small ash plume erupted from the crater; by March 13, scientists detected ash deposits at the head of the Gual River.[52] After seismicity continued to increase, the alert level was raised to Orange, and in April Nevados National Natural Park authority closed the reserve, fearing lahars and ashfall hazards.[51] The sudden activity peak in March did not culminate in a major eruption, and activity declined enough that the alert level was lowered to Yellow on May 3.[51][nb 4] On May 29, seismicity rapidly increased, and the alert level was restored to Orange because ash fell into more than 20 nearby communities. Over the next few months ash fell frequently until earthquakes increased again in June. Because of the severity of these tremors, evacuations were ordered by the Emergency Committee of Caldas on news media for 300ÿ1500 people near the volcano. The alert level was raised to Red, indicating an imminent major volcanic event, and an eruption 7.5 kilometers (4.7?mi) in diameter took place on July 2, 2012, continuing intermittently until the end of August.[51] Ash plumes and sulfur dioxide emissions recurred until January 2013.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis volcano is monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project.","input":"What type of eruption does nevado del ruiz produce?"},{"output":"farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade; this had displaced the native, deep-rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds","context":"The Dust Bowl, also known as the Dirty Thirties, was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion (the Aeolian processes) caused the phenomenon. The drought came in three waves, 1934, 1936, and 1939ÿ1940, but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years.[1] With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains, farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade; this had displaced the native, deep-rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds. The rapid mechanization of farm equipment, especially small gasoline tractors, and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers' decisions to convert arid grassland (much of which received no more than 10?inches (~250?mm) of precipitation per year) to cultivated cropland.[2]\\r\\nDuring the drought of the 1930s, the unanchored soil turned to dust, which the prevailing winds blew away in huge clouds that sometimes blackened the sky. These choking billows of dust ÿ named \\"black blizzards\\" or \\"black rollers\\" ÿ traveled cross country, reaching as far as the East Coast and striking such cities as New York City and Washington, D.C. On the Plains, they often reduced visibility to 3 feet (1?m) or less. Associated Press reporter Robert E. Geiger happened to be in Boise City, Oklahoma, to witness the \\"Black Sunday\\" black blizzards of April 14, 1935; Edward Stanley, Kansas City news editor of the Associated Press coined the term \\"Dust Bowl\\" while rewriting Geiger's news story.[3][4] While the term \\"the Dust Bowl\\" was originally a reference to the geographical area affected by the dust, today it usually refers to the event itself.\\r\\nThe drought and erosion of the Dust Bowl affected 100,000,000 acres (400,000?km2) that centered on the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and touched adjacent sections of New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas.[5]\\r\\nThe Dust Bowl forced tens of thousands of poverty-stricken families to abandon their farms, unable to pay mortgages or grow crops, and losses reached US$25 million per day by 1936 (equivalent to US$440,000,000 in 2017).[6][7] Many of these families, who were often known as \\"Okies\\" because so many of them came from Oklahoma, migrated to California and other states to find that the Great Depression had rendered economic conditions there little better than those they had left.\\r\\nThe Dust Bowl has been the subject of many cultural works, notably the novel The Grapes of Wrath (1939) by John Steinbeck, the folk music of Woody Guthrie, and photographs depicting the conditions of migrants by Dorothea Lange.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dust Bowl area lies principally west of the 100th meridian on the High Plains, characterized by plains which vary from rolling in the north to flat in the Llano Estacado. Elevation ranges from 2,500 feet (760?m) in the east to 6,000 feet (1,800?m) at the base of the Rocky Mountains. The area is semiarid, receiving less than 20 inches (510?mm) of rain annually; this rainfall supports the shortgrass prairie biome originally present in the area. The region is also prone to extended drought, alternating with unusual wetness of equivalent duration.[8] During wet years, the rich soil provides bountiful agricultural output, but crops fail during dry years. The region is also subject to high winds.[9] During early European and American exploration of the Great Plains, this region was thought unsuitable for European-style agriculture; explorers called it the Great American Desert. The lack of surface water and timber made the region less attractive than other areas for pioneer settlement and agriculture.\\r\\nThe federal government encouraged settlement and development of the Plains for agriculture via the Homestead Act of 1862, offering settlers 160-acre (65?ha) plots. With the end of the Civil War in 1865 and the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, waves of new migrants and immigrants reached the Great Plains, and they greatly increased the acreage under cultivation.[10][11] An unusually wet period in the Great Plains mistakenly led settlers and the federal government to believe that \\"rain follows the plow\\" (a popular phrase among real estate promoters) and that the climate of the region had changed permanently.[12] While initial agricultural endeavors were primarily cattle ranching, the adverse effect of harsh winters on the cattle, beginning in 1886, a short drought in 1890, and general overgrazing, led many landowners to increase the amount of land under cultivation.\\r\\nRecognizing the challenge of cultivating marginal arid land, the United States government expanded on the 160 acres (65?ha) offered under the Homestead Actgranting 640 acres (260?ha) to homesteaders in western Nebraska under the Kinkaid Act (1904) and 320 acres (130?ha) elsewhere in the Great Plains under the Enlarged Homestead Act (1909). Waves of European settlers arrived in the plains at the beginning of the 20th century. A return of unusually wet weather seemingly confirmed a previously held opinion that the \\"formerly\\" semiarid area could support large-scale agriculture. At the same time, technological improvements such as mechanized plowing and mechanized harvesting made it possible to operate larger properties without increasing labor costs.\\r\\nThe combined effects of the disruption of the Russian Revolution, which decreased the supply of wheat and other commodity crops, and World War I increased agricultural prices; this demand encouraged farmers to dramatically increase cultivation. For example, in the Llano Estacado of eastern New Mexico and northwestern Texas, the area of farmland was doubled between 1900 and 1920, then tripled again between 1925 and 1930.[11] The agricultural methods favored by farmers during this period created the conditions for large-scale erosion under certain environmental conditions.[1] The widespread conversion of the land by deep plowing and other soil preparation methods to enable agriculture eliminated the native grasses which held the soil in place and helped retain moisture during dry periods. Furthermore, cotton farmers left fields bare during winter months, when winds in the High Plains are highest, and burned the stubble as a means to control weeds prior to planting, thereby depriving the soil of organic nutrients and surface vegetation.\\r\\nAfter fairly favourable climatic conditions in the 1920s with good rainfall and relatively moderate winters,[13] which permitted increased settlement and cultivation in the Great Plains, the region entered an unusually dry era in the summer of 1930.[14] During the next decade, the northern plains suffered four of their seven driest calendar years since 1895, Kansas four of its twelve driest,[15] and the entire region south to West Texas[16] lacked any period of above-normal rainfall until record rains hit in 1941.[17] When severe drought struck the Great Plains region in the 1930s, it resulted in erosion and loss of topsoil because of farming practices at the time. The drought dried the topsoil and over time it became friable, reduced to a powdery consistency in some places. Without the indigenous grasses in place, the high winds that occur on the plains picked up the topsoil and created the massive dust storms that marked the Dust Bowl period.[18] The persistent dry weather caused crops to fail, leaving the plowed fields exposed to wind erosion. The fine soil of the Great Plains was easily eroded and carried east by strong continental winds.\\r\\nOn November 11, 1933, a very strong dust storm stripped topsoil from desiccated South Dakota farmlands in just one of a series of severe dust storms that year. Beginning on May 9, 1934, a strong, two-day dust storm removed massive amounts of Great Plains topsoil in one of the worst such storms of the Dust Bowl.[19] The dust clouds blew all the way to Chicago, where they deposited 12 million pounds of dust (~ 5500 tonnes).[20] Two days later, the same storm reached cities to the east, such as Cleveland, Buffalo, Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C.[21] That winter (1934ÿ1935), red snow fell on New England.\\r\\nOn April 14, 1935, known as \\"Black Sunday\\", 20 of the worst \\"black blizzards\\" occurred across the entire sweep of the Great Plains, from Canada south to Texas. The dust storms caused extensive damage and turned the day to night; witnesses reported that they could not see five feet in front of them at certain points. Denver-based Associated Press reporter Robert E. Geiger happened to be in Boise City, Oklahoma that day. His story about Black Sunday marked the first appearance of the term Dust Bowl; it was coined by Edward Stanley, Kansas City news editor of the Associated Press, while rewriting Geiger's news story.[3][4]\\r\\nSpearman and Hansford County have been literaly [sic] in a cloud of dust for the past week. Ever since Friday of last week, there hasn't been a day pass but what the county was beseieged [sic] with a blast of wind and dirt. On rare occasions when the wind did subside for a period of hours, the air has been so filled with dust that the town appeared to be overhung by a fog cloud. Because of this long seige of dust and every building being filled with it, the air has become stifling to breathe and many people have developed sore throats and dust colds as a result.\\"\\r\\n[22]\\r\\nMuch of the farmland was eroded in the aftermath of the Dust Bowl. In 1941, a Kansas agricultural experiment station released a bulletin that suggested reestablishing native grasses by the \\"hay method\\". Developed in 1937 to speed up the process and increase returns from pasture, the \\"hay method\\" was originally supposed to occur in Kansas naturally over 25ÿ40 years.[23] After much data analysis, the causal mechanism for the droughts can be linked to ocean temperature anomalies. Specifically, Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures appear to have had an indirect effect on the general atmospheric circulation, while Pacific sea surface temperatures seem to have had the most direct influence.[24]\\r\\nThis catastrophe intensified the economic impact of the Great Depression in the region.\\r\\nIn 1935, many families were forced to leave their farms and travel to other areas seeking work because of the drought (which at that time had already lasted four years).[25] The abandonment of homesteads and financial ruin resulting from catastrophic topsoil loss led to widespread hunger and poverty.[26] Dust Bowl conditions fomented an exodus of the displaced from Texas, Oklahoma, and the surrounding Great Plains to adjacent regions. More than 500,000 Americans were left homeless. Over 350 houses had to be torn down after one storm alone.[27] The severe drought and dust storms had left many homeless; others had their mortgages foreclosed by banks, or felt they had no choice but to abandon their farms in search of work.[28] Many Americans migrated west looking for work. Parents packed up \\"jalopies\\" with their families and a few personal belongings, and headed west in search of work.[29] Some residents of the Plains, especially in Kansas and Oklahoma, fell ill and died of dust pneumonia or malnutrition.[20]\\r\\nThe Dust Bowl exodus was the largest migration in American history within a short period of time. Between 1930 and 1940, approximately 3.5 million people moved out of the Plains states; of those, it is unknown how many moved to California.[30] In just over a year, over 86,000 people migrated to California. This number is more than the number of migrants to that area during the 1849 Gold Rush.[31] Migrants abandoned farms in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico, but were often generally referred to as \\"Okies\\", \\"Arkies\\", or \\"Texies\\".[27] Terms such as \\"Okies\\" and \\"Arkies\\" came to be known in the 1930s as the standard terms for those who had lost everything and were struggling the most during the Great Depression.[32]\\r\\nNot all migrants traveled long distances; some simply went to the next town or county. So many families left their farms and were on the move that the proportion between migrants and residents was nearly equal in the Great Plains states.[30]\\r\\nHistorian James N. Gregory examined Census Bureau statistics and other records to learn more about the migrants. Based on a 1939 survey of occupation by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of about 116,000 families who arrived in California in the 1930s, he learned that only 43 percent of southwesterners were doing farm work immediately before they migrated. Nearly one-third of all migrants were professional or white-collar workers.[33] The poor economy displaced more than just farmers as refugees to California; many teachers, lawyers, and small business owners moved west with their families during this time. After the Great Depression ended, some moved back to their original states. Many others remained where they had resettled. About one-eighth of California's population is of Okie heritage.[34]\\r\\nThe greatly expanded participation of government in land management and soil conservation was an important outcome from the disaster. Different groups took many different approaches to responding to the disaster. To identify areas that needed attention, groups such as the Soil Conservation Service generated detailed soil maps and took photos of the land from the sky. To create shelterbelts to reduce soil erosion, groups such as the United States Forestry Services Prairie States Forestry Project planted trees on private lands. Finally, groups like the Resettlement Administration, which later became the Farm Security Administration, encouraged small farm owners to resettle on other lands, if they lived in dryer parts of the Plains.[24]\\r\\nDuring President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first 100 days in office in 1933, his administration quickly initiated programs to conserve soil and restore the ecological balance of the nation. Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes established the Soil Erosion Service in August 1933 under Hugh Hammond Bennett. In 1935, it was transferred and reorganized under the Department of Agriculture and renamed the Soil Conservation Service. It is now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).[35]\\r\\nAs part of New Deal programs, Congress passed the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act in 1936, requiring landowners to share the allocated government subsidies with the laborers who worked on their farms. Under the law, \\"benefit payments were continued as measures for production control and income support, but they were now financed by direct Congressional appropriations and justified as soil conservation measures. The Act shifted the parity goal from price equality of agricultural commodities and the articles that farmers buy to income equality of farm and non-farm population.\\"[36] Thus, the parity goal was to re-create the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms from agriculture and that of the income of persons not on farms that prevailed during 1909ÿ1914.\\r\\nTo stabilize prices, the government paid farmers and ordered more than six million pigs to be slaughtered. It paid to have the meat packed and distributed to the poor and hungry. The Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) was established to regulate crop and other surpluses. FDR in an address on the AAA commented,\\r\\nLet me make one other point clear for the benefit of the millions in cities who have to buy meats. Last year the Nation suffered a drought of unparalleled intensity. If there had been no Government program, if the old order had obtained in 1933 and 1934, that drought on the cattle ranges of America and in the corn belt would have resulted in the marketing of thin cattle, immature hogs and the death of these animals on the range and on the farm, and if the old order had been in effect those years, we would have had a vastly greater shortage than we face today. Our program ÿ we can prove it ÿ saved the lives of millions of head of livestock. They are still on the range, and other millions of heads are today canned and ready for this country to eat.\\"\\r\\nThe FSRC diverted agricultural commodities to relief organizations. Apples, beans, canned beef, flour and pork products were distributed through local relief channels. Cotton goods were later included, to clothe the needy.[37]\\r\\nIn 1935, the federal government formed a Drought Relief Service (DRS) to coordinate relief activities. The DRS bought cattle in counties which were designated emergency areas, for $14 to $20 a head. Animals determined unfit for human consumption were killed; at the beginning of the program, more than 50 percent were so designated in emergency areas. The DRS assigned the remaining cattle to the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) to be used in food distribution to families nationwide. Although it was difficult for farmers to give up their herds, the cattle slaughter program helped many of them avoid bankruptcy. \\"The government cattle buying program was a blessing to many farmers, as they could not afford to keep their cattle, and the government paid a better price than they could obtain in local markets.\\"[38]\\r\\nPresident Roosevelt ordered the Civilian Conservation Corps to plant a huge belt of more than 200?million trees from Canada to Abilene, Texas to break the wind, hold water in the soil, and hold the soil itself in place. The administration also began to educate farmers on soil conservation and anti-erosion techniques, including crop rotation, strip farming, contour plowing, terracing, and other improved farming practices.[39][40] In 1937, the federal government began an aggressive campaign to encourage farmers in the Dust Bowl to adopt planting and plowing methods that conserved the soil. The government paid reluctant farmers a dollar an acre to practice the new methods. By 1938, the massive conservation effort had reduced the amount of blowing soil by 65%.[41] The land still failed to yield a decent living. In the fall of 1939, after nearly a decade of dirt and dust, the drought ended when regular rainfall finally returned to the region. The government still encouraged continuing the use of conservation methods to protect the soil and ecology of the Plains.\\r\\nAt the end of the drought, the programs which were implemented during these tough times helped to sustain a positive relationship between America's farmers and the federal government.[42]\\r\\nThe President's Drought Committee issued a report in 1935 covering the government's assistance to agriculture during 1934 through mid-1935: it discussed conditions, measures of relief, organization, finances, operations, and results of the government's assistance.[43] Numerous exhibits are included in this report.\\r\\nIn many regions, more than 75% of the topsoil was blown away by the end of the 1930s. Land degradation varied widely. Aside from the short-term economic consequences caused by erosion, there were severe long-term economic consequences caused by the Dust Bowl.\\r\\nBy 1940, counties that had experienced the most significant levels of erosion had a greater decline in agricultural land values. The per-acre value of farmland declined by 28% in high-erosion counties and 17% in medium-erosion counties, relative to land value changes in low-erosion counties.[23]:3 Even over the long-term, the agricultural value of the land often failed to recover to pre-Dust Bowl levels. In highly eroded areas, less than 25% of the original agricultural losses were recovered. The economy adjusted predominantly through large relative population declines in more-eroded counties, both during the 1930s and through the 1950s.[44]:1500\\r\\nThe economic effects persisted, in part, because of farmers' failure to switch to more appropriate crops for highly eroded areas. Because the amount of topsoil had been reduced, it would have been more productive to shift from crops and wheat to animals and hay. During the Depression and through at least the 1950s, there was limited relative adjustment of farmland away from activities that became less productive in more-eroded counties.\\r\\nSome of the failure to shift to more productive agricultural products may be related to ignorance about the benefits of changing land use. A second explanation is a lack of availability of credit, caused by the high rate of failure of banks in the Plains states. Because banks failed in the Dust Bowl region at a higher rate than elsewhere, farmers could not get the credit they needed to buy capital to shift crop production.[45] In addition, profit margins in either animals or hay were still minimal, and farmers had little incentive in the beginning to change their crops.\\r\\nPatrick Allitt recounts how fellow historian Donald Worster responded to his return visit to the Dust Bowl in the mid-1970s when he revisited some of the worst afflicted counties:\\r\\nIn contrast with Worsters pessimism, historian Mathew Bonnifield argued that the long-term significance of the Dust Bowl was \\"the triumph of the human spirit in its capacity to endure and overcome hardships and reverses.\\"[47]\\r\\nThe crisis was documented by photographers, musicians, and authors, many hired during the Great Depression by the federal government. For instance, the Farm Security Administration hired numerous photographers to document the crisis. Artists such as Dorothea Lange were aided by having salaried work during the Depression.[48] She captured what have become classic images of the dust storms and migrant families. Among her most well-known photographs is Destitute Pea Pickers in California. Mother of Seven Children,[48] which depicted a gaunt-looking woman, Florence Owens Thompson, holding three of her children. This picture expressed the struggles of people caught by the Dust Bowl and raised awareness in other parts of the country of its reach and human cost. Decades later, Thompson disliked the boundless circulation of the photo and resented the fact she did not receive any money from its broadcast. Thompson felt it gave her the perception as a Dust Bowl \\"Okie.\\"[49]\\r\\nThe work of independent artists was also influenced by the crises of the Dust Bowl and the Depression. Author John Steinbeck, borrowing closely from field notes taken by Farm Security Administration worker and author Sanora Babb,[citation needed] wrote The Grapes of Wrath (1939) about migrant workers and farm families displaced by the Dust Bowl. Babb's own novel about the lives of the migrant workers, Whose Names Are Unknown, was written in 1939 but was eclipsed and shelved in response to the success of the Steinbeck's work, and was finally published in 2004.[50][51][52] Many of the songs of folk singer Woody Guthrie, such as those on his 1940 album Dust Bowl Ballads, are about his experiences in the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression when he traveled with displaced farmers from Oklahoma to California and learned their traditional folk and blues songs, earning him the nickname the \\"Dust Bowl Troubadour\\".[53]\\r\\nMigrants also influenced musical culture wherever they went. Oklahoma migrants, in particular, were rural Southwesterners who carried their traditional country music to California. Today, the \\"Bakersfield Sound\\" describes this blend, which developed after the migrants brought country music to the city. Their new music inspired a proliferation of country dance halls as far south as Los Angeles.\\r\\nThe 2014 science fiction film Interstellar features a ravaged 21st-century America which is again scoured by dust storms (caused by a worldwide pathogen affecting all crops). Along with inspiration from the 1930s crisis, director Christopher Nolan features interviews from the 2012 documentary The Dust Bowl to draw further parallels.[54]\\r\\nIn 2017, Americana recording artist Grant Maloy Smith released the album Dust Bowl ÿ American Stories, which was inspired by the history of the Dust Bowl.[55] In a review, the music magazine No Depression wrote that the albums lyrics and music are as potent as Woody Guthrie, as intense as John Trudell and dusted with the trials and tribulations of Tom Joad ÿ Steinbeck and The Grapes of Wrath.[56]\\r\\nThe change in the total value of agricultural land and revenue was quite similar over the twentieth century. Agricultural land and revenue boomed during World War I, but fell during the Great Depression and the 1930s. The land and revenue began increasing again in 1940, and has been increasing since then. From 1910 to the 1940s, total farmland increased and remained constant until 1970 when it slightly declined. During this time, total population increased steadily, but there was a slight dip in trend from 1930 to 1960.[44][clarify][verification needed]","input":"What led to dust storms during the 1930s?"},{"output":"September 2016","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n2G GSM/GPRS/EDGE ÿ 850, 900, 1800, 1900? 96% are still in distribution\\r\\n\\r\\n2G CDMA 1xRTT ÿ 800, 850, 1900?MHz\\r\\n3G TD-SCDMA ÿ 1900, 2000?MHz\\r\\n3G UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA/HSPA+ ÿ 850, 900, AWS (1700), 1900, 2000, 2100?MHz\\r\\n\\r\\n2.3 GHz Mongoose & 1.6 GHz Cortex-A53 Octa-core\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (marketed as Samsung Galaxy Note7) is a now-discontinued Android phablet smartphone that was produced and marketed by Samsung Electronics. Unveiled on 2 August 2016,[6] it was officially released on 19 August 2016 as a successor to the Galaxy Note 5. It was Samsung's first phone with a symmetrical connector and the last phone in the Galaxy Note Series to have a home button. Although it is the sixth main device in the Galaxy Note series, Samsung branded its series number as \\"7\\" instead of \\"6\\", so that consumers would not perceive it as being inferior to the flagship Samsung Galaxy S7.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Galaxy Note 7 is an evolution of the Galaxy Note 5 that inherited hardware components and improvements from the Galaxy S7, including the restoration of expandable storage and IP68 water resistance, and new features such as a dual-sided curved display, support for high-dynamic-range (HDR) color, improvements to the bundled stylus and new software features which utilize it, an iris recognition system, and a USB-C port. Demand for the Galaxy Note 7 on-launch was high, breaking pre-order records in South Korea and causing international releases to be delayed in some markets due to supply shortages. The Galaxy Note 7 also received positive reviews from critics, praising the quality of its construction, HDR support, as well as its streamlined user interface, although it was panned for its high price and increasing similarities in overall specifications to the main Galaxy S series phones.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 September 2016, Samsung suspended sales of the Galaxy Note 7 and announced an informal recall, after it was found that a manufacturing defect in the phones' batteries had caused some of them to generate excessive heat, resulting in fires. A formal U.S. recall was announced on 15 September 2016.[7][8] Samsung exchanged the affected phones for a new revision, which utilized batteries sourced from a different supplier. However, after reports emerged of incidents where these replacement phones also caught fire, Samsung recalled the Galaxy Note 7 worldwide on 10 October 2016, and permanently ceased production of the device on 11 October. Due to the recalls, Samsung has issued software updates in some markets that are intended to \\"eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices\\", including restricting battery capacity, and blocking their ability to connect to wireless networks. Samsung has stated that it intends to recycle reusable silicon and components from the recalled models, and release refurbished models \\"where applicable\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recall had a major impact on Samsung's business in the third quarter of 2016, with the company projecting that its operating profits would be down by 33% in comparison to the previous quarter. Credit Suisse analysts estimated that Samsung would lose at least US$17 billion in revenue from the production and recall of the Galaxy Note 7. The Note 7 had the shortest life span of any Samsung phone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2017, 9 months after the Note7 recall, Samsung released a refurbished version of the Galaxy Note 7 called Galaxy Note Fan Edition (marketed as Samsung Galaxy Note FE). It has a smaller battery of 3200 mAh and is supplied with Android Nougat with Samsung Experience UI, the operating system of the Galaxy S8. The successor to the Galaxy Note 7, the Galaxy Note 8, was announced on 23 August 2017 and released almost a month later.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Galaxy Note 7's hardware is similar in overall specifications and design to the Galaxy S7, with a metal and glass chassis, IP68 water resistance, and a microSD card slot.[9] The Note 7 is equipped with an octa-core Exynos 8890 system-on-chip in most markets, and 4?GB of RAM. In China, Japan, and the United States, the Note 7 uses the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 instead (which supports older CDMA networks that are extensively used by wireless carriers in these markets),[10][11][12]  Unlike the S7, which uses Exynos chips in this market, Canadian models of the Note 7 also use the Snapdragon 820.[13] The Note 7 uses a USB Type-C portmarking Samsung's first mobile phone with the symmetrical connector.[9][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Galaxy Note 7 features a 5.7 inches (140?mm) 1440p Super AMOLED display. Similarly to the \\"Edge\\" models of the S6 and S7, the display curves over the side bezels of the device; the curvature allows the Note 7 to be 2.2 millimetres (0.087?in) narrower than the Galaxy Note 5.[9] The display supports high-dynamic-range video,[16] and is coated in Gorilla Glass 5.[17] As with all Galaxy Note models, the device is supplied with an active stylus branded as \\"S Pen\\". The Note 7 stylus supports 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and is water resistant.[9] The Note 7 features the same 12-megapixel rear-facing camera as the S7,[9] with a \\"Dual Pixel\\" image sensor and f/1.7 aperture lens.[5][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Galaxy Note 7 also offers an iris recognition system, using a front-facing camera and infrared illumination. The iris scanner can be used for unlocking, and as authentication for other features of the device (such as Samsung Pay and Secure Folder). A fingerprint reader is also embedded in the home button.[9][19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Galaxy Note 7 is supplied with Android 6.0 \\"Marshmallow\\" and an updated version of Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz user interface and software suite codenamed \\"Project Grace\\". It features an \\"always-on display\\" mode, which can display a clock and notifications on-screen when the device is not in use; different clock styles and support for notifications from third-party apps were added for the \\"Grace\\" version. The Screen off memo feature also leverages this mode, allowing users to write notes on the always-on display. The OS also features several new tools supporting the S Pen stylus, including translation, a screen magnifier, and a GIF recording tool. The previous suite of note-taking apps were also consolidated into a single Samsung Notes app.[9][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Galaxy Note 7 introduces a security feature known as \\"Secure Folder\\"; it allows users to create a private workspace, protected by an authentication method, with separate user data and apps that are sandboxed from the main system. Installed apps can be cloned into Secure Folder, and users can designate whether notifications generated by apps in the Secure Folder are displayed from outside it. Secure Folder is based on the Samsung Knox 2.7 technology, which also added the ability for enterprises to control the distribution of system updates, and improvements to mobile device management and Microsoft Exchange Server integration.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe device also introduces Samsung Pass, a platform allowing apps to provide biometric authentication using its iris scanner. Samsung reached partnerships with several major U.S. banks to explore the integration of Samsung Pass into their mobile apps.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nPre-orders for the Galaxy Note 7 opened the day following its unveiling, with a U.S. release on 19 August 2016.[9][18] Samsung skipped the numbering of the Galaxy Note series directly from \\"5\\" to \\"7\\" to synchronize it with the flagship Galaxy S series, and the Galaxy S7 line. The company stated that consumers may have perceived the Galaxy Note models to be inferior in technology to Galaxy S models because the numbering in their names were one digit lower.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nPre-orders in South Korea already broke records with 200,000 plus units pre-ordered within 2 days.[26] Samsung Canada stated that pre-orders in Canada were \\"outstanding\\".[27] The demand also forced countries like Malaysia, Netherlands, Russia and Ukraine to delay their releases to September due to shortage in supply.[28][29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nTechRadar complimented that the Galaxy Note 7's \\"rich-looking, glass-and-metal-fused design\\" would \\"really wow people who are upgrading from those old, plastic-clad Note 4 and Note 3 handsets\\", but noted that the curved edges of the screen infrequently caused minor issues when using the stylus. The display was considered to be vibrant and well-suited for multimedia, especially due to its HDR support. Aspects of the software were also praised, including the continued trimming of Samsung's TouchWiz suite and its streamlined settings interface, and that it already included features introduced to the stock operating system as of Android \\"Nougat\\" (although still being initially supplied with Android \\"Marshmallow\\"). Of the device's new stylus-oriented features, the consolidated S Notes app, GIF recorder, and always-on display functionality were commended, but the translation tool was considered to be inferior to Google Translate. The Galaxy Note 7's battery was judged as being capable of one-and-a-half days of normal use, and it was noted that the software also featured numerous estimation and power-saving features. Techradar concluded that \\"If you're going to get out of the stylus, the Note 7 is an obvious choice. The iris scanner doesn't make it a convincing enough buy on its own. Otherwise, save your money and stick with the S7 Edge.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nArs Technica was critical of the Note 7 due to its many similarities to the Galaxy S7. The Note 7's refreshed design was commended for being smoother and more ergonomic than previous Samsung devices with curved screens, although the company was panned for using glass on the rear panel rather than metal. The S Pen was also criticized for feeling \\"cheap\\", describing it as a \\"hollow plastic tube that would feel more at home in a 100-pack of disposable Bic pens than in an ultra-premium $850 smartphone\\". The iris scanner's implementation was panned for adding additional steps to the process of unlocking the phone in comparison to the fingerprint reader, and that it does not integrate into Android's integrated authentication platforms (making it proprietary to Samsung components). Warnings regarding looking at the sensor for too long were also considered to be \\"just a little scary\\". TouchWiz on the Note 7 was panned for consisting mainly of \\"'different for the sake of being different' changes that don't add much to the software experience\\", and make the interface less consistent with third-party software by removing elements of Material design language. In conclusion, Ars Technica doubted whether the Galaxy Note series was even necessary anymore due to its increasing similarities to the main Galaxy S line, and felt that the device was priced too high, citing Chinese vendors capable of undercutting the prices of major brands while still producing phones of similar specifications.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBattery defects caused many Note 7 units to overheat and combust or explode.[32][33][34][35][36] On 10 October 2016, Samsung permanently discontinued the Galaxy Note 7 due to these repeated incidents.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the original run of devices, the battery, produced by Samsung SDI,[38] contained a design flaw that made electrodes on the top-right of the battery susceptible to bending. This weakened separation between positive and negative tabs of the battery, thus resulting in thermal runaway and short circuits.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing an official recall on 12 September 2016,[8] the Galaxy Note 7 was re-versioned using batteries from China-based Contemporary Amperex Technology(CATL or ATL), which also supplies batteries to the IPhone. [38] Samsung stated on 23 January 2017 that these batteries had suffered from a manufacturing defect in the welding process, which pushed electrodes up and caused damage to the separation between the positive and negative tabs. Some batteries were also missing insulation tape entirely. Samsung reported that these oversights resulted from the vendor's push to ramp up production of batteries for the replacement phones in order to meet demand.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the battery defects, the device is considered a hazmat product, and is prohibited from being taken on-board at any airline or bus station, even if powered off.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 31 August 2016, it was reported that Samsung was delaying shipments of the Galaxy Note 7 in some regions to perform \\"additional tests being conducted for product quality\\"; this came alongside user reports of batteries exploding while charging.[39] On 1 September 2016, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported that Samsung was preparing to recall the device worldwide due to these battery issues. On 2 September 2016, Samsung suspended sales of the Galaxy Note 7 and announced an informal recall, after it was found that a manufacturing defect in the phones' batteries had caused some of them to generate excessive heat, resulting in fires and explosions. A formal U.S. recall was announced on 15 September 2016.[7][8] Samsung exchanged the affected phones for a new revision, which utilized batteries sourced from a different supplier. However, after reports emerged of incidents where these replacement phones also caught fire, Samsung recalled the Galaxy Note 7 worldwide on 10 October 2016, and permanently ceased production of the device on 11 October. Due to the recalls, Samsung has issued software updates in some markets that are intended to \\"eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices\\", including restricting battery capacity, and blocking their ability to connect to wireless networks.\\r\\n\\r\\nA company spokesperson stated that it had received 35 reports of battery failure, which \\"account for less than 0.1 percent of the entire volume sold\\".[7][39] Samsung stated that the hazard was limited to a small fraction of phones manufactured, and released a tool on its website on 19 September to identify affected units by their unique IMEI numbers.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an advisory on 8 September 2016, that passengers should not turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft.[41] The European Aviation Safety Agency made a similar statement on 9 September, stating that \\"passengers are reminded of the need to inform the cabin crew when a device is damaged, hot, produces smoke, is lost, or falls into the seat structure.\\"[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 September 2016, the Galaxy Note 7 was officially recalled in the U.S. by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, who advised all owners to shut down and cease all usage of the device, and return them in exchange for a replacement.[8] On 13 September 2016, Samsung announced in newspaper advertisements that it would release a software patch to the affected Galaxy Note 7 devices in South Korea, which prevents the device from being charged beyond 60% capacity to reduce the risk of combustion.[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Galaxy Note 7 was subsequently re-issued with batteries supplied by the Chinese company Amperex Technology Limited (which also serves as the main battery supplier for the iPhone line).[38] These replacement models, which Samsung purportedly[45][46] classified as being safe, had a prominent marking on their packaging to distinguish them from the first wave of recalled units,[47] and render all software battery indicators with green icons. Samsung was granted special permission by Google to allow this change, as it would normally violate the requirements of the Android Compatibility Definition Document (which must be met to license Google Mobile Services software and Android trademarks)[48] for all status bar icons to only be rendered in white.[49] Following the announcement of the recall, Verizon Wireless released a software update to Galaxy Note 7 units purchased from the carrier, which displays the aforementioned green icons on safe devices, and an embedded recall notice on affected devices when the device is plugged in. Unlike the South Korean update, it does not include a charging cut-off.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nSamsung reported that 80% of devices had been replaced in South Korea, and roughly 50% in Europe and North America. Only 10%[not in citation given] of devices in the U.S. were returned, and about 50,000 devices were traded for a different model. However, Samsung stated that 95% of users chose to maintain their loyalty to the company.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2016, several incidents occurred in which replacement Galaxy Note 7 phones still suffered from battery failure and combustion.  A Galaxy Note 7 owner in Kentucky was hospitalized with acute bronchitis due to smoke inhalation, after his replacement device caught fire in the early morning of 4 October. The owner told a local television station that he had received a text message not meant for him from a Samsung customer service representative, which read \\"Just now got this. I can try and slow him down if we think it will matter, or we just let him do what he keeps threatening to do and see if he does it\\".[45][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 October 2016, a flight preparing to depart from Louisville was evacuated prior to takeoff when a passenger's replacement Galaxy Note 7, obtained from an AT&T retail outlet, began smoking and popping as they were turning it off. Samsung stated that they were working with Southwest Airlines to investigate the incident, but stated that they would be unable to confirm whether the device was a replacement model until it was recovered.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 October 2016, a third replacement phone in Minnesota had reportedly caught fire in a similar manner.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to these incidents involving replacement phones, the United States' five major wireless carriers (AT&T Mobility and T-Mobile US on 9 October, along with Sprint Corporation, Verizon Wireless, and U.S. Cellular on 10 October) subsequently announced that they would suspend sales of the Galaxy Note 7 until further notice, pending an investigation.[35][54][55][56][57]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 October 2016, Samsung officially announced that it had \\"[asked] all carrier and retail partners globally to stop sales and exchanges\\" of the Galaxy Note 7, and urged all owners to power them off and \\"take advantage of the remedies available, including a refund at their place of purchase\\".[58] On 11 October 2016, Samsung announced that it would permanently cease production of the Galaxy Note 7 in the interest of customer safety.[37][59] Samsung began issuing special kits to package the devices for returns; they consist of an antistatic bag that the phone is to be inserted into, and three layers of boxesthe last of which is lined with ceramic fibre paper for fire protection. The shipping box also contains instructions explicitly stating that they are not to be shipped by air.[60] Samsung stated to Vice's Motherboard that it would not repair or refurbish any of the returned phones, and that the company would \\"safely dispose\\" of them.[61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Samsung's actions, the Rwanda Utilities and Regulatory Authority and the United States' Consumer Product Safety Commission issued official recalls of all units of the Galaxy Note 7. These recalls ban the sale and distribution of any Galaxy Note 7 phone within these countries.[63][64][65] The British Royal Mail and British courier company Parcelforce announced that they would not accept or deliver any parcels containing a Galaxy Note 7.[66][67] Online marketplaces eBay and Gumtree also began to pull listings selling Galaxy Note 7 devices.[68] After the suspension of sales, Oculus VR issued an update to its software for the Samsung Gear VR virtual reality headset, which blocks its use with the Galaxy Note 7 for safety reasons. The headset had been included with some units of the phone as a promotional offer.[68][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 14 October 2016, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration banned the Note 7 from being taken aboard any airline flight, even if powered off.[70][71] Qantas, Virgin Australia and Singapore Airlines issued similar bans,[72] while Transport Canada issued a notice stating that the Galaxy Note 7 was banned from flights under Special Provision 137 prohibitions, banning the carriage of damaged or defective lithium-ion batteries onto flights.[73] In response to these air travel bans, Samsung announced that it would set up dedicated kiosks at selected airports, to allow travelers to exchange or receive a refund for their Galaxy Note 7 on-site before they depart, rather than having their phone confiscated by security or airport staff.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2016, a Virgin America flight from San Francisco to Boston was nearly diverted mid flight after it was discovered that a passenger on the plane had been operating a Wi-Fi hotspot with the SSID \\"Samsung Galaxy Note7_1097\\". However, it was later discovered that the hotspot was a hoax, and that no passenger had actually brought a Galaxy Note 7 on board.[75][76]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 November 2016, the New Zealand Telecommunications Forum announced that all Galaxy Note 7 phones would be banned from use on local mobile networks (Vodafone NZ, Spark NZ, 2degrees and around a dozen MVNO's) beginning 18 November, enforced via IMEI blacklist.[77] On 30 November 2016, Samsung announced that Galaxy Note 7 devices would be banned from Australian wireless networks effective 15 December 2016.[78][79]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2016, Samsung announced its intent to cripple the functionality of unreturned Galaxy Note 7 phones in Canada and the United States via software updates. In Canada, an update restricted charge capacity, and blocked the phone from connecting to any wireless networks, nor use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. In the United States, the update blocked the devices from being recharged in order to \\"eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices\\".[80][81]\\r\\n\\r\\nVerizon announced that it would refuse to distribute this update due to the \\"added risk this could pose to Galaxy Note 7 users that do not have another device to switch to\\" because it would \\"make it impossible to contact family, first responders or medical professionals in an emergency situation\\", especially during the holiday season. On 18 December 2016, Verizon announced that they would be distributing the update on 5 January 2017.[82] Sprint also stated that it would not distribute this update until January 2017.[83] Verizon later announced that it would redirect all outgoing calls (excluding emergency calls) made on unreturned Galaxy Note 7 devices to a service hotline demanding that they be returned, and threatened to charge customers a fee equaling the total retail cost of the phone if they refused to comply.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 9 January 2017, Samsung released another update in South Korea, blocking the device from being charged beyond 15%.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 24 March 2017, Samsung released yet another update for South Korea users, barring charging of the Galaxy Note 7.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Verge criticized Samsung's overall handling of the battery faults and recall, arguing that the company had initially delivered unclear messaging over whether the devices were still safe to use, as well as its slow communication with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which had the capacity to issue an official recall in the U.S. The arguments were based on data released on 13 September 2016 by the research firm Apteligent, which stated that Galaxy Note 7 usage had been \\"almost exactly the same\\" since the announcement of the exchange program.[87] The Verge also noted that the U.S. government's ban on taking Galaxy Note 7 phones aboard airline flights was \\"perhaps unprecedented\\", acknowledging that only the ban of hoverboards by individual airlines for similar reasonsan entire class of products (albeit one that was \\"admittedly fire-prone because of cheap materials\\")came close to a legal ban for a single consumer product in terms of overall magnitude.[70] Kyle Weins of Wired.com felt that Samsung switched to non-removable batteries in order to imitate the industrial design of Apple, after having used removable batteries on many of its past models (such as the Galaxy Note 4). He argued that this design decision exacerbated the battery faults of the Note 7, by requiring users to replace the entire phone as opposed to just the battery. He suggested that in the future, Samsung could \\"lead the pack\\" by switching back to removable batteries, as with other \\"responsible\\" OEMs such as HP Inc. and LG Electronics.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalysts argued that the recall had hurt Samsung's brand, and would likely cause the company to lose its market share to competitors, including Apple and Google (which had recently unveiled their iPhone 7 and Pixel models), and other Android vendors.[37][59] Credit Suisse analysts predicted that the recall and discontinuation would cause Samsung to lose nearly US$17 billion in revenue.[89] On 12 October 2016, Samsung revised its earnings forecast for the third quarter of 2016, estimating a 33% drop in operating profits in comparison to the second quarter of 2016, and revenue expectations cut by ?2 trillion to ?47 trillion (US$41.8 billion).[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 October 2016, McCuneWright LLP sued Samsung and filed a proposed class-action lawsuit over its handling of the recall, stating that the company had \\"failed to reimburse consumers for monthly costs associated with owning an unusable Note 7\\".[91] Samsung was also criticized by customers affected by the exploding phones, who alleged that the company was refusing to compensate them for property damage caused by the explosions.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wake of the recall, Samsung, as well as UL LLC, Exponent, and TV Rheinland performed internal testing and analysis to determine the exact causes of the defects. Samsung released its official findings on 23 January 2017.[93] Concurrently, the company announced that all of its future battery-operated products would become subject to an \\"enhanced\\" eight-point inspection and testing protocol, including stricter visual inspections, as well as charge and discharge tests, Total Volatile Organic Compound tests, and accelerated usage tests. An advisory board of academics was also formed.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerns were also raised over the creation of electronic waste resulting from Samsung's announced plan to destroy all returned phones, rather than recycle and refurbish them into new products.[61][62] In February 2017, Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung had been considering refurbishing the Galaxy Note 7 into a modified version with lower battery capacity, and targeted toward markets such as Vietnam. A representative of Samsung India denied these reports.[95] Greenpeace disrupted a press conference by Samsung at Mobile World Congress to protest the company's unclear plans for the recalled devices. On 27 March 2017, Samsung announced that it now intends to extract reusable parts such as metal, semiconductors, and cameras from the recalled devices, and market refurbished devices \\"where applicable\\".[96][97]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the discontinuation of the Note 7, some features in the device (such as Samsung Pass, Secure Folder, S Pen related features, and Grace UX) were eventually made available in Marshmallow (e.g. Galaxy A8 (2016), Galaxy A (2017) series and Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2016)) and Nougat (e.g. Galaxy Note 5 (via software update), Galaxy S8/S8+ and Galaxy C Pro series)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported on Samsung's plan to refurbish its inventory of recalled phones and release them with a new model designation of Galaxy Note FE, with the \\"FE\\" referencing \\"Fan Edition.\\" The phone was also rumored to be named as the Note 7R, with the R referencing \\"refurbished\\". This phone was released on the 7th of July in South Korea, with limited availability in other countries to follow, and a price of $610; being a $255 discount from the price of the Note 7.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fan Edition has a smaller battery of 3200 mAh and multiple safety features. It has a \\"Fan Edition\\" logo on the back.  The software is identical to that of the S8. It has a similar UI and includes Bixby home and reminders but not the whole Bixby assistant.[99][100] Samsung introduced an eight-point battery check after the Note7 to make sure all of their batteries are safe for new and current devices in production. There have been no reported incidents of an S8/S8+ catching fire after their release as the first new flagship device to go through the eight-point battery check. There have been no reported incidents of the successor Note 8 catching fire either.[101][102]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Fan Edition was released in South Korea, the Galaxy Note FE was also released in select countries in Asia starting in October 2017.[103]","input":"When did the first samsung note 7 explode?"},{"output":"Fana Broadcasting Corporate S.C.","context":"Fana Broadcasting Corporate S.C.

According to anthropological and archaeological evidence, Sri Lankan Tamils have a very long history in Sri Lanka and have lived on the island since at least around the 2nd century BC.[17][18][a] Most modern Sri Lankan Tamils claim descent from residents of Jaffna Kingdom, a former kingdom in the north of the island and Vannimai chieftaincies from the east. They constitute a majority in the Northern Province, live in significant numbers in the Eastern Province, and are in the minority throughout the rest of the country. 70% of Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka live in the Northern and Eastern provinces.\\r\\nAlthough Sri Lankan Tamils are culturally and linguistically distinct, genetic studies indicate that they are closely related to Sinhalese ethnic group in the island. The Sri Lankan Tamils are mostly Hindus with a significant Christian population. Sri Lankan Tamil literature on topics including religion and the sciences flourished during the medieval period in the court of the Jaffna Kingdom. Since the beginning of the Sri Lankan Civil War in the 1980s, it is distinguished by an emphasis on themes relating to the conflict. Sri Lankan Tamil dialects are noted for their archaism and retention of words not in everyday use in the Tamil Nadu state in India.\\r\\nSince Sri Lanka gained independence from Britain in 1948, relations between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities have been strained. Rising ethnic and political tensions, along with ethnic riots in 1956, 1958, 1977, 1981 and 1983, led to the formation and strengthening of militant groups advocating independence for Tamils. The ensuing civil war resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000?people and the forced disappearance of thousands of others. The civil war ended in 2009 but there are continuing allegations of atrocities being committed by the Sri Lankan Military and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam during its final months.[19] A United Nations panel found that as many as 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the final months of the civil war.[20] The end of the civil war has not improved conditions in Sri Lanka, with press freedom not being restored and the judiciary coming under political control.[21][22][23]\\r\\nOne-third of Sri Lankan Tamils now live outside Sri Lanka. While there was significant migration during the British colonial period, the civil war led to more than 800,000?Tamils leaving Sri Lanka, and many have left the country for destinations such as Canada, India and Europe as refugees.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is little scholarly consensus over the presence of the Sri Lankan Tamil people in Sri Lanka, also known as Eelam in Sangam literature. One theory states that there was not an organised Sri Lankan Tamil people presence in Sri Lanka until the creation of a Tamil Kingdom in the 7th century AD, followed by much earlier invasions from Tamilakam.[24] Another theory states that the Sri Lankan Tamils are descendant of the Nagas, who started to assimilate to Tamil culture and language around 3rd BCE.[25] Other theories contends that Tamil people were one of the original inhabitants of the island.[26][27]\\r\\nThe indigenous Veddhas are ethnically related to people in South India and early populations of Southeast Asia. It is not possible to ascertain what languages that they originally spoke as Vedda language is considered diverged from its original source.[29]\\r\\nAccording to K. Indrapala, cultural diffusion, rather than migration of people, spread the Prakrit and Tamil languages from peninsular India into an existing mesolithic population, centuries before the common era.[30] Tamil Brahmi and Tamil-Prakrit scripts were used to write the Tamil language during this period on the island.[31]\\r\\nSettlements of culturally similar early populations of ancient Sri Lanka and ancient Tamil Nadu in India were excavated at megalithic burial sites at Pomparippu on the west coast and in Kathiraveli on the east coast of the island. Bearing a remarkable resemblance to burials in the Early Pandyan Kingdom, these sites were established between the 5th century BCE and 2nd century CE.[28][32] Excavated ceramic sequences similar to that of Arikamedu were found in Kandarodai (Kadiramalai) on the north coast, dated to 1300 BCE. Cultural similarities in burial practices in South India and Sri Lanka were dated by archaeologists to 10th century BCE. However, Indian history and archaeology have pushed the date back to 15th century BCE. In Sri Lanka, there is radiometric evidence from Anuradhapura that the non-Brahmi symbol-bearing black and red ware occur in the 10th century BCE.[33] The skeletal remains of an Early Iron Age chief were excavated in Anaikoddai, Jaffna District. The name Ko Veta is engraved in Brahmi script on a seal buried with the skeleton and is assigned by the excavators to the 3rd century BCE. Ko, meaning \\"King\\" in Tamil, is comparable to such names as Ko Atan, Ko Putivira and Ko Ra-pumaan occurring in contemporary Tamil Brahmi inscriptions of ancient South India and Egypt.[34][35]\\r\\nPotsherds with early Tamil writing from the 2nd century BCE have been found from the north in Poonagari, Kilinochchi District to the south in Tissamaharama. They bore several inscriptions, including a clan namevela, a name related to velir from ancient Tamil country.[36] Epigraphic evidence shows people identifying themselves as Damelas or Damedas (the Prakrit word for Tamil people) in Anuradhapura, the capital city of Rajarata the middle kingdom, and other areas of Sri Lanka as early as the 2nd century BCE.[37] Excavations in the area of Tissamaharama in southern Sri Lanka have unearthed locally issued coins, produced between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE, some of which carry local Tamil personal names written in early Tamil characters,[38] which suggest that local Tamil merchants were present and actively involved in trade along the southern coast of Sri Lanka by the late classical period.[39] Other ancient inscriptions from the period reference a Tamil merchant,[b] the Tamil householder residing in Ilubharata[c] and a Tamil sailor named Karava.[d] Two of the five ancient inscriptions referring to the Damedas (Tamils) are in Periya Pullyakulam in the Vavuniya District, one is in Seruvavila in Trincomalee District, one is in Kuduvil in Ampara District and one is in Anuradhapura. Mention is made in literary sources of Tamil rulers bringing horses to the island in water craft in the second century BCE, most likely arriving at Kudiramalai. Historical records establish that Tamil kingdoms in modern India were closely involved in the island's affairs from about the 2nd century BCE.[40][41] Kudiramalai, Kandarodai and Vallipuram served as great northern Tamil capitals and emporiums of trade with these kingdoms and the Romans from the 6thÿ2nd centuries BCE. The archaeological discoveries in these towns and the Manimekhalai, a historical poem, detail how Nka-Tivu of Nka-Nadu on the Jaffna Peninsula was a lucrative international market for pearl and conch trading for the Tamil fishermen.\\r\\nIn Mahavamsa, a historical poem, ethnic Tamil adventurers such as Ellalan invaded the island around 145?BCE.[42] Early Chola king Karikalan, son of Eelamcetcenni utilised superior Chola naval power to conquer Ceylon in the first century CE. Hindu Saivism, Tamil Buddhism, Jainism and secularism were popular amongst the Tamils at this time, as was the proliferation of village deity worship. The Amaravati school was influential in the region when the Telugu Satavahana dynasty established the Andhra empire and its 17th monarch Hla (20ÿ24 CE) married a princess from the island. Ancient Vanniars settled in the east of the island in the first few centuries of the common era to cultivate and maintain the area.[43][44] The Vanni region flourished.[45] In the 6th century CE, a special coastal route by boat was established from the Jaffna peninsula southwards to Saivite religious centres in Trincomalee (Koneswaram) and further south to Batticaloa (Thirukkovil), passed a few small Tamil trading settlements in Mullaitivu on the north coast.[46] The conquests and rule of the island by Pallava king Narasimhavarman I (630ÿ668 CE) and his grandfather King Simhavishnu (537ÿ590 CE) saw the erection and structural development of several Kovils around the island, particularly in the north-east ÿ these Pallava Dravidian rock temples remained a popular and highly influential style of architecture in the region over the next few centuries.[47][48][49] Tamil soldiers from what is now South India were brought to Anuradhapura between the 7th and 11th centuries CE in such large numbers that local chiefs and kings trying to establish legitimacy came to rely on them.[50] By the 8th century CE Tamil villages were collectively known as Demel-kaballa (Tamil allotment), Demelat-valademin (Tamil villages), and Demel-gam-bim (Tamil villages and lands).[51]\\r\\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries?CE, Pandya and Chola incursions into Sri Lanka culminated in the Chola annexation of the island, which lasted until the latter half of the 11th century CE.[50][53][54][55][56][57] Raja Raja Chola I renamed the northern throne Mummudi Chola Mandalam after his conquest of the northeast country to protect Tamil traders being looted, imprisoned and killed for years on the island.[58] Rajadhiraja Chola's conquest of the island led to the fall of four kings there, one of whom, Madavarajah, the king of Jaffna, was a usurper from the Rashtrakuta Dynasty.[59] These dynasties oversaw the development of several Kovils that administered services to communities of land assigned to the temples through royal grants. Their rule also saw the benefaction of other faiths. Recent excavations have led to the discovery of a limestone Kovil of Raja Raja Chola I's era on Delft island, found with Chola coins from this period.[60] The decline of Chola power in Sri Lanka was followed by the restoration of the Polonnaruwa monarchy in the late 11th century CE.[61] In 1215, following Pandya invasions, the Tamil-dominant Arya Chakaravarthi dynasty established an independent Jaffna kingdom on the Jaffna peninsula and other parts of the north.[62] The Arya Chakaravarthi expansion into the south was halted by Alagakkonara,[63] a man descended from a family of merchants from Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu. He was the chief minister of the Sinhalese king Parakramabahu V (1344ÿ59?CE). Vira Alakeshwara, a descendant of Alagakkonara, later became king of the Sinhalese,[64] but he was overthrown by the Ming admiral Zheng He in 1409?CE. The next year, the Chinese admiral Zheng He erected a trilingual stone tablet in Galle in the south of the island, written in Chinese, Persian and Tamil that recorded offerings he made to Buddha, Allah and the God of Tamils Tenavarai Nayanar. The admiral invoked the blessings of Hindu deities at Temple of Perimpanayagam Tenavaram, Tevanthurai for a peaceful world built on trade.[65] The 1502 map Cantino represents three Tamil cities on the east coast of the island ÿ Mullaitivu, Trincomalee and Pannoa, where the residents grow cinnamon and other spices, fish for pearls and seed pearls and worship idols, trading heavily with Kozhikode of Kerala.[66] The Arya Chakaravarthi dynasty ruled large parts of northeast Sri Lanka until the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom in 1619?CE. The coastal areas of the island were conquered by the Dutch and then became part of the British Empire in 1796?CE.\\r\\nThe Sinhalese Nampota dated in its present form to the 14th or 15th century CE suggests that the whole of the Tamil Kingdom, including parts of the modern Trincomalee District, was recognised as a Tamil region by the name Demala-pattanama (Tamil city).[67] In this work, a number of villages that are now situated in the Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Trincomalee districts are mentioned as places in Demala-pattanama.[68]\\r\\nThe English sailor Robert Knox described walking into the islands Tamil country in the publication An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon, referencing some aspects of their royal, rural and economic life and annotating some kingdoms within it on a map in 1681?CE.[69] Upon arrival of European powers from the 17th century?CE, the Tamils' separate nation was described in their areas of habitation in the northeast of the island.[e]\\r\\nThe caste structure of the majority Sinhalese has also accommodated Hindu immigrants from South India since the 13th century CE. This led to the emergence of three new Sinhalese caste groups: the Salagama, the Durava and the Karava.[70][71][72] The Hindu migration and assimilation continued until the 18th century CE.[70]\\r\\nAccording to the 2012 census there were 2,270,924 Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka, 11.21% of the population.[1] Sri Lankan Tamils constitute an overwhelming majority of the population in the Northern Province and are the largest ethnic group in the Eastern Province.[1] They are minority in other provinces. 70% of Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka live in the Northern and Eastern provinces.[1]\\r\\nThere are no accurate figures for the number of Sri Lankan Tamils living in the diaspora. Estimates range from 450,000 to one million.[75][76]\\r\\nThe two groups of Tamils located in Sri Lanka are the Sri Lankan Tamils and the Indian Tamils. There also exists a significant population in Sri Lanka who are native speakers of Tamil language and are of Islamic faith. Though several evidence point them towards being ethnic Tamils,[77][78][79] they are however controversially[77][79][80] listed as a separate ethnic group by the Sri Lankan government.[81][82][83] Sri Lankan Tamils (also called Ceylon Tamils) are descendants of the Tamils of the old Jaffna Kingdom and east coast chieftaincies called Vannimais. The Indian Tamils (or Hill Country Tamils) are descendants of bonded labourers sent from Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka in the 19th century to work on tea plantations.[84][85]\\r\\nMost Sri Lankan Tamils live in the Northern and Eastern provinces and in the capital Colombo, and most Indian Tamils live in the central highlands.[83] Historically, both groups have seen themselves as separate communities, although there has been a greater sense of unity since the 1980s.[86] In 1948, the United National Party government stripped the Indian Tamils of their citizenship. Under the terms of an agreement reached between the Sri Lankan and Indian governments in the 1960s, about forty percent of the Indian Tamils were granted Sri Lankan citizenship, and most of the remainder were repatriated to India.[87] By the 1990s, most Indian Tamils had received Sri Lankan citizenship.[87]\\r\\nSri Lankan Tamils are categorised into three subgroups based on regional distribution, dialects, and culture: Negombo Tamils from the western part of the island, Eastern Tamils from the eastern part, and Jaffna or Northern Tamils from the north.\\r\\nWestern Tamils, also known as Negombo Tamils or Puttalam Tamils, are native Sri Lankan Tamils who live in the western Gampaha and Puttalam districts. The term does not apply to Tamil immigrants in these areas.[88] They are distinguished from other Tamils by their dialects, one of which is known as the Negombo Tamil dialect, and by aspects of their culture such as customary laws.[88][89][90] Most Negombo Tamils have assimilated into the Sinhalese ethnic group through a process known as Sinhalisation. Sinhalisation has been facilitated by caste myths and legends.[91] The Western Tamils caste hierarchy is predominantly dominated by the maritime Karaiyars, with other dominant groups such as the Paravars.[92]\\r\\nIn Gampaha District, Tamils have historically inhabited the coastal region. In the Puttalam District, there was a substantial ethnic Tamil population until the first two decades of the 20th century.[91][93] Most of those who identify as ethnic Tamils live in villages such as Udappu and Maradankulam.[94] The coastal strip from Jaffna to Chilaw is also known as the \\"Catholic belt\\".[95] The Tamil Christians, chiefly Roman Catholics, have preserved their heritage in the major cities such as Negombo, Chilaw, Puttalam, and also in villages such as Mampuri.[91]\\r\\nSome residents of these two districts, especially the Karaiyars, are bilingual, ensuring that the Tamil language survives as a lingua franca among migrating maritime communities across the island. Negombo Tamil dialect is spoken by about 50,000 people. This number does not include others, outside of Negombo city, who speak local varieties of the Tamil language.[89] The bilingual catholic Karavas are also found in the western coastal regions, who trace their origins to the Tamil Karaiyar however identify themselves as Sinhalese.[96]\\r\\nSome Tamil place names have been retained in these districts. Outside the Tamil-dominated northeast, the Puttalam District has the highest percentage of place names of Tamil origin in Sri Lanka. Composite or hybrid place names are also present in these districts.[97]\\r\\nEastern Tamils inhabit a region that spans the Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Ampara districts.[99] Their history and traditions are inspired by local legends, native literature, and colonial documents.[100]\\r\\nIn the 16th century the area came under the nominal control of the Kingdom of Kandy, but there was scattered leadership under Vannimai chiefs in Batticaloa District[101][102] who came with Magha's army in 1215.[103] From that time on, Eastern Tamil social development diverged from that of the Northern Tamils.\\r\\nEastern Tamils are an agrarian-based society. They follow a caste system similar to the South Indian or Dravidian kinship system. The Eastern Tamil caste hierarchy is dominated by the Mukkuvar, Paravar and Karaiyar . The main feature of their society is the kuti system.[104] Although the Tamil word kuti means a house or settlement, in eastern Sri Lanka it is related to matrimonial alliances. It refers to the exogamous matrilineal clans and is found amongst most caste groups.[105] Men or women remain members of the kuti of their birth and be brother or sister by relation. No man can marry in the same kuti because woman is always become sister to him. But, a man can only marry in one of his sampantha kutis not in the sakothara kutis. By custom, children born in a family belong to mother's kuti. Kuti also collectively own places of worship such as Hindu temples.[105] Each caste contains a number of kutis, with varying names. Aside from castes with an internal kuti system, there are seventeen caste groups, called Ciraikutis, or imprisoned kutis, whose members were considered to be in captivity, confined to specific services such as washing, weaving, and toddy tapping. However, such restrictions no longer apply.\\r\\nThe Tamils of the Trincomalee district have different social customs from their southern neighbours due to the influence of the Jaffna kingdom to the north.[105] The indigenous Veddha people of the east coast also speak Tamil and have become assimilated into the Eastern Tamil caste structure.[106] Most Eastern Tamils follow customary laws called Mukkuva laws codified during the Dutch colonial period.[107]\\r\\nJaffna's history of being an independent kingdom lends legitimacy to the political claims of the Sri Lankan Tamils, and has provided a focus for their constitutional demands.[108] Northern Tamil society is generally categorised into two groups: those who are from the Jaffna peninsula in the north, and those who are residents of the Vanni to the immediate south. The Jaffna society is separated by castes. The Sri Lankan Vellalar are the landed gentry and the dominant caste in Jaffna. They are the landlords and temple owners/patrons of the north. They also make up the largest proportion of skilled professionals among Tamils in Sri Lanka. Before independence, the largest proportion of skilled government and professional jobs in the whole country were held by this caste. They constitute half of the population and enjoyed dominance under Dutch and British rule, from which community the colonial political elites were also drawn from.[109] The Vellalars and other dominant castes use the services of castes collectively known as Panchamar (Tamil for group of five). The Panchamar consisted of the Nalavar, Pallar, Parayar, Vannar, and Ambattar.[108] The maritime communities existed outside the agriculture-based caste system and is dominated by the Karaiyars.[110][111] The caste of temple priests known as Kurukkals or Iyers are also held in high esteem.[110] The important groups of artisans, known as Kammalar are constituted of the Tatchar, Kusavar, Tattar, Kollar and Kannar. The Kammalar and Panchamar are also jointly known as Kudimakkal, who gave ritual importance to the dominant castes.[112][113]\\r\\nPeople in the Vanni districts considered themselves separate from Tamils of the Jaffna peninsula but the two groups did intermarry. Most of these married couples moved into the Vanni districts where land was available. Vanni consists of a number of highland settlements within forested lands using irrigation tank-based cultivation. An 1890 census listed 711 such tanks in this area. Hunting and raising livestock such as water buffalo and cattle is a necessary adjunct to the agriculture. The Tamil-inhabited Vanni consists of the Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, and eastern Mannar districts. Historically, the Vanni area has been in contact with what is now South India, including during the medieval period and was ruled by the Vanniar Chieftains.[108] Northern Tamils follow customary laws called Thesavalamai, codified during the Dutch colonial period.[114]\\r\\nAlthough Sri Lankan Tamils are culturally and linguistically distinct, genetic studies indicate that they are closely related to other ethnic groups in the island while being related to the Indian Tamils from South India as well. There are various studies that indicate varying degrees of connections between Sri Lankan Tamils, Sinhalese and Indian ethnic groups.\\r\\nIn 1981, about eighty percent of Sri Lankan Tamils were Hindus who followed the Shaiva sect.[115] The rest were mostly Roman Catholics who converted after the Portuguese conquest of Jaffna Kingdom and coastal Sri Lanka. There is also a small minority of Protestants due to missionary efforts in the 18th century by organisations such as the American Ceylon Mission.[116] Most Tamils who inhabit the Western Province are Roman Catholics, while those of the Northern and Eastern Provinces are mainly Hindu.[117] Pentecostal and other churches, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, are active among the internally displaced and refugee populations.[118] The 2012 Sri Lanka Census revealed a Buddhist population of 22,254 amongst Sri Lankan Tamils. Accounting to roughly 1% of all Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka.[119]\\r\\nThe Hindu elite, especially the Vellalar, follow the religious ideology of Shaiva Siddhanta (Shaiva school) while the masses practice folk Hinduism, upholding their faith in local village deities not found in formal Hindu scriptures. The place of worship depends on the object of worship and how it is housed. It could be a proper Hindu temple known as a Koyil, constructed according to the Agamic scripts (a set of scriptures regulating the temple cult). More often, however, the temple is not completed in accordance with Agamic scriptures but consists of the barest essential structure housing a local deity.[117] These temples observe daily Puja (prayers) hours and are attended by locals. Both types of temples have a resident ritualist or priest known as a Kurukkal. A Kurukkal may belong to someone from a prominent local lineage like Pandaram or Iyer community.[117] In the Eastern Province, a Kurukkal usually belongs to Lingayat sect. Other places of worship do not have icons for their deities. The sanctum could house a trident (culam), a stone, or a large tree. Temples of this type are common in the Northern and Eastern Provinces; a typical village has up to 150 such structures. The offering would be done by an elder of the family who owns the site. A coconut oil lamp would be lit on Fridays, and a special rice dish known as pongal would be cooked either on a day considered auspicious by the family or on the Thai Pongal day, and possibly on Tamil New Year Day.\\r\\nThere are seven worshipped deities: Ayyanar, Annamar, Vairavar, Kali, Pillaiyar, Murukan, or Pattini. Villages have more Pillaiyar temples, which are patronised by local farmers.[117] Tamil Roman Catholics, along with members of other faiths, worship at the Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu.[120] Hindus have several temples with historic importance such as those at Ketheeswaram, Koneswaram, Naguleswaram, Munneswaram, Tondeswaram, and Nallur Kandaswamy.[121] Kataragama temple and Adam's Peak are attended by all religious communities.\\r\\nTamil dialects are differentiated by the phonological changes and sound shifts in their evolution from classical or old Tamil (3rd century BCEÿ7th century CE). The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects form a group that is distinct from the dialects of the modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala states of India. They are classified into three subgroups: the Jaffna Tamil, the Batticaloa Tamil, and the Negombo Tamil dialects. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as the Sinhalese, Moors and Veddhas. Tamil loan words in Sinhala also follow the characteristics of Sri Lankan Tamil dialects.[122]\\r\\nThe Negombo Tamil dialect is used by bilingual fishermen in the Negombo area, who otherwise identify themselves as Sinhalese. This dialect has undergone considerable convergence with spoken Sinhala.[90] The Batticaloa Tamil dialect is shared between Tamils, Muslims, Veddhas and Portuguese Burghers in the Eastern Province. Batticaloa Tamil dialect is the most literary of all the spoken dialects of Tamil. It has preserved several ancient features, remaining more consistent with the literary norm, while at the same time developing a few innovations. It also has its own distinctive vocabulary and retains words that are unique to present-day Malayalam, a Dravidian language from Kerala that originated as a dialect of old Tamil around 9th century CE.[123][124] The Tamil dialect used by residents of the Trincomalee District has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil dialect.[122]\\r\\nThe dialect used in Jaffna is the oldest and closest to old Tamil. The long physical isolation of the Tamils of Jaffna has enabled their dialect to preserve ancient features of old Tamil that predate Tolkappiyam,[122] the grammatical treatise on Tamil dated from 3rd century BCE to 10th century CE.[125] Also, a large component of the settlers were from the Coromandel Coast and Malabar Coast which may have helped with the preservation of the dialect.[126][127] The large section of the settlers were Vellalars (Mudaliar and Pillai) and this would have helped retain pure Tamil words. Their ordinary speech is closely related to classical Tamil.[122] Conservational Jaffna Tamil dialect and Indian Tamil dialects are to an extent not mutually intelligible,[128] and the former is frequently mistaken for Malayalam by native Indian Tamil speakers. [129] The closest Tamil Nadu Tamil variant to Jaffna Tamil is literary Tamil, used in formal speeches and news reading. There are also Prakrit loan words that are unique to Jaffna Tamil.[130][131]\\r\\nSri Lankan Tamil society values education highly, for its own sake as well as for the opportunities it provides.[89] The kings of the Aryacakravarti dynasty were historically patrons of literature and education. Temple schools and traditional gurukulam classes on verandahs (known as Thinnai Pallikoodam in Tamil) spread basic education in religion and in languages such as Tamil and Sanskrit to the upper classes.[132] The Portuguese introduced western-style education after their conquest of the Jaffna kingdom in 1619. The Jesuits opened churches and seminaries, but the Dutch destroyed them and opened their own schools attached to Dutch Reformed churches when they took over Tamil-speaking regions of Sri Lanka.[133]\\r\\nThe primary impetus for educational opportunity came with the establishment of the American Ceylon Mission in Jaffna District, which started with the arrival in 1813 of missionaries sponsored by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. The critical period of the missionaries' impact was from the 1820s to the early 20th century. During this time, they created Tamil translations of English texts, engaged in printing and publishing, established primary, secondary, and college-level schools, and provided health care for residents of the Jaffna Peninsula. American activities in Jaffna also had unintended consequences. The concentration of efficient Protestant mission schools in Jaffna produced a revival movement among local Hindus led by Arumuga Navalar, who responded by building many more schools within the Jaffna peninsula. Local Catholics also started their own schools in reaction, and the state had its share of primary and secondary schools. Tamil literacy greatly increased as a result of these changes. This prompted the British colonial government to hire Tamils as government servants in British-held Ceylon, India, Malaysia, and Singapore.[134]\\r\\nBy the time Sri Lanka became independent in 1948, about sixty percent of government jobs were held by Tamils, who formed barely fifteen percent of the population. The elected Sinhalese leaders of the country saw this as the result of a British stratagem to control the majority Sinhalese, and deemed it a situation that needed correction by implementation of the Policy of standardization.[135][136]\\r\\nAccording to legends, the origin of Sri Lankan Tamil literature dates back to the Sangam period (3rd century BCEÿ6th century CE). These legends indicate that the Tamil poet Eelattu Poothanthevanar (Poothanthevanar from Sri Lanka) lived during this period.[137]\\r\\nMedieval period Tamil literature on the subjects of medicine, mathematics and history was produced in the courts of the Jaffna Kingdom. During Singai Pararasasekaran's rule, an academy for the propagation of the Tamil language, modelled on those of ancient Tamil Sangam, was established in Nallur. This academy collected manuscripts of ancient works and preserved them in the Saraswathy Mahal library.[132][138]\\r\\nDuring the Portuguese and Dutch colonial periods (1619ÿ1796), Muttukumara Kavirajar is the earliest known author who used literature to respond to Christian missionary activities. He was followed by Arumuga Navalar, who wrote and published a number of books.[137] The period of joint missionary activities by the Anglican, American Ceylon, and Methodist Missions also saw the spread of modern education and the expansion of translation activities.\\r\\nThe modern period of Tamil literature began in the 1960s with the establishment of modern universities and a free education system in post-independence Sri Lanka. The 1960s also saw a social revolt against the caste system in Jaffna, which impacted Tamil literature: Dominic Jeeva, Senkai aazhiyaan, Thamizhmani Ahalangan are the products of this period.[137]\\r\\nAfter the start of the civil war in 1983, a number of poets and fiction writers became active, focusing on subjects such as death, destruction, and rape. Such writings have no parallels in any previous Tamil literature.[137] The war produced displaced Tamil writers around the globe who recorded their longing for their lost homes and the need for integration with mainstream communities in Europe and North America.[137]\\r\\nThe Jaffna Public Library which contained over 97,000 books and manuscripts was one of the biggest libraries in Asia, and through the Burning of the Jaffna Public Library much of Sri Lankan Tamil literature has been obliterated.[139]\\r\\nThe cuisine of Sri Lankan Tamils draws influence from that of India, as well as from colonialists and foreign traders. Rice is usually consumed daily and can be found at any special occasion, while spicy curries are favourite dishes for lunch and dinner. Rice and curry is the name for a range of Sri Lankan Tamil dishes distinct from Indian Tamil cuisine, with regional variations between the island's northern and eastern areas. While rice with curries is the most popular lunch menu, combinations such as curd, tangy mango, and tomato rice are also commonly served.[140]\\r\\nString hoppers, which are made of rice flour and look like knitted vermicelli neatly laid out in circular pieces about 12 centimetres (4.7?in) in diameter, are frequently combined with tomato sothi (a soup) and curries for breakfast and dinner.[141] Another common item is puttu, a granular, dry, but soft steamed rice powder cooked in a bamboo cylinder with the base wrapped in cloth so that the bamboo flute can be set upright over a clay pot of boiling water. This can be transformed into varieties such as ragi, spinach, and tapioca puttu. There are also sweet and savoury puttus.[142] Another popular breakfast or dinner dish is Appam, a thin crusty pancake made with rice flour, with a round soft crust in the middle.[143] It has variations such as egg or milk Appam.[140]\\r\\nJaffna, as a peninsula, has an abundance of seafood such as crab, shark, fish, prawn, and squid. Meat dishes such as mutton, chicken and pork also have their own niche. Vegetable curries use ingredients primarily from the home garden such as pumpkin, yam, jackfruit seed, hibiscus flower, and various green leaves. Coconut milk and hot chilli powder are also frequently used. Appetizers can consist of a range of achars (pickles) and vadahams. Snacks and sweets are generally of the homemade \\"rustic\\" variety, relying on jaggery, sesame seed, coconut, and gingelly oil, to give them their distinct regional flavour. A popular alcoholic drink in rural areas is palm wine (toddy), made from palmyra tree sap. Snacks, savouries, sweets and porridge produced from the palmyra form a separate but unique category of foods; from the fan-shaped leaves to the root, the palmyra palm forms an intrinsic part of the life and cuisine of northern region.[140]\\r\\nSri Lanka became an independent nation in 1948. Since independence, the political relationship between Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil community has been strained. Sri Lanka has been unable to contain its ethnic violence as it escalated from sporadic terrorism to mob violence, and finally to civil war.[145] The Sri Lankan Civil War has several underlying causes: the ways in which modern ethnic identities have been made and remade since the colonial period, rhetorical wars over archaeological sites and place name etymologies, and the political use of the national past.[71] The civil war resulted in the death of at least 100,000 people[146][147] and, according to human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch, the forced disappearance of thousands of others (see White van abductions in Sri Lanka).[148][149][150] Since 1983, Sri Lanka has also witnessed massive civilian displacements of more than a million people, with eighty percent of them being Sri Lankan Tamils.[151]\\r\\nThe arrival of Protestant missionaries on a large scale beginning in 1814 was a primary contributor to the development of political awareness among Sri Lankan Tamils. Activities by missionaries of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and Methodist and Anglican churches led to a revival among Hindu Tamils who created their own social groups, built their own schools and temples, and published their own literature to counter the missionary activities. The success of this effort led to a new confidence for the Tamils, encouraging them to think of themselves as a community, and it paved the way for their emergence as a cultural, religious, and linguistic society in the mid-19th century.[152][153]\\r\\nBritain, which conquered the whole island by 1815, established a legislative council in 1833 by unifying the Tamil and Sinhalese nations on the island and assigning three European seats and one seat each for Sinhalese, Tamils and Burghers.[154] This council's primary function was to act as advisor to the Governor, and the seats eventually became elected positions.[155] There was initially little tension between the Sinhalese and the Tamils, when in 1913 Ponnambalam Arunachalam, a Tamil, was appointed representative of the Sinhalese as well as of the Tamils in the national legislative council. British Governor William Manning, who was appointed in 1918 however, actively encouraged the concept of \\"communal representation\\".[156] Subsequently, the Donoughmore Commission in 1931 rejected communal representation and brought in universal franchise. This decision was opposed by the Tamil political leadership, who realised that they would be reduced to a minority in parliament according to their proportion of the overall population. In 1944, G. G. Ponnambalam, a leader of the Tamil community, suggested to the Soulbury Commission that a roughly equal number of seats be assigned to Sinhalese and minorities in an independent Ceylon (50:50) ÿ a proposal that was rejected.[157] But under section 29(2) of the constitution formulated by the commissioner, additional protection was provided to minority groups, such requiring a two-thirds majority for any amendments and a scheme of representation that provided more weight to the ethnic minorities.[158]\\r\\nShortly after independence in 1948, G. G. Ponnambalam and his All Ceylon Tamil Congress joined D. S. Senanayake's moderate, western-oriented United National Party led government which led to a split in the Tamil Congress.[159] S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, the leader of the splinter Federal Party (FP or Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi), contested the Ceylon Citizenship Act, which denied citizenship to Tamils of recent Indian origin, before the Supreme Court, and then in the Privy council in England, but failed to overturn it. The FP eventually became the dominant Tamil political party.[160] In response to the Sinhala Only Act in 1956, which made Sinhala the sole official language, Federal Party Members of Parliament staged a nonviolent sit-in (satyagraha) protest, but it was violently broken up by a mob. The FP was blamed and briefly banned after the riots of MayÿJune 1958 targeting Tamils, in which many were killed and thousands forced to flee their homes.[161] Another point of conflict between the communities was state sponsored colonisation schemes that effectively changed the demographic balance in the Eastern Province, an area Tamil nationalists considered to be their traditional homeland, in favour of the majority Sinhalese.[145][162]\\r\\nIn 1972, a newly formulated constitution removed section 29(2) of the 1947 Soulbury constitution that was formulated to protect the interests of minorities.[158] Also, in 1973, the Policy of standardization was implemented by the Sri Lankan government, supposedly to rectify disparities in university enrolment created under British colonial rule. The resultant benefits enjoyed by Sinhalese students also meant a significant decrease in the number of Tamil students within the Sri Lankan university student population.[163]\\r\\nShortly thereafter, in 1973, the Federal Party decided to demand a separate Tamil state. In 1976 they merged with the other Tamil political parties to become the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). [164] [145][162] By 1977 most Tamils seemed to support the move for independence by electing the Tamil United Liberation Front overwhelmingly.[165] The elections were followed by the 1977 riots, in which around 300 Tamils were killed.[166] There was further violence in 1981 when an organised Sinhalese mob went on a rampage during the nights of 31 May to 2 June, burning down the Jaffna public libraryat the time one of the largest libraries in Asiacontaining more than 97,000 books and manuscripts.[167][168]\\r\\nSince 1948, successive governments have adopted policies that had the net effect of assisting the Sinhalese community in such areas as education and public employment.[169] These policies made it difficult for middle class Tamil youth to enter university or secure employment.[169][170]\\r\\nThe individuals belonging to this younger generation, often referred to by other Tamils as \\"the boys\\" (Pudiyangal in Tamil), formed many militant organisations.[169] The most important contributor to the strength of the militant groups was the Black July massacre, in which between 1,000[171]- 3,000[172] Tamils were killed, prompting many youths to choose the path of armed resistance.[169][172][173]\\r\\nBy the end of 1987, the militant youth groups had fought not only the Sri Lankan security forces and the Indian Peace Keeping Force also among each other, with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) eventually eliminating most of the others. Except for the LTTE, many of the remaining organisations transformed into either minor political parties within the Tamil National Alliance or standalone political parties. Some also function as paramilitary groups within the Sri Lankan military.[169]\\r\\nHuman rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as well as the United States Department of State[174] and the European Union,[175] have expressed concern about the state of human rights in Sri Lanka, and both the government of Sri Lanka and the rebel LTTE have been accused of human rights violations. Although Amnesty International in 2003 found considerable improvement in the human rights situation, attributed to a ceasefire and peace talks between the government and the LTTE,[176] by 2007 they reported an escalation in political killings, child recruitment, abductions, and armed clashes, which created a climate of fear in the north and east of the country.[177]\\r\\nIn August 2009, the civil war ended with total victory for the government forces. During last phase of the war many Tamil civilians and combatants were killed. The government estimated that over 22,000 LTTE cadres had died.[178] The civilian death toll is estimated to vary from 6,500[179] to as high as 40,000.[180] This is in addition to the 70,000 Sri Lankans killed up to the beginning of the last phase of the civil war.[181] Over 300,000 internally displaced Tamil civilians were interred in special camps and eventually released. As of 2011, there were still few thousand alleged combatants in state prisons awaiting trials.[182] The Sri Lankan government has released over 11,000 rehabilitated former LTTE cadres.[183]\\r\\nBishop of Mannar (a north western town), Rayappu Joseph, says 146,679 people seem to be unaccounted between 2008 October and at the end of the civil war.[184]\\r\\nTamil presence in Sri Lankan politics and society is facing a revival. In 2015 elections the Tamil national alliance got the third largest amound of seats in the Parliament and as the largest parties UNP and SLFP created a unity government TNA leader R.Sampanthan was appointed as the opposition leader[185][186] K.Sripavan beame the 44th Chief justice and the second Tamil to hold the position.[187]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest Tamil speakers from Sri Lanka known to have travelled to foreign lands were members of a merchant guild called Tenilankai Valanciyar (Valanciyar from Lanka of the South). They left behind inscriptions in South India dated to the 13th century.[188] In the late 19th century, educated Tamils from the Jaffna peninsula migrated to the British colonies of Malaya (Malaysia and Singapore) and India to assist the colonial bureaucracy. They worked in almost every branch of public administration, as well as on plantations and in industrial sectors. Prominent Sri Lankan Tamils in the Forbes list of billionaire include: Ananda Krishnan,[189] Raj Rajaratnam, and G. Gnanalingam,[190] and Singapore's former foreign minister and deputy prime minister, S. Rajaratnam, are of Sri Lankan Tamil descent.[191] C. W. Thamotharampillai, an Indian-based Tamil language revivalist, was born in the Jaffna peninsula.[192]\\r\\nAfter the start of the conflict between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, there was a mass migration of Tamils trying to escape the hardships and perils of war. Initially, it was middle class professionals, such as doctors and engineers, who emigrated; they were followed by the poorer segments of the community. The fighting drove more than 800,000 Tamils from their homes to other places within Sri Lanka as internally displaced persons and also overseas, prompting the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to identify them in 2004 as the largest asylum-seeking group.[8][193]\\r\\nThe country with the largest share of displaced Tamils is Canada, with more than 200,000 legal residents,[2] found mostly within the Greater Toronto Area.[194] and there are a number of prominent Canadians of Sri Lankan Tamil descent, such as author Shyam Selvadurai,[195] and Indira Samarasekera,[196] former president of the University of Alberta.\\r\\nSri Lankan Tamils in India are mostly refugees of about over 100,000 in special camps and another 50,000 outside of the camps.[8] In western European countries, the refugees and immigrants have integrated themselves into society where permitted. Tamil British singer M.I.A (born Mathangi Arulpragasam)[197] and BBC journalist George Alagiah[198] are, among others, notable people of Sri Lankan Tamil descent. Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus have built a number of prominent Hindu temples across North America and Europe, notably in Canada, France, Germany, Denmark, and the UK.[9][15]\\r\\nSri Lankan Tamils continue to seek refuge in countries like Canada and Australia.[199][200] The International Organization for Migration and the Australian government have declared Tamil refugees as economic migrants.[201] Canada has tightened controls on their refugee program due to various abuses within the Canadian refugee system.[202] A Canadian government survey found that over 70% of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees have gone back to Sri Lanka for holidays raising concerns over the legitimacy of their refugee claims.[203]","input":"How many tamils are there in sri lanka?"},{"output":"Islam","context":"Asia is the largest and most populous continent, with a wide variety of religions, and was the birthplace of many religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam, Jainism, Christianity, Judaism, Shintoism, Sikhism, Taoism, and Zoroastranism. All major religious traditions are practiced in the region and new forms are constantly emerging. The largest religion in Asia is Islam with approx. 1.1 billion adherents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDharmic religions are the predominant and oldest religions of Asia. Most of Asia's population follows Indian religions. All Indian religions originated in South Asia. These religions all have the concepts of dharma, karma, and reincarnation.\\r\\nHinduism is the second largest and the oldest religion in Asia with more than 1 billion followers.[1] Demographically, it is the largest religion in India (80%), Nepal (81%), and the island of Bali (83.5%),[2] with strong minorities in the Asian nations of Bhutan, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Mayanmar, the Philippines, and Afghanistan. Hinduism is subdivided into a number of major currents, the primary ones being Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Smartism and Shaktism. The vast majority of present-day Hindus can be categorized under one of these four groups, although there are many other, partly overlapping, allegiances and denominations.\\r\\nHinduism predates recorded history and is thought to have had a beginning during the Indus Valley Civilization itself. It has no single founder; rather, it is a diverse melange of traditions, practices, and lineages. Jainism, and Sikhism emerged in ancient India from Hinduism.\\r\\nJainism is an Indian religion. Jains are mostly found in India but are increasingly found throughout the world.[3] Jains have significantly influenced and contributed to ethical, political and economic spheres in India. Jains have an ancient tradition of scholarship and have the highest degree of literacy for a religious community in India.[4][5] Jain libraries are the oldest in the country.[6][7] It has traditionally been confined to the Indian Subcontinent. It is based on the teachings of Vardhaman Mahavir and also on 23 other Tirthankaras.\\r\\nBuddhism is the fourth largest world religion and the 3rd largest in Asia, which is 12% of Asia's population.[8] It is dominant and the majority in Bhutan, Burma, Cambodia, Tibet, Laos, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Thailand.[8][9] Large Buddhist populations live in China (18.2%), Japan (36.2%), Taiwan (35%), Macau (17%), North Korea (13.8%), Nepal (10.7%), Vietnam (10%), Singapore (33%), Hong Kong (15%) and South Korea (22.9%).[8] It also has strong minorities in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Russia. Buddhism was founded by Siddartha Gautama, also known as Buddha.\\r\\nBefore the rise of Islam, Buddhism was one of the most widely practiced religions in Central Asia, Afghanistan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia.[10][11][12]\\r\\nSikhism is the fifth largest organized religion in the world,[13] with approximately 30 million adherents.[14] And one of the most steadily growing.[15] It is a monotheistic religion founded by Guru Nanak Dev in the 1500s. The religion professes its roots in the area of Punjab, whose territories form part of India and Pakistan.\\r\\nThis system of religious philosophy and expression has been traditionally known as the Gurmat (literally the counsel of the gurus) or the Sikh Dharm. Sikhism originated from the word Sikh, which in turn comes from the Sanskrit root ?hi?hya meaning \\"disciple\\" or \\"learner\\", or ?hik?ha meaning \\"instruction\\".\\r\\nSikhism is the 4th largest religion in India with 2% of the total population being Sikh. There is also a large concentration of Sikhs in Malaysia, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Hongkong, Singapore, Indonesia, Kuwait and U.A.E.\\r\\nEast Asian religions (also known as Far Eastern religions, Chinese religions, or Taoic religions) form a subset of the Eastern religions.\\r\\nConfucianism was founded in ancient China by Confucius (551 B.C.E. - 479). Confucianism is a complex of moral, social, political, philosophical, and religious concerns that permeated the culture and history of East Asia. Confucianism emphasizes family, social hierarchy, and personal integrity and is manifested in practices and attitudes rather than institutions and is centered on the family and local society. It was, however, considered the state religion of East Asian countries in some periods. Today the Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese diasporas have brought Confucianism to all parts of the world.\\r\\nTaoism (also romanized Daoism) is a diverse philosophical and religious tradition that emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (also romanized \\"Dao\\"), a term that means \\"way\\", \\"path\\" or \\"principle\\". The concept is shared with other Chinese philosophies and religions. In Taoism, however, Tao denotes both the source and the driving force inherent in everything that exists. It is ultimately ineffable: \\"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.\\"[16]\\r\\nLaozi is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoism and is closely associated with \\"original\\", or \\"primordial\\", Taoism.[17] Whether he actually existed is commonly disputed;[18][19] however, the work attributed to him ÿ the Daodejing ÿ is dated to the late 4th century BC.[20]\\r\\nTaoist propriety and ethics vary according to the particular school, but in general tends to emphasize wu-wei (action through non-action), \\"naturalness\\", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: compassion, moderation, and humility.\\r\\nSignificant Taoist communities can be found in China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam and in the Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese diasporas.\\r\\nChinese folk religion is a label used to describe the ethnic religious traditions which have been a main belief system in China and among the Han Chinese ethnic group for most of the civilization's history. This group of diverse beliefs comprises Chinese mythology and includes the worship of various shen (^, shn; \\"deities\\", \\"spirits\\", \\"awarenesses\\", \\"consciousnesses\\", \\"archetypes\\") which can be nature deities, Taizu or clan deities, city deities, national deities, cultural heroes and demigods, dragons and ancestors. Chinese folk religion is sometimes categorized with Taoism, since over the world institutional Taoism has been attempting to assimilate or administer local religions. More accurately, Taoism can be defined as a component of Chinese religion, since it sprang out of folk religion and Chinese philosophy. Chinese folk religion is sometimes seen as a constituent part of Chinese traditional religion, but more often, the two are regarded as synonymous. With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population, Chinese folk religion is one of the major religious traditions in the world. In China more than 30% of the population adheres to folk religions or Taoism.[21]\\r\\nKami-no-michi is almost unique to Japan and the Japanese diaspora. It is a set of practices carried out to establish a connection between present-day Japan and its ancient past. Shinto practices were first recorded and codified in the written records of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki in the 7th and 8th century. Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not refer to a unified \\"Shinto religion\\", but rather to disorganized folklore, history, and mythology. Shinto today applies to public shrines suited to various purposes such as war memorials, harvest festivals, romance, and historical monuments, as well as various sectarian organizations.\\r\\nShinto is the largest religion in Japan, practiced by nearly 80% of the population, yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves as \\"Shintoists\\" in surveys.[22] According to surveys carried out in 2006 and 2008 show that 3% to 3.9% of the population of Japan are members of Shinto sects and derived religions.[23]\\r\\nMuism (\\"religion of the Mu\\")[24][25] or sometimes Sinism (Shingyo, \\"religion of the gods\\", with shin being the Korean character derivative of the Hanja),[26] encompasses a variety of indigenous religious beliefs and practices of the Korean people, the Korean sphere and the Korean diaspora.[27] In contemporary South Korea, the most used term is Muism and a shaman is known as a mudang (??, ). The role of the mudang, usually a woman, is to act as intermediary between a spirit entity, spirits or gods and human beings.\\r\\nWomen are enlisted by those who want the help of the spirit world. Shamans hold gut, or services, in order to gain good fortune for clients, cure illnesses by exorcising negative or 'bad' spirits that cling to people, or propitiate local or village gods. Such services are also held to guide the spirit of a deceased person to higher realms. Today this religion is a minority, but has in recent years seen a resurgence.[28]\\r\\nZoroastrianism was once the state religion of the Persian Empire, but is now a minority mostly found in India and Iran. It worships a monotheistic god, Ahura Mazda, and was founded by Zoroaster. Zoroastrianism is a religion and philosophy based on the teachings of prophet Zoroaster (also known as Zarathustra, in Avestan), probably founded some time before the 6th century BC. The term Zoroastrianism is, in general usage, essentially synonymous with Mazdaism, i.e., the worship of Ahura Mazda, exalted by Zoroaster as the supreme divine authority.\\r\\nIn Zoroastrianism, the Creator Ahura Mazda is all good, and no evil originates from Him. Thus, in Zoroastrianism good and evil have distinct sources, with evil (druj) trying to destroy the creation of Mazda (asha), and good trying to sustain it. Mazda is not immanent in the world, and His creation is represented by the Amesha Spentas and the host of other Yazatas, through whom the works of God are evident to humanity, and through whom worship of Mazda is ultimately directed. The most important texts of the religion are those of the Avesta, of which a significant portion has been lost, and mostly only the liturgies of which have survived. The lost portions are known of only through references and brief quotations in the later works of (primarily) the 9th-11th centuries.\\r\\nThe total number of currently practicing adherents of Zoroastrianism is unknown. A 2004 estimate gives a range of 124,000 to 190,000,[29] roughly half of them in India (the Parsi and Irani groups).\\r\\nThe largest number of Zoroastrians in Asia can be found in India; according to the 2001 census, they amounted 69,000.[30] In Iran, there were some 25,000 according to the 2011 census.[31] In 2012, the numbers for Zoroastrians were; India (61,000), Iran (15,000 / 22,271), United States (14,405), Canada (6,442), Great Britain (5,500), Australia (2,577), Persian Gulf Countries (1,900) Pakistan (1,675), Singapore (372).[32]\\r\\nShamanism and Animism have historically been practised in Asia, and is still practiced in most of Asia.[33][34][35]\\r\\n[36][37]\\r\\nJudaism is the predominant religion in Israel (75.6%), which has a nominal Jewish population of about 6.1 million,[38]\\r\\nOutside of Israel there are small diaspora communities of Jewish people living in Turkey (17,400),[39] Azerbaijan (9,100),[40] Iran (8,756),[41] India (5,000) and Uzbekistan (4,000).[42]\\r\\nChristianity is a widespread minority religion in Asia with more than 286 million adherents according to Pew Research Center in 2010,[44] and nearly 364 million according to Britannica Book of the Year 2014.[45] constituting around 12.6% of the total population of Asia.\\r\\nOnly six countries are predominantly Christian: Asian Russia which is predominantly the Russian Orthodox Church?;Cyprus, which is predominantly Orthodox; the Philippines, which is the third-largest Roman Catholic nation in the world;[46] Timor Leste, which is the most overwhelming Christian (99.6%) and Roman Catholic nation in Asia (97.6%)[47]?; Armenia, which was the first state to adopt a Christian denomination as its state religion; and Georgia. Christianity also accounts for 29.2% of South Korea's population (54.5% of its religious population) and is now the predominant religion in South Korea, Christianity is also a large minority religion in Lebanon accounting for 40% of its population.[48] Christianity is also a large minority religion in Kazakhstan (26%),[49] Singapore (18.3%),[50] and Kyrgyzstan (17%).\\r\\nAsian countries with large Christian populations are Philippines (84 million),[46] China (68 million),[51] India (24 million),[52] Indonesia (23 million), Kazakhstan (16.5 million), South Korea (15 million), Vietnam (7 million),[53] Georgia (4.6 million),[54] Armenia (3.2 million),[55] Malaysia (2.6 million),[56] Japan (2.5 million), Pakistan (2.5 million),[57] Uzbekistan (2.5 million),[58] Syria (1.8 million),[59] Sri Lanka (1.5 million)[60], East Timor (1.2 million)[47] and Taiwan (one million).[61]\\r\\nThere are still large ancient communities of Middle Eastern Christians and Arab Christians in Lebanon, Iraq, Iran,[62] Turkey,[63] Syria, Jordan, Israel and Palestine numbering more than 3 million in West Asia. There are also a large populations of expatriate workers which include a sizeable Christian communities live in Arabian Peninsula numbering more than 3 million.[64]\\r\\nA 2015 study estimates about 6,968,500 Muslims convert to Christianity in Asia, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.[65]\\r\\nIslam is the largest religion in Asia with approx. 1.1 billion adherents.[66]Islam is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion articulated by the Qur'an, a book considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God (Arabic: ???? Allh) and by the teachings and normative example (called the Sunnah and composed of hadith) of Muhammad, considered by them to be the last prophet of God. South Asia and Southeast Asia are home of the most populous Muslim countries, with Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh having more than 100 million adherents each. According to U.S. government figures, in 2006 there were 20 million Muslims in China. In the Western Asia, the non-Arab countries of Iran and Turkey are the largest Muslim-majority countries. In South Asia, Pakistan and Bangladesh are the countries with the largest Muslim-majority. In Central Asia, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan are the countries with the largest Muslim-majority.\\r\\nIndonesia is 87 percent Muslim and is the country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Pakistan is 97 percent Muslim, Bangladesh is 90 percent Muslim. India's Muslim population is 14.2% of the total, approximately 190 million people.[67] Around 6-11 percent, some 6 - 12 million people in the Philippines are Muslim.[68][69][70][71][72] Thailand's Muslims make up 4.6 percent of the population, or approximately 3 million people.[73] Also Sri Lanka's Muslims make up 10 percent of the population, or approximately 2.5 million people\\r\\nBangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Kazakhstan, Qatar, Kuwait, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Maldives, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Yemen, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Lebanon are the 23 Muslim majority states in Asia\\r\\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, a minority Muslim sect, originated on the Asian continent in 1889 in Qadian, India. The community had 10 million members as of the 1980s. As of 2008, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has been established in all Asian countries except for Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia and North Korea. Ahmadis are most persecuted in Asia, particularly in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia.\\r\\nThe Bah' Faith is an Abrahamic religion although it is quite different from Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. It was so founded by Bah'u'llh in what was then Persia (also known as Iran). Today the largest national population of Bah's is in India with between 1.7 million[74] to 3.2 million,[75] where there is also the Lotus Temple. Significant populations are found in many countries including Vietnam and Malaysia where \\"about 1%\\", some 260,000, of the population are Bah's.[76] In other places, like Kazakhstan there are 25 Local Spiritual Assemblies.[77]\\r\\nIn modern-day Iran, the religion is severely persecuted (see Persecution of Bah's). In neighboring Turkmenistan, Bah' Faith is effectively banned,[78] and individuals have had their homes raided for Bah' literature.[79] For further information, see Bah' Statistics for Asia and Category:Bah' Faith by country.\\r\\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey in 2012 religiously unaffiliated (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 21.2% of Asia population.[80] According to the same survey, the religiously unaffiliated are the majority of the population in four Asian countries/territories: North Korea (71%), Japan (57%), Hong Kong (56%), and Mainland China (52%).[80]\\r\\nOther sources say that in the People's Republic of China, 59% of the population claim to be non-religious.[81] However, this percentage may be significantly greater (up to 80%) or smaller (down to 30%) in reality, because some Chinese define religion differently. Some Chinese define religion as practicing customs (which may be done for cultural or traditional reasons), while others define it as actually consciously believing their religion will lead to post-mortem salvation or reincarnation. A Dentsu statistic states that 46% of Vietnamese and 51% of Japanese are irreligious.[82]","input":"What is the most common religion in southeast asia?"},{"output":"1 July 1997","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong,[1][2][3] commonly known as the handover of Hong Kong (or simply \\"the Handover\\", also \\"the Return\\" in mainland China) was the transition of control over the former British colony of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997. The returned territory comprised Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula, which were respectively ceded to Britain in 1842 and 1860, as well as the New Territories, which were leased for 99 years from 1898. The transfer was arranged to coincide with the expiration of this lease on the previous day, 30 June 1997. This event marked the end of British rule in Hong Kong, and is regarded by some as the end of the British Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Kingdom obtained control over portions of Hong Kong's territory through three treaties with Qing China:\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the finite nature of the New Territories lease, this portion of the colony was developed just as rapidly as, and became highly integrated with, the rest of Hong Kong. By the time of serious negotiations over the future status of Hong Kong in the 1980s, it was thought impractical to separate the ceded territories and return only the New Territories to China. In addition, with the scarcity of land and natural resources in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, large-scale infrastructure investments had been made in the New Territories, with break-evens lying well past 30 June 1997.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the People's Republic of China obtained its seat in the United Nations as a result of the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 in 1971, it began to act diplomatically on the sovereignty issues of Hong Kong and Macau. In March 1972, the Chinese UN representative, Huang Hua, wrote to the United Nations Decolonization Committee to state the position of the Chinese government:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same year, on 8 November, the United Nations General Assembly passed the resolution on removing Hong Kong and Macau from the official list of colonies.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 1979 the Governor of Hong Kong, Murray MacLehose, paid his first official visit to the People's Republic of China (PRC), taking the initiative to raise the question of Hong Kong's sovereignty with Deng Xiaoping.[6]  Without clarifying and establishing the official position of the PRC government, the arranging of real estate leases and loans agreements in Hong Kong within the next 18 years would become difficult.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to concerns over land leases in the New Territories, MacLehose proposed that British administration of the whole of Hong Kong, as opposed to sovereignty, be allowed to continue after 1997.[7] He also proposed that contracts include the phrase \\"for so long as the Crown administers the territory\\".[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, as early as the mid-1970s, Hong Kong had faced additional risks raising loans for large-scale infrastructure projects such as its Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system and a new airport. Caught unprepared, Deng asserted the necessity of Hong Kong's return to China, upon which Hong Kong would be given special status by the PRC government.\\r\\n\\r\\nMacLehose's visit to the PRC raised the curtain on the issue of Hong Kong's sovereignty: Britain was made aware of the PRC's aspiration to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong and began to make arrangements accordingly to ensure the sustenance of her interests within the territory, as well as initiating the creation of a withdrawal plan in case of emergency.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree years later, Deng received the former British Prime Minister Edward Heath, who had been dispatched as the special envoy of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to establish an understanding of the PRC's view with regards to the question of Hong Kong; during their meeting, Deng outlined his plans to make the territory a special economic zone, which would retain its capitalist system under Chinese sovereignty.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same year, Edward Youde, who succeeded MacLehose as the 26th Governor of Hong Kong, led a delegation of five Executive Councillors to London, including Chung Sze-yuen, Lydia Dunn, and Roger Lobo.[10] Chung presented their position on the sovereignty of Hong Kong to Thatcher, encouraging her to take into consideration the interests of the native Hong Kong population in her upcoming visit to China.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn light of the increasing openness of the PRC government and economic reforms on the mainland, the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sought the PRC's agreement to a continued British presence in the territory.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the PRC took a contrary position: not only did the PRC wish for the New Territories, on lease until 1997, to be placed under the PRC's jurisdiction, it also refused to recognize the \\"unfair and unequal treaties\\" under which Hong Kong Island and Kowloon had been ceded to Britain in perpetuity.[12] Consequently, the PRC recognized only the British administration in Hong Kong, but not British sovereignty.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wake of Governor MacLehose's visit, Britain and the PRC established initial diplomatic contact for further discussions of the Hong Kong question, paving the way for Thatcher's first visit to the PRC in September 1982.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nMargaret Thatcher, in discussion with Deng Xiaoping, reiterated the validity of an extension of the lease of Hong Kong territory, particularly in light of binding treaties, including the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, the Convention of Peking in 1856, and the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory signed in 1890.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response, Deng Xiaoping cited clearly the lack of room for compromise on the question of sovereignty over Hong Kong; the PRC, as the successor of Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China on the mainland, would recover the entirety of the New Territories, Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. China considered treaties about Hong Kong as unequal and ultimately refused to accept any outcome that would indicate permanent loss of sovereignty over Hong Kong's area, whatever wording the former treaties had.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring talks with Thatcher, China planned to invade and seize Hong Kong if the negotiations set off unrest in the colony. Thatcher later said that Deng told her bluntly that China could easily take Hong Kong by force, stating that \\"I could walk in and take the whole lot this afternoon\\", to which she replied that \\"there is nothing I could do to stop you, but the eyes of the world would now know what China is like\\".[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter her visit with Deng in Beijing, Thatcher was received in Hong Kong as the first British Prime Minister to set foot on the territory whilst in office. At a press conference, Thatcher re-emphasised the validity of the three treaties, asserting the need for countries to respect treaties on universal terms: \\"There are three treaties in existence; we stick by our treaties unless we decide on something else. At the moment, we stick by our treaties.\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, at the 5th session of the 5th National People's Congress, the constitution was amended to include a new Article 31 which stated that the country might establish Special Administrative Regions (SARs) when necessary.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe additional Article would hold tremendous significance in settling the question of Hong Kong and later Macau, putting into social consciousness the concept of \\"One country, two systems\\". The concept would prove useful to deploy until the territories were secured and conditions were ripe for its gradual abrogation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few months after Thatcher's visit to Beijing, the PRC government had yet to open negotiations with the British government regarding the sovereignty of Hong Kong.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly before the initiation of sovereignty talks, Governor Youde declared his intention to represent the population of Hong Kong at the negotiations. This statement sparked a strong response from the PRC, prompting Deng Xiaoping to denounce talk of \\"the so-called 'three-legged stool'\\", which implied that Hong Kong was a party to talks on its future, alongside Beijing and London.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the preliminary stage of the talks, the British government proposed an exchange of sovereignty for administration and the implementation of a British administration post-handover.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe PRC government refused, contending that the notions of sovereignty and administration were inseparable, and although it recognised Macau as a \\"Chinese territory under Portuguese administration\\", this was only temporary.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, during informal exchanges between 1979 and 1981, the PRC had proposed a \\"Macau solution\\" in Hong Kong, under which it would remain under British administration at China's discretion.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, this had previously been rejected following the 1967 Leftist riots, with the then Governor, David Trench, claiming the leftists' aim was to leave the UK without effective control, or \\"to Macau us\\".[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conflict that arose at that point of the negotiations ended the possibility of further negotiation. During the reception of former British Prime Minister Edward Heath during his sixth visit to the PRC, Deng Xiaoping commented quite clearly on the impossibility of exchanging sovereignty for administration, declaring an ultimatum: the British government must modify or give up its position or the PRC will announce its resolution of the issue of Hong Kong sovereignty unilaterally.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1983, Typhoon Ellen ravaged Hong Kong, causing great amounts of damage to both life and property.[21] The Hong Kong dollar plummeted on Black Saturday, and the Financial Secretary John Bremridge publicly associated the economic uncertainty with the instability of the political climate.[22] In response, the PRC government condemned Britain through the press for \\"playing the economic card\\" in order to achieve their ends: to intimidate the PRC into conceding to British demands.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Youde with nine members of the Hong Kong Executive Council travelled to London to discuss with Prime Minister Thatcher the crisis of confidencethe problem with morale among the people of Hong Kong arising from the ruination of the Sino-British talks. The session concluded with Thatcher's writing of a letter addressed to the PRC Premier Zhao Ziyang.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the letter, she expressed Britain's willingness to explore arrangements optimising the future prospects of Hong Kong while utilising the PRC's proposals as a foundation. Furthermore, and perhaps most significantly, she expressed Britain's concession on its position of a continued British presence in the form of an administration post-handover.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo rounds of negotiations were held in October and November. On the sixth round of talks in November, Britain formally conceded its intentions of either maintaining a British administration in Hong Kong or seeking some form of co-administration with the PRC, and showed its sincerity in discussing PRC's proposal on the 1997 issue. Obstacles were cleared.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon Keswick, chairman of Jardine Matheson & Co., said they were not pulling out of Hong Kong, but a new holding company would be established in Bermuda instead.[24] The PRC took this as yet another plot by the British. The Hong Kong government explained that it had been informed about the move only a few days before the announcement. The government would not and could not stop the company from making a business decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as the atmosphere of the talks was becoming cordial, members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong felt impatient at the long-running secrecy over the progress of Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue. A motion, tabled by legislator Roger Lobo, declared \\"This Council deems it essential that any proposals for the future of Hong Kong should be debated in this Council before agreement is reached\\", was passed unanimously.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe PRC attacked the motion furiously, referring to it as \\"somebody's attempt to play the three-legged stool trick again\\".[26] At length, the PRC and Britain initiated the Joint Declaration on the question of Hong Kong's future in Beijing. Zhou Nan, the then PRC Deputy Foreign Minister and leader of the negotiation team, and Sir Richard Evans, British Ambassador to Beijing and leader of the team, signed respectively on behalf of the two governments.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed by the Prime Ministers of the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom governments on 19 December 1984 in Beijing. The Declaration entered into force with the exchange of instruments of ratification on 27 May 1985 and was registered by the People's Republic of China and United Kingdom governments at the United Nations on 12 June 1985.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Joint Declaration, the People's Republic of China Government stated that it had decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong (including Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories) with effect from 1 July 1997 and the United Kingdom Government declared that it would restore Hong Kong to the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997. In the document, the People's Republic of China Government also declared its basic policies regarding Hong Kong.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn accordance with the \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" principle agreed between the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China, the socialist system of the People's Republic of China would not be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and Hong Kong's previous capitalist system and its way of life would remain unchanged for a period of 50 years. This would have left Hong Kong unchanged until 2047. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Joint Declaration provided that these basic policies should be stipulated in the Hong Kong Basic Law. The ceremony of the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration took place at 18:00, 19 December 1984 at the Western Main Chamber of the Great Hall of the People. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office at first proposed a list of 60-80 Hong Kong people to attend the ceremony. The number was finally extended to 101.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe list included Hong Kong government officials, members of the Legislative and Executive Councils, chairmen of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered Bank, prominent businessmen such as Li Ka-shing, Pao Yue-kong and Fok Ying-tung, and also Martin Lee Chu-ming and Szeto Wah.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Basic Law was drafted by a Drafting Committee composed of members from both Hong Kong and Mainland China. A Basic Law Consultative Committee formed purely by Hong Kong people was established in 1985 to canvas views in Hong Kong on the drafts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first draft was published in April 1988, followed by a five-month public consultation exercise. The second draft was published in February 1989, and the subsequent consultation period ended in October 1989.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Basic Law was formally promulgated on 4 April 1990 by the NPC, together with the designs for the flag and emblem of the HKSAR. Some members of the Basic Law drafting committee were ousted by Beijing following the 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, after voicing views supporting the students.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Basic Law was said to be a mini-constitution drafted with the participation of Hong Kong people. The political system had been the most controversial issue in the drafting of the Basic Law. The special issue sub-group adopted the political model put forward by Louis Cha. This \\"mainstream\\" proposal was criticised for being too conservative.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Clauses 158 and 159 of the Basic Law, powers of interpretation and amendment of the Basic Law are vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the National People's Congress, respectively. Hong Kong's people have limited influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Executive Councillors and the Legislative Councillors unexpectedly held an urgent meeting, in which they agreed unanimously that the British Government should give the people of Hong Kong the right of abode in the United Kingdom.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 10,000 Hong Kong residents rushed to Central in order to get an application form for residency in the United Kingdom. On the eve of the deadline, over 100,000 lined up overnight for a BN(O) application form. While mass migration did begin well before 1989, the event did lead to the peak migration year in 1992 with 66,000 leaving.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany citizens were pessimistic towards the future of Hong Kong and the transfer of the region's sovereignty. A tide of emigration, which was to last for no less than five years, broke out. At its peak, citizenship of small countries, such as Tonga, was also in great demand.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nSingapore, which also had a predominantly Chinese population, was another popular destination, with the country's Commission (now Consulate-General) being besieged by anxious Hong Kong residents.[31] By September 1989, 6000 applications for residency in Singapore had been approved by the Commission.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome consul staff were suspended or arrested for their corrupt behaviour in granting immigration visas. In April 1997, the acting immigration officer at the US Consulate-General, James DeBates, was suspended after his wife was arrested for smuggling of Chinese migrants into the United States.[33] The previous year, his predecessor, Jerry Stuchiner, had been arrested for smuggling forged Honduran passports into the territory before being sentenced to 40 months in prison.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada (Vancouver and Toronto), United Kingdom (London, Glasgow, and Manchester), Australia (Sydney and Melbourne), and the United States (San Francisco and New York) were, by and large, the most popular destinations. The United Kingdom devised the British Nationality Selection Scheme, granting 50,000 families British citizenship under the British Nationality Act (Hong Kong) 1990.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nVancouver was among the most popular destinations, earning the nickname of  \\"Hongcouver\\".[36] Richmond, a suburb of Vancouver, was nicknamed \\"Little Hong Kong\\".[37]  All in all, from the start of the settlement of the negotiation in 1984 to 1997, nearly 1 million people emigrated; consequently, Hong Kong suffered serious loss of capital.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nChris Patten became the last governor of Hong Kong. This was regarded as a turning point in Hong Kong's history. Unlike his predecessors, Patten was not a diplomat, but a career politician and former Member of Parliament. He introduced democratic reforms which pushed PRCÿBritish relations to a standstill and affected the negotiations for a smooth handover.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatten introduced a package of electoral reforms in the Legislative Council. These reforms proposed to enlarge the electorate, thus making voting in the Legislative Council more democratic. This move posed significant changes because Hong Kong citizens would have the power to make decisions regarding their future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe handover ceremony was held at the new wing of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on the night of 30 June 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal British guest was Prince Charles, who read a farewell speech on behalf of the Queen. The newly elected Labour Prime Minister, Tony Blair, the Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, the departing Governor Chris Patten and General Sir Charles Guthrie, Chief of the Defence Staff, also attended.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepresenting the People's Republic of China were the President, Jiang Zemin, the Premier, Li Peng, and the first Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. The event was broadcast around the world.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Hong Kong government proposed a grand \\"Rose Garden Project\\" to restore faith and solidarity among the residents.[128] As the construction of the new Hong Kong International Airport would extend well after the handover, Governor Wilson met PRC Premier Li Peng in Beijing to ease the mind of the PRC government.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe communist press published stories that the project was an evil plan to bleed Hong Kong dry before the handover, leaving the territory in serious debt.[130] After three years of negotiations, Britain and the PRC finally reached an agreement over the construction of the new airport, and signed a Memorandum of Understanding.[131] Removing hills and reclaiming land, it took only a few years to construct the new airport.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Walled City was originally a single fort built in the mid-19th century on the site of an earlier 17th century watch post on the Kowloon Peninsula of Hong Kong.[132] After the ceding of Hong Kong Island to Britain in 1842 (Treaty of Nanjing), Manchu Qing Dynasty authorities of China felt it necessary for them to establish a military and administrative post to rule the area and to check further British influence in the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1898 Convention which handed additional parts of Hong Kong (the New Territories) to Britain for 99 years excluded the Walled City, with a population of roughly 700. It stated that China could continue to keep troops there, so long as they did not interfere with Britain's temporary rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritain quickly went back on this unofficial part of the agreement, attacking Kowloon Walled City in 1899, only to find it deserted. They did nothing with it, or the outpost, and thus posed the question of Kowloon Walled City's ownership squarely up in the air. The outpost consisted of a yamen, as well as buildings which grew into low-lying, densely packed neighbourhoods from the 1890s to 1940s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enclave remained part of Chinese territory despite the turbulent events of the early 20th century that saw the fall of the Qing government, the establishment of the Republic of China and later, a Communist Chinese government (PRC).\\r\\n\\r\\nSquatters began to occupy the Walled City, resisting several attempts by Britain in 1948 to drive them out. The Walled City became a haven for criminals and drug addicts, as the Hong Kong Police had no right to enter the City and China refused maintainability. The 1949 foundation of the People's Republic of China added thousands of refugees to the population, many from Guangdong; by this time, Britain had had enough, and simply adopted a \\"hands-off\\" policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nA murder that occurred in Kowloon Walled City in 1959 set off a small diplomatic crisis, as the two nations each tried to get the other to accept responsibility for a vast tract of land now virtually ruled by anti-Manchurian Triads.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Joint Declaration in 1984, the PRC allowed British authorities to demolish the City and resettle its inhabitants. The mutual decision to tear down the walled city was made in 1987.[133] The government spent up to HK$ 3 billion to resettle the residents and shops.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome residents were not satisfied with the compensation, and some even obstructed the demolition in every possible way.[134] Ultimately, everything was settled, and the Walled City became a park.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nRennie's Mill got its name from a Canadian businessman named Alfred Herbert Rennie, who established a flour mill at Junk Bay. The business failed, and Rennie hanged himself there in 1908. The incident gave the Chinese name for the site Tiu Keng Leng (?X), meaning \\"Hanging (neck) Ridge\\". The name was later formally changed to similar-sounding Tiu King Leng (?X) because it was regarded as inauspicious.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1950s the (British) Government of Hong Kong settled a considerable number of refugees from Chinaformer Nationalist soldiers and other Kuomintang supportersat Rennie's Mill, following the Chinese civil war. For many years the area was a Kuomintang enclave known as \\"Little Taiwan\\", with the flag of the Republic of China flying, its own school system and practically off-limits to the Royal Hong Kong Police Force.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996 the Hong Kong government finally forcibly evicted Rennie's Mill's residents, ostensibly to make room for new town developments, as part of the Tseung Kwan O New Town, but widely understood to be a move to please the Communist Chinese government before Hong Kong reverted to Communist Chinese rule in 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the eviction, Rennie's Mill could be reached by the winding, hilly and narrow Po Lam Road South. At that time, Rennie's Mill's only means of public transport were the routes 90 and 290 of Kowloon Motor Bus, which were operated by minibuses, and by water transport.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan promulgated the Laws and Regulations Regarding Hong Kong & Macao Affairs on 2 April 1997 by Presidential Order, and the Executive Yuan on 19 June 1997 ordered the provisions pertaining to Hong Kong to take effect on 1 July 1997.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United StatesÿHong Kong Policy Act or more commonly known as the Hong Kong Policy Act (P.L no. 102-383m 106 Stat. 1448) is a 1992 act enacted by the United States Congress.  It allows the United States to continue to treat Hong Kong separately from China for matters concerning trade export and economics control after the handover.[137]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States was represented by then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at the Hong Kong handover ceremony.[138] However, she partially boycotted it in protest of China's dissolution of the democratically elected Hong Kong legislature.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nScholars have begun to study the complexities of the transfer as shown in the popular media, such as films, television and video and online games.  For example, Hong Kong director Fruit Chan made a  sci-fi thriller The Midnight After (2014) that stressed the sense of loss and alienation represented by survivors in an apocalyptic Hong Kong. Chan infuses a political agenda in the film by playing on Hong Kongers' collective anxiety towards communist China.[140]  Yiman Wang has argued that America has viewed China through the prisms of films from Shanghai and Hong Kong, with a recent emphasis on futuristic disaster films set in Hong Kong after the transfer goes awry.[141]","input":"When did britain give hong kong to china?"},{"output":"the 7th century BCE","context":"Book burning is the ritual destruction by fire of books or other written materials, usually carried out in a public context. The burning of books represents an element of censorship and usually proceeds from a cultural, religious, or political opposition to the materials in question.[1]\\r\\nIn some cases, the destroyed works are irreplaceable and their burning constitutes a severe loss to cultural heritage. Examples include the burning of books and burying of scholars under China's Qin Dynasty (213ÿ210 BCE), the burning of the Library of Alexandria (c. 49), the obliteration of the Library of Baghdad (1258), the destruction of Aztec codices by Itzcoatl (1430s), and the burning of Maya codices on the order of bishop Diego de Landa (1562).\\r\\nIn other cases, such as the Nazi book burnings, other copies of the destroyed books survive, but the instance of book burning becomes emblematic of a harsh and oppressive regime which is seeking to censor or silence an aspect of a nation's culture.\\r\\nBook burning can be an act of contempt for the book's contents or author, and the act is intended to draw wider public attention to this opinion. Examples include the burning of Wilhelm Reich's books by the FDA and the 2010 Qur'an-burning controversy.\\r\\nArt destruction is related to book burning, both because it might have similar cultural, religious, or political connotations, and because in various historical cases books and artworks were destroyed at the same time.\\r\\nIn modern times, other forms of media, such as phonograph records, video tapes, and CDs have also been burned, shredded, or crushed.\\r\\nWhen the burning is widespread and systematic, destruction of books and media can become a significant component of cultural genocide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe burning of books has a long history as a tool wielded by authorities both secular and religious, in efforts to suppress dissenting or heretical views that are perceived as posing a threat to the prevailing order.\\r\\nAccording to the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), in the 7th century BCE King Jehoiakim of Judah burned part of a scroll Baruch ben Neriah had written at prophet Jeremiah's dictation (Jeremiah 36).\\r\\nQin Shi Huang, first emperor of Qin Dynasty, ordered a Burning of books and burying of scholars in 213 BC and burial alive of 460 Confucian scholars in 210 BC in order to stay in the throne. Some of these books were written in Shang Xiang, a superior school founded in 2208 BC. The event caused the loss of many philosophical treatises of the Hundred Schools of Thought. The official philosophy of government (\\"legalism\\") survived.\\r\\nAnd many that believed, came and confessed and shewed their deeds. Many of them also which used curious arts, brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.[2]\\r\\nAfter the First Council of Nicea (325 AD), Roman emperor Constantine the Great issued an edict against nontrinitarian Arians which included a prescription for systematic book-burning:\\r\\n\\"In addition, if any writing composed by Arius should be found, it should be handed over to the flames, so that not only will the wickedness of his teaching be obliterated, but nothing will be left even to remind anyone of him. And I hereby make a public order, that if someone should be discovered to have hidden a writing composed by Arius, and not to have immediately brought it forward and destroyed it by fire, his penalty shall be death. As soon as he is discovered in this offense, he shall be submitted for capital punishment.....\\"[3]\\r\\nAccording to Elaine Pagels, \\"In AD 367, Athanasius, the zealous bishop of Alexandria... issued an Easter letter in which he demanded that Egyptian monks destroy all such unacceptable writings, except for those he specifically listed as 'acceptable' even 'canonical'a list that constitutes the present 'New Testament'\\".[4] (Pagels cites Athanasius's Paschal letter (letter 39) for 367 AD, which prescribes a canon but does not explicitly order monks to destroy excluded works.[5][original research?]) Heretical texts do not turn up as palimpsests, scraped clean and overwritten, as do many texts of Classical antiquity. According to author Rebecca Knuth, multitudes of early Christian texts have been as thoroughly \\"destroyed\\" as if they had been publicly burnt.[6]\\r\\nThe stories surrounding this loss include:\\r\\n\\"Much of its downfall was gradual, often bureaucratic, and by comparison to our cultural imaginings, somewhat petty.\\"[8] (Compare: El-Abbadi, M.

There were many[quantify] books written by the Aztecs in existence at the time of the Spanish conquest of Yucatn in the 16th century.[citation needed] However, most were destroyed by the Conquistadors and the Catholic priests, with the exception of the work of the priest Bartolome de la Casas. In particular, many books in Yucatn were ordered destroyed by Bishop Diego de Landa in July 1562. De Landa wrote: \\"We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they (the Maya) regretted to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction.\\" Ironically, most of the books that were destroyed by the Europeans were biased and based upon the Aztec people's version of the history of the region. The Aztecs had previously conquered the area and destroyed many of the Mayan books and documents.\\r\\nThe Library of Congress was founded in 1800, 24 years after the United States gained its independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1814, 3,000 books from the Library of Congress were used by the British forces to burn down the US Capitol during the Burning of Washington. Although there were dissenting voices to this wanton destruction, the conflagration was motivated by a strong desire on the part of the British to humiliate the Americans.[15]\\r\\nAnthony Comstock's New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, founded in 1873, inscribed book burning on its seal, as a worthy goal to be achieved. Comstock's total accomplishment in a long and influential career is estimated to have been the destruction of some 15?tons of books, 284,000?pounds of plates for printing such 'objectionable' books, and nearly 4,000,000 pictures. All of this material was defined as \\"lewd\\" by Comstock's very broad definition of the termwhich he and his associates successfully lobbied the United States Congress to incorporate in the Comstock Law.[16]\\r\\nMain: Nazi book burnings\\r\\nThe Nazi government decreed broad grounds for burning material:\\r\\n...which acts subversively on our future or strikes at the root of German thought, the German home and the driving forces of our people...\\r\\nIn the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, a stash of thousands of papyrus scrolls (the Herculaneum papyri) in a villa were burnt to carbon by a pyroclastic flow. This incident had the unusual effect of preserving them in a readable form (though with difficulty). Under normal circumstances, a climate moist as Italy's would have rotted the scrolls long ago.\\r\\nIn 1588, the exiled English Catholic William Cardinal Allen wrote \\"An Admonition to the Nobility and People of England\\", a work sharply attacking Queen Elizabeth I. It was to be published in Spanish-occupied England in the event of the Spanish Armada succeeding in its invasion. Upon the defeat of the Armada, Allen carefully consigned his publication to the fire, and we only know of it through one of Elizabeth's spies, who had stolen a copy.[18]\\r\\nThe Hassidic Rabbi Nachman of Breslov is reported to have written a book which he himself burned in 1808. To this day, his followers mourn \\"The Burned Book\\" and seek in their Rabbi's surviving writings for clues as to what the lost volume contained and why it was destroyed.[19]\\r\\nCarlo Goldoni is known to have burned his first play, a tragedy called Amalasunta, when encountering unfavorable criticism.\\r\\nNikolai Gogol burned the second half of his magnum opus Dead Souls, having come under the influence of a priest who persuaded him that his work was sinful; Gogol later described this as a mistake.\\r\\nIn the 1870s Tchaikovsky destroyed the manuscript full score of his first opera, The Voyevoda. During the Soviet period The Voyevoda was posthumously reconstructed from surviving orchestral and vocal parts and the composer's sketches.\\r\\nAfter Hector Hugh Munro (better known by the pen name Saki) was killed in World War I in November 1916, his sister Ethel destroyed most of his papers.\\r\\nJoe Shuster, who together with Jerry Siegel created the fictional superhero Superman, in 1938 burned the first Superman story when under the impression that it would not find a publisher.\\r\\nIn Catholic hagiography, Saint Vincent of Saragossa is mentioned as having been offered his life on condition that he consign Scripture to the fire; he refused and was martyred. He is often depicted holding the book which he protected with his life.\\r\\nAnother book-saving Catholic Saint is the Tenth Century St. Wiborada. She is credited with having predicted in 925 a Hungarian invasion of her region in Switzerland. Her warning allowed the priests and religious of St. Gall and St. Magnus to hide their books and wine and escape into caves in nearby hills.[20] Wiborada herself refused to escape and was killed by the marauders, being later canonized. In art, she is commonly represented holding a book to signify the library she saved, and is considered a patron saint of libraries and librarians.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the Battle of Monte Cassino in the World War II, two German officers - Viennese-born Lt.Col. Julius Schlegel (a Roman Catholic), and Captain Maximilian Becker (a Protestant) - had the foresight to transfer the Monte Cassino archives to the Vatican. Otherwise the archives - containing a vast number of documents relating to the 1500-years' history of the Abbey as well as some 1,400 irreplaceable manuscript codices, chiefly patristic and historical - would have been destroyed in the Allied air bombing which almost completely destroyed the Abbey shortly afterwards. Also saved by the two officers' prompt action were the collections of the Keats-Shelley Memorial House in Rome which had been sent to the Abbey for safety in December 1942.\\r\\nThe Sarajevo Haggadah - one of the oldest and most valuable Jewish illustrated manuscripts, with immense historical and cultural value - was hidden from the Nazis and their Ustashe collaborators by Dervi? Korkut, chief librarian of the National Museum in Sarajevo. At risk to his own life, Korkut smuggled the Haggadah out of Sarajevo and gave it for safekeeping to a Muslim cleric in Zenica, where it was hidden until the end of the war under the floorboards of either a mosque or a Muslim home. The Haggdah again survived destruction during the wars which followed the Breakup of Yugoslavia[21]\\r\\nIn 1940's France, a group of anti-fascist exiles created a Library of Burned Books which housed all the books that Adolf Hitler had destroyed. This library contained copies of titles that were burned. These book burnings from the Nazis was an idea to help cleanse German culture of Jewish and foreign influences such as pacifist and decadent literature. The Nazis were going to make a \\"museum\\" of Judaism once the Final Solution was complete to house certain books that were saved by the Nazis themselves.[22]\\r\\nWhen Virgil died, he left instructions that his manuscript of the Aeneid was to be burnt, as it was a draft version with uncorrected faults and not a final version for release. However, this instruction was ignored. It is mainly to the Aeneid, published in this \\"imperfect\\" form, that Virgil owes his lasting fame ÿ and it is considered one of the great masterpieces of classical literature as a whole.\\r\\nBefore his death, Franz Kafka wrote to his friend and literary executor Max Brod: \\"Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread.\\"[23] Brod overrode Kafka's wishes, believing that Kafka had given these directions to him, specifically, because Kafka knew he would not honour them ÿ Brod had told him as much. Had Brod carried out Kafka's instructions, virtually the whole of Kafka's work ÿ except for a few short stories published in his lifetime ÿ would have been lost forever. Most critics, at the time and up to the present, justify Brod's decision.\\r\\nA similar case concerns the noted American poet Emily Dickinson, who died in 1886 and left to her sister Lavinia the instruction of burning all her papers. Lavinia Dickinson did burn almost all of her sister's correspondences, but interpreted the will as not including the forty notebooks and loose sheets, all filled with almost 1800 poems; these Lavinia saved and began to publish the poems that year. Had Lavinia Dickinson been more strict in carrying out her sister's will, all but a small handful of Emily Dickinson's poetic work would have been lost.[24][25]\\r\\nBiblioclasm still occurs. All over the world schools and libraries have been destroyed in recent years. Despite the act of destroying books being condemned by the majority of society, people still participate on small and large scale.\\r\\nIn Azerbaijan, when a modified Latin alphabet was adopted, books published in Arabic script were burned, especially in the late 1920s and 1930s.[26] The texts were not limited to the Quran; medical and historical manuscripts were also destroyed.[27]\\r\\nBook burnings were organised regularly in Nazi Germany in the 1930s by stormtroopers to destroy degenerate works, especially by Jewish authors such as Thomas Mann, Marcel Proust and Karl Marx.\\r\\nIn the 1950s, over six tons of books by William Reich were burned in the U.S. under judicial orders.[28]\\r\\nIn Denmark, a comic book burning took place 23 June 1955. It was a bonfire consisting of comic books and on top of that a life size cardboard cutout of The Phantom.[29]\\r\\nKjell Ludvik Kvavik, a senior Norwegian official, had a penchant for removing maps and other pages from rare books and was noticed in January 1983 by a young college student. The student, Barbro Andenaes, reported the actions of the senior official to the superintendent of the reading room and then to the head librarian of the university library in Oslo. Hesitant to make public something that would greatly hurt the career of Kvavik even if the accusation proved false, media kept the name of the perpetrator quiet until his house was searched by police. The authorities seized 470 maps and prints as well as 112 books that Kvavik had illegally obtained. While this may not be the large scale, violent demonstration seen during wars, Kvavik's disregard for libraries and books shows that destruction of books on any scale can affect an entire country. Here, a senior official in the Norwegian government was disgraced and the University Library was refunded only a small portion of the costs it incurred from the loss and destruction of rare materials as well as the security changes that had to be made. In this case, the draw of personal profit and enhancing one's own collection was the cause of the defacement of rare books and maps. While the main goal was not destruction for destruction's sake, the resulting damage to the ephemera still carries weight within the library community.[30]\\r\\nThe annihilation of the Bosnian National and University Library in August 1992 was led by Serbian nationalist Ratko Mladi?. After firing incendiary shells on the library roof, Sarajevans attempted to save the books from the growing flames. As firefighters arrived to help, the nationalists began shooting bullets into the crowd, killing firefighters and cutting off supplies to stop the fire. As the onslaught continued, Bosnian soldiers continued their rescue efforts. The building burned. The Serbian nationalist purposefully targeted libraries and places of cultural significance in an effort to destroy the diverse history and Ottoman legacy within Bosnia. The nationalists laid waste to libraries, museums, and architectural treasures, and within just the National and University library, approximately 1.5 million volumes were lost, including almost 150,000 rare books.[31]\\r\\nIn 1984, Amsterdam's South African Institute was infiltrated by an organized group bent on drawing attention to the inequality of the apartheid. Well-organized and ensuring patrons of the library that no harm would come to them, group members systematically smashed microfiche machines and threw books into the nearby waterway. Indiscriminate of the content being destroyed, shelf after shelf was cleared of its contents until the group left. Staff members fished books from the water in hopes of salvaging the rare editions of travel books, documents about the Boer Wars, and contemporary materials both for and against apartheid. Many were destroyed by oil, ink, and paint that the anti-apartheid demonstrators had flung around the library. The world was outraged at the loss of knowledge that these demonstrators had caused, and instead of winning support and getting attention on the issue of apartheid, the international audience cried out against the actions at the Amsterdam's South African Institute. Some demonstrators came forward to explain that they believed the institute was pro-apartheid and that nothing was being done to change the status quo in South Africa.[32]\\r\\nThe advent of the digital age has resulted in an immense collection of written work being catalogued exclusively or primarily in digital form. The intentional deletion or removal of these works has been often referred to as a new form of book burning.[33]\\r\\nSome supporters have celebrated book burning cases in art and other media. Such is the bas-relief by Giovanni Battista Maini of The Burning of Heretical Books over a side door on the fa?ade of Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, which depicts the burning of 'heretical' books as a triumph of righteousness.[34]\\r\\nIn 1973, during the years of the Chilean fascist dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet, hundreds of books were burned as a way of repression and censorship of leftist literature.[35][36]\\r\\nA similar incident also occurred in Mullumbimby, New South Wales, Australia in 2009. Reported as \\"just like the ritual burning of books in Nazi Germany\\", a book-burning ceremony was held by students of the alleged cult Universal Medicine, an esoteric healing business owned by Serge Benhayon. Students were invited to throw their books onto the pyre. Most of the volumes were on Chinese medicine, kinesiology, acupuncture, homeopathy and other alternative healing modalities, all of which Benhayon has decreed \\"prana\\".[37]\\r\\nIn 1981, the Jaffna Public Library in Jaffna, Sri Lanka was burned down by Sinhalese police and paramilitaries during a pogrom against the minority Tamil population. At the time of its burning it contained almost 100,000 Tamil books and rare documents.[38]\\r\\nIn the Sikh religion, any copies of their sacred Guru, Guru Granth Sahib which are too badly damaged to be used, and any printer's waste which bears any of its text, are cremated. Such a cremation is called Agan Bhet, and is similar to that performed when cremating a deceased Sikh.[39][40][41][42]\\r\\nIn his 1821 play, Almansor, the German writer Heinrich Heinereferring to the burning of the Muslim holy book, the Qur'an, during the Spanish Inquisitionwrote, \\"Where they burn books, so too will they in the end burn human beings.\\" (\\"Dort, wo man Bcher verbrennt, verbrennt man auch am Ende Menschen.\\") Over a century later, Heine's own books were among the thousands of volumes that were torched by the Nazis in Berlin's Opernplatz, even while his poem Die Lorelei continued to be printed in German schoolbooks as \\"by an unknown author\\".[43] In Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the book deals with the concept of censorship by via burning books. It is said that Ray Bradbury wrote the book due to his concerns of literature being burned in America during the McCarthy era and as well, fearing that mass media would reduce the interest in reading books.[44]","input":"When did the practice of book burning start?"},{"output":"John Jay","context":" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Justice of the United States is the chief judge of the Supreme Court of the United States and thus the head of the United States federal court system, which functions as the judicial branch of the nation's federal government. The Chief Justice is one of nine Supreme Court justices; the other eight have the title Associate Justice.\\r\\nThe Chief Justice, as the highest judicial officer in the country, serves as a spokesperson for the federal government's judicial branch, and acts as a chief administrative officer for the federal courts. The Chief Justice is also head of the Judicial Conference of the United States, and in that capacity appoints the director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. By law, the Chief Justice is also a member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and by custom is elected chancellor of the board.\\r\\nThe Chief Justice leads the business of the Supreme Court and presides over oral arguments. When the court renders an opinion, the Chief Justicewhen in the majoritydecides who writes the court's opinion. The Chief Justice also has significant agenda-setting power over the court's meetings. In the case of an impeachment of a President of the United States, which has occurred twice, the Chief Justice presides over the trial in the U.S. Senate. Additionally, the presidential oath of office is typically administered by the Chief Justice (although the Constitution does not assign this duty to anyone in particular).\\r\\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 17 persons have served as chief justice. The first was John Jay (1789ÿ1795). The current chief justice is John Roberts (since 2005). FourEdward Douglass White, Charles Evans Hughes, Harlan Fiske Stone, and William Rehnquistwere previously confirmed for associate justice and subsequently confirmed for chief justice separately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Constitution does not explicitly establish an office of Chief Justice, but presupposes its existence with a single reference in Article I, Section 3, Clause 6: \\"When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.\\" Nothing more is said in the Constitution regarding the office. Article III, Section 1, which authorizes the establishment of the Supreme Court, refers to all members of the Court simply as \\"judges.\\" The Judiciary Act of 1789 created the distinctive titles of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\\r\\nIn 1866, at the urging of Salmon P. Chase, Congress restyled the chief justice's title to the current Chief Justice of the United States. The first person whose Supreme Court commission contained the modified title was Melville Fuller in 1888.[1] The associate justices' title was not altered in 1866, and remains as originally created.\\r\\nThe chief justice, like all federal judges, is nominated by the President and confirmed to office by the U.S. Senate. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution specifies that they \\"shall hold their Offices during good Behavior\\". This language means that the appointments are effectively for life, and that, once in office, a justice's tenure ends only when they die, retire, resign, or are removed from office through the impeachment process.\\r\\nThe salary of the chief justice is set by Congress; the current (2018) annual salary is $267,000, which is slightly higher than that of associate justices, which is $255,300.[2] The practice of appointing an individual to serve as chief justice is grounded in tradition; while the Constitution mandates that there be a chief justice, it is silent on the subject of how one is chosen and by whom. There is no specific constitutional prohibition against using another method to select the chief justice from among those justices properly appointed and confirmed to the Supreme Court. Constitutional law scholar Todd Pettys has proposed that presidential appointment of chief justices should be done away with, and replaced by a process that permits the Justices to select their own chief justice.[3]\\r\\nThree incumbent associate justices have been nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate as chief justice: Edward Douglass White in 1910, Harlan Fiske Stone in 1941, and William Rehnquist in 1986. A fourth, Abe Fortas, was nominated to the position in 1968, but not confirmed. As an associate justice does not have to resign his or her seat on the Court in order to be nominated as chief justice, Fortas remained an associate justice. Similarly, when associate justice William Cushing was nominated and confirmed as chief justice in January 1796, but declined the office, he too remained on the Court. Additionally, two former associate justices subsequently returned to service on the Court as chief justice. John Rutledge was the first. President Washington gave him a recess appointment in 1795. However, his subsequent nomination to the office was not confirmed by the Senate, and he left office and the Court. In 1933, former associate justice Charles Evans Hughes was confirmed as chief justice.\\r\\nAlong with his general responsibilities as a member of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice has several unique duties to fulfill.\\r\\nArticle I, section 3 of the U.S. Constitution stipulates that the Chief Justice shall preside over impeachment trials of the President of the United States in the U.S. Senate. Two Chief Justices, Salmon P. Chase and William Rehnquist, have presided over the trial in the Senate that follows an impeachment of the president ÿ Chase in 1868 over the proceedings against President Andrew Johnson and Rehnquist in 1999 over the proceedings against President Bill Clinton. Both presidents were subsequently acquitted.\\r\\nMany of the procedures and inner workings of the Court turn on the seniority of the justices. Traditionally, the chief justice has been regarded as primus inter pares (first among equals)that is, the chief justice is the highest-ranking and foremost member of the Court, regardless of that officeholder's length of service when compared against that of any associate justice. This seniority and added prestige enables a chief justice to define the Court's culture and norms, and thus influence how it functions. The chief justice sets the agenda for the weekly meetings where the justices review the petitions for certiorari, to decide whether to hear or deny each case. The Supreme Court agrees to hear less than one percent of the cases petitioned to it. While associate justices may append items to the weekly agenda, in practice this initial agenda-setting power of the chief justice has significant influence over the direction of the court. Nonetheless, a chief justice's influence may be limited by circumstances and the associate justices' understanding of legal principles; it is definitely limited by the fact that he has only a single vote of nine on the decision whether to grant or deny certiorari.[4][5]\\r\\nDespite the chief justice's elevated stature, his vote carries the same legal weight as the vote of each associate justice. Additionally, he has no legal authority to overrule the verdicts or interpretations of the other eight judges or tamper with them.[4] The task of assigning who shall write the opinion for the majority falls to the most senior justice in the majority. Thus, when the chief justice is in the majority, he always assigns the opinion.[6] Early in his tenure, Chief Justice John Marshall insisted upon holdings which the justices could unanimously back as a means to establish and build the Court's national prestige. In doing so, Marshall would often write the opinions himself, and actively discouraged dissenting opinions. Associate Justice William Johnson eventually persuaded Marshall and the rest of the Court to adopt its present practice: one justice writes an opinion for the majority, and the rest are free to write their own separate opinions or not, whether concurring or dissenting.[7]\\r\\nThe chief justice's formal prerogativewhen in the majorityto assign which justice will write the Court's opinion is perhaps his most influential power,[5] as this enables him to influence the historical record.[4] He \\"may assign this task to the individual justice best able to hold together a fragile coalition, to an ideologically amenable colleague, or to himself.\\" Opinion authors can have a big influence on the content of an opinion; two justices in the same majority, given the opportunity, might write very different majority opinions.[5] A chief justice who knows well the associate justices can therefore do muchby the simple act of selecting the justice who writes the opinion of the courtto affect the general character or tone of an opinion, which in turn can affect the interpretation of that opinion in cases before lower courts in the years to come.\\r\\nAdditionally, the chief justice chairs the conferences where cases are discussed and tentatively voted on by the justices. He normally speaks first and so has influence in framing the discussion. Although the chief justice votes firstthe Court votes in order of seniorityhe may strategically pass in order to ensure membership in the majority if desired.[5] It is reported that:\\r\\nChief Justice Warren Burger was renowned, and even vilified in some quarters, for voting strategically during conference discussions on the Supreme Court in order to control the Courts agenda through opinion assignment. Indeed, Burger is said to have often changed votes to join the majority coalition, cast \\"phony votes\\" by voting against his preferred position, and, declined to express a position at conference.[8]\\r\\nThe Chief Justice typically administers the oath of office at the inauguration of the President of the United States. This is a tradition, rather than a constitutional responsibility of the Chief Justice; the Constitution does not require that the oath be administered by anyone in particular, simply that it be taken by the president. Law empowers any federal and state judge, as well as notaries public (such as John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.), to administer oaths and affirmations.\\r\\nIf the Chief Justice is ill or incapacitated, the oath is usually administered by the next senior member of the Supreme Court. Seven times, someone other than the Chief Justice of the United States administered the oath of office to the President.[9] Robert Livingston, as Chancellor of the State of New York (the state's highest ranking judicial office), administered the oath of office to George Washington at his first inauguration; there was no Chief Justice of the United States, nor any other federal judge prior to their appointments by President Washington in the months following his inauguration. William Cushing, an associate justice of the Supreme Court, administered Washington's second oath of office in 1793. Calvin Coolidge's father, a notary public, administered the oath to his son after the death of Warren Harding.[10] This, however, was contested upon Coolidge's return to Washington and his oath was re-administered by Judge Adolph A. Hoehling, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.[11] John Tyler and Millard Fillmore were both sworn in on the death of their predecessors by Chief Justice William Cranch of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia.[12] Chester A. Arthur and Theodore Roosevelt's initial oaths reflected the unexpected nature of their taking office. On November 22, 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Judge Sarah T. Hughes, a federal district court judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, administered the oath of office to then Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson aboard the presidential airplane.\\r\\nIn addition, the Chief Justice ordinarily administers the oath of office to newly appointed and confirmed associate justices, whereas the senior associate justice will normally swear in a new Chief Justice or vice president.\\r\\nSince the tenure of William Howard Taft, the office of the Chief Justice has moved beyond just first among equals.[13] The Chief Justice also:\\r\\nUnlike Senators and Representatives who are constitutionally prohibited from holding any other \\"office of trust or profit\\" of the United States or of any state while holding their congressional seats, the Chief Justice and the other members of the federal judiciary are not barred from serving in other positions. Chief Justice John Jay served as a diplomat to negotiate the so-called Jay Treaty (also known as the Treaty of London of 1794), Justice Robert H. Jackson was appointed by President Truman to be the U.S. Prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials of leading Nazis, and Chief Justice Earl Warren chaired The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. As described above, the Chief Justice holds office in the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress.\\r\\nUnder 28 USC,[15] when the Chief Justice is unable to discharge his functions, or that office is vacant, his duties are carried out by the most senior associate justice who is able to act, until the disability or vacancy ends, as chief justice.[3] As of February 13, 2016, Anthony Kennedy is the most senior associate justice.\\r\\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, the following 17 persons have served as Chief Justice:[16][17]","input":"Who was the first chief justice of the supreme court?"},{"output":"February 14, 2018","context":"A school shooting occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Broward County, Florida, part of the Miami metropolitan area, on February 14, 2018. Seventeen people ÿ fourteen students and three staff members ÿ were fatally shot and seventeen others were wounded, making the shooting one of the deadliest school massacres.[2][3][4] After being identified by witnesses and arrested by the Broward County Sheriff's Office shortly afterward, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz confessed to being the perpetrator.[5] He was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. Police and prosecutors have not yet offered a motive and are investigating \\"a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior\\".[6] The massacre surpassed the 1999 Columbine High School massacre as the deadliest high school shooting in American history.\\r\\nThe sheriff's office received a number of tips in 2016 and 2017 about Cruz's threats to carry out a school shooting. The Federal Bureau of Investigation learned that a YouTube user with the username \\"nikolas cruz\\" posted a message in September 2017 about becoming a school shooter, but the agency could not identify the user. In January 2018, a direct complaint of a death threat by Cruz was not forwarded to the local FBI office by the FBI tip line.\\r\\nAfter the shooting, some Stoneman Douglas students began campaigning for gun control legislation, founding the advocacy group Never Again MSD. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that raised the minimum age for buying rifles in Florida from 18 to 21. The legislation also established waiting periods and background checks for gun buyers. The law also allowed for the arming of properly trained teachers and the hiring of school police. Bump stocks would now be banned and some potentially violent or mentally unstable people would be prohibited from possessing guns.[7][8] The National Rifle Association (NRA) immediately filed a lawsuit that challenged the federal constitutionality of the age requirement clause.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48?km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale.[10][11] The shooter, former student Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[12] at 2:19?p.m.,[5] near dismissal time.[13] Carrying a duffel bag and a backpack,[14] he was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \\"purposefully\\" toward Building 12, according to a police report.[15][16]\\r\\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 2] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[17] Armed with an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle[note 3] and multiple magazines,[19] he activated a fire alarm and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[18][20][21] The fire alarm caused confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[22]\\r\\nAt about 2:21, the same staff member heard gunfire and activated a code red lockdown.[15][23] A school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office rushed to the scene and took a position between two other buildings next to Building 12.[24][25][26]\\r\\nThe shooting lasted six minutes,[27] after which Cruz dropped his rifle on the 3rd floor of the building and left the scene by blending in with fleeing students. He walked to a Walmart, where he purchased a soda at its Subway restaurant. He then walked to a McDonald's and lingered before leaving on foot at 3:01.[5] At about 3:40, he was stopped by police in Coral Springs, 2 miles (3.2?km) from the school, and arrested without incident.[28][29][1][30] He was taken to a hospital emergency room with \\"labored breathing\\".[note 4] After 40 minutes, he was released back into police custody and booked into the Broward County Jail.[5][31]\\r\\nSchool surveillance camera footage revealed Cruz as the perpetrator,[32][33] and he was also recognized by eyewitnesses.[15]\\r\\nSeventeen people were killed and seventeen people were wounded but survived their gunshot wounds.[4][35][36][37][38][39] Three remained in critical condition the day after the shooting[40] and one remained by the second day.[41]\\r\\nThe fourteen students and three staff members killed were:[42]\\r\\nGeography teacher Scott Beigel was killed after he unlocked a classroom for students to enter and hide from the gunman.[43][44] Aaron Feis, an assistant football coach and security guard, was killed as he shielded two students.[45] Chris Hixon, the school's athletic director, was killed as he ran toward the sound of the gunfire and tried to help fleeing students.[46]\\r\\nStudent Peter Wang was last seen in his Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) uniform, holding doors open so others could get out more quickly. He sacrificed his life for others and was called a hero. A White House petition was circulated, calling for him to be buried with full military honors.[47][48] At their respective funerals, Wang, Alaina Petty, and Martin Duque were all posthumously honored by the U.S. Army with the ROTC Medal for Heroism, and Wang was buried in his JROTC Blues uniform. On February 20, he was given a rare posthumous admission to the United States Military Academy.[49]\\r\\nAlyssa Alhadeff, who played for and captained a local soccer team in Parkland, was honored by the United States women's national soccer team before a game in Orlando, on March 7, 2018, nearly three weeks after the shooting. Her teammates and family were invited to the game and presented with official jerseys that featured Alhadeff's name.[51]\\r\\nMeadow Pollack, a senior at Stoneman Douglas High, had been shot four times during the shooting. As the shooter shot into other classrooms, Meadow crawled to a classroom door but was not able to get inside. Along side her was Cara Loughran, who Meadow covered in an attempt to shield her from bullets. The shooter returned to the classroom where Meadow was and shot her five more times, killing her and Cara.[52]\\r\\nThe last victim to remain hospitalized, 15-year-old Anthony Borges, was released on April 4. Dubbed \\"the real Iron Man\\", Borges was shot five times after he used his body to barricade the door of a classroom where twenty students were inside.[53][54] Upon his release, Borges issued a statement that criticized the actions of Broward Sheriffs deputies, Sheriff Scott Israel and School Superintendent Robert Runcie. His family has filed notice of its intent to sue the school district for personal injury to cover costs related to his recovery.[55][56][57]\\r\\nThe shooter was identified by police as Nikolas Jacob Cruz, a 19-year-old former student who had been expelled from the school.[58][59] He was born in South Florida and was adopted at birth.[60] His adoptive father died at age 67 in 2004.[61] His adoptive mother died at age 68 in November 2017, three months before the shooting.[62] He had been living with relatives and friends since her death.[63] At the time of the shooting, he was enrolled in a GED program and employed at a local dollar store.[64][65]\\r\\nCruz was a member of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) and had received multiple awards \\"including academic achievement for maintaining an A grade in JROTC and Bs in other subjects\\", according to CNN.[66] He was also a member of his school's varsity air rifle team.[66][67]\\r\\nCruz had behavioral issues[58] since middle school, but a Washington Post writer said he was \\"entrenched in the process for getting students help rather than referring them to law enforcement\\"[68] and he was transferred between schools six times in three years to deal with these problems. In 2014, he was transferred to a school for children with emotional or learning disabilities. There were reports that he made threats against other students.[69] He returned to Stoneman Douglas High School two years later, only to be banished from the school in 2017 for disciplinary reasons.[58] An email from the school administration had circulated among teachers, warning that he had made threats against other students. This led the school to ban him from wearing a backpack on campus.[59][70][71]\\r\\nPsychiatrists recommended an involuntary admission of Cruz to a residential treatment facility starting in 2013.[72] The Florida Department of Children and Families investigated him in September 2016 for Snapchat posts in which he cut both his arms and said he planned to buy a gun. At this time, a school resource officer requested to have him undergo an involuntary psychiatric examination under the provisions of the Baker Act. Two guidance counselors agreed, but a mental institution did not.[73] State investigators reported he had depression, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In their assessment, they concluded he \\"was at low risk of harming himself or others\\".[74] He had previously received mental health treatment, but had not received treatment in the year leading up to the shooting.[66]\\r\\nBroward County Sheriff Scott Israel described Cruz's online profiles and accounts as \\"very, very disturbing\\".[66] They contained pictures and posts of him with a variety of weapons, including long knives, a shotgun, a pistol, and a BB gun. Police said that he held \\"extremist\\" views; social media accounts that were thought to be linked to him contained anti-black and anti-Muslim slurs.[66] YouTube comments linked to him include \\"I wanna die Fighting[sic] killing shit ton[sic] of people\\", threats against police officers and Antifa, and intent to mimic the University of Texas tower shooting.[66][75][76] In February 2017, he legally purchased an AR-15 style rifle from a Coral Springs gun store. A year later, he used this weapon to commit the mass shooting at his former school.[77]\\r\\nItems recovered by police at the scene included gun magazines with swastikas carved in them. One student reported that Cruz had drawn a swastika and the words \\"I hate niggers\\" on his backpack.[78] CNN reported that Cruz was in a private Instagram group chat where he expressed racist, homophobic, antisemitic, and anti-immigrant (xenophobic) views. He said he wanted to kill gay people and Mexicans, and talked about keeping black people in chains. He said he hated black people \\"simply because they were black,\\" and Jewish people because he believed \\"they wanted to destroy the world\\". He also referred to white women who engaged in interracial relationships as traitors.[79]\\r\\nA former classmate said Cruz had anger management issues and often joked about guns and gun violence, which included threats of shooting up establishments.[10] The brother of a 2016 graduate described him as \\"super stressed out all the time and talked about guns a lot and tried to hide his face\\". A student who was enrolled at the school at the time of the shooting said, \\"I think everyone had in their minds if anybody was going to do it, it was going to be him\\".[80] A classmate who was assigned to work with him in sophomore year said, \\"He told me how he got kicked out of two private schools. He was held back twice. He had aspirations to join the military. He enjoyed hunting.\\"[66] A student's mother said that he also bragged about killing animals. A neighbor said his mother would call the police over to the house to try to talk some sense into him.[81]\\r\\nSheriff Scott Israel said that his office received 23 calls about Cruz during the previous decade, but this figure is in dispute. CNN used a public records request to obtain a sheriff's office log, which showed that from 2008 to 2017, at least 45 calls were made in reference to Cruz, his brother, or the family home.[82][83] The calls included an anonymous tip on February 5, 2016, that Cruz had threatened to shoot up the school, and a tip on November 30, 2017, that he might be a \\"school shooter in the making\\" and that he collected knives and guns. On September 23, 2016, a peer counselor notified the school resource officer of his suicide attempt and intent to buy a gun; the school indicated it would do a \\"threat assessment\\".[84][85][86]\\r\\nIn September 2016, three peoplea sheriff's deputy who worked as a resource officer at Stoneman Douglas, and two of the school's counselorsstated that Cruz should be committed for mental evaluation.[87][88]\\r\\nOn September 24, 2017, a person with the username \\"nikolas cruz\\" posted a comment to a YouTube video. It read, \\"Im[sic] going to be a professional school shooter\\". The video's uploader reported the comment to the FBI. According to agent Robert Lasky, the agency conducted database reviews but was unable to track down the individual who made the threatening comment.[89][90]\\r\\nOn January 5, 2018, the FBI's Public Access Line received a tip from a person who was close to Cruz. On February 16, two days after the shooting, the agency released a statement that detailed this information. According to the statement, \\"The caller provided information about Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.\\" After conducting an investigation, the FBI said the tip line did not follow protocol when the information was not forwarded to the Miami Field Office, where investigative steps would have been taken.[91][92] The FBI opened a probe into the tip line's operations.[93]\\r\\nThe lack of response by Israel and other members of the Broward Country sheriff's department to the numerous red flags and warnings about Cruz has been the subject of much scrutiny.[94] In the days following the shooting, calls for Israel's resignation intensified as more information that alluded to the department's inaction was revealed.[95] Since the shooting, Israel has declined to resign and refused to take responsibility for his role in failing to stop Cruz before the mass shooting took place.[96] In an interview with CNN, Israel described his leadership at the department as \\"amazing\\", a claim that was widely mocked and criticized.[97][98][99][100]\\r\\nAt his initial arraignment the day after the shootings, Cruz was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and ordered held without bond.[101][102] If convicted of first degree murder, he faces either the death penalty or life without parole.[103] According to an affidavit by the sheriff's office, Cruz confessed to the shooting. He also told officers that he brought additional loaded magazines hidden in a backpack.[5][104]\\r\\nThe chief public defender said it is yet unknown if Cruz's court-appointed attorneys will seek an insanity defense.[105]\\r\\nCruz was placed on suicide watch in an isolation cell (solitary confinement) after the arraignment.[106]\\r\\nLead defense counsel Gordon Weekes asked Judge Elizabeth Scherer to recuse herself, claiming that her previous comments and rulings showed favoritism toward the prosecution, which would prevent Cruz from receiving a fair trial. She disagreed and declined the request on February 26.[107]\\r\\nOn March 7, a grand jury indicted Cruz on 34 charges: 17 counts of first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder.[108] He was arraigned on March 13, and the prosecution filed notice of their intent to seek the death penalty.[109] They said they can prove five of the aggravating factors that qualify a murder for the death penalty in Florida. Cruz declined to enter a plea, so Judge Scherer entered \\"not guilty\\" on his behalf. The defense had earlier offered a guilty plea if the death penalty was taken off the table, and reiterated it immediately before it was refused.[110]\\r\\nDuring the week of April 8ÿ12, 2018, Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer included a three-page letter from a Minnesotan into the court record of the case. The letter was addressed to the judge and claimed that research into Cruz's' past led the writer to believe that Cruz suffered from a developmental disability and that he was \\"...fearful of other people and was threatened by bullies.\\" The letter ended by claiming that Cruz appeared to be consumed by sadness and depression.[111] This is part of a string of letters that have been sent to the judge, asking for her to show mercy or for God to forgive his actions against his victims.\\r\\nThe same week, a hearing was held to determine if taxpayers will pay for Cruz's defense. Information was revealed that Cruz's inheritance from his late mother's estate could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. His attorney Howard Finkelstein, the court-appointed public defender, pleaded with the court to wait until the probate case involving Cruz's late mother's estate was concluded and his net worth could be determined.[112] There are also lawsuits and claims against his mother's estate. These liens can complicate the proceedings, although Cruz has reportedly stated he wants the leftover money from his defense to be donated to a cause that promotes healing and education in the community.[112]\\r\\nThe school district provided grief counseling to students and their families. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the fees of funerals and counseling would be paid for by the state.[113]\\r\\nOn February 15, police presence was increased at schools in at least two counties in Florida in response to the shooting.[114][115] The building where the shooting took place will be demolished.[116]\\r\\nTwo weeks after the shooting, Stoneman Douglas reopened to students on February 28 amid a heavy police presence.[117] School principal Ty Thompson emphasized that the first week back would be focused on healing, with classes ending at 11:40?a.m. through March 2. He tweeted \\"... Remember our focus is on emotional readiness and comfort not curriculum: so there is no need for backpacks. Come ready to start the healing process and #RECLAIMTHENEST\\".[117][118] Extra counseling and emotional support dogs were provided to students upon return.[117]\\r\\nIn early April, the school implemented several new safety rules and regulations. The changes included fewer entrances, law enforcement officers at each entrance, identification badges for students and staff, and the requirement that all book bags must be transparent. The use of metal detectors is under consideration. Several students criticized the new safety measures as ineffective and intrusive.[119]\\r\\nThe school resource officer (SRO) who remained outside Building 12 during the shooting was a sheriff's deputy; he was suspended without pay the following day but he immediately retired. Sheriff Israel said \\"[the deputy] was absolutely on campus for this entire event\\" and that he should have \\"[gone] in, addressed the killer, [and] killed the killer\\".[83][120][121] A statement released by the officer's lawyer said he believed the shooting was happening outside the building, which he said he told the first Coral Springs police officer who arrived on scene. It also pointed to radio transmissions indicating a gunshot victim near the football field.[24] However, the Miami Herald transcribed radio dispatches that the SRO at 2:23 said, \\"possible shots fired  1200 building\\". At 2:25, he radioed that \\"We also heard it's by, inside the 1200\\". At 2:27, at Building 12, he radioed, \\"Stay at least 500 feet away at this point.\\"[122] On March 15 in compliance with a court order, the sheriff's office released video footage, captured by school surveillance cameras, showing some of the SRO's movements during the shooting.[123]\\r\\nUnnamed sources told CNN that Coral Springs police arrived at the scene and saw three Broward deputies behind their vehicles with pistols drawn.[121] The commanding sheriff's office captain ordered deputies to form a perimeter instead of immediately confronting the shooter; this tactic was contrary to BSO training regarding active shooters. Based on time stamps of the police logs, the order was given some time after the shooting had stopped.[124] Sheriff Israel said that Coral Springs officers were the first to enter the building, about four minutes after Cruz had left the school.[124] Due to a tape delay in viewing surveillance footage, officers believed that Cruz was still in the building.[125] As of early March, there were three investigations into the timeline of police response.[126][121]\\r\\nPresident Donald Trump criticized the officers who failed to enter the building during the shooting. On February 26, he said that he believed he would have entered \\"even if I didn't have a weapon, and I think most of the people in this room would have done that, too\\",[127] a claim and reaction that was mocked by the media.[128][129][130][131]\\r\\nPresident Trump offered his prayers and condolences to the victims' families, writing, \\"no child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school\\".[132][133] In a televised address, he mentioned school safety and mental health issues.[134] Florida Governor Rick Scott ordered that flags at state buildings be flown at half-staff,[135] and Trump later ordered flags be flown at half-staff for the entire country.[136] Two days after the shooting, Trump and his wife Melania visited Broward Health North, a hospital where eight of the shooting victims were admitted. They met with two victims and Trump praised doctors and law enforcement officials for their responses to the attack.[137]\\r\\nOn February 22, Trump met with students and others at the White House for a \\"listening session\\". He suggested arming up to 20% of the teachers to stop \\"maniacs\\" from attacking students. The following day, he called a \\"gun free\\" school a \\"magnet\\" for criminals and tweeted, \\"Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive.\\"[138][139]\\r\\nBBC News characterized Republican politicians' reactions as focusing on mental health issues while dodging debate on gun control, with the reasoning that it was either \\"too political or too soon\\". Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said that this was the time to \\"step back and count our blessings\\" instead of \\"taking sides and fighting each other politically\\".[140] Republican Florida Senator Marco Rubio said that \\"most\\" proposals on stricter gun laws \\"would not have prevented\\" this shooting nor \\"any of those in recent history\\" and that lawmakers should take action with \\"focus on the violence part\\" alongside guns.[141] Republican Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin declared that the country should re-evaluate \\"the things being put in the hands of our young people\\",[142] specifically \\"quote-unquote video games\\" that \\"have desensitized people to the value of human life\\".[143]\\r\\nAl Hoffman Jr., a Republican donor in Florida, pledged that he would no longer fund legislative groups or candidates who were not actively working to ban sales of military-style assault weapons to civilians. He said, \\"For how many years now have we been doing this?ÿ having these experiences of terrorism, mass killings?ÿ and how many years has it been that nothing's been done?\\"[144]\\r\\nSheriff Israel called on lawmakers to amend the Baker Act to allow police to detain and hospitalize people who make disturbing postsnot just clear threatson social media. \\"I'm talking about being around bombs, possibly talking about 'I want to be a serial killer', talking about taking people's lives\\", he said. \\"Just taking a picture with a gun or a knife or a weapon?ÿ that in and of itself is clearly not even remotely something that we're concerned about.\\"[145]\\r\\nMany student survivors criticized the response from politicians and asked them not to offer condolences but to take action to prevent more children from being killed in shootings. These students have demanded stricter gun control measures.[146][147] Survivor Emma Gonzlez was noted for her speech that rebuked thoughts and prayers from politicians.[148][149] She later helped lead a protest movement against gun violence in the United States.[150] Broward County Schools Superintendent Rob Runcie said, \\"now is the time to have a real conversation about gun control legislation\\".[104][151] Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter was killed in the shooting, implored President Trump to do something to improve school safety.[152]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, some of the student survivors organized a group called Never Again MSD. The group was created on social media with the hashtag #NeverAgain,[153][154] activism inspired in part by the ground broken by the #MeToo movement and the 2018 Women's March.[155] The group demanded legislative action to prevent similar shootings, and has condemned lawmakers who received political contributions from the National Rifle Association.[156][157] The group held a rally on February 17 in Fort Lauderdale that was attended by hundreds of supporters.[158][159]\\r\\nSince the shooting, several more rallies have been planned to take place with the focus on legislative action. The Women's March Network organized a 17-minute school walkout that took place on March 14.[160][161] A series of demonstrations called \\"March for Our Lives\\" on March 24 included a march in Washington, D.C.[162][163][164] On April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre, all-day walkouts are planned for teacher groups by educators Diane Ravitch and David Berliner,[165] as well as student groups.[166][167]\\r\\nOn February 20, dozens of Stoneman Douglas High School students went to the State Capital in Tallahassee and watched as the Florida House of Representatives rejected a bill that would have banned assault weapons. Students strongly criticized the vote. The bill's sponsor, Carlos Guillermo Smith, noted the peculiarity of the timing of the rejection both because of the tragedy at Stoneman Douglas High School and because the Florida House of Representatives had just recently passed a bill declaring that pornography is a public health risk.[168]\\r\\nIn mid-March, Lori Alhadeff announced her own nonprofit organization Make Schools Safe, which will be mostly focusing on school campus security.[169][170]\\r\\nIn May 2018, Cameron Kasky's father registered a super PAC, Families vs Assault Rifles PAC (FAMSVARPAC), with intentions of going \\"up against NRA candidates in every meaningful race in the country\\".[171][172][173]\\r\\nIn March, the Florida Legislature passed a bill titled the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act. It raises the minimum age for buying rifles to 21, establishes waiting periods and background checks, provides a program for the arming of some school employees and hiring of school police, bans bump stocks, and bars some potentially violent or mentally unhealthy people arrested under certain laws from possessing guns. In all, it allocated around $400 million.[7] Rick Scott signed the bill into law on March 9.[8] The same day, the NRA challenged the law by filing a lawsuit alleging that the ban on gun sales to people under 21 is unconstitutional because it violates the rights that the Second and Fourteenth Amendments conferred to 18- to 21-year-olds, who were classified as adults.[9]\\r\\nOn March 23, the STOP School Violence Act was signed into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, which increases funding for metal detectors, security training, and similar safety measures.[174] Lawmakers made it clear it was in response to the shooting and the public outcry.[175] However students from the Stoneman Douglas High School who were active in calling for stricter gun control (not just safety measures) felt this was passed because lawmakers \\"pass something very easy and simple that everyone can get behind. But that's because it doesn't do anything.\\"[176][non-primary source needed][who?]\\r\\nFollowing the shooting, a boycott emerged against the U.S. gun rights advocacy group National Rifle Association (NRA) and its business affiliates. Calls for companies to sever their ties to the NRA were heeded when several companies terminated their business relationships with the NRA.[177][178][179][180] Public pressure resulted major gun sellers like Dick's, Walmart, and Fred Meyer to voluntarily bump the age requirement on gun purchases from 18 to 21.\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, over $7.5 million was raised for the victims as of April 2018. Two other funds, Florida's Crime Victims Compensation Fund, which pays for medical and funeral expenses, and the National Compassion Fund which pays for pain and suffering, are also available to help the victims of the Parkland shooting.[181]\\r\\nConspiracy theories circulated in the wake of the shooting. The speculation included false claims that the shooting did not happen or was staged by \\"crisis actors\\".[182][183][184] In one of the claims, Benjamin A. Kelly, a district secretary for Republican state Rep. Shawn Harrison, sent an email to the Tampa Bay Times stating that the children in the picture were not students at the school.[182] The children were actually students at Stoneman Douglas High School who were interviewed by CNN. As a result of the backlash, Kelly was fired hours later.[182] Former Republican congressman and CNN contributor Jack Kingston suggested student demonstrators were paid by billionaire George Soros or were supported by members of Antifa.[182] A video with a description espousing a conspiracy theory that student David Hogg was a \\"crisis actor\\" reached No. 1 on YouTube's trending page before it was removed by the company.[185]\\r\\nThe Alliance for Securing Democracy showed that Russia-linked accounts on Twitter and other platforms used the shooting's aftermath to inflame tensions and divide Americans by posting loaded comments that oppose gun control.[186][187] Other Russia-linked accounts labeled the shooting a false flag operation that the U.S. government would exploit to seize guns from citizens.[188] Hundreds of Russian bots are also suspected of coming to the defense of Laura Ingraham on Twitter following the boycott of her show, The Ingraham Angle that resulted from her public ridicule of Hogg.[189][190]\\r\\nSome of the survivors of the massacre and their relatives were targeted by online harassment that included death threats.[191][192] Cameron Kasky wrote on Twitter that he was quitting Facebook for the time being, because the death threats from \\"NRA cultists\\" were slightly more graphic on a service without a character limit.[193]","input":"When did the douglas high school shooting happen?"},{"output":"slaves","context":"Triangular trade or triangle trade is a historical term indicating trade among three ports or regions. Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has export commodities that are not required in the region from which its major imports come. Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying trade imbalances between the above regions.\\r\\nHistorically the particular routes were also shaped by the powerful influence of winds and currents during the age of sail. For example, from the main trading nations of Western Europe, it was much easier to sail westwards after first going south of 30 N latitude and reaching the so-called \\"trade winds\\"; thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the North American mainland. Returning from North America, it is easiest to follow the Gulf Stream in a northeasterly direction using the westerlies. A similar triangle to this, called the volta do mar was already being used by the Portuguese, before Christopher Columbus' voyage, to sail to the Canary Islands and the Azores. Columbus simply expanded this triangle outwards, and his route became the main way for Europeans to reach, and return from, the Americas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best-known triangular trading system is the transatlantic slave trade, that operated from the late 16th to early 19th centuries, carrying slaves, cash crops, and manufactured goods between West Africa, Caribbean or American colonies and the European colonial powers, with the northern colonies of British North America, especially New England, sometimes taking over the role of Europe.[1] The use of African slaves was fundamental to growing colonial cash crops, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to purchase African slaves, who were then brought on the sea lane west from Africa to the Americas, the so-called Middle Passage.[2] Despite being driven primarily by economic needs, Europeans sometimes had a religious justification for their actions. In 1452, for instance, Pope Nicholas V, in the Dum Diversas, granted to the kings of Spain and Portugal \\"full and free permission to invade, search out, capture, and subjugate the Saracens [Muslims] and pagans and any other unbelievers ... and to reduce their persons into perpetual slavery.\\"[3]\\r\\nA classic example is the colonial molasses trade. Sugar (often in its liquid form, molasses) from the Caribbean was traded to Europe or New England, where it was distilled into rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were used to purchase manufactured goods, which were then shipped to West Africa, where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of the slaves were then used to buy more sugar, which was shipped to Europe, restarting the cycle. The trip itself took five to twelve weeks.\\r\\nThe first leg of the triangle was from a European port to Africa, in which ships carried supplies for sale and trade, such as copper, cloth, trinkets, slave beads, guns and ammunition.[4] When the ship arrived, its cargo would be sold or bartered for slaves. On the second leg, ships made the journey of the Middle Passage from Africa to the New World. Many slaves died of disease in the crowded holds of the slave ships. Once the ship reached the New World, enslaved survivors were sold in the Caribbean or the American colonies. The ships were then prepared to get them thoroughly cleaned, drained, and loaded with export goods for a return voyage, the third leg, to their home port,[5] from the West Indies the main export cargoes were sugar, rum, and molasses; from Virginia, tobacco and hemp. The ship then returned to Europe to complete the triangle.\\r\\nHowever, because of several disadvantages that slave ships faced compared to other trade ships, they often returned to their home port carrying whatever goods were readily available in the Americas and filled up a large part or all of their capacity with ballast. Other disadvantages include the different form of the ships (to carry as many humans as possible, but not ideal to carry a maximum amount of produce) and the variations in the duration of a slave voyage, making it practically impossible to pre-schedule appointments in the Americas, which meant that slave ships often arrived in the Americas out-of-season. When the ships did reach their intended ports, only about 90% of the passengers survived the journey across the middle passage. Due to the slaves being transported in tight, confined spaces, a small percentage of the group that started perished at the hands of disease and lack of nourishment.[6][unreliable source?] Cash crops were transported mainly by a separate fleet which only sailed from Europe to the Americas and back mitigating the impact the slaves involvement brought forth. The Triangular trade is a trade model, not an exact description of the ship's route.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2017 study provides evidence for the hypothesis that the export of gunpowder technology to Africa increased the transatlantic slave trade by making it easier for Africans to enslave each other: \\"A one percent increase in gunpowder set in motion a 5-year gun-slave cycle that increased slave exports by an average of 50%, and the impact continued to grow over time.\\"[8]\\r\\nNew England also benefited from the trade, as many merchants from New England, especially the state of Rhode Island, replaced the role of Europe in the triangle. New England also made rum from Caribbean sugar and molasses, which it shipped to Africa as well as within the New World.[9] Yet, the \\"triangle trade\\" as considered in relation to New England was a piecemeal operation. No New England traders are known to have completed a sequential circuit of the full triangle, which took a calendar year on average, according to historian Clifford Shipton.[10] The concept of the New England Triangular trade was first suggested, inconclusively, in an 1866 book by George H. Moore, was picked up in 1872 by historian George C. Mason, and reached full consideration from a lecture in 1887 by American businessman and historian William B. Weeden.[11] The song \\"Molasses to Rum\\" from the musical 1776 vividly describes this form of the triangular trade.\\r\\nThe term \\"triangular trade\\" also refers to a variety of other trades.","input":"What was traded along the triangular trade route?"},{"output":"approximately 3.5 billion years ago","context":"A prokaryote is a unicellular organism that lacks a membrane-bound nucleus, mitochondria, or any other membrane-bound organelle.[1] The word prokaryote comes from the Greek ? (pro) \\"before\\" and ? (karyon) \\"nut or kernel\\".[2][3] Prokaryotes are divided into two domains, Archaea and Bacteria. In contrast, species with nuclei and organelles are placed in the third domain, Eukaryota.[4] Prokaryotes reproduce without fusion of gametes. The first living organisms are thought to have been prokaryotes.\\r\\nIn the prokaryotes, all the intracellular water-soluble components (proteins, DNA and metabolites) are located together in the cytoplasm enclosed by the cell membrane, rather than in separate cellular compartments. Bacteria, however, do possess protein-based bacterial microcompartments, which are thought to act as primitive organelles enclosed in protein shells.[5][6] Some prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria may form large colonies. Others, such as myxobacteria, have multicellular stages in their life cycles.[7]\\r\\nMolecular studies have provided insight into the evolution and interrelationships of the three domains of biological species.[8] Eukaryotes are organisms, including humans, whose cells have a well defined membrane-bound nucleus (containing chromosomal DNA) and organelles. The division between prokaryotes and eukaryotes reflects the existence of two very different levels of cellular organization. Distinctive types of prokaryotes include extremophiles and methanogens; these are common in some extreme environments.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProkaryotes have a prokaryotic cytoskeleton, albeit more primitive than that of the eukaryotes. Besides homologues of actin and tubulin (MreB and FtsZ), the helically arranged building-block of the flagellum, flagellin, is one of the most significant cytoskeletal proteins of bacteria, as it provides structural backgrounds of chemotaxis, the basic cell physiological response of bacteria. At least some prokaryotes also contain intracellular structures that can be seen as primitive organelles. Membranous organelles (or intracellular membranes) are known in some groups of prokaryotes, such as vacuoles or membrane systems devoted to special metabolic properties, such as photosynthesis or chemolithotrophy. In addition, some species also contain carbohydrate-enclosed microcompartments, which have distinct physiological roles (e.g. carboxysomes or gas vacuoles).\\r\\nMost prokaryotes are between 1?m and 10?m, but they can vary in size from 0.2?m (Mycoplasma genitalium) to 750?m (Thiomargarita namibiensis).\\r\\nLong, whip-like protrusion that aids cellular locomotion used by both gram positive and gram negative organisms.\\r\\nSurrounds the cell's cytoplasm and regulates the flow of substances in and out of the cell.\\r\\nOuter covering of most cells that protects the bacterial cell and gives it shape.\\r\\nA gel-like substance composed mainly of water that also contains enzymes, salts, cell components, and various organic molecules.\\r\\nCell structures responsible for protein production.\\r\\nArea of the cytoplasm that contains the prokaryote's single DNA molecule.\\r\\nA glycoprotein-polysaccharide covering that surrounds the cell membranes.\\r\\nIt contains the inclusion bodies like ribosomes and larger masses scattered in the cytoplasmic matrix.\\r\\nProkaryotic cells have various shapes; the four basic shapes of bacteria are:[9]\\r\\nThe archaeon Haloquadratum has flat square-shaped cells.[10]\\r\\nBacteria and archaea reproduce through asexual reproduction, usually by binary fission. Genetic exchange and recombination still occur, but this is a form of horizontal gene transfer and is not a replicative process, simply involving the transference of DNA between two cells, as in bacterial conjugation.\\r\\nDNA transfer between prokaryotic cells occurs in bacteria and archaea, although it has been mainly studied in bacteria. In bacteria, gene transfer occurs by three processes. These are (1) bacterial virus (bacteriophage)-mediated transduction, (2) plasmid-mediated conjugation, and (3) natural transformation. Transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to reflect an occasional error during intracellular assembly of virus particles, rather than an adaptation of the host bacteria. The transfer of bacterial DNA is under the control of the bacteriophages genes rather than bacterial genes. Conjugation in the well-studied E. coli system is controlled by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for distributing copies of a plasmid from one bacterial host to another. Infrequently during this process, a plasmid may integrate into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfer part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium. Plasmid mediated transfer of host bacterial DNA (conjugation) also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation.\\r\\nNatural bacterial transformation involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through the intervening medium. Unlike transduction and conjugation, transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer, because it depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process.[11] For a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state called competence. About 40 genes are required in Bacillus subtilis for the development of competence.[12] The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be as much as a third to the whole chromosome.[13][14] Transformation is a common mode of DNA transfer, and 67 prokaryotic species are thus far known to be naturally competent for transformation.[15]\\r\\nAmong archaea, Halobacterium volcanii forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear to be used for transfer of DNA from one cell to another.[16] Another archaeon, Sulfolobus solfataricus, transfers DNA between cells by direct contact. Frols et al.[17] found that exposure of S. solfataricus to DNA damaging agents induces cellular aggregation, and suggested that cellular aggregation may enhance DNA transfer among cells to provide increased repair of damaged DNA via homologous recombination.\\r\\nWhile prokaryotes are considered strictly unicellular, most can form stable aggregate communities.[18] When such communities are encased in a stabilizing polymer matrix (\\"slime\\"), they may be called \\"biofilms\\".[19] Cells in biofilms often show distinct patterns of gene expression (phenotypic differentiation) in time and space. Also, as with multicellular eukaryotes, these changes in expression often appear to result from cell-to-cell signaling, a phenomenon known as quorum sensing.\\r\\nBiofilms may be highly heterogeneous and structurally complex and may attach to solid surfaces, or exist at liquid-air interfaces, or potentially even liquid-liquid interfaces. Bacterial biofilms are often made up of microcolonies (approximately dome-shaped masses of bacteria and matrix) separated by \\"voids\\" through which the medium (e.g., water) may flow easily. The microcolonies may join together above the substratum to form a continuous layer, closing the network of channels separating microcolonies. This structural complexitycombined with observations that oxygen limitation (a ubiquitous challenge for anything growing in size beyond the scale of diffusion) is at least partially eased by movement of medium throughout the biofilmhas led some to speculate that this may constitute a circulatory system [20] and many researchers have started calling prokaryotic communities multicellular (for example [21]). Differential cell expression, collective behavior, signaling, programmed cell death, and (in some cases) discrete biological dispersal[22] events all seem to point in this direction. However, these colonies are seldom if ever founded by a single founder (in the way that animals and plants are founded by single cells), which presents a number of theoretical issues. Most explanations of co-operation and the evolution of multicellularity have focused on high relatedness between members of a group (or colony, or whole organism). If a copy of a gene is present in all members of a group, behaviors that promote cooperation between members may permit those members to have (on average) greater fitness than a similar group of selfish individuals[23] (see inclusive fitness and Hamilton's rule).\\r\\nShould these instances of prokaryotic sociality prove to be the rule rather than the exception, it would have serious implications for the way we view prokaryotes in general, and the way we deal with them in medicine.[24] Bacterial biofilms may be 100 times more resistant to antibiotics than free-living unicells and may be nearly impossible to remove from surfaces once they have colonized them.[25] Other aspects of bacterial cooperationsuch as bacterial conjugation and quorum-sensing-mediated pathogenicity, present additional challenges to researchers and medical professionals seeking to treat the associated diseases.\\r\\nProkaryotes have diversified greatly throughout their long existence. The metabolism of prokaryotes is far more varied than that of eukaryotes, leading to many highly distinct prokaryotic types. For example, in addition to using photosynthesis or organic compounds for energy, as eukaryotes do, prokaryotes may obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide. This enables prokaryotes to thrive in harsh environments as cold as the snow surface of Antarctica, studied in cryobiology or as hot as undersea hydrothermal vents and land-based hot springs.\\r\\nProkaryotes live in nearly all environments on Earth. Some archaea and bacteria are extremophiles, thriving in harsh conditions, such as high temperatures (thermophiles) or high salinity (halophiles).[26] Many archaea grow as plankton in the oceans. Symbiotic prokaryotes live in or on the bodies of other organisms, including humans.\\r\\nIn 1977, Carl Woese proposed dividing prokaryotes into the Bacteria and Archaea (originally Eubacteria and Archaebacteria) because of the major differences in the structure and genetics between the two groups of organisms. Archaea were originally thought to be extremophiles, living only in inhospitable conditions such as extremes of temperature, pH, and radiation but have since been found in all types of habitats. The resulting arrangement of Eukaryota (also called \\"Eucarya\\"), Bacteria, and Archaea is called the three-domain system, replacing the traditional two-empire system.[27][28]\\r\\nA widespread current model of the evolution of the first living organisms is that these were some form of prokaryotes, which may have evolved out of protocells, while the eukaryotes evolved later in the history of life.[30] Some authors have questioned this conclusion, arguing that the current set of prokaryotic species may have evolved from more complex eukaryotic ancestors through a process of simplification.[31][32][33] Others have argued that the three domains of life arose simultaneously, from a set of varied cells that formed a single gene pool.[34] This controversy was summarized in 2005:[35]\\r\\nThere is no consensus among biologists concerning the position of the eukaryotes in the overall scheme of cell evolution. Current opinions on the origin and position of eukaryotes span a broad spectrum including the views that eukaryotes arose first in evolution and that prokaryotes descend from them, that eukaryotes arose contemporaneously with eubacteria and archeabacteria and hence represent a primary line of descent of equal age and rank as the prokaryotes, that eukaryotes arose through a symbiotic event entailing an endosymbiotic origin of the nucleus, that eukaryotes arose without endosymbiosis, and that eukaryotes arose through a symbiotic event entailing a simultaneous endosymbiotic origin of the flagellum and the nucleus, in addition to many other models, which have been reviewed and summarized elsewhere.\\r\\nThe oldest known fossilized prokaryotes were laid down approximately 3.5 billion years ago, only about 1 billion years after the formation of the Earth's crust. Eukaryotes only appear in the fossil record later, and may have formed from endosymbiosis of multiple prokaryote ancestors. The oldest known fossil eukaryotes are about 1.7 billion years old. However, some genetic evidence suggests eukaryotes appeared as early as 3 billion years ago.[36]\\r\\nWhile Earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist, some have suggested that there is evidence on Mars of fossil or living prokaryotes.[37][38] However, this possibility remains the subject of considerable debate and skepticism.[39][40]\\r\\nThe division between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is usually considered the most important distinction or difference among organisms. The distinction is that eukaryotic cells have a \\"true\\" nucleus containing their DNA, whereas prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus. Both eukaryotes and prokaryotes contain large RNA/protein structures called ribosomes, which produce protein.\\r\\nAnother difference is that ribosomes in prokaryotes are smaller than in eukaryotes. However, two organelles found in many eukaryotic cells, mitochondria and chloroplasts, contain ribosomes similar in size and makeup to those found in prokaryotes.[41] This is one of many pieces of evidence that mitochondria and chloroplasts are themselves descended from free-living bacteria. This theory holds that early eukaryotic cells took in primitive prokaryotic cells by phagocytosis and adapted themselves to incorporate their structures, leading to the mitochondria we see today.\\r\\nThe genome in a prokaryote is held within a DNA/protein complex in the cytosol called the nucleoid, which lacks a nuclear envelope.[42] The complex contains a single, cyclic, double-stranded molecule of stable chromosomal DNA, in contrast to the multiple linear, compact, highly organized chromosomes found in eukaryotic cells. In addition, many important genes of prokaryotes are stored in separate circular DNA structures called plasmids.[2]\\r\\nProkaryotes lack mitochondria and chloroplasts. Instead, processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis take place across the prokaryotic cell membrane.[43] However, prokaryotes do possess some internal structures, such as prokaryotic cytoskeletons.[44][45] It has been suggested that the bacterial order Planctomycetes have a membrane around their nucleoid and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures.[46] However, further investigation revealed that Planctomycetes cells are not compartmentalized or nucleated and like the other bacterial membrane systems are all interconnected.[47]\\r\\nProkaryotic cells are usually much smaller than eukaryotic cells.[2] Therefore, prokaryotes have a larger surface-area-to-volume ratio, giving them a higher metabolic rate, a higher growth rate, and as a consequence, a shorter generation time than eukaryotes.[2]\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from the NCBI document \\"Science Primer\\".","input":"When did prokaryotic cells

The constitution, which was heavily influenced by the United States Constitution and the ideas of the French Revolution, was modified several times during the following decades and wholly replaced in 1999. The constitution represents the first time that the Swiss were governed by a strong central government instead of being simply a collection of independent cantons bound by treaties.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1847, the period of Swiss history known as Restoration ended with the breaking out of a war between the conservative Roman Catholic and the liberal Protestant cantons (the Sonderbundskrieg). The conflict between the Catholic and Protestant cantons had existed since the Reformation; in the 19th century the Protestant population had a majority.[1] The Sonderbund (German: separate alliance) was concluded after the Radical Party had taken power in Switzerland and had, thanks to the Protestant majority of cantons, taken measures against the Catholic Church such as the closure of monasteries and convents in Aargau in 1841.[2] When Lucerne, in retaliation, recalled the Jesuits the same year, groups of armed radicals (\\"Freisch?rler\\") invaded the canton. This caused a revolt, mostly because rural cantons were strongholds of ultramontanism.\\r\\nThe Sonderbund was in violation of the Federal Treaty of 1815, 6, which expressly forbade such separate alliances, and the Radical majority in the Tagsatzung decided to dissolve the Sonderbund on 21 October 1847. The confederate army was raised against the members of the Sonderbund, composed of soldiers of all the other states except Neuchatel and Appenzell Innerrhoden, which had stayed neutral. Ticino, while a Catholic canton, did not join the Sonderbund and fought with the Protestants.\\r\\nThe war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties. Apart from small riots,[3] this was the last armed conflict on Swiss territory.\\r\\nAt the end of the Sonderbund War, the Diet began to debate a new federal constitution drawn up by Johann Conrad Kern (1808ÿ1888) of Thurgau and Henri Druey (1790ÿ1855) of Vaud. In the summer of 1848 this constitution was accepted by fifteen and a half cantons, with Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Valais, Ticino and Appenzell Innerrhoden opposing. The new constitution was declared on 12 September 1848.\\r\\nThe new constitution created, for the first time, Swiss citizenship in addition to cantonal citizenship.\\r\\nA federal central government was set up to which the cantons gave up certain parts of their sovereign rights, retaining the rest. The Federal Assembly was made up of two houses- Council of States (St?nderat), composed of two deputies from each canton (44 members at the time) and the National Council (Nationalrat) made up of deputies elected three years, in the proportion of one for every 20,000 citizens or fraction over 10,000 from each canton. The Federal Council or executive (Bundesrat) consisted of seven members elected by the Federal Assembly. In the 1848 Constitution, the entire Federal Council was granted the \\"supreme executive and directorial authority of the Confederation\\".[4] Each member of the Federal Council heads one of seven executive departments. The chairman of the Council also holds the title of President of the Swiss Confederation for a one-year term, with the position rotating among the members of the Federal Council.\\r\\nThe judiciary (Bundesgericht) was made up of eleven members elected for three years by the Federal Assembly. The Bundesgericht was chiefly confined to civil cases in which the Confederation was a party, but also took in great political crimes. All constitutional questions are however reserved for the Federal Assembly.\\r\\nA federal university and a polytechnic school were to be founded. All military capitulations were forbidden in the future. All cantons were required to treat Swiss citizens who belonged to one of the Christian confessions like their own citizens. Previously, citizens of one canton regarded citizens of the others as the citizens of foreign countries. All Christians were guaranteed the exercise of their religion but the Jesuits and similar religious orders were not to be received in any canton. German, French and Italian were recognized as national languages.\\r\\nAlthough there was now a fully organized central government, Switzerland was a very decentralized federation. Most authority remained with the cantons, including all powers not explicitly granted to the federal government. One of the first acts of the Federal Assembly was to exercise the power given them of determining the home of the Federal authorities (the de facto capital of the newly created confederation), and on 28 November 1848 Bern was chosen. The first Federal Council sat on 16 November 1848, composed entirely of members of the Free Democratic Party.\\r\\nSome of the first acts of the new Federal Assembly were to unify and standardize daily life in the country. In 1849 a uniform postal service was established. In 1850 a single currency was imposed to replace the cantonal currencies, while all customs between cantons were abolished. In 1851 the telegraph was organized, while all weights and measures were unified. In 1868 the metric system was allowed and in 1875 declared obligatory and universal. In 1854 roads and canals taken in hand were taken under federal control. The Federal Polytechnic wasn't opened until 1855 in Zurich, though the Federal university authorized by the new constitution has not yet been set up.\\r\\nIn 1859, Reisl?uferei (mercenary service) was outlawed, with the exception of the Vatican guard.\\r\\nIn 1866 the rights granted only to Christians (free movement and freedom of religion) under the 1848 Constitution were extended to all Swiss regardless of religion.\\r\\nFrom 1848 onwards the cantons continually revised their constitutions, with most including the introduction of the referendum, by which laws made by the cantonal legislature may (facultative referendum) or must (obligatory referendum) be submitted to the people for their approval. It was therefore only natural that attempts should be made to revise the federal constitution of 1848 in a democratic and centralizing sense, for it had been provided that the Federal Assembly, on its own initiative or on the written request of 50,000 Swiss electors, could submit the question of revision to a popular vote. The first attempt at a revision in 1872 was defeated by a small majority, owing to the efforts of the anti-centralizing party. Finally, however, another draft was preferred, and on the 19 April 1874, the new constitution was accepted by the people ÿ 14?1?2 cantons against 7?1?2 (those of 1848 without Ticino, but with Fribourg and Lucerne).[2]\\r\\nThe Constitution of 1874 further strengthened the federal power. The revised Constitution included three major points. First, a system of free elementary education was set up, under the superintendence of the Confederation, but managed by the cantons. Second, a man settling in another canton was, after three months (instead of two years in the 1848 Constitution), given all cantonal and communal rights (formerly only cantonal rights were granted). Finally, the referendum was introduced in its \\"facultative\\" form; i.e., all federal laws must be submitted to popular vote on the demand of 30,000 Swiss citizens or of eight cantons. The Initiative (i.e., the right of compelling the legislature to consider a certain subject or bill) was not introduced into the Federal Constitution until 1891 (when it was given to 50,000 Swiss citizens) and then only as to a partial (not a total) revision of that constitution.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe 1847 to 1914 period saw the development of the Swiss railway network. The Schweizerische Nordbahn (SNB) society opened the first railway line on Swiss soil in 1847, connecting Zrich and Baden. The Gotthard Rail Tunnel was completed in 1881.\\r\\nThe Swiss watchmaking industry has its origins in the 18th century, but boomed during the 19th century, turning the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds into an industrial center. Rapid urban growth also enlarged Zrich, which incorporated its industrial suburb Aussersihl into the municipality in 1891.\\r\\nBanking emerged as a significant factor in Swiss economy with the foundation of the Union Bank of Switzerland in 1862, the Swiss Bank Corporation in 1872.\\r\\nThe Golden age of alpinism in the 1850s to 1860s lay the foundation to the tourism industry.","input":"What are the federal states in switzerland called?"},{"output":"Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff","context":"United States military seniority is the method by which the United States Armed Forces determine precedence among commissioned officers, in particular those who hold the same rank. Seniority is used to determine assignments, tactical commands, promotions and general courtesy. To a lesser extent, historical seniority is used to recognize status of honor given to early United States military leaders such as inaugural holders of certain ranks or those officers who served as leadership during major wars and armed conflicts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern-day seniority system of the United States commissioned officer corps operates on two different levels. For officers of different ranks, seniority is simply determined by who holds the highest rank. For instance, Army colonel is senior to captain and captain senior to lieutenant. Seniority extends across services as for instance major in the Army is senior to captain in the Air Force while commander in the United States Navy is senior to both. For officers in the same rank or paygrade, seniority is determined by the date of whom assumed their rank earlier.[1] If officers of the same grade have the same date of rank, then seniority is determined in order by the officer's previous rank's date and so forth.[1] If all promotion dates of ranks are the same, seniority is then determined on order of: previous active duty grade relative seniority (if applicable),[1] total active commissioned service,[1] and finally, total federal commissioned service or date of appointment as a commissioned officer.[1] The secretaries of each service may establish further seniority rules if applicable.[1]\\r\\nA type of \\"positional seniority\\" exists for military officers who hold top leadership positions of the armed forces. For instance, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is considered the senior most officer of the entire United States military, even though it is possible that contemporaries of the same rank may have earlier dates of rank or time in service. Likewise, heads of various armed service branches are considered senior most within their service; unified commanders are also considered senior most in their respective regions yet not necessarily to each other.\\r\\nThe regular United States military hierarchy is as follows:\\r\\nWhen compared to each other, seniority is determined among the service heads by lineal number and commissioning date. Externally, the standing of each service head is determined by the date of the creation of the position as follows.\\r\\nThe officers in charge of the Unified Combatant Commands are considered \\"operational officers\\" while the standard military hierarchy is administrative. For instance, the Chief of Naval Operations, who would most likely be senior to a naval admiral in command of the United States Pacific Command, would not be able to issue direct orders to said commander since operational chain of command is separate from regular administrative military hierarchy.[2] Military seniority, within itself, would not be affected.\\r\\nTactical seniority, also known as \\"battlefield seniority\\", is the manner in which a senior officer in command of a given tactical situation is determined. For instance, within the United States Navy, groups of ships performing exercises together will have one ship designated as the tactical senior unit. The commander of said ship is the senior tactical officer and may in fact be junior in rank to the other officers of the tactical group. For multi-national exercises, such as the Sharem event in South Korea, ships of foreign nations are sometimes given tactical seniority and thus may issue routine movement orders to United States vessels. Actual combat would fall under the Task Force system, in which a United States admiral, with clear seniority, would take command over all vessels.\\r\\nGroups of Army units, especially in active combat, may be placed under tactical command of any officer, regardless of rank seniority, for completion of a single mission. During World War II, the term \\"mixed unit\\" was commonly used to denote military formations created from several other smaller units, most often \\"on the spot\\", due to operational confusion and the need for a single battlefield commander to take authority over all units physically present. Army Air Force bomber groups operated on a similar principle, in that tactical command could pass to officers who were not necessarily the senior most present, given the specific needs of the mission or casualties during the mission itself.\\r\\nOperational seniority refers to the ability to issue long range orders to U.S. forces, such as deployments, general orders, and other administrative matters. Operational seniority is never granted to non-U.S. officers and usually stems from such major offices as the Bureau of Naval Personnel or the Army Personnel Branch.\\r\\nHistorical seniority loosely indicates the general significance of various generals and flag officers within the scope of the history of the United States. Historical seniority is typically only bestowed to those officers who were the inaugural holders of ranks or for those who served as the senior most military officer during a major armed conflict.\\r\\nThe only case where historical seniority has been legally established by the United States Congress are for the two \\"super ranks\\" of the armed forces of the United States, these being the ranks General of the Armies and Admiral of the Navy. By clear precedent, the holders of these two ranks (three persons in all) are senior to all other officers of the United States military, past and present. By special Congressional edict, George Washington is considered the senior most officer of all time meaning he may never be lesser in seniority to any other military officer, although Washington technically shares the same rank with John Pershing.\\r\\nThe office of general was discontinued after the Civil War, but revived in 1919 by the title of \\"General of the Armies of the United States\\" when General John J. Pershing was appointed to that office on 3 September 1919; accepted the appointment on 8 September 1919, was retired with that rank on 13 September 1924, and held it until his death on 15 July 1948. No other officer has occupied this office on active duty. General Pershing held the grade of General of the Armies of the United States under the provisions of the Act of U.S. Congress of 3 September 1919 (Public Law 45). Washington was posthumously appointed General of the Armies of the United States under s:Public Law 94-479. Under s:Order 31-3, the effective promotion date was on 4 July 1976. Congress specified that no officer of the United States Army should outrank Lieutenant General George Washington on the Army list. While promoted to a lieutenant general only a year before his death, he was the most senior officer and the only lieutenant general in the army. The same is true of Ulysses S. Grant, who was the second person to permanently hold this rank. (Winfield Scott was a brevet lieutenant general for his service in the MexicanÿAmerican War.) Washington was referred to as \\"commander in chief\\" of the Continental Army, a title that since the adoption of the Constitution has been reserved for the (civilian) President.\\r\\nThe five star officers of World War II are technically considered the most senior officers in U.S. history (with the exception of the two \\"super ranks\\" previously mentioned), yet are often considered historically junior to the military leaders of the 19th century, especially the inaugural holders of senior military ranks. Most historical seniority lists also omit three star officers, with some rare exceptions (such as Winfield Scott), and typically avoid comparing two star ranks and below, which are permanent ranks held by hundreds of officers over the past two centuries. In these cases, standard methods of seniority are utilized. Since 1981, the highest rank held by any officer in the U.S. armed forces is four stars, or a pay grade of \\"O-10\\". Modern-day admirals and generals are typically not considered in lists of historical seniority, except for extreme cases such as leaders of wars or other wide scale armed conflicts.\\r\\nThe officers listed below are generally accepted in military history circles as the top twenty five officers of all time in United States military history[3][4]\\r\\nAlexander Vandegrift is also frequently included in historical seniority lists due to his status as the first Commandant of the Marine Corps to hold a four-star rank, as is Anna Mae Hays who was the first woman to be promoted to brigadier general in the history of the United States. Historical seniority is rarely referred to after the Korean War since modern military seniority systems had been well-established after the mid 20th century. Expanded seniority lists such as the one listed below do exist mostly in recognition of major military leaders of modern wars and conflicts.","input":"Who is the us highest ranking military officer?"},{"output":"Koine Greek","context":"The New Testament was written in a form of Koine Greek,[1][2] which was the common language of the Eastern Mediterranean[3][4][5][6] from the Conquests of Alexander the Great (335ÿ323 BC) until the evolution of Byzantine Greek (c. 600).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Testament Gospels and Epistles were only part of a Hellenistic Jewish culture in the Roman Empire, where Alexandria had a larger Jewish population than Jerusalem, and Greek was spoken by more Jews than Hebrew.[7] Other Jewish Hellenistic writings include those of Jason of Cyrene, Josephus, Philo, Demetrius the chronographer, Eupolemus, Pseudo-Eupolemus, Artapanus of Alexandria, Cleodemus Malchus, Aristeas, Pseudo-Hecataeus, Thallus, and Justus of Tiberias, Pseudo-Philo, many Old Testament Pseudepigrapha and the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible itself.\\r\\nWhereas the Classical Greek city states used different dialects of Greek, a common standard, called Koine (? \\"common\\"), developed gradually in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC as a consequence of the formation of larger political structures (like the Greek colonies, Athenian Empire, and the Macedonian Empire) and a more intense cultural exchange in the Aegean area, or in other words the Hellenization of the empire of Alexander the Great.\\r\\nIn the Greek Dark Ages and the Archaic Period, Greek colonies were founded all over the Mediterranean basin. However, even though Greek goods were popular in the East, the cultural influence tended to work the other way around. Yet, with the conquests of Alexander the Great (333-323 BC) and the subsequent establishment of Hellenistic kingdoms (above all, the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Kingdom), Koine Greek became the dominant language in politics, culture and commerce in the Near East.\\r\\nDuring the following centuries, Rome conquered Greece and the Macedonian Kingdoms piece for piece until, with the conquest of Egypt in 30 BC, she held all land around the Mediterranean. However, as Horace gently puts it: \\"Conquered Greece has conquered the brute victor and brought her arts into rustic Latium\\" (Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit et artis intulit agresti Latio.[8]) Roman art and literature were calqued upon Hellenistic models.\\r\\nKoine Greek remained the dominant language in the eastern part of the Roman Empire, extending into the Byzantine Empire as Byzantine Greek. In the city of Rome, Koine Greek was in widespread use among ordinary people, and the elite spoke and wrote Greek as fluently as Latin. Jewish Koine Greek did not exist as a separate dialect, but some Jewish texts in Koine Greek do show the influence of Aramaic in syntax and the influence of Biblical background in vocabulary.\\r\\nAfter the Babylonian captivity, Aramaic replaced Biblical Hebrew as the everyday language in Palestine. The two languages were as similar as two Romance languages or two Germanic languages today. Thus Biblical Hebrew, which was still used for religious purposes, was not totally unfamiliar, but still a somewhat strange norm that demanded a certain degree of training to be understood properly.\\r\\nAfter Alexander, Palestine was ruled by the Ptolemies and the Seleucids for almost two hundred years. Jewish culture was heavily influenced by Hellenistic culture, and Koine Greek was used not only for international communication, but also as the first language of many Jews. This development was furthered by the fact that the largest Jewish community of the world lived in Ptolemaic Alexandria. Many of these diaspora Jews would have Greek as their first language, and first the Torah and then other Jewish scriptures (later the Christian \\"Old Testament\\") were therefore translated into standard Koine Greek, i.e. the Septuagint.\\r\\nCurrently, 1,600 Jewish epitaphs (funerary inscriptions) are extant from ancient Palestine dating from 300 B.C. to 500 A.D. Approximately 70 percent are in Greek, about 12 percent are in Latin, and only 18 percent are in Hebrew or Aramaic. \\"In Jerusalem itself about 40 percent of the Jewish inscriptions from the first century period (before 70 C.E.) are in Greek. We may assume that most Jewish Jerusalemites who saw the inscriptions in situ were able to read them\\".[9]\\r\\nMost biblical scholars adhere to the view that the Greek text of the New Testament is the original version.[10] However, there does exist an alternative view which maintains that it is a translation from an Aramaic original, a position known as Peshitta Primacy (also known in primarily non-scholarly circles as \\"Aramaic primacy\\"). Although this view has its adherents, the vast majority of scholars dispute this position citing linguistic, historical, and textual inconsistencies.[11] At any rate, since most of the texts are written by diaspora Jews such as Paul the Apostle and his possibly Gentile companion, Luke, and to a large extent addressed directly to Christian communities in Greek-speaking cities (often communities consisting largely of Paul's converts, which appear to have been non-Jewish in the majority), and since the style of their Greek is impeccable,[12] a Greek original is more probable than a translation.\\r\\nEven Mark, whose Greek is heavily influenced by his Semitic substratum, seems to presuppose a non-Hebrew audience. Thus, he explains Jewish customs (e.g. Mark 7:3-4, see also Mark 7), and he translates Aramaic phrases into Greek (Mark 3:17: boanerges; Mark 5:41: talitha kum; Mark 7:34: ephphatha; Mark 14:36: abba; Mark 15:22: Golgotha; Mark 15:34, see also Aramaic of Jesus and Sayings of Jesus on the cross). In the Aramaic Syriac version of the Bible, these translations are preserved, resulting in odd texts like Mark 15:34:\\r\\nIn the Peshitta:\\r\\nThe languages spoken in Galilee and Judea during the first century include the Semitic Aramaic and Hebrew languages as well as Greek, with Aramaic being the predominant language.[13][14] Most scholars agree that during the early part of first century Aramaic was the mother tongue of virtually all natives of Galilee and Judea.[15] Most scholars support the theory that Jesus spoke Aramaic and that he may have also spoken Hebrew and Greek.[13][14][16][17] Stanley E. Porter concluded: \\"The linguistic environment of Roman Palestine during the first century was much more complex, and allows for the possibility that Jesus himself may well have spoken Greek on occasion.\\"[18]\\r\\nCritics of the mainstream consensus in favour of Greek being the original language of the New Testament claim logical improbabilities in the Greek Text compared to the Syriac/Hebrew Texts and vocabulary containing wordplay in the Syriac/Hebrew New Testament texts that parallels Hebraic wordplay in the Old Testament.[19][20] These arguments are rejected by the academic mainstream.","input":"What language was the new testament bible originally written in?"},{"output":"iOS 11.4","context":"iOS is a mobile operating system, developed by Apple Inc. for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.

It was officially renamed iOS on June 7, 2010 with the announcement and introduction of iPad. The introduction of iPad, and the existence of iPod Touch, meant the iPhone was no longer the only device to run the mobile operating system. iOS 4 was the first major iOS release that reflected the name change.[6] Apple licensed the \\"iOS\\" trademark from Cisco Systems.[7]\\r\\nApple concurrently provides the same version of iOS for the comparable model of iPhone and iPod Touch, usually devices released in the same calendar year. iPhone users receive all software updates for free, while iPod Touch users paid for the 2.0 and 3.0 major software updates. As of iOS 4.0, Apple no longer charges money for iPod Touch updates.[8]\\r\\nAs of 2017, two versions of iOS were never released. iPhone OS 1.2, which after the first beta was replaced by a 2.0 version number; the second beta was named 2.0 beta 2 instead of 1.2 beta 2. The other was iOS 4.2, replaced with 4.2.1 due to a Wi-Fi bug in 4.2 beta 3, causing Apple to release 2 golden masters (4.2 GM and 4.2.1 GM).[9] One version of iOS was pulled back by Apple after being released. iOS 8.0.1 was pulled back by Apple because cellular service and Touch ID were disabled on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.\\r\\nApple announced iPhone OS 1 at the iPhone keynote on January 9, 2007, and it was released to the public alongside the original iPhone on June 29, 2007. No official name was given on its initial release; Apple marketing literature simply stated the iPhone runs a version of Apple's desktop operating system, OS X.[10] The release of iPhone OS 1.1 brought support for the iPod touch (1st generation). iPhone OS 1.1.5 is the final version of iPhone OS 1.

The final release supported on the original iPhone and iPod Touch is iPhone OS 3.1.3.[37] The first iPad was introduced along with iPhone OS 3.2.[38] Support of iPhone OS 3 ended in 2012.\\r\\nLimited support on iPhone (1st generation) and iPod Touch (1st generation)\\r\\n04.26.08 P2 P3\\r\\n04.26.08 P2 P3\\r\\nLimited support on iPhone (1st generation) and iPod Touch (1st generation)\\r\\n7C145 T1 T2 T3\\r\\n7C146 T3\\r\\n05.11.07P2 P3\\r\\n05.11.07P2 P3\\r\\n05.12.01 P2 P3\\r\\nApple announced iOS 4 in March 2010 and it was released to the public on June 21, 2010 alongside the iPhone 4. With this release, Apple dropped support for the original iPhone and iPod touch, the first time they had done this. All other devices from the iPhone 3G onwards and the iPod touch (2nd generation) onward are supported. However, iOS 4 has limited support for the iPhone 3G and iPod Touch (2nd generation), as they lack of multitasking capabilities and the ability to set a home screen wallpaper. It is also the first major iOS release that iPod Touch users did not have to pay for. The release of iOS 4.2.1 brought compatibility to the original iPad and is the final supported release on the iPhone 3G and iPod touch (2nd generation) due to major performance issues. The release of iOS 4.3 brought iPad 2 compatibility.[52][53] Support of iOS 4 ended in 2014.\\r\\nLimited support on iPhone 3G and iPod Touch (2nd generation)\\r\\n01.59.00 P4\\r\\n01.59.00 P4\\r\\n01.59.00 P4\\r\\nLimited support on iPhone 3G and iPod Touch (2nd generation)\\r\\n02.10.04 P4\\r\\nLimited support on iPhone 3G and iPod Touch (2nd generation)\\r\\n8C148a P3\\r\\n03.10.01 P4\\r\\n07.10.00 S1C\\r\\niOS 4.2 was replaced because of a Wi-Fi bug in beta 3, causing Apple to release two golden master candidates (4.2 GM and 4.2.1 GM)\\r\\nCDMA (Verizon) iPhone 4 only\\r\\nThis version was deployed with demo and review units only.[73][74]\\r\\nBug fixes\\r\\nUpdate released before public launch of CDMA iPhone 4.[73]\\r\\nBug fixes\\r\\nSecurity Updates\\r\\nSecurity Update\\r\\n8F191 S2 S2C S2D\\r\\n04.10.01 P4 S2C\\r\\n07.11.00 S1C\\r\\n2.0.4 S2D\\r\\n04.10.01 P4 S2C\\r\\n07.11.01 S1C\\r\\n2.0.4 S2D\\r\\n8H8S2D\\r\\n04.10.01 P4 S2C\\r\\n07.11.01 S1C\\r\\n2.0.4 S2D\\r\\n8J3S1 S1C\\r\\n04.10.01 P4 S2C\\r\\n07.11.01 S1C\\r\\n2.0.4 S2D\\r\\nThis update contains changes to the iOS crowd-sourced location database cache.\\r\\n04.10.01 P4 S2C\\r\\n07.11.01 S1C\\r\\n2.0.4 S2D\\r\\n2.0.4 S2D\\r\\nApple announced iOS 5 on June 6, 2011 at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, and it was released to the public on October 12, 2011 alongside the IPhone 4S.[77] Apple did not drop support for any devices with this release, as this had already been done with the release of iOS 4.3 seven months earlier.

Despite Apple's promise of better performance on these devices, there were still widespread complaints that the issue had not been fixed. iOS 9.3.5 is the final release on the iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPad (3rd generation), iPod Touch (5th generation) and iPad Mini (1st generation)\\r\\nLimited support on iPad 2, iPad (3rd generation), iPad Mini (1st generation), iPhone 4S, and iPod Touch (5th generation)[124]\\r\\n13A342 P6S\\r\\n13A343 P6SP\\r\\n13A344P4S P5 P5C P5S P6 P6P T5 T6 S2 S2C S2D S3 S3L S3D S4 S4L S4D S5 S5L S5D S6 S6L S6D M1 M1C M2 M2C M3 M3C\\r\\n3.0.04 S2D\\r\\n5.3.04 P4S\\r\\n5.2.03 S3L S3D\\r\\n10.00.00 P5 S4L S4D M1C\\r\\n5.00.11 P5C\\r\\n6.00.00 P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n4.01.00 P6 P6P M4C\\r\\n1.00.05 P6S P6SP\\r\\n13A405 P6S P6SP\\r\\n3.0.04 S2D\\r\\n10.00.00 P5 S4L S4D M1C\\r\\n6.00.00 S3L S3D P4S P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n4.01.00 P6 P6P M4C\\r\\n1.00.05 P6S P6SP\\r\\nSeptember?24, 2015; 2 years ago?(2015-09-24) (13A405)\\r\\n3.0.04 S2D\\r\\n10.00.00 P5 S4L S4D M1C\\r\\n6.00.00 S3L S3D P4S P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n4.01.00 P6 P6P M4C\\r\\n1.00.05 P6S P6SP\\r\\nLimited support on iPad 2, iPad (3rd generation), iPad Mini (1st generation), iPhone 4S, and iPod Touch (5th generation)[124]\\r\\n3.0.04 S2D\\r\\n10.00.00 P5 S4L S4D M1C\\r\\n6.0.00 S3L S3D P4S\\r\\n6.01.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n4.32.00 P6 P6P\\r\\n1.14.00 R1C P6S P6SP\\r\\nLimited support on iPad 2, iPad (3rd generation), iPad Mini (1st generation), iPhone 4S, and iPod Touch (5th generation)[124]\\r\\n3.0.04 S2D\\r\\n10.00.00 P5 S4L S4D M1C\\r\\n6.0.00 S3L S3D P4S\\r\\n6.01.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n4.52.00 P6 P6P M4C\\r\\n1.23.00 R1C P6S P6SP\\r\\n13D20 P6 P6P P6S P6SP M3 M3C M4 M4C R1 R1C S6 S6L\\r\\n3.0.04 S2D\\r\\n10.00.00 P5 S4L S4D M1C\\r\\n6.0.00 S3L S3D P4S\\r\\n6.01.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n4.52.00 P6 P6P M4C\\r\\n1.23.00 R1C P6S P6SP\\r\\nLimited support on iPad 2, iPad (3rd generation), iPad Mini (1st generation), iPhone 4S, and iPod Touch (5th generation)[124]\\r\\n13E234 R2 R2C P6S P6SP\\r\\n13E236 S2C\\r\\n13E237 P4S P5 P5C P5S[136]\\r\\n3.0.04 S2D\\r\\n10.01.00 P5 S4L S4D M1C\\r\\n6.1.00 S3L S3D\\r\\n6.0.00 P4S\\r\\n6.02.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n4.71.00 R1C P6 P6P M4C\\r\\n1.60.00 R2C P6S P6SP\\r\\nMarch?25, 2016; 2 years ago?(2016-03-25) (13E236)\\r\\nMarch?28, 2016; 2 years ago?(2016-03-28) (13E237)\\r\\n3.0.04 S2D\\r\\n10.01.00 P5 S4L S4D M1C\\r\\n6.1.00 S3L S3D\\r\\n6.0.00 P4S\\r\\n6.02.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n4.71.00 R1C P6 P6P M4C\\r\\n1.60.00 R2C P6S P6SP\\r\\n13F72 R2 R2C\\r\\n3.0.04 S2D\\r\\n10.01.00 P5 S4L S4D M1C\\r\\n6.1.00 S3L S3D\\r\\n6.0.00 P4S\\r\\n6.02.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n4.71.00 R1C P6 P6P M4C\\r\\n1.60.00 R2C P6S P6SP\\r\\n3.0.04 S2D\\r\\n10.01.00 P5 S4L S4D M1C\\r\\n6.1.00 S3L S3D\\r\\n6.0.00 P4S\\r\\n6.02.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n4.71.00 R1C P6 P6P M4C\\r\\n1.60.00 R2C P6S P6SP\\r\\n3.0.04 S2D\\r\\n10.01.00 P5 S4L S4D M1C\\r\\n6.1.00 S3L S3D\\r\\n6.0.00 P4S\\r\\n6.02.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n4.71.00 R1C P6 P6P M4C\\r\\n1.60.00 R2C P6S P6SP\\r\\n3.0.04 S2D\\r\\n10.01.00 P5 S4L S4D M1C\\r\\n6.1.00 S3L S3D\\r\\n6.0.00 P4S\\r\\n6.02.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n4.71.00 R1C P6 P6P M4C\\r\\n1.60.00 R2C P6S P6SP\\r\\nApple announced iOS 10 on June 13, 2016, at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, and it was released to the public on September 13, 2016 alongside the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. With this release, Apple dropped support for devices using an A5 or A5X processor: the iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPad (3rd generation), iPad Mini (1st generation) and iPod Touch (5th generation). All other devices from the iPhone 5 onwards, iPod touch (6th generation) onwards, iPad (4th generation) onwards, and the iPad mini 2 onwards are supported. However, iOS 10 has limited support on the iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and iPad (4th generation),[citation needed] because those devices have 32-bit processors.[citation needed] The release of iOS 10.2.1 brought support for the iPad (5th generation), and iOS 10.3.2 brought support for the iPad Pro (10.5-inch) and the iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 2nd generation). iOS 10.3.3 is the final supported release for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and iPad (4th generation) and last iOS version to run on 32-bit processors.\\r\\n7.01.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n5.24.00 P6 P6P S6L R1C M4C PSE\\r\\n2.30.00 P6S P6SP R2C\\r\\n1.00.02 P7I P7PI\\r\\n1.00.03 P7Q P7PQ\\r\\n7.01.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n5.24.00 P6 P6P S6L R1C M4C PSE\\r\\n2.30.00 P6S P6SP R2C\\r\\n1.00.03 P7I P7PI\\r\\n1.00.04 P7Q P7PQ\\r\\nLimited support on iPad (4th generation), iPhone 5, and iPhone 5C\\r\\n14B72c P7I P7Q P7PI P7PQ\\r\\n7.01.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n5.26.00 P6 P6P S6L R1C M4C PSE\\r\\n2.36.00 P6S P6SP R2C\\r\\n1.01.13 P7I P7PI\\r\\n1.25.00 P7Q P7PQ\\r\\n14B150\\r\\n7.01.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n5.26.00 P6 P6P S6L R1C M4C PSE\\r\\n2.36.00 P6S P6SP R2C\\r\\n1.01.15 P7I P7PI\\r\\n1.25.00 P7Q P7PQ\\r\\nNovember?9, 2016; 18 months ago?(2016-11-09) (14B150)\\r\\nLimited support on iPad (4th generation), iPhone 5, and iPhone 5C\\r\\n7.21.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n5.32.00 P6 P6P S6L R1C M4C PSE\\r\\n2.41.00 P6S P6SP R2C\\r\\n1.02.15 P7I P7PI\\r\\n1.33.00 P7Q P7PQ\\r\\n7.21.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n5.32.00 P6 P6P S6L R1C M4C PSE\\r\\n2.41.00 P6S P6SP R2C\\r\\n1.02.15 P7I P7PI\\r\\n1.33.00 P7Q P7PQ\\r\\nInitial release on iPad\\r\\nLimited support on iPad (4th generation), iPhone 5, and iPhone 5C\\r\\n7.51.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n5.51.00 P6 P6P S6L S7L R1C M4C PSE\\r\\n2.54.00 P6S P6SP R2C\\r\\n1.03.21 P7I P7PI\\r\\n1.59.02 P7Q P7PQ\\r\\n7.51.00 P5C P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n5.51.00 P6 P6P S6L S7L R1C M4C PSE\\r\\n2.54.00 P6S P6SP R2C\\r\\n1.03.21 P7I P7PI\\r\\n1.59.02 P7Q P7PQ\\r\\nFixed in this release:\\r\\n14F8089R3C R4C\\r\\n14F90S7 S7L\\r\\n14F91M4C\\r\\n7.60.00 P5S S5L S5D M2C M3C\\r\\n5.62.00 P6 P6P S6L S7L R1C M4C PSE\\r\\n2.61.00 P6S P6SP R2C\\r\\n1.03.50 P7I P7PI\\r\\n1.81.01 P7Q P7PQ R3C R4C\\r\\nInitial release on iPad Pro 10.5\\" and 12.9\\" (2nd generation)\\r\\nSecurity and Bug Fixes\\r\\n6.17.00 P6 P6P S6L S7L R1C M4C PSE\\r\\n4.00.01 P6S P6SP R2C\\r\\n1.03.60 P7I P7PI\\r\\n1.91.00 P7Q P7PQ R3C R4C\\r\\nApple announced iOS 11 on June 5, 2017, at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, and it was released to the public on September 19, 2017 alongside the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.

The first bug noticed was the \\"DST bug\\" which was first seen when some countries switched to/from daylight saving time from/to standard time in October/November 2010.[152][153] It caused recurring alarms to start going off an hour too early or late. Apple promised the bug would be fixed in iOS 4.2 but according to some reports it still exists even in iOS 4.3.1.[154]\\r\\nThe second alarm clock bug discovered was the \\"New Year's Day bug\\" which showed up on January 1, 2011 and January 1, 2012. It caused non-recurring alarms to never work.[155] However two days after each New Year's Day, on January 3, 2011, they \\"magically\\" started working again. This bug was seemingly fixed in iOS 4.3.[156]\\r\\nApple confirmed that several battery life bugs were negatively affecting battery life in iOS 5.[157] They attempted to fix these bugs with iOS 5.0.1 and 5.1 but the problem still remained.[158] Finally, these bugs were fixed in iOS 5.1.1.\\r\\nThe launch of the iOS 5 update on October 12, 2011 (including iOS 5.0.1 released on November 10, 2011), led many users to report a major bug causing the device to lose Wi-Fi access. This problem has supposedly been fixed with the release of iOS 5.1.1[159][160]\\r\\nSome users of the iPhone 4S and iPad (Wi-Fi + Cellular) reported issues with the SIM card in iOS 5.0,[161] and even though Apple attempted to fix these issues in version 5.0.1 build 9A406 (for iPhone 4S only), they still remained.[162]\\r\\nSome users of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S reported issues with having echo problems during phone call in the initial release of iOS 5, which causes echoes to appear randomly during phone calls made through earbuds. The other party in the call is generally unable to hear the conversation due to this problem.[163] Apple has since released version 5.1.1 in an attempt to fix the problem.\\r\\nApple has admitted that there were several bugs in the mapping app on iOS 6, with cities in the wrong location, some places being missed off altogether, some places misnamed and places of interest in the sea.[164][165][166] Problems submitted by users have gradually been addressed with daily updates to Maps.[167]\\r\\nMany users report a problem with Bluetooth audio streaming to a range of compatible devices. The sound cuts out every now and then for no apparent reason. As of October?2012[update], no solution has been provided by Apple.[168]\\r\\nLocation-based reminders do not work for iPads, even though they were promised to work on cellular enabled devices.[169] It has later been clarified by Apple that only the 4th generation iPad and the iPad Mini 1st generation or later will be able to use this.[170]\\r\\nIn iOS 6.1, users reported problems with cellular connectivity. This was addressed for the iPhone 4S in iOS 6.1.1 which \\"fixes an issue that could impact cellular performance and reliability for iPhone 4S.\\"[171]\\r\\nMany iPhone users experienced a bug with the Do Not Disturb feature when the calendar changed from 2012 to 2013. The feature would be left on past the scheduled time set by the user, allowing texts, notifications, and alarm settings to be missed. The bug was caused by a difference in formatting in the ISO calendar system versus the Gregorian calendar system.[172] Apple did not offer a quick software update for the bug, instead saying that the bug would fix itself on January 7, 2013.[173]\\r\\nAnother bug causes issues when iOS devices connect to a Microsoft Exchange server to retrieve email, resulting in message \\"mailbox server resources are consumed, log growth becomes excessive, memory and CPU use may increase significantly, and server performance is affected\\".[174] Microsoft have suggested several workarounds,[175] and Apple responded with a KnowledgeBase article describing the cause of the bug and a suggested temporary workaround, promising a fix in the near future,[176] which was then fixed with release of iOS 6.1.2.\\r\\nOn iPhones, another bug found in 6.1 allowing bypassing the lock screen's passcode to temporarily gain full access to the Phone app, by performing a specific sequence of actions on the phone that remained unfixed,[177] with Apple acknowledging the bug[178] and then addressed with release of iOS 6.1.3.\\r\\niPhone 5 users experienced dropped calls during the release of iOS 6.1.3 when there was an issue with the audio microphone profile. This also caused issues with many voice-over commands, including Siri, to get different results than expected or to fail easily. Apple fixed this bug with the release of iOS 6.1.4, which updated the audio speaker profile so users would get better results.\\r\\nShortly when Apple released iOS 7, users running iOS 6 were said to have problems using FaceTime. Apple later released a support document stating that this was due to an expired device certificate and that devices that support iOS 7 should update to it in order to resolve these issues.[179] Devices that are unable to run iOS 7, such as the fourth-generation iPod Touch, should upgrade to iOS 6.1.6.[179]\\r\\nAn attacker can collect or modify data in sessions protected by SSL/TLS protocols. This same bug was also reported on iOS 7.0.4 and iOS 7.0.5 for the iPhone 5C and 5S. For the iPhone 3GS and the iPod Touch 4th generation, iOS 6.1.6 was released to fix this issue since iOS 7 is not compatible with these devices (see iOS 7.x).\\r\\nPeople are able to bypass the \\"Enter Passcode\\" screen. This flaw was discovered within hours of it becoming publicly available. This is only able to be done on iPhone 5 and earlier while the iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S are safe from this bug. This is caused by the ability to use the control center via the lock screen and tapping on the camera or timer buttons. This feature can be turned off in the Settings app.[180] This was fixed in iOS 7.0.2.\\r\\nUsers complained about dizziness and vertigo-like symptoms when using this operating system because of parallax motion effects. In iOS 7.1, a new function in the Settings app named \\"Reduce Motion\\" was introduced to reduce the motion of the user interface and disable the parallax effects.[181]\\r\\nCreating a CardDAV Account contains a bug that needs manual fixing of the CardDAV-Server-URL.[182]\\r\\nIn iOS 7.1, users have reported seeing significant drain on their batteries after installing the new update.[183]\\r\\nIssues with video-calling and connection errors. This was fixed in iOS 7.0.4. (See iOS 6.x)\\r\\nLocal domain names can no longer be resolved in Safari.[184][185] This breaks short names on the local network, e.g. 'nas' for nas.<ourdomain>.\\r\\nUsers have reported various crashes of the home screen, the core service that renders the home screen icons, Notification Center, Control Center, Siri and the lockscreen.[186] This was fixed in iOS 7.1.\\r\\nSecure transport failed to validate the authenticity of connection. This issue was addressed by restoring missing validation steps. This may cause an attacker with a privileged network position to capture or modify data in sessions protected by SSL/TLS.[187] This issue was addressed by the release of iOS 7.0.6.\\r\\niPhone 4S users report experiencing problems with the battery indicator; the indicator will freeze at the same value until the iPhone is restarted again.[188][189]\\r\\nIn iOS 7.1, Touch ID was not functioning on the iPhone 5S. The problem cannot be resolved by turning Touch ID on and off in the \\"Fingerprint and Passcode\\" menu, restarting, resetting, or restoring the device using iTunes. This problem was similar to the iOS 8.0.1 release, which crippled iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus of both cellular and Touch ID. This was fixed in iOS 7.1.1.\\r\\nShortly after the release of iOS 8, Apple released a statement pointing out that a bug had been found in the operating system which prevented HealthKit-compatible apps from being released alongside iOS 8.[190] Apps already released that included Healthkit functionality were withdrawn from the App Store. iOS 8.0.1/8.0.2 included a fix for this issue.\\r\\niPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users who updated to iOS 8.0.1 wirelessly had cellular service and Touch ID disabled due to a software issue. Over-the-Air downloads of iOS 8.0.1 were stopped within an hour of the release of the software, but many early adopters had been affected.

A web server processes incoming network requests over the HTTP protocol (and several other related protocols).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients. The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content. \\r\\n\\r\\nA user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server's secondary storage, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is implemented.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting web forms, including uploading of files.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany generic web servers also support server-side scripting using Active Server Pages (ASP), PHP, or other scripting languages. This means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files, while the actual server software remains unchanged. Usually, this function is used to generate HTML documents dynamically (\\"on-the-fly\\") as opposed to returning static documents. The former is primarily used for retrieving or modifying information from databases. The latter is typically much faster and more easily cached but cannot deliver dynamic content.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeb servers are not only used for serving the World Wide Web. They can also be found embedded in devices such as printers, routers, webcams and serving only a local network. The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring or administering the device in question. This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer since only a web browser is required (which now is included with most operating systems).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989 Sir Tim Berners-Lee proposed a new project to his employer CERN, with the goal of easing the exchange of information between scientists by using a hypertext system.

Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case that decided that redistricting (attempts to change the way voting districts are delineated) issues present justiciable questions, thus enabling federal courts to intervene in and to decide redistricting cases. The defendants unsuccessfully argued that redistricting of legislative districts is a \\"political question\\", and hence not a question that may be resolved by federal courts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaintiff Charles Baker was a Republican who lived in Shelby County, Tennessee, and had served as the mayor of Millington, Tennessee, near Memphis.[1] The Tennessee State Constitution required that legislative districts for the Tennessee General Assembly be redrawn every ten years according to the federal census to provide for districts of substantially equal population (as was to be done for congressional districts). Baker's complaint was that Tennessee had not redistricted since 1901, in response to the 1900 census.\\r\\nBy the time of Baker's lawsuit, the population had shifted such that his district in Shelby County had about ten times as many residents as some of the rural districts. The votes of rural citizens were overrepresented compared to those of urban citizens. Baker's argument was that this discrepancy was causing him to fail to receive the \\"equal protection of the laws\\" required by the Fourteenth Amendment. Defendant Joe Carr was sued in his position as Secretary of State for Tennessee. Carr was not the person who set the district lines ÿ the state legislature had done that ÿ but was sued ex officio as the person who was ultimately responsible for the conduct of elections in the state and for the publication of district maps.\\r\\nThe state of Tennessee argued that the composition of legislative districts was essentially a political question, not a judicial one, as had been held by Colegrove v. Green, a plurality opinion of the Court in which Justice Felix Frankfurter declared that \\"Courts ought not to enter this political thicket.\\" Frankfurter believed that relief for legislative malapportionment had to be won through the political process.[2]\\r\\nThe decision of Baker v. Carr was one of the most wrenching in the Court's history. The case had to be put over for reargument because in conference no clear majority emerged for either side of the case. Associate Justice Charles Evans Whittaker was so torn over the case that he eventually had to recuse himself for health reasons. The arduous decisional process in Baker is often blamed for Whittaker's subsequent health problems, which forced him to retire from the Court in 1962.[3]\\r\\nThe opinion was finally handed down in March 1962, nearly a year after it was initially argued. The Court split 6 to 2 in ruling that Baker's case was justiciable, producing, in addition to the opinion of the Court by Justice William J. Brennan, three concurring opinions and two dissenting opinions. Brennan reformulated the political question doctrine, identifying six factors to help in determining which questions were \\"political\\" in nature. Cases that are political in nature are marked by:\\r\\nJustice Tom C. Clark switched his vote at the last minute to a concurrence on the substance of Baker's claims, which would have enabled a majority which could have granted relief for Baker. Instead the Supreme Court remanded the case to the District Court.\\r\\nThe large majority in this case can in many ways be attributed to Justice Brennan, who convinced Potter Stewart that the case was a narrow ruling dealing only with the right to challenge the statute. Brennan also talked down Justices Black and Douglas from their usual absolutist positions to achieve a compromise.[4]\\r\\nFrankfurter, joined by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, dissented vigorously and at length, arguing that the Court had cast aside history and judicial restraint, and violated the separation of powers between legislatures and Courts.[5] He wrote:\\r\\nAppellants invoke the right to vote and to have their votes counted. But they are permitted to vote and their votes are counted. They go to the polls, they cast their ballots, they send their representatives to the state councils. Their complaint is simply that the representatives are not sufficiently numerous or powerful.\\r\\nHaving declared redistricting issues justiciable in Baker, the court laid out a new test for evaluating such claims. The Court formulated the famous \\"one person, one vote\\" standard under American jurisprudence for legislative redistricting, holding that each individual had to be weighted equally in legislative apportionment. This affected numerous state legislatures that had not redistricted congressional districts for decades, despite major population shifts. It also ultimately affected the composition of state legislative districts as well, which in Alabama and numerous other states had overrepresented rural districts and underrepresented urban districts with much greater populations.\\r\\nThis principle was formally enunciated in Reynolds v. Sims (1964). The Court decided that in states with bicameral legislatures, as had Alabama, the state in this suit, both houses had to be apportioned on this standard. This voided the provision of the Alabama Constitution which had provided for two state senators from each county and similar provisions elsewhere. (Similarly, the Tennessee Constitution had a provision that prevented counties from being split and portions of a county being attached to other counties or parts of counties in the creation of a legislative district. This was overridden under the principle of basing districts on population. Today counties are frequently split among districts in forming Tennessee State Senate districts.) \\"One person, one vote\\" was first applied as a standard for Congressional districts. State legislatures were supposed to redistrict according to changes in population but many had not for decades.\\r\\nBaker v. Carr and subsequent cases fundamentally changed the nature of political representation in the United States, requiring not just Tennessee but nearly every state to redistrict during the 1960s, often several times. This re-apportionment increased the political power of urban areas with greater population and reduced the influence of more rural areas.[6] After he left the Court, Chief Justice Earl Warren called the Baker v. Carr line of cases the most important in his tenure as Chief Justice.[7]\\r\\n Works related to Baker v.

The U.S. involvement in South Vietnam stemmed from 20 long years of political and economic action. These had the common incentive of ending the growing communist domination in Vietnam. At the time, French forces, allies of the U.S., were backed by America  President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam. From the spring of 1950, their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia). Eventually, U.S. missions were carried out at a more constant rate by sending out increasing number of military assistance from the United States. Their main intent was to restrict the Communist domination that was present in the government of Vietnam as it would soon lead to a chain of neighbouring countries adopting the same. This would have resulted in a change in balance of power throughout Southeast Asia. Essentially, the U.S. saw their major security interests being disturbed due to the rise of the communist expansion and strived to take any measure to end it[1]. Estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000[2] to 3,812,000.[3] The conflict also resulted in 58,318 US soldiers dead.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb 1965 - Operation Rolling Thunder begins\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1961 the new administration of President John F. Kennedy remained essentially committed to the bi-partisan, anti-communist foreign policies inherited from the administrations of Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. During 1961, his first year in office, Kennedy found himself faced with a three-part crisis: The failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba; the construction of the Berlin Wall by the Soviets; and a negotiated settlement between the pro-Western government of Laos and the Pathet Lao communist movement. Fearing that another failure on the part of the U.S. to stop communist expansion would fatally damage U.S. credibility with its allies, Kennedy realized, \\"Now we have a problem in making our power credible... and Vietnam looks like the place.\\"[15] The commitment to defend South Vietnam was reaffirmed by Kennedy on May 11 in National Security Action Memorandum 52, which became known as \\"The Presidential Program for Vietnam\\". Its opening statement reads:\\r\\nU.S. objectives and concept of operations [are] to prevent communist domination of South Vietnam; to create in that country a viable and increasingly democratic society, and to initiate, on an accelerated basis, a series of mutually supporting actions of a military, political, economic, psychological, and covert character designed to achieve this objective.[16]\\r\\nKennedy was intrigued by the idea of utilizing United States Army Special Forces for counterinsurgency conflicts in Third World countries threatened by the new \\"wars of national liberation\\". Originally intended for use behind front lines after a conventional invasion of Europe, Kennedy believed that the guerrilla tactics employed by Special Forces would be effective in the \\"brush fire\\" war in South Vietnam. He saw British success in using such forces during the Malayan Emergency as a strategic template. Thus in May 1961 Kennedy sent detachments of Green Berets to South Vietnam to train South Vietnamese soldiers in guerrilla warfare.\\r\\nThe Di?m regime had been initially able to cope with the insurgency of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, or derogatively, Viet Cong) in South Vietnam with the aid of U.S. matriel and advisers, and, by 1962, seemed to be gaining the upper hand. Senior U.S. military leaders received positive reports from the U.S. commander, General Paul D. Harkins of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, or MACV. By the following year, however, cracks began to appear in the fa?ade of success. In January a possible victory that was turned into a stunning defeat for government forces at the Battle of Ap Bac caused consternation among both the military advisers in the field and among politicians in Washington, D.C. JFK also indicated to Walter Cronkite that the war may be unwinnable, and that it was ultimately a Vietnamese war, not an American war.[17]\\r\\nDi?m was already growing unpopular with many of his countrymen because of his administration's nepotism, corruption, and its apparent bias in favor of the Catholic minorityof which Di?m was a partat the expense of the Buddhist majority. This contributed to the impression of Di?m's rule as an extension of the French Colonial regime. Promised land reforms were not instituted, and Di?m's strategic hamlet program for village self-defense (and government control) was a disaster. The Kennedy administration grew increasingly frustrated with Di?m. In 1963, a crackdown by Di?m's forces was launched against Buddhist monks protesting discriminatory practices and demanding a political voice. Di?m's repression of the protests sparked the so-called Buddhist Revolt, during which several monks committed self-immolation, which was covered in the world press. The communists took full advantage of the situation and fueled anti-Di?m sentiment to create further instability.\\r\\nOn July 27, 1964, 5,000 additional U.S. military advisers were ordered to the Republic of Vietnam (RVN or South Vietnam), bringing the total American troop level to 21,000. Shortly thereafter an incident occurred off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) that was destined to escalate the conflict to new levels and lead to the full scale Americanization of the war.\\r\\nOn the evening of August 2, 1964, the destroyer USS?Maddox was conducting an electronic intelligence collection mission in international waters (even as claimed by North Vietnam) in the Gulf of Tonkin when it was attacked by three P-4 torpedo boats of the North Vietnamese Navy.[18] Reports later reached the Johnson administration saying that the Maddox was under attack. Two nights later, after being joined by the destroyer C. Turner Joy, the Maddox again reported that both vessels were under attack (this event, which took place under adverse weather conditions, in fact never occurred).[citation needed] Regardless, President Johnson addressed Congress asking for more political power to utilize American military forces in South Vietnam, using the attack on the Maddox as cause to get what he wanted.\\r\\nThere was rampant confusion in Washington, but the incident was seen by the administration as the perfect opportunity to present Congress with \\"a pre-dated declaration of war\\" in order to strengthen weakening morale in South Vietnam through reprisal attacks by the U.S. on the North.[19] Even before confirmation of the phantom attack had been received in Washington, President Johnson had decided that an attack could not go unanswered.\\r\\nJust before midnight he appeared on television and announced that retaliatory air strikes were underway against North Vietnamese naval and port facilities. Neither Congress nor the American people learned the whole story about the events in the Gulf of Tonkin until the publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1969. It was on the basis of the administration's assertions that the attacks were \\"unprovoked aggression\\" on the part of North Vietnam, that the United States Congress approved the Southeast Asia Resolution (also known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution) on August 7. The law gave the President broad powers to conduct military operations without an actual declaration of war. The resolution passed unanimously in the House of Representatives and was opposed in the Senate by only two members.\\r\\nNational Security Council members, including United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and General Maxwell Taylor, agreed on November 28 to recommend that Johnson adopt a plan for a two-stage escalation of the bombing of North Vietnam.\\r\\nIn February 1965, a U.S. air base at Pleiku, in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam, was attacked twice by the NLF, resulting in the deaths of over a dozen U.S. personnel. These guerrilla attacks prompted the administration to order retaliatory air strikes against North Vietnam.\\r\\nOperation Rolling Thunder was the code name given to a sustained strategic bombing campaign targeted against the North by aircraft of the U.S. Air Force and Navy that was inaugurated on March 2, 1965. Its original purpose was to bolster the morale of the South Vietnamese and to serve as a signaling device to Hanoi. U.S. airpower would act as a method of \\"strategic persuasion\\", deterring the North Vietnamese politically by the fear of continued or increased bombardment. Rolling Thunder gradually escalated in intensity, with aircraft striking only carefully selected targets. When that did not work, its goals were altered to destroying North Vietnam's will to fight by destroying the nation's industrial base, transportation network, and its (continually increasing) air defenses. After more than a million sorties were flown and three-quarters of a million tons of bombs were dropped, Rolling Thunder was ended on November 11, 1968.[20]\\r\\nOther aerial campaigns (Operation Barrel Roll, Operation Steel Tiger, Operation Tiger Hound, and Operation Commando Hunt) were directed to counter the flow of men and material down the PAVN logistical system that flowed from North Vietnam through southeastern Laos, and into South Vietnam known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.\\r\\nPresident Johnson had already appointed General William C. Westmoreland to succeed General Harkins as Commander of MACV in June 1964. Under Westmoreland, the expansion of American troop strength in South Vietnam took place. American forces rose from 16,000 during 1964 to more than 553,000 by 1969. With the U.S. decision to escalate its involvement, ANZUS Pact allies Australia and New Zealand agreed to contribute troops and matriel to the conflict. They were quickly joined by the Republic of Korea (second only to the Americans in troop strength), Thailand, and the Philippines. The U.S. paid for (through aid dollars) and logistically supplied all of the allied forces.\\r\\nMeanwhile, political affairs in Saigon were finally settling down  at least as far as the Americans were concerned. On February 14 the most recent military junta, the National Leadership Committee, installed Air Vice-Marshal Nguy?n Cao K? as prime minister. In 1966, the junta selected General Nguy?n V?n Thi?u to run for president with Ky on the ballot as the vice-presidential candidate in the 1967 election. Thieu and Ky were elected and remained in office for the duration of the war. In the presidential election of 1971, Thieu ran for the presidency unopposed. With the installation of the Thieu and Ky government (the Second Republic), the U.S. had a pliable, stable, and semi-legitimate government in Saigon with which to deal.\\r\\nWith the advent of Rolling Thunder, American airbases and facilities needed to be constructed and manned for the aerial effort. The defense of those bases would not be entrusted to the South Vietnamese. So, on March 8, 1965, 3,500 United States Marines came ashore at Da Nang as the first wave of U.S. combat troops into South Vietnam, adding to the 25,000 U.S. military advisers already in place. On May 5 the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade became the first U.S. Army ground unit committed to the conflict in South Vietnam. On August 18, Operation Starlite began as the first major U.S. ground operation, destroying an NLF stronghold in Qu?ng Ng?i Province. The NLF learned from their defeat and subsequently tried to avoid fighting an American-style ground war by reverting to small-unit guerrilla operations.\\r\\nThe North Vietnamese had already sent units of their regular army into southern Vietnam beginning in late 1964. Some officials in Hanoi had favored an immediate invasion of the South, and a plan was developed to use PAVN units to split southern Vietnam in half through the Central Highlands. The two imported adversaries first faced one another during Operation Silver Bayonet, better known as the Battle of the Ia Drang. During the savage fighting that took place, both sides learned important lessons. The North Vietnamese, who had taken horrendous casualties, began to adapt to the overwhelming American superiority in air mobility, supporting arms, and close air support by moving in as close as possible during confrontations, thereby negating the effects of the above. The Americans learned that PAVN (which was basically a light infantry force) was not a rag-tag band of guerrillas, but was instead a highly disciplined, proficient, and well motivated force.\\r\\nOn November 27, 1965, the Pentagon declared that if the major operations needed to neutralize North Vietnamese and NLF forces were to succeed, U.S. troop levels in South Vietnam would have to be increased from 120,000 to 400,000. In a series of meetings between Westmoreland and the President held in Honolulu in February 1966, Westmoreland argued that the U.S. presence had succeeded in preventing the immediate defeat of the South Vietnamese government but that more troops would be necessary if systematic offensive operations were to be conducted. The issue then became in what manner American forces would be used.\\r\\nThe nature of the American military's strategic and tactical decisions made during this period would color the conduct and nature of the conflict for the duration of the American commitment. Classical military logic demanded that the U.S. attack the locus of PAVN/NLF in the North. If that country could not be invaded, then the enemy's logistical system in Laos and Cambodia should be cut by ground forces, isolating the southern battlefield. However, political considerations limited U.S. military actions, mainly because of the memory of communist reactions during the Korean War. Ever present in the minds of diplomats, military officers, and politicians was the possibility of a spiraling escalation of the conflict into a superpower confrontation and the possibility of a nuclear exchange. Therefore, there would be no invasion of North Vietnam, the \\"neutrality\\" of Laos and Cambodia would be respected, and Rolling Thunder would not resemble the bombing of Germany and Japan during the Second World War.\\r\\nThese limitations were not foisted upon the military as an afterthought. Before the first U.S. soldiers came ashore at Da Nang, the Pentagon was cognizant of all of the parameters that would be imposed by their civilian leaders, yet they still agreed that the mission could be accomplished within them. Westmoreland believed that he had found a strategy that would either defeat North Vietnam or force it into serious negotiations. Attrition was to be the key. The general held that larger offensive operations would grind down the communists and eventually lead to a \\"crossover point\\" in PAVN/NLF casualties after which a decisive (or at least political) victory would be possible.\\r\\nIt is widely held that the average U.S. serviceman was nineteen years old, as evidenced by the casual reference in a pop song (\\"19\\" by Paul Hardcastle); the figure is cited by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman ret. of the Killology Research Group in his 1995 book On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society (p.?265). However, it is disputed by the[21] Vietnam Helicopter Flight Crew Network Website, which claims the average age of MOS 11B personnel was 22. This compares with 26 years of age for those who participated in World War II. Soldiers served a one-year tour of duty. The average age of the U.S. military men who died in Vietnam was 22.8 years old.[22]\\r\\nThe one-year tour of duty deprived units of experienced leadership. As one observer put it, \\"we were not in Vietnam for 10 years, but for one year 10 times.\\"[23] As a result, training programs were shortened. Some NCOs were referred to as \\"Shake 'N' Bake\\" to highlight their accelerated training. Unlike soldiers in World War II and Korea, there were no secure rear areas in which to get rest and relaxation.[citation needed] One unidentified soldier said to United Press International that there was nothing to do in Vietnam and therefore many of the men smoked marijuana. He said, \\"One of the biggest reasons that a lot of GIs do get high over here is there is nothing to do. This place is really a drag; it's a bore over here. Like right now sitting around here, we are getting loaded. Whereas, it doesn't really get you messed up; that's I guess the main reason why we smoke it.\\"[24]\\r\\nAmerican forces would conduct operations against PAVN forces, pushing them further back into the countryside away from the heavily populated coastal lowlands. In the backcountry the U.S. could fully utilize its superiority in firepower and mobility to bleed the enemy in set-piece battles. The cleaning-out of the NLF and the pacification of the villages would be the responsibility of the South Vietnamese military. The adoption of this strategy, however, brought Westmoreland into direct conflict with his Marine Corps commander, General Lewis W. Walt, who had already recognized the security of the villages as the key to success. Walt had immediately commenced pacification efforts in his area of responsibility, but Westmoreland was unhappy, believing that the Marines were being underutilized and fighting the wrong enemy. In the end, MACV won out and Westmoreland's search and destroy concept, predicated on the attrition of enemy forces, won the day.\\r\\nBoth sides chose similar strategies. PAVN, which had been operating a more conventional, large-unit war, switched back to small-unit operations in the face of U.S. military capabilities. The struggle moved to the villages, where the \\"hearts and minds\\" of the South Vietnamese peasants, whose cooperation was absolutely necessary to military success, would be won or lost. The U.S. had given responsibility for this struggle to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), whose troops and commanders were notoriously unfit for the task.\\r\\nFor the American soldier, whose doctrine was one of absolute commitment to total victory, this strategy led to a frustrating small-unit war. Most of the combat was conducted by units smaller than battalion-size (the majority at the platoon level). Since the goal of the operations was to kill the enemy, terrain was not taken and held as in previous wars. Savage fighting and the retreat of the communists was immediately followed by the abandonment of the terrain just seized. Combined with this was the anger and frustration engendered among American troops by the effective tactics of the NLF, who conducted a war of sniping, booby traps, mines, and terror against the Americans.\\r\\nAs a result of the conference held in Honolulu, President Johnson authorized an increase in troop strength to 429,000 by August 1966. The large increase in troops enabled MACV to carry out numerous operations that grew in size and complexity during the next two years. For U.S. troops participating in these operations (Operation Masher/White Wing, Operation Attleboro, Operation Cedar Falls, Operation Junction City and dozens of others) the war boiled down to hard marching through some of the most difficult terrain on the planet and weather conditions that were alternately hot and dry, or cold and wet. It was the PAVN/NLF that actually controlled the pace of the war, fighting only when their commanders believed that they had the upper hand and then disappearing when the Americans and/or ARVN brought their superiority in numbers and firepower to bear. North Vietnam, utilizing the Ho Chi Minh and Sihanouk Trails, matched the U.S. at every point of the escalation, funneling manpower and supplies to the southern battlefields.\\r\\nDuring the Vietnam War, the use of the helicopter, known as \\"Air Mobile\\", was an essential tool for conducting the war. In fact, the whole conduct and strategy of the war depended on it. Vietnam was the first time the helicopter was used on a major scale, and in such important roles. Search and destroy missions, for example, would have been nearly impossible without it. Helicopters allowed American commanders to move large numbers of troops to virtually anywhere, regardless of the terrain or roads. Troops could also be easily resupplied in remote areas. The helicopter also provided another new and vital capability: medical evacuation. It could fly wounded soldiers to aid stations very quickly, usually within the critical first hour. This gave wounded soldiers a higher chance of survival in Vietnam than in any previous war. The helicopter was also adapted for many other roles in Vietnam, including ground attack, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare. Without the helicopter, the war would have been fought very differently.[25]\\r\\nBy mid-1967, Westmoreland said that it was conceivable that U.S. forces could be phased out of the war within two years, turning over progressively more of the fighting to the ARVN.[26] That fall, however, savage fighting broke out in the northern provinces. Beginning below the DMZ at Con Tien and then spreading west to the Laotian border near Dak To, large PAVN forces began to stand their ground and fight. This willingness of the communists to remain fixed in place inspired MACV to send reinforcements from other sectors of South Vietnam. The Border Battles had begun.\\r\\nMost of the PAVN/NLF operational capability was possible only because of the unhindered movement of men along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. To threaten this flow of supplies, the Marine Corps established a combat base on the South Vietnamese side of the Laotian frontier, near the village of Khe Sanh. The U.S. used the base as a border surveillance position overlooking Route 9, the only east-west road that crossed the border in the province. Westmoreland also hoped to use the base as a jump-off point for any future incursion against the Trail system in Laos. During the spring of 1967, a series of small-unit actions near Khe Sanh prompted MACV to increase its forces. These small unit actions and increasing intelligence information indicated that the PAVN was building up significant forces just across the border.\\r\\nIndeed, PAVN was doing just that. Two regular divisions (and later elements of a third) were moving toward Khe Sanh, eventually surrounding the base and cutting off its only road access. Westmoreland, contrary to the advice of his Marine commanders, reinforced the outpost. As far as he was concerned, if the communists were willing to mass their forces for destruction by American air power, so much the better. He described the ideal outcome as a \\"Dien Bien Phu in reverse\\". MACV then launched the largest concentrated aerial bombardment effort of the conflict (Operation Niagara) to defend Khe Sanh. Another massive aerial effort was undertaken to keep the beleaguered Marines supplied. There were many comparisons (by the media, Americans military and political officials, and the North Vietnamese) to the possibility of PAVN staging a repeat of its victory at Dien Bien Phu, but the differences outweighed the similarities in any comparison.\\r\\nMACV used this opportunity to field its latest technology against the North Vietnamese. A sensor-driven, anti-infiltration system known as Operation Igloo White was in the process of being field tested in Laos as the siege of Khe Sanh began. Westmoreland ordered that it be employed to detect PAVN troop movements near the Marine base and the system worked well. By March, the long-awaited ground assault against the base had failed to materialize and communist forces began to melt back toward Laos. MACV (and future historians) were left with only questions. What was the goal of the PAVN? Was the siege a real attempt to stage another Dien Bien Phu? Or had the battles near the border (which eventually drew in half of MACV's maneuver battalions) been a diversion, meant to pull forces away from the cities, where another PAVN offensive would soon commence?\\r\\nGeneral Westmoreland's public reassurances that \\"the light at the end of the tunnel\\" was near were countered when, on January 30, 1968, PAVN and NLF forces broke the truce that accompanied the T?t holiday and mounted their largest offensive thus far, in hopes of sparking a general uprising among the South Vietnamese. These forces, ranging in size from small groups to entire regiments, attacked nearly every city and major military installation in South Vietnam. The Americans and South Vietnamese, initially surprised by the scope and scale of the offensive, quickly responded and inflicted severe casualties on their enemies. The NLF was essentially eliminated as a fighting force and the places of the dead within its ranks were increasingly filled by North Vietnamese.\\r\\nThe PAVN/NLF attacks were speedily and bloodily repulsed in virtually all areas except Saigon, where the fighting lasted for three days, and in the old imperial capital of Hu?, where it continued for a month. During the occupation of the historic city, 2,800 South Vietnamese were murdered by the NLF in the single worst massacre of the conflict. The hoped-for uprising never took place; indeed, the offensive drove some previously apathetic South Vietnamese to fight for the government. Another surprise for the communists was that the ARVN did not collapse under the onslaught, instead turning in a performance that pleased even its American patrons.\\r\\nAfter the Tet Offensive, influential news magazines and newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal, Time and The New York Times, increasingly began to characterize the war as a stalemate. What shocked and dismayed the American public was the realization that either it had been lied to or that the American military command had been dangerously overoptimistic in its appraisal of the situation in Vietnam. The public could not understand how such an attack was possible after being told for several years that victory was just around the corner. The Tet Offensive came to embody the growing credibility gap at the heart of U.S. government statements. These realizations and changing attitudes forced the American public (and politicians) to face hard realities and to reexamine their position in Southeast Asia. Moreover, the U.S. media coverage made it even more clear that an overall victory in Vietnam was not imminent. It also massively weakened the domestic support for the Johnson administration at the time[27]. The days of an open-ended commitment to the conflict were over.\\r\\nThe psychological impact of the Tet Offensive effectively ended the political career of Lyndon Johnson. On March 11, Senator Eugene McCarthy won 42 percent of the vote in the Democratic New Hampshire primary. Although Johnson was not on the ballot, commentators viewed this as a defeat for the President. Shortly thereafter, Senator Robert Kennedy announced his intention to seek the Democratic nomination for the 1968 presidential election. On March 31, in a speech that took America and the world by surprise, Johnson announced that \\"I shall not seek, and I will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your President\\" and pledged himself to devoting the rest of his term in office to the search for peace in Vietnam.[28] Johnson announced that he was limiting bombing of North Vietnam to just north of the Demilitarized Zone and that U.S. representatives were prepared to meet with North Vietnamese counterparts in any suitable place \\"to discuss the means to bring this ugly war to an end\\". A few days later, much to Johnson's surprise, North Vietnam agreed to contacts between the two sides. On May 13, what became known as the Paris peace talks began.[29]\\r\\nOn March 16, 1968, three companies of Task Force Barker, part of the Americal Division, took part in a search and destroy operation near the village of My Lai, in Qu?ng Nam Province. Although not all of the members of the company participated, a significant number of them, led by Calley, did. He personally ordered the executions of hundreds of villagers in large groups. The killings ended only when an American helicopter crew, headed by Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson, Jr., discovered Calley's unit in the act and threatened to attack them with his aircraft's weapons unless they stopped. One of the soldiers on the scene was Ron Haeberle, a photographer for the newspaper Stars and Stripes, who took unobtrusive official black-and-white photos of the operation through the lens of his military-issued camera and color shots of the massacre with his personal camera. Although the operation appeared suspicious to Calley's superiors, it was forgotten.\\r\\nIn 1969, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh exposed the My Lai massacre in print, and the Haeberle photos were released to the world media. The Pentagon launched an investigation headed by General William R. Peers to look into the allegations. After a flurry of activity, the Peers Commission issued its report. It declared that \\"an atmosphere of atrocity\\" surrounded the event, concluding that a massacre had taken place and the crime had been covered up by the commander of the Americal Division and his executive officer. Perhaps 400 Vietnamese civilians, mostly old men, women, and children had been killed by Charlie company. Several men were charged in the killings, but only Calley was convicted. He was given a life sentence by a court-martial in 1970, but after numerous appeals he was finally set free; he had served just over three years of house arrest.\\r\\nAlthough My Lai generated a lot of civilian recriminations and bad publicity for the military, it was not the only massacre. The Vietnam War Crimes Working Group Files made public in 1994 by the \\"Freedom of Information Act\\" reveal seven, albeit much smaller, massacres previously unacknowledged by the Pentagon, in which at least 137 civilians had died.[1] Cover-ups may have occurred in other cases, as detailed in the Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles concerning the Tiger Force of the 101st Airborne Division by the Toledo Blade in 2003.\\r\\nRichard Nixon had campaigned in the 1968 presidential election under the slogan that he would end the war in Vietnam and bring \\"peace with honor\\". However, there was no plan to do this, and the American commitment continued for another five years. The goal of the American military effort was to buy time, gradually building up the strength of the South Vietnamese armed forces, and re-equipping it with modern weapons so that they could defend their nation on their own. This policy became the cornerstone of the so-called Nixon Doctrine. As applied to Vietnam, it was labeled Vietnamization.\\r\\nNixon's papers show that in 1968, as a presidential candidate, he ordered Anna Chennault, his liaison to the South Vietnam government, to persuade them to refuse a cease-fire being brokered by President Lyndon Johnson. This action violated the Logan Act, banning private citizens from intruding into official government negotiations with a foreign nation, and has been said to constitute treason.[30]\\r\\nSoon after Tet, General Westmoreland was promoted to Army Chief of Staff and he was replaced by his deputy, General Creighton W. Abrams. Because of the change in American strategy posed by Vietnamization, Abrams pursued a very different approach. The U.S. was gradually withdrawing from the conflict, and Abrams favored smaller-scale operations aimed at PAVN/NLF logistics, more openness with the media, less indiscriminate use of American firepower, elimination of the body count as the key indicator of battlefield success, and more meaningful cooperation with South Vietnamese forces.\\r\\nVietnamization of the war, however, created a dilemma for U.S. forces: the strategy required that U.S. troops fight long enough for the ARVN to improve enough to hold its own against Communist forces. Morale in the U.S. ranks rapidly declined during 1969ÿ1972, as evidenced by declining discipline, worsening drug use among soldiers, and increased \\"fraggings\\" of U.S. officers by disgruntled troops.\\r\\nOne of Nixon's main foreign policy goals had been the achievement of a breakthrough in U.S. relations with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. An avowed anti-communist since early in his political career, Nixon could make diplomatic overtures to the communists without being accused of being \\"soft on communism\\". The result of his overtures was an era of dtente that led to nuclear arms reductions by the U.S. and Soviet Union and the beginning of a dialogue with China. In this context, Nixon viewed Vietnam as simply another limited conflict forming part of the larger tapestry of superpower relations; however, he was still determined to preserve South Vietnam until such time as he could not be blamed for what he saw as its inevitable collapse (or a \\"decent interval\\", as it was known). To this end he and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger employed Chinese and Soviet foreign policy gambits to successfully defuse some of the anti-war opposition at home and secured movement at the negotiations that had begun in Paris.\\r\\nChina and the Soviet Union had been the principal backers of North Vietnam's effort through large-scale military and financial aid. The two communist superpowers had competed with one another to prove their \\"fraternal socialist links\\" with the regime in Hanoi. The North Vietnamese had become adept at playing the two nations off against one another. Even with Nixon's rapprochement, their support of North Vietnam increased significantly in the years leading up to the U.S. departure in 1973, enabling the North Vietnamese to mount full-scale conventional offensives against the South, complete with tanks, heavy artillery, and the most modern surface-to-air missiles.\\r\\nThe credibility of the U.S. government again suffered in 1971 when The New York Times, The Washington Post and other newspapers serially published The Pentagon Papers (actually U.S.-Vietnam Relations, 1945ÿ1967). This top-secret historical study of the American commitment in Vietnam, from the Franklin Roosevelt administration until 1967, had been contracted to the RAND Corporation by Secretary of Defense McNamara. The documents were leaked to the press by Daniel Ellsberg, a former State Department official who had worked on the study.\\r\\nThe Pentagon Papers laid out the missteps taken by four administrations in their Vietnam policies. For example, they revealed the Johnson administration's obfuscations to Congress concerning the Gulf of Tonkin incidents that had led to direct U.S. intervention; they exposed the clandestine bombing of Laos that had begun in 1964; and they detailed the American government's complicity in the death of Ng? ?nh Di?m. The study presented a continuously pessimistic view of the likelihood of victory and generated fierce criticism of U.S. policies.\\r\\nThe importance of the actual content of the papers to U.S. policy-making was disputed, but the window that they provided into the flawed decision-making process at the highest levels of the U.S. government opened the issue for other questions. Their publication was a news event and the government's legal (Nixon lost to the Supreme Court) and extra-legal efforts (the \\"Plumbers\\" break-in at the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist committed to gain material to discredit him, was one of the first steps on the road to Watergate) carried out to prevent their publicationmainly on national security groundsthen went on to generate yet more criticism and suspicion of the government by the American public.\\r\\nBy 1969 the policy of non-alignment and neutrality had worn thin for Prince Sihanouk, ruler of Cambodia. Pressures from the right in Cambodia caused the prince to begin a shift away from the pro-left position he had assumed in 1965ÿ1966. He began to make overtures for normalized relations with the U.S. and created a Government of National Salvation with the assistance of the pro-American General Lon Nol. Seeing a shift in the prince's position, President Nixon ordered the launching of a top-secret bombing campaign, targeted at the PAVN/NLF Base Areas and sanctuaries along Cambodia's eastern border.\\r\\nOn March 18, 1970, Sihanouk, who was out of the country on a state visit, was deposed by a vote of the National Assembly and replaced by General Lon Nol. Cambodia's ports were immediately closed to North Vietnamese military supplies, and the government demanded that PAVN/NLF forces be removed from the border areas within 72 hours. On March 29, 1970, the Vietnamese had taken matters into their own hands and launched an offensive against the Cambodian army. A force of North Vietnamese quickly overran large parts of eastern Cambodia reaching to within 15 miles (24?km) of Phnom Penh allowing their allies, the Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge to extend their power. Nixon ordered a military incursion into Cambodia by U.S. and ARVN troops in order to both destroy PAVN/NLF sanctuaries bordering South Vietnam and to buy time for the U.S. withdrawal. During the Cambodian Campaign, U.S. and ARVN forces discovered and removed or destroyed a huge logistical and intelligence haul in Cambodia.\\r\\nThe incursion also sparked large-scale demonstrations on and closures of American college campuses. The expansion of the conflict into Cambodia was seen as an expansion of the conflict into yet another country, nullifying Nixon's promises of de-escalating the war. During the ensuing protests, four students were killed and a score were wounded by Ohio National Guardsmen during a demonstration at Kent State University. Two other students were killed at Jackson State University in Mississippi. In an effort to lessen opposition to the U.S. commitment, Nixon announced on October 12 that the U.S. would withdraw 40,000 more troops from Vietnam before Christmas.\\r\\nFollowing the coup, Sihanouk arrived in Beijing, where he established and headed a government in exile, throwing his substantial personal support behind the Khmer Rouge, the North Vietnamese, and the Laotian Pathet Lao.\\r\\nIn 1971 the U.S. authorized the ARVN to carry out an offensive operation aimed at cutting the Ho Chi Minh Trail in southeastern Laos. Besides attacking the PAVN logistical system (which would buy time for the U.S. withdrawal) the incursion would be a significant test of Vietnamization. Backed by U.S. air and artillery support (American troops were forbidden to enter Laos), the ARVN moved across the border along Route 9, utilizing the abandoned Marine outpost of Khe Sanh as a jumping-off point. At first, the incursion went well, but unlike the Cambodian operation of 1970, the PAVN decided to stand and fight, finally mustering around 60,000 men on the battlefield.\\r\\nThe North Vietnamese first struck the flanks of the ARVN column, smashed its outposts, and then moved in on the main ARVN force. Unlike previous encounters during the conflict, the PAVN fielded armored formations, heavy artillery, and large amounts of the latest anti-aircraft artillery. After two months of savage fighting, the ARVN retreated back across the border, closely pursued by the North Vietnamese. One half of the invasion force was killed or captured during the operation, and Vietnamization was seen as a failure.\\r\\nOn August 18, Australia and New Zealand decided to withdraw their troops from the conflict. The total number of U.S. forces in South Vietnam dropped to 196,700 on October 29, 1971, the lowest level since January 1966. On November 12, 1971, Nixon set a February 1, 1972 deadline for the removal of another 45,000 troops.\\r\\nVietnamization received another severe test in the spring of 1972 when the North Vietnamese launched a massive conventional offensive across the Demilitarized Zone. Beginning on March 30, the Easter Offensive (known as the Nguy?n Hu? Offensive to the North Vietnamese) quickly overran the three northernmost provinces of South Vietnam, including the provincial capital of Qu?ng Tr? City. PAVN forces then drove south toward Hu?.\\r\\nEarly in April, PAVN opened two additional operations. The first, a three-division thrust supported by tanks and heavy artillery, advanced out of Cambodia on April 5. The North Vietnamese seized the town of Loc Ninh and advanced toward the provincial capital of An L?c in Bnh Long Province. The second new offensive, launched from the tri-border region into the Central Highlands, seized a complex of ARVN outposts near Dak To and then advanced toward Kon Tum, threatening to split South Vietnam in two.\\r\\nThe U.S. countered with a buildup of American airpower to support ARVN defensive operations and to conduct Operation Linebacker, the first offensive bombing of North Vietnam since Rolling Thunder had been terminated in 1968. The PAVN attacks against Hu?, An L?c, and Kon Tum were contained and the ARVN launched a counteroffensive in May to retake the lost northern provinces. On September 10, the South Vietnamese flag once again flew over the ruins of the Citadel of Qu?ng Tr? City, but the ARVN offensive then ran out of steam, conceding the rest of the occupied territory to the North Vietnamese. South Vietnam had countered the heaviest attack since Tet, but it was very evident that it was totally dependent on U.S. airpower for its survival. Meanwhile, the withdrawal of American troops, who numbered less than 100,000 at the beginning of the year, was continued as scheduled. By June only six infantry battalions remained. On August 12, the last American ground combat division left the country. However, the U.S. continued to operate the base At Long Binh. Combat patrols continued there until November 11 when the U.S. handed over the base to the South Vietnamese. After this, only 24,000 American troops remained in Vietnam and President Nixon announced that they would stay there until all U.S. POW's were freed.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the North Vietnamese invasion, the media, including conservative commentator William F. Buckley, predicted the downfall of the Republic of Vietnam; Buckley even called for the firing of General Creighton Abrams as an incompetent military leader. But the ARVN succeeded in defeating General Giap and his huge invading army. His forces were shattered at the Battle of An L?c, where he threw several divisions at the entrenched South Vietnamese forces, ultimately losing over half of his army as casualties. General Giap's loss and subsequent retreat was viewed as so great a failure by the North Vietnamese Communist Party that Giap was relieved of his command. Although ARVN troops withstood and repelled the massive PAVN attack at An L?c, American air power seems to have been a key to the ARVN success, just as it had been a key factor in supporting U.S. ground forces when they operated in South Vietnam prior to 1972. Thus, the 1973 withdrawal of U.S. military support and passage of Congressional resolutions cutting off U.S. funding for combat activities in Indochina (H.R. 9055 and H.J.Res. 636) opened the way for the 1975 defeat of the Republic of Vietnam.\\r\\nDuring the run-up to the 1972 presidential election, the war was once again a major issue. An antiwar Democrat, George McGovern, ran against President Nixon. The president ended Operation Linebacker on October 22 after the negotiating deadlock was broken and a tentative agreement had been hammered out by U.S. and North Vietnamese representatives at the peace negotiations in Paris. The head of the U.S. negotiating team, Henry Kissinger, declared that \\"peace is at hand\\" shortly before election day, dealing a death blow to McGovern's already doomed campaign. Kissinger had not, however, counted on the intransigence of South Vietnamese President Thieu, who refused to accept the agreement and demanded some 90 changes in its text. These the North Vietnamese refused to accept, and Nixon was not inclined to put too much pressure on Thieu just before the election, even though his victory was all but assured. The mood between the U.S. and North further turned sour when Hanoi went public with the details of the agreement. The Nixon Administration claimed that North Vietnamese negotiators had used the pronouncement as an opportunity to embarrass the President and to weaken the United States. White House Press Secretary Ron Ziegler told the press on November 30 that there would be no more public announcements concerning U.S. troop withdrawals from Vietnam since force levels were down to 27,000.\\r\\nBecause of Thieu's unhappiness with the agreement, primarily the stipulation that North Vietnamese troops could remain \\"in place\\" on South Vietnamese soil, the negotiations in Paris stalled as Hanoi refused to accept Thieu's changes and retaliated with amendments of its own. To reassure Thieu of American resolve, Nixon ordered a massive bombing campaign against North Vietnam utilizing B-52s and tactical aircraft in Operation Linebacker II, which began on December 18 with large raids against both Hanoi and the port of Haiphong. Nixon justified his actions by blaming the impasse in negotiations on the North Vietnamese, causing one commentator to describe his actions as \\"War by tantrum\\". Although this heavy bombing campaign caused protests, both domestically and internationally, and despite significant aircraft losses over North Vietnam, Nixon continued the operation until December 29. He also exerted pressure on Thieu to accept the terms of the agreement reached in October.\\r\\nOn January 15, 1973, citing progress in peace negotiations, Nixon announced the suspension of all offensive actions against North Vietnam, to be followed by a unilateral withdrawal of all U.S. troops. The Paris Peace Accords on \\"Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam\\" were signed on January 27, officially ending direct U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.\\r\\nThe agreement called for the withdrawal of all U.S. personnel and an exchange of prisoners of war. Within South Vietnam, a cease-fire was declared (to be overseen by a multi-national, 1,160-man International Control Commission force) and both ARVN and PAVN/NLF forces would remain in control of the areas they then occupied, effectively partitioning South Vietnam. Both sides pledged to work toward a compromise political solution, possibly resulting in a coalition government. To maximize the area under their control, both sides in South Vietnam almost immediately engaged in land-grabbing military operations, which turned into flashpoints. The signing of the Accords was the main motivation for the awarding of the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize to Henry Kissinger and to leading North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho. A separate cease-fire had been installed in Laos in February. Five days before the signing of the agreement in Paris, President Lyndon Johnson, whose presidency had been tainted with the Vietnam issue, died.\\r\\nThe first U.S. prisoners of war were released by North Vietnam on February 11, and all U.S. military personnel were ordered to leave South Vietnam by March 29. As an inducement for Thieu's government to sign the agreement, Nixon had promised that the U.S. would provide financial and limited military support (in the form of air strikes) so that the South would not be overrun. But Nixon was fighting for his political life in the growing Watergate scandal and facing an increasingly hostile Congress that withheld funding. The President was able to exert little influence on a hostile public long sick of the Vietnam War.\\r\\nThus, Nixon (or his successor Gerald Ford) was unable to fulfill his promises to Thieu. At the same time, aid to North Vietnam from the Soviet Union increased. With the U.S. no longer heavily involved, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union no longer saw the war as significant to their relations. The balance of power shifted decisively in North Vietnam's favor, and the North subsequently launched a major military offensive, the Ho Chi Minh Campaign, against the South that culminated in the surrender of the Republic of Vietnam to PAVN forces on April 30, 1975.\\r\\nThe Office of the Secretary of Defense & Joint Staff, FOIA Requester Service Center\\r\\nForeign Relations Series\\r\\nUnder Eisenhower\\r\\nUnder Kennedy\\r\\nUnder Johnson\\r\\nUnder Nixon\\r\\nUnder Ford","input":"How long was america's involvement in the vietnam war?"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function I(h,t,n,c,u,o){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),i(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),i(l,null,g(o.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const x=d(M,[["render",I]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/14.md","filePath":"qapage/14.md"}'),D={name:"qapage/14.md"},F=Object.assign(D,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[b(x)]))}});export{H as __pageData,F as default};
