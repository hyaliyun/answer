Prison building efforts in the United States came in three major waves . The first began during the Jacksonian Era and led to widespread use of imprisonment and rehabilitative labor as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the American Civil War . The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States . These periods of prison construction and reform produced major changes in the structure of prison systems and their missions , the responsibilities of federal and state agencies for administering and supervising them , as well as the legal and political status of prisoners themselves ."},{"query":"who is appointed by the president of india","short_answer":"","abstract":"The President of the Republic of India is the head of state of India and the commander - in - chief of the Indian Armed Forces ."},{"query":"who made up the committee of public safety","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Committee of Public Safety ( French : Comité de salut public ) -- created in April 1793 by the National Convention and then restructured in July 1793 -- formed the de facto executive government in France during the Reign of Terror ( 1793 -- 94 ) , a stage of the French Revolution .

Water is necessary for plants but only a small amount of water taken up by the roots is used for growth and metabolism . The remaining 97 -- 99.5 % is lost by transpiration and guttation . Leaf surfaces are dotted with pores called stomata , and in most plants they are more numerous on the undersides of the foliage . The stomata are bordered by guard cells and their stomatal accessory cells ( together known as stomatal complex ) that open and close the pore . Transpiration occurs through the stomatal apertures , and can be thought of as a necessary \`\` cost '' associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis . Transpiration also cools plants , changes osmotic pressure of cells , and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots . Two major factors influence the rate of water flow from the soil to the roots : the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the magnitude of the pressure gradient through the soil . Both of these factors influence the rate of bulk flow of water moving from the roots to the stomatal pores in the leaves via the xylem ."},{"query":"who is the girl band in boy meets world","short_answer":"Nobody 's Angel","abstract":"Nobody 's Angel was an American pop girl group of the late 1990s and early 2000s .

It conveys two analog message signals , or two digital bit streams , by changing ( modulating ) the amplitudes of two carrier waves , using the amplitude - shift keying ( ASK ) digital modulation scheme or amplitude modulation ( AM ) analog modulation scheme . The two carrier waves of the same frequency , usually sinusoids , are out of phase with each other by 90 ° and are thus called quadrature carriers or quadrature components -- hence the name of the scheme . The modulated waves are summed , and the final waveform is a combination of both phase - shift keying ( PSK ) and amplitude - shift keying ( ASK ) , or , in the analog case , of phase modulation ( PM ) and amplitude modulation . In the digital QAM case , a finite number of at least two phases and at least two amplitudes are used . PSK modulators are often designed using the QAM principle , but are not considered as QAM since the amplitude of the modulated carrier signal is constant . QAM is used extensively as a modulation scheme for digital telecommunication systems , such as in 802.11 Wi - Fi standards . Arbitrarily high spectral efficiencies can be achieved with QAM by setting a suitable constellation size , limited only by the noise level and linearity of the communications channel ."},{"query":"4. the animals celebrate a victory but at what cost what happened to the animals during the battle","short_answer":"","abstract":"Animal Farm is an allegorical novella by George Orwell , first published in England on 17 August 1945 .

It was approved on August 27 , 1958 . The most notable of these requirements is the need to have an animal completely sedated and insensible to pain . This is to minimize the suffering to the point where the animal feels nothing at all , instead losing a consciousness from which they will never awaken . This differs from animal to animal as size increases and decreases . Larger animals such as bovines require a stronger method than chickens , for example . Bovines require electronarcosis or something equally potent , though electronarcosis remains a standard . The bovine would have a device placed on their head that , once activated , sends an electric charge that efficiently and safely stuns them . Chickens , on the other hand , require much less current to be efficiently sedated and are given a run under electrically charged water . To ensure that these guidelines are met , The Food Safety and Inspection Service inspectors at slaughtering plants are responsible for overseeing compliance , and have the authority to stop slaughter lines and order plant employees to take corrective actions . Although more than 168 million chickens ( excluding broilers ) and around 9 billion broiler chickens are killed for food in the United States yearly , the Humane Slaughter Act specifically mentions only cattle , calves , horses , mules , sheep and swine ."},{"query":"what is the fear of being different called","short_answer":"","abstract":"Xenophobia is the fear and distrust of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange .

Scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work , regardless of the theoretical difficulties . If as Linnaeus thought , species were fixed , there would be no problem , but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually , and to grade into one another . A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring , typically by sexual reproduction . While this definition is often adequate , when looked at more closely it is problematic . For example , with hybridisation , in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies , or in a ring species , the boundaries between closely related species become unclear . Among organisms that reproduce only asexually , the concept of a reproductive species breaks down , and each clone is potentially a microspecies . Problems also arise when dealing with fossils , since reproduction can not be examined ; the concept of the chronospecies is therefore used in palaeontology . Other ways of defining species include their karyotype , DNA sequence , morphology , behaviour or ecological niche ."},{"query":"when does stefan go back to normal in season 1","short_answer":"","abstract":"High school student ( Seasons 1 - 4 )"},{"query":"where does the purr come from in a cat","short_answer":"","abstract":"A purr is a tonal fluttering sound made by some species of felids and two species of genets .

Like other power supplies , an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source ( often mains power ) to DC loads , such as a personal computer , while converting voltage and current characteristics . Unlike a linear power supply , the pass transistor of a switching - mode supply continually switches between low - dissipation , full - on and full - off states , and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions , which minimizes wasted energy . Ideally , a switched - mode power supply dissipates no power . Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on - to - off time . In contrast , a linear power supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor . This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched - mode power supply . Switched - mode power supplies may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight ."},{"query":"folk arts of ilocos region and cordillera autonomous region","short_answer":"","abstract":"Cordillera Administrative Region ( Ilokano : Rehion / Deppaar Administratibo ti Kordiliera ; Filipino : Rehiyong Pampangasiwaan ng Cordillera ) , designated as CAR , is an administrative region in the Philippines situated within the island of Luzon .

The essence of COM is a language - neutral way of implementing objects that can be used in environments different from the one in which they were created , even across machine boundaries . For well - authored components , COM allows reuse of objects with no knowledge of their internal implementation , as it forces component implementers to provide well - defined interfaces that are separated from the implementation . The different allocation semantics of languages are accommodated by making objects responsible for their own creation and destruction through reference - counting . Type conversion casting between different interfaces of an object is achieved through the QueryInterface method . The preferred method of \`\` inheritance '' within COM is the creation of sub-objects to which method \`\` calls '' are delegated ."},{"query":"where did the ouija board get its name","short_answer":"","abstract":"The ouija ( / ˈwiːdʒə / WEE - jə or / ˈwiːdʒi / WEE - jee ) , also known as a spirit board or talking board , is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet , the numbers 0 -- 9 , the words \`\` yes '' , \`\` no '' , \`\` hello '' ( occasionally ) , and \`\` goodbye '' , along with various symbols and graphics .

A common demonstration of SM is a child 's ability to write letters and make circles by twirling a sparkler at night . When the sparkler is spun fast enough , it appears to leave a trail which forms a continuous image . This \`\` light trail '' is the image that is represented in the visual sensory store known as iconic memory .
