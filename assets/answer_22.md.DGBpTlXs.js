They are far lighter and thinner than traditional cathode ray tube ( CRT ) television sets and video displays and are usually less than 10 centimetres ( 3.9 in ) thick . Flat - panel displays can be divided into two display device categories : volatile and static . Volatile displays require that pixels be periodically electronically refreshed to retain their state ( e.g. , liquid - crystal displays ( LCD ) ) . A volatile display only shows an image when it has battery or AC mains power . Static flat - panel displays rely on materials whose color states are bistable ( e.g. , e-book reader tablets from Sony ) , and as such , flat - panel displays retain the text or images on the screen even when the power is off . As of 2016 , flat - panel displays have almost completely replaced old CRT displays . In many 2010 - era applications , specifically small portable devices such as laptops , mobile phones , smartphones , digital cameras , camcorders , point - and - shoot cameras , and pocket video cameras , any display disadvantages of flat - panels ( as compared with CRTs ) are made up for by portability advantages ( thinness and lightweightness ) ."},{"query":"what was the dust bowl and its effects","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Dust Bowl , also known as the Dirty Thirties , was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s ; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion ( the Aeolian processes ) caused the phenomenon . The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland ."},{"query":"describe how third parties increase surplus chain surplus through capacity and inventory aggregation","short_answer":"","abstract":"Supply chain surplus is the value addition by supply chain function of an organisation .

This term can be used formally or informally . In Western Europe and the Americas , abolitionism is a historical movement in effort to end the African and Indian slave trade and set slaves free . King Charles I of Spain , usually known as Emperor Charles V , was following the example of Louis X of France who abolished slavery within the Kingdom of France in 1315 . He passed a law which would have abolished colonial slavery in 1542 , although this law was not passed in the largest colonial states , and was not enforced . In the late 17th century , the Roman Catholic Church , taking up a plea by Lourenço da Silva de Mendouça , officially condemned the slave trade , which was affirmed vehemently by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839 . The abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century , however , when English and American Quakers began to question the morality of slavery . James Oglethorpe was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery , banning it in the Province of Georgia on humanitarian grounds , and arguing against it in Parliament , and eventually encouraging his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause .

There are different variations of the experiment . The most notable experiment measured the children 's behavior after seeing the model get rewarded , get punished , or experience no consequence for beating up the bobo doll . The experiments are empirical approaches to test Bandura 's social learning theory . The social learning theory claims that people learn through observing , imitating , and modeling . It shows that people not only learn by being rewarded or punished ( behaviorism ) , but they can also learn from watching somebody else being rewarded or punished ( observational learning ) . These experiments are important because they sparked many more studies on the effects of observational learning . The studies not only give us new data , but this data has practical implications , e.g. how children can be influenced by watching violent media ."},{"query":"the oldest museum in america the pennsylvania academy of fine arts was founded in","short_answer":"1805","abstract":"The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts is a museum and art school in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .

This relationship holds for situations where the amount of nucleophile is much greater than that of the carbocation intermediate . Instead , the rate equation may be more accurately described using steady - state kinetics . The reaction involves a carbocation intermediate and is commonly seen in reactions of secondary or tertiary alkyl halides under strongly basic conditions or , under strongly acidic conditions , with secondary or tertiary alcohols . With primary and secondary alkyl halides , the alternative S 2 reaction occurs . In inorganic chemistry , the S 1 reaction is often known as the dissociative mechanism . This dissociation pathway is well - described by the cis effect . A reaction mechanism was first proposed by Christopher Ingold et al. in 1940 . This reaction does not depend much on the strength of the nucleophile unlike the S 2 mechanism. this type of mechanism involves two steps the first step is the reversible ionization of Alkyl halide in the presence of aqueous acetone or an aqueous ethyl alcohol this step provides a carbocation as an intermediate in second step this carbocation is attacked by the nucleophile to give the product"},{"query":"who is announcing the red wings game tonight","short_answer":"","abstract":"The following 23 pages are in this category , out of 23 total .

This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors .

The term ahimsa means nonviolence , non-injury or absence of desire to harm any life forms . Vegetarianism and other nonviolent practices and rituals of Jains flow from the principle of ahimsa . The Jain concept of ahimsa is very different from the concept of nonviolence found in other philosophies . Violence is usually associated with causing harm to others . But according to the Jain philosophy , violence refers primarily to injuring one 's own self -- behaviour which inhibits the soul 's own ability to attain moksha ( liberation from the cycle of births and deaths ) . At the same time it also means violence to others because it is this tendency to harm others that ultimately harms one 's own soul . Furthermore , the Jains extend the concept of ahimsa not only to humans but to all animals , plants , micro-organisms and all beings having life or life potential . All life is sacred and everything has a right to live fearlessly to its maximum potential . Living beings need not fear those who have taken the vow of ahimsa .

The Virginia Company colony was looking for gold but failed and the colonists could barely feed themselves . The famine during the harsh winter of 1609 forced the colonists to eat leather from their clothes and boots and resort to cannibalism .

The role NK cells play is analogous to that of cytotoxic T cells in the vertebrate adaptive immune response . NK cells provide rapid responses to viral - infected cells , acting at around 3 days after infection , and respond to tumor formation . Typically , immune cells detect major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) presented on infected cell surfaces , triggering cytokine release , causing lysis or apoptosis . NK cells are unique , however , as they have the ability to recognize stressed cells in the absence of antibodies and MHC , allowing for a much faster immune reaction . They were named \`\` natural killers '' because of the initial notion that they do not require activation to kill cells that are missing \`\` self '' markers of MHC class 1 . This role is especially important because harmful cells that are missing MHC I markers can not be detected and destroyed by other immune cells , such as T lymphocyte cells ."},{"query":"who were known as the gems of kannada literature","short_answer":"","abstract":"Kannada literature ( ಕನ್ನಡ ಸಾಹಿತ್ಯ ) is the corpus of written forms of the Kannada language , a member of the Dravidian family spoken mainly in the Indian state of Karnataka and written in the Kannada script ."},{"query":"who plays dr harrison wells in the flash","short_answer":"Thomas Patrick Cavanagh","abstract":"Champlain College"},{"query":"what is the point of sports illustrated swimsuit","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"what happened to christian in alex and co","short_answer":"","abstract":"Alex & Co. is an Italian television series which first aired on Disney Channel Italy on May 11 , 2015 .

This may be a natural process produced by plant colonization and succession , manmade rewilding projects , accelerated process designed to repair damage to a landscape due to wildfire , mining , flood , or other cause .

The ability of an organism or organ to respond to external stimuli is called sensitivity . When a stimulus is applied to a sensory receptor , it normally elicits or influences a reflex via stimulus transduction . These sensory receptors can receive information from outside the body , as in touch receptors found in the skin or light receptors in the eye , as well as from inside the body , as in chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors . An internal stimulus is often the first component of a homeostatic control system . External stimuli are capable of producing systemic responses throughout the body , as in the fight - or - flight response . In order for a stimulus to be detected with high probability , its level must exceed the absolute threshold ; if a signal does reach threshold , the information is transmitted to the central nervous system ( CNS ) , where it is integrated and a decision on how to react is made . Although stimuli commonly cause the body to respond , it is the CNS that finally determines whether a signal causes a reaction or not ."},{"query":"who played jennifer in the first back to the future","short_answer":"Claudia Grace Wells","abstract":"Claudia Grace Wells ( born July 5 , 1966 ) is an American actress best known for her role as Jennifer Parker in the film Back to the Future ( 1985 ) ."},{"query":"when did the apple ipad 5th generation come out","short_answer":"March 24 , 2017","abstract":"Bluetooth 4.2"},{"query":"what kind of money is used in chile","short_answer":"the Chilean peso ( CLP )","abstract":"Coordinates : 30 ° S 71 ° W \uFEFF / \uFEFF 30 ° S 71 ° W \uFEFF / - 30 ; - 71"},{"query":"whose next in line to be king of england","short_answer":"Charles , Prince of Wales","abstract":""},{"query":"who played the head of the bank in mary poppins","short_answer":"","abstract":"David Cecil MacAlister Tomlinson ( 7 May 1917 -- 24 June 2000 ) was an English stage , film and television actor and comedian .

Since chromosomal abnormalities can result in impaired cardiovascular development , a nuchal translucency scan is used as a screening , rather than diagnostic , tool for conditions such as Down syndrome . However , increased nuchal translucency measurements are also associated with non-chromosomal abnormalities such as genetic conditions ( e.g. Di George syndrome ) and non-genetic ones ( e.g. Body - stalk anomaly ) . The scan is carried out at 11 -- 13 + 6 weeks pregnancy and assesses the quantity of fluid collecting within the nape of the fetal neck . There are two distinct measurements -- the nuchal translucency , which is measured earlier in pregnancy at the end of the first trimester , and for which there is a lower threshold for increased diameter , and the nuchal fold , which is measured towards the end of the second trimester . The scan may also help confirm both the accuracy of the pregnancy dates and the fetal viability . As nuchal translucency size increases , the chances of a chromosomal abnormality and mortality increase ; 65 % of the largest translucencies ( > 6.5 mm ) are due to chromosomal abnormality , while fatality is 19 % at this size ."},{"query":"what are the exits on the new jersey turnpike","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who plays the red robot in sam and cat","short_answer":"Dan Schneider","abstract":"Sam & Cat is an American teen sitcom that originally aired from June 8 , 2013 , to July 17 , 2014 , on Nickelodeon .

The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands .
