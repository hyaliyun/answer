The Soviet Air Forces treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding U.S. spy plane , and proceeded to destroy it with air - to - air missiles , after firing warning shots which were likely not seen by the KAL pilots . The Korean airliner eventually crashed in the sea near Moneron Island west of Sakhalin in the Sea of Japan .

The Soviets found the wreckage under the sea on September 15 , and found the flight recorders in October , but this information was kept secret until 1993 ."},{"query":"who has freedom of the city of london","short_answer":"","abstract":"The granting of the Honorary Freedom ( or Freedom Honoris Causa ) of the City of London is extremely rare and only generally awarded today to Royalty , Heads of State or to figures of genuine global standing .

The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland ."},{"query":"are sam's club and walmart owned by the same company","short_answer":"","abstract":"Sam 's West , Inc.

Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year ."},{"query":"when was the last time women's hockey won gold","short_answer":"2018","abstract":"The United States women 's national ice hockey team is controlled by USA Hockey .

Formally , a wider study includes water falling as ice crystals , i.e. hail , sleet , snow ( parts of the hydrological cycle known as precipitation ) . The aim of rainfall climatology is to measure , understand and predict rain distribution across different regions of planet Earth , a factor of air pressure , humidity , topography , cloud type and raindrop size , via direct measurement and remote sensing data acquisition . Current technologies accurately predict rainfall 3 -- 4 days in advance using numerical weather prediction . Geostationary orbiting satellites gather IR and visual wavelength data to measure realtime localised rainfall by estimating cloud albedo , water content , and the corresponding probability of rain . Geographic distribution of rain is largely governed by climate type , topography and habitat humidity . In mountainous areas , heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation . On the leeward side of mountains , desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by compressional heating . The movement of the monsoon trough , or intertropical convergence zone , brings rainy seasons to savannah climes . The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall , both in amounts and intensity , downwind of cities . Global warming may also cause changes in the precipitation pattern globally , including wetter conditions at high latitudes and in some wet tropical areas , and drier conditions in parts of the subtropics and middle latitudes . Precipitation is a major component of the water cycle , and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the planet . Approximately 505,000 cubic kilometres ( 121,000 cu mi ) of water falls as precipitation each year ; 398,000 cubic kilometres ( 95,000 cu mi ) of it over the oceans . Given the Earth 's surface area , that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990 millimetres ( 39 in ) .

The first kind are taxes that employers are required to withhold from employees ' wages , also known as withholding tax , pay - as - you - earn tax ( PAYE ) , or pay - as - you - go tax ( PAYG ) and often covering advance payment of income tax , social security contributions , and various insurances ( e.g. , unemployment and disability ) .

These can consist of fixed charges or be proportionally linked to an employee 's pay . The charges paid by the employer usually cover the employer 's funding of the social security system , medicare , and other insurance programs .

Carnegie proposed that the best way of dealing with the new phenomenon of wealth inequality was for the wealthy to redistribute their surplus means in a responsible and thoughtful manner . This approach was contrasted with traditional bequest ( patrimony ) , where wealth is handed down to heirs , and other forms of bequest e.g. where wealth is willed to the state for public purposes . Carnegie argued that surplus wealth is put to best use ( i.e. produces the greatest net benefit to society ) when it is administered carefully by the wealthy . Carnegie also argues against wasteful use of capital in the form of extravagance , irresponsible spending , or self - indulgence , instead promoting the administration of said capital over the course of one 's lifetime toward the cause of reducing the stratification between the rich and poor .

Trees transfer water and sap from the roots to the leaves through their vascular cells , but as the autumn season begins , these veins slowly close until a layer of cells called the abscission layer completely closes off the vein allowing the tree to rid itself of the leaf . Leaf marcescence is most often seen on juvenile plants and may disappear as the tree matures . It also may not affect the entire tree ; sometimes leaves persist only on scattered branches . Marcescence is most obvious in deciduous trees that retain leaves through the winter . Several trees normally have marcescent leaves such as oak ( Quercus ) , beech ( Fagus ) and hornbeam ( Carpinus ) , or marcescent stipules as in some but not all species of willows ( Salix ) . All oak trees may display foliage marcescence , even species that are known to fully drop leaves when the tree is mature . Marcescent leaves of pin oak ( Quercus palustris ) complete development of their abscission layer in the spring . The base of the petiole remains alive over the winter . Many other trees may have marcescent leaves in seasons where an early freeze kills the leaves before the abscission layer develops or completes development . Diseases or pests can also kill leaves before they can develop an abscission layer ."},{"query":"the lyrics to i love you a bushel and a peck","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` A Bushel and a Peck '' is a popular song written by Frank Loesser and published in 1950 .

Impeachment proceedings have been initiated against several presidents of the United States . Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are the only two presidents to have been successfully impeached by the House of Representatives , and both were later acquitted by the Senate . The impeachment process against Richard Nixon was never completed , as Nixon resigned his office before the vote of the full House for impeachment , but such a vote was widely expected to pass , and the threat of it and a subsequent conviction in the Senate was the impetus for Nixon 's departure . To date , no president has been removed from office by impeachment and conviction . The impeached official continues in office until conviction ."},{"query":"when does the new season of vanderpump rules start","short_answer":"","abstract":"Vanderpump Rules is an American reality television series airing on Bravo that debuted on January 7 , 2013 , with the first season originally eight episodes .

The primary spermatocyte divides meiotically ( Meiosis I ) into two secondary spermatocytes ; each secondary spermatocyte divides into two equal haploid spermatids by Meiosis II. The spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa ( sperm ) by the process called Spermiogenesis. These develop into mature spermatozoa , also known as sperm cells .

It conveys two analog message signals , or two digital bit streams , by changing ( modulating ) the amplitudes of two carrier waves , using the amplitude - shift keying ( ASK ) digital modulation scheme or amplitude modulation ( AM ) analog modulation scheme . The two carrier waves of the same frequency , usually sinusoids , are out of phase with each other by 90 ° and are thus called quadrature carriers or quadrature components -- hence the name of the scheme . The modulated waves are summed , and the final waveform is a combination of both phase - shift keying ( PSK ) and amplitude - shift keying ( ASK ) , or , in the analog case , of phase modulation ( PM ) and amplitude modulation . In the digital QAM case , a finite number of at least two phases and at least two amplitudes are used . PSK modulators are often designed using the QAM principle , but are not considered as QAM since the amplitude of the modulated carrier signal is constant . QAM is used extensively as a modulation scheme for digital telecommunication systems , such as in 802.11 Wi - Fi standards . Arbitrarily high spectral efficiencies can be achieved with QAM by setting a suitable constellation size , limited only by the noise level and linearity of the communications channel ."},{"query":"who plays lady of the lake in spamalot","short_answer":"","abstract":"Monty Python 's Spamalot is a musical comedy adapted from the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail .

They were first seen by Galileo Galilei in January 1610 , and recognized by him as satellites of Jupiter in March 1610 . They are the first objects found to orbit another planet . Their names derive from the lovers of Zeus . They are among the largest objects in the Solar System with the exception of the Sun and the eight planets , with a radius larger than any of the dwarf planets . Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System , and is even bigger than the planet Mercury . The three inner moons -- Io , Europa , and Ganymede -- are in a 4 : 2 : 1 orbital resonance with each other . Because of their much smaller size , and therefore weaker self - gravitation , all of Jupiter 's remaining moons have irregular forms rather than a spherical shape ."},{"query":"who played lucas mccain son on the rifleman","short_answer":"Chuck Connors","abstract":"John Ernest \`\` Johnny '' Crawford ( born March 26 , 1946 ) is an American character actor , singer , and musician .

The scientific revolution took place in Europe towards the end of the Renaissance period and continued through the late 18th century , influencing the intellectual social movement known as the Enlightenment . While its dates are debated , the publication in 1543 of Nicolaus Copernicus 's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium ( On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres ) is often cited as marking the beginning of the scientific revolution ."},{"query":"where did they film bbc pride and prejudice","short_answer":"","abstract":"Pride and Prejudice is a six - episode 1995 British television drama , adapted by Andrew Davies from Jane Austen 's 1813 novel of the same name .
