This species may be a composite of two species.\\r\\nThe new species name is in honor of the late Professor David Joseph Morafka of California State University, Dominguez Hills, in recognition of his many contributions to the study and conservation of Gopherus.\\r\\nThe desert tortoises live about 50 to 80 years;[6] they grow slowly and generally have low reproductive rates. They spend most of their time in burrows, rock shelters, and pallets to regulate body temperature and reduce water loss. They are most active after seasonal rains and are inactive during most of the year. This inactivity helps reduce water loss during hot periods, whereas winter hibernation facilitates survival during freezing temperatures and low food availability. Desert tortoises can tolerate water, salt, and energy imbalances on a daily basis, which increases their lifespans.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese tortoises may attain a length of 10 to 14?in (25 to 36?cm),[8] with males being slightly larger than females. A male tortoise has a longer gular horn than a female, his plastron (lower shell) is concave compared to a female tortoise. Males have larger tails than females do. Their shells are high-domed, and greenish-tan to dark brown in color. Desert tortoises can grow to 4ÿ6?in (10ÿ15?cm) in height. They can range in weight from .02 to 5?kg (0.044 to 11.023?lb).[9] The front limbs have sharp, claw-like scales and are flattened for digging. Back legs are skinnier and very long.\\r\\nDesert tortoises can live in areas with ground temperatures exceeding 140?F (60?C) because of their ability to dig underground burrows and escape the heat. At least 95% of their lives are spent in burrows. There, they are also protected from freezing winter weather while dormant, from November through February or March. Within their burrows, these tortoises create a subterranean environment that can be beneficial to other reptiles, mammals, birds, and invertebrates.\\r\\nScientists have divided the desert tortoise into two types: Agassiz's and Morafka's desert tortoises, with a possible third type in northern Sinaloan and southern Sonora, Mexico. An isolated population of Agassiz's desert tortoise occurs in the Black Mountains of northwestern Arizona.[10] They live in a different type of habitat, from sandy flats to rocky foothills. They have a strong proclivity in the Mojave Desert for alluvial fans, washes, and canyons where more suitable soils for den construction might be found. They range from near sea level to around 3,500 feet (1,100?m) in elevation. Tortoises show very strong site fidelity, and have well-established home ranges where they know where their food, water, and mineral resources are.\\r\\nDesert tortoises inhabit elevations from below mean sea level in Death Valley to 5,300 feet (1,600?m) in Arizona, though they are most common from around 1,000 to 3,500 feet (300 to 1,070 metres). Estimates of densities vary from less than eight individuals/km2 on sites in southern California to over 500 individuals/km2 in the western Mojave Desert, although most estimates are less than 150 individuals/km2. The home range generally consists of 10 to 100 acres (4.0 to 40.5?ha). In general, males have larger home ranges than females, and home range size increases with increasing resources and rainfall.[7]\\r\\nDesert tortoises are sensitive to the soil type, owing to their reliance on burrows for shelter, reduction of water loss, and regulation of body temperature. The soil should crumble easily during digging and be firm enough to resist collapse. Desert tortoises prefer sandy loam soils with varying amounts of gravel and clay, and tend to avoid sands or soils with low water-holding capacity, excess salts, or low resistance to flooding. They may consume soil to maintain adequate calcium levels, so may prefer sites with higher calcium content.[7]\\r\\nDesert tortoises spend most of their lives in burrows, rock shelters, and pallets to regulate body temperature and reduce water loss. Burrows are tunnels dug into soil by desert tortoises or other animals, rock shelters are spaces protected by rocks and/or boulders, and pallets are depressions in the soil. The use of the various shelter types is related to their availability and climate. The number of burrows used, the extent of repetitive use, and the occurrence of burrow sharing are variable. Males tend to occupy deeper burrows than females. Seasonal trends in burrow use are influenced by desert tortoise gender and regional variation. Desert tortoise shelter sites are often associated with plant or rock cover. Desert tortoises often lay their eggs in nests dug in sufficiently deep soil at the entrance of burrows or under shrubs. Nests are typically 3 to 10 inches (7.6 to 25.4 centimetres) deep.[7]\\r\\nShelters are important for controlling body temperature and water regulation, as they allow desert tortoises to slow their rate of heating in summer and provide protection from cold during the winter. The humidity within burrows prevents dehydration. Burrows also provide protection from predators. The availability of adequate burrow sites influences desert tortoise densities.[7]\\r\\nThe number of burrows used by desert tortoises varies spatially and temporally, from about 5 to 25 per year. Some burrows are used repeatedly, sometimes for several consecutive years. Desert tortoises share burrows with various mammals, reptiles, birds, and invertebrates, such as white-tailed antelope squirrels (Ammospermophilus leucurus), woodrats (Neotoma), collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu), burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia), Gambel's quail (Callipepla gambelii ), rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.), Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum), beetles, spiders, and scorpions. One burrow can host up to 23 desert tortoises ÿ such sharing is more common for desert tortoises of opposite sexes than for desert tortoises of the same sex.[7]\\r\\nTortoises mate in the spring and autumn. Male desert tortoises grow two large white glands around the chin area, called chin glands, that signify mating season. A male circles around female, biting her shell in the process. He then climbs upon the female and insert his penis (a white organ, usually only seen upon careful inspection during mating, as it is hidden inside the male and can only be coaxed out with sexual implication) into the vagina of a female, which is located around the tail. The male may make grunting noises once atop a female, and may move his front legs up and down in a constant motion, as if playing a drum.[11]\\r\\nMonths later, the female lays a clutch of four to eight hard-shelled eggs,[12] which have the size and shape of ping-pong balls, usually in June or July. The eggs hatch in August or September. Wild female tortoises produce up to three clutches a year depending on the climate. Their eggs incubate from 90 to 135 days;[3] some eggs may overwinter and hatch the following spring. In a laboratory experiment, temperature influenced hatching rates and hatchling gender. Incubation temperatures from 81 to 88?F (27 to 31?C) resulted in hatching rates exceeding 83%, while incubation at 77?F (25?C) resulted in a 53% hatching rate. Incubation temperatures less than 88?F (31?C) resulted in all-male clutches. Average incubation time decreased from 124.7 days at 77?F to 78.2 days at 88?F (31?C).[13]\\r\\nThe desert tortoise grows slowly, often taking 16 years or longer to reach about 8 in (20?cm) in length. The growth rate varies with age, location, gender and precipitation. It can slow down from 12?mm/year for ages 4ÿ8 years to about 6.0?mm/year for ages 16 to 20 years. Males and females grow at similar rates; females can grow slightly faster when young, but males grow larger than females.[7]\\r\\nDesert tortoises generally reach reproductive maturity at age 15 to 20 years, when they are longer than 7 in (18?cm), though 10-year-old reproductive females have been observed.[7]\\r\\nTheir activity depends on location, peaking in late spring for the Mojave Desert and in late summer to fall in Sonoran Desert; some populations exhibit two activity peaks during one year. Desert tortoises hibernate during winters, roughly from November to FebruaryÿApril. Females begin hibernating later and emerge earlier than males; juveniles emerge from hibernation earlier than adults.[7]\\r\\nTemperature strongly influences desert tortoise activity level. Although desert tortoises can survive body temperatures from below freezing to over 104?F (40?C), most activity occurs at temperatures from 79 to 93?F (26 to 34?C). The influence of temperature is reflected in daily activity patterns, with desert tortoises often active late in the morning during spring and fall, early in the morning and late in the evening during the summer, and occasionally becoming active during relatively warm winter afternoons. The activity generally increases after rainfall.[7]\\r\\nAlthough desert tortoises spend the majority of their time in shelter, movements of up to 660 feet (200?m) per day are common. The common, comparatively short-distance movements presumably represent foraging activity, traveling between burrows, and possibly mate-seeking or other social behaviors. Long-distance movements could potentially represent dispersal into new areas and/or use of peripheral portions of the home range.[7]\\r\\nDesert tortoises can live well over 50 years, with estimates of lifespan varying from 50 to 80 years.[6] Causes of mortality include predation, disease, human-related factors, and environmental factors such as drought, flooding, and fire.[7]\\r\\nThe annual death rate of adults is typically a few percent, but is much higher for young desert tortoises. Only 2ÿ5% of hatchlings are estimated to reach maturity. Estimates of survival from hatching to 1 year of age for Mojave Desert tortoises range from 47 to 51%. Survival of Mojave Desert tortoises from 1 to 4 years of age is 71ÿ89%.[7]\\r\\nThe desert tortoise is an herbivore. Grasses form the bulk of its diet, but it also eats herbs, annual wildflowers, and new growth of cacti, as well as their fruit and flowers. Rocks and soil are also ingested, perhaps as a means of maintaining intestinal digestive bacteria as a source of supplementary calcium or other minerals. As with birds, stones may also function as gastroliths, enabling more efficient digestion of plant material in the stomach.[7]\\r\\nMuch of the tortoises water intake comes from moisture in the grasses and wildflowers they consume in the spring. A large urinary bladder can store over 40% of the tortoise's body weight in water, urea, uric acid, and nitrogenous wastes. During very dry times, they may give off waste as a white paste rather than a watery urine. During periods of adequate rainfall, they drink copiously from any pools they find, and eliminate solid urates. The tortoises can increase their body weight by up to 40% after copious drinking.[14] Adult tortoises can survive a year or more without access to water.[7] During the summer and dry seasons, they rely on the water contained within cactus fruits and mesquite grass. To maintain sufficient water, they reabsorb water in their bladders, and move to humid underground burrows in the morning to prevent water loss by evaporation.[14]\\r\\nEmptying the bladder is one of the defense mechanisms of this tortoise. This can leave the tortoise in a very vulnerable condition in dry areas, and it should not be alarmed, handled, or picked up in the wild unless in imminent danger. If it must be handled, and its bladder is emptied, then water should be provided to restore the fluid in its body.\\r\\nRavens, Gila monsters, kit foxes, badgers, roadrunners, coyotes, and fire ants are all natural predators of the desert tortoise. They prey on eggs, juveniles, which are 2ÿ3?inches long with a thin, delicate shell, or, in some cases, adults. Ravens are thought to cause significant levels of juvenile tortoise predation in some areas of the Mojave Desert ÿ frequently near urbanized areas. The most significant threats to tortoises include urbanization, disease, habitat destruction and fragmentation, illegal collection and vandalism by humans, and habitat conversion from invasive plant species (Brassica tournefortii, Bromus rubens and Erodium spp.).\\r\\nDesert tortoise populations in some areas have declined by as much as 90% since the 1980s, and the Mojave population is listed as threatened. It is unlawful to touch, harm, harass, or collect wild desert tortoises. It is, however, possible to adopt captive tortoises through the Tortoise Adoption Program in Arizona, Utah Division of Wildlife Resources Desert Tortoise Adoption Program in Utah, Joshua Tree Tortoise Rescue Project in California, or through Bureau of Land Management in Nevada. When adopted in Nevada, they will have a computer chip embedded on their backs for reference. According to Arizona Game and Fish Commission Rule R12-4-407 A.1, they may be possessed if the tortoises are obtained from a captive source which is properly documented. Commission Order 43: Reptile Notes 3: one tortoise per family member.\\r\\nThe Fort Irwin National Training Center of the US Army expanded into an area that was habitat for about 2,000 desert tortoises, and contained critical desert tortoise habitat (a designation by the US Fish and Wildlife Service). In March 2008, about 650 tortoises were moved by helicopter and vehicle, up to 35?km away.[15]\\r\\nAnother potential threat to the desert tortoise's habitat is a series of proposed wind and solar farms.[16] As a result of legislation, solar energy companies have been making plans for huge projects in the desert regions of Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah. The requests submitted to the Bureau of Land Management total nearly 1,800,000 acres (7,300?km2).[17]\\r\\nIn 2006, a proposal was made in California to build a landfill in Kern County, a site near the Desert Tortoise Natural Area, to dump trash for Los Angeles residents. A landfill would attract many of the tortoises predators ÿ ravens, rats, roadrunners, and coyotes ÿ which would threaten their population.[18]\\r\\nConcerns about the impacts of the Ivanpah Solar thermal project led the developers to hire some 100 biologists and spend US$22 million caring for the tortoises on or near the site during construction.[19][20] Despite this, in a 2011 Revised Biological Assessment for the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, the Bureau of Land Management anticipated the loss or significant degradation of 3,520 acres of tortoise habitat and the harm of 57ÿ274 adult tortoises, 608 juveniles, and 236 eggs inside the work area, and 203 adult tortoises and 1,541 juvenile tortoises outside the work area. The BLM expects that most of the juvenile tortoises on the project will be killed.[21][22]\\r\\nThe Desert Tortoise Preserve Committee protects roughly 5,000 acres of desert tortoise habitat from human activity. This area includes 4,340 acres in Kern County, 710 acres in San Bernardino County, and 80 acres in Riverside County.[18]\\r\\nIn the summer of 2010, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility filed a lawsuit against the National Park Service for not having taken measures to manage tortoise shooting in the Mojave National Preserve of California. Biologists discovered numerous gunshot wounds on dead tortoise shells. These shells left behind by vandals attracted ravens and threatened the healthy tortoises.[23]\\r\\nReptiles are known to become infected by a wide range of pathogens, which includes viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. More specifically, the G. agassizii population has been negatively affected by upper respiratory tract disease, cutaneous dyskeratosis, herpes virus, shell necrosis, urolithiasis (bladder stones), and parasites.[24][25][26]\\r\\nUpper respiratory tract disease (URTD) is a chronic, infectious disease responsible for population declines across the entire range of the desert tortoise. It was identified in the early 1970s in captive desert tortoise populations, and later identified in the wild population.[24] URTD is caused by the infectious agents Mycoplasma agassizii and Mycoplasma testudineum, which are bacteria in the class Mollicutes and characterized by having no cell wall and a small genome.[27][28][29] Mycoplasmae appear to be highly virulent (infectious) in some populations, while chronic, or even dormant in others.[30] The mechanism (whether environmental or genetic) responsible for this diversity is not understood. Infection is characterized by both physiological and behavioral changes: nasal and ocular discharge, palpebral edema (swelling of the upper and/or lower palpebra, or eyelid, the fleshy portion that is in contact with the tortoises eye globe) and conjunctivitis, weight loss, changes in color and elasticity of the integument, and lethargic or erratic behavior.[24][31][32][33] These pathogens are likely transmitted by contact with an infected individual. Epidemiological studies of wild desert tortoises in the western Mojave Desert from 1992 to 1995 showed a 37% increase in M. agassizii.[29] Tests were conducted on blood samples, and a positive test was determined by the presence of antibodies in the blood, defined as being seropositive.\\r\\nCutaneous dyskeratosis (CD) is a shell disease of unknown origin and has unknown implications on desert tortoise populations. Observationally, it is typified by shell lesions on the scutes. Areas infected with CD appear discolored, dry, rough and flakey, with peeling, pitting, and chipping through multiple cornified layers.[34] Lesions are usually first located on the plastron (underside) of the tortoises, although lesions on the carapace (upper side) and fore limbs are not uncommon. In advanced cases, exposed areas become infected with bacteria, fungi, and exposed tissue and bone may become necrotic.[32][34] CD was evident as early as 1979 and was initially identified on the Chuckwalla Bench Area of Critical Environmental Concern in Riverside County, California.[35] Currently, the means of transmission are unknown, although hypotheses include autoimmune diseases, exposure to toxic chemicals (possibly from mines, or air pollution), or a deficiency disease (possibly resulting from tortoises consuming low-quality invasive plant species instead of high-nutrient native plants).[25][30]\\r\\nTwo case studies outlined the spread of disease in desert tortoises. The Daggett Epidemiology of Upper Respiratory Tract Disease project, which provides supporting disease research for the Fort Irwin translocation project, lends an example of the spread of disease. In 2008, 197 health evaluations were conducted, revealing 25.0ÿ45.2% exposure to M. agassizii and M. testudineum, respectively, in a core area adjacent to Interstate 15. The spread of disease was tracked over two years, and clinical signs of URTD spread from the core area to adjacent, outlying locations during this time. Overlaying home ranges and the social nature of these animals, suggests that disease-free individuals may be vulnerable to spread of disease, and that transmission can occur rapidly.[36] Thus, wild tortoises that are close to the urban-wildlife interface may be vulnerable to spread of disease as a direct result of human influence.\\r\\nThe second study indicated that captive tortoises can be a source of disease to wild Agassiz's desert tortoise populations. Johnson et al. (2006) tested blood samples for URTD (n = 179) and herpesvirus (n = 109) from captive tortoises found near Barstow, CA and Hesperia, CA. Demographic and health data were collected from the tortoises, as well from other reptiles housed in the same facility. Of these, 45.3% showed signs of mild disease, 16.2% of moderate disease, and 4.5% of severe disease, and blood tests revealed that 82.7% of tortoises had antibodies to mycoplasma, and 26.6% had antibodies to herpesvirus (which means the tortoises were seropositive for these two diseases, and indicate previous exposure to the causative agents). With an estimated 200,000 captive desert tortoises in California, their escape or release into the wild is a real threat to uninfected wild populations of tortoises. Projections from this study suggest that about 4400 tortoises could escape from captivity in a given year, and with an 82% exposure rate to URTD, the wild population may be at greater risk than previously thought.[37]\\r\\nEdwards et al. reported that 35% of desert tortoises in the Phoenix area are hybrids between either Gopherus agassizii and G. morafkai, or G. morafkai and the Texas tortoise, G. berlandieri. The intentional or accidental release of these tortoises could have dire consequences for wild tortoises.[38]\\r\\nBefore obtaining a desert tortoise as a pet, it is best to check the laws and regulations of the local area and/or state. Desert tortoises may not be moved across state borders or captured from the wild. They may, however, be given as a gift from one private owner to another. Desert tortoises need to be kept outdoors in a large area of dry soil and with access to vegetation and water. An underground den and a balanced diet are crucial to the health of captive tortoises.\\r\\nWild populations of tortoises must be managed effectively to minimize the spread of diseases, which includes research and education. Despite significant research being conducted on desert tortoises and disease, a considerable knowledge gap still exists in understanding how disease affects desert tortoise population dynamics. It is not known if the population would still decline if disease were completely absent from the system; are tortoises more susceptible to disease during draught conditions? How does a non-native diet impact a tortoises ability to ward off pathogens? What are the causes of immunity exhibited by some desert tortoises? The 2008 USFWS draft recovery plan suggests that populations of tortoises that are uninfected, or only recently infected, should likely be considered research and management priorities. Tortoises are known to show resistance to disease in some areas, an effort to identify and maintain these individuals in the populations is essential. Furthermore, increasing research on the social behavior of these animals, and garnering a greater understanding of how behavior facilitates disease transmission would be advantageous in understanding rates of transmission. Finally, translocation of tortoises should be done with extreme caution; disease is typically furtive and moving individuals or populations of tortoises across a landscape can have unforeseen consequences.[30]\\r\\nCorollary to research, education may help preventing captive tortoises from coming in contact with wild populations.[37] Education campaigns through veterinarians, government agencies, schools, museums, and community centers throughout the range of the desert tortoise could limit the spread of tortoise diseases into wild populations. Strategies may include encouraging people to not breed their captive tortoises, ensure that different species of turtles and tortoises are not housed in the same facility (which would help to prevent the spread of novel diseases into the desert tortoise population), ensure captive tortoises are adequately housed to prevent them from escaping into the wild, and to ensure that captive turtles and tortoises are never released into the wild.\\r\\nDesert tortoises have been severely affected by disease. Both upper respiratory tract disease and cutaneous dyskeratosis have caused precipitous population declines and die-offs across the entire range of this charismatic species. Both of these diseases are extremely likely to be caused by people, and URTD is easily linked with people releasing captive tortoises into the wild. The combination of scientific research and public education is imperative to curb the spread of disease and aid the tortoise in recovery.\\r\\nThe desert tortoise is the state reptile of California and Nevada.\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from the United States Forest Service document \\"Gopherus agassizii \\".","context":"What protects the north american desert tortoise from heat?"},{"output":"Morocco","context":"","input":"What country casablanca and marrakech are located in?"},{"output":"Sterling Price Holloway Jr.","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSterling Price Holloway Jr. (January 4, 1905 ÿ November 22, 1992) was an American character actor and voice actor who appeared in over 100 films and 40 television shows.

His mother was Rebecca DeHaven (some sources say her last name was Boothby). He had a younger brother named Boothby. The family owned a grocery store in Cedartown, where his father served as mayor in 1912. After graduating from Georgia Military Academy in 1920 at the age of fifteen, he left Georgia for New York City, where he attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.[3]  While there, he befriended actor Spencer Tracy, whom he considered one of his favorite working colleagues.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his late teens, Holloway toured with stock company of The Shepherd of the Hills[4][5], performing in one-nighters across much of the American West before returning to New York where he accepted small walk-on parts from the Theatre Guild, and appeared in the Rodgers and Hart review The Garrick Gaieties in the mid-1920s. A talented singer, he introduced \\"Manhattan\\" in 1925, and the following year sang \\"Mountain Greenery\\".[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved to Hollywood in 1926 to begin a film career that lasted almost 50 years. His bushy red hair and high pitched voice meant that he almost always appeared in comedies. His first film was The Battling Kangaroo (1926), a silent picture. Over the following decades, Holloway would appear with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Lon Chaney Jr, Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, Bing Crosby, and John Carradine.  In 1942, during World War II, Holloway enlisted in the United States Army at the age of 37 and was assigned to the Special Services. He helped develop a show called \\"Hey Rookie\\", which ran for nine months and raised $350,000 for the Army Relief Fund.[6] In 1945, Holloway played the role of a medic assigned to an infantry platoon in the critically acclaimed film A Walk in the Sun. During 1946 and 1947, he played the comic sidekick in five Gene Autry Westerns.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney originally considered Holloway for the voice of Sleepy in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), but chose Pinto Colvig instead. Holloway's voice work in animated films began in 1941 when he was first heard in Dumbo (1941), as the voice of Mr. Stork. Holloway was the voice of the adult Flower in Bambi (1942), the narrator of the Antarctic penguin sequence in The Three Caballeros (1944) and the narrator in the Peter and the Wolf sequence of Make Mine Music (1946).\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was the voice of the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland (1951), the narrator in The Little House (1952), Susie the Little Blue Coupe (1952), Lambert the Sheepish Lion (1952), Kaa the snake in The Jungle Book (1967), and Roquefort in The Aristocats (1970). He is perhaps best remembered as the voice of Winnie the Pooh in Disney's Winnie the Pooh featurettes through 1977. He was honored as a Disney Legend in 1991, the first person to receive the award in the Voice category. His final role was Hobe Carpenter, a friendly moonshiner who helps Harley Thomas (David Carradine) in Thunder and Lightning (1977).\\r\\n\\r\\nHolloway acted on many radio programs, including The Railroad Hour, The United States Steel Hour, Suspense and Lux Radio Theater. In the late 1940s, he could be heard in various roles on NBC's \\"Fibber McGee and Molly\\". His distinctive tenor voice retained a touch of its Southern drawl and was very recognizable. Holloway was chosen to narrate many children's records, including Uncle Remus Stories (Decca), Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes (Disneyland Records), Walt Disney Presents Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories (Disneyland Records) and Peter And The Wolf (RCA Victor).\\r\\n\\r\\nHolloway easily made the transition from radio to television. He appeared on the Adventures of Superman as \\"Uncle Oscar\\", an eccentric inventor, and played a recurring role on The Life of Riley.

Some other series on which he performed include Five Fingers (episode \\"The Temple of the Swinging Doll\\"), The Untouchables, The Real McCoys (\\"The Jinx\\"), Hazel, Pete and Gladys, The Twilight Zone (\\"What's in the Box\\"), The Brothers Brannagan, Gilligan's Island, The Andy Griffith Show, The Donald O'Connor Show, Peter Gunn, F Troop, and Moonlighting. During the 1970s, Holloway did commercial voice-overs for Purina Puppy Chow dog food and sang their familiar jingle, \\"Puppy Chow/For a full year/Till he's full-grown!\\". He also provided the voice for Woodsy Owl in several 1970s and 1980s United States Forest Service commercials.

As of the 2009 Astronaut Class 61% of the astronauts selected by NASA have come from military service.[1]\\r\\nNASA selects candidates from a diverse pool of applicants with a wide variety of backgrounds. From the thousands of applications received, only a few are chosen for the intensive Astronaut Candidate training program. Including the Original Seven, 339 candidates have been selected to date.[2]\\r\\nThe Astronaut Corps is based at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, although members may be assigned to other locations based on mission requirements, e.g. Soyuz training at Star City, Russia.\\r\\nThe Chief of the Astronaut Office is the most senior leadership position for active astronauts in the Corps. The Chief Astronaut serves as head of the Corps and is the principal adviser to the NASA Administrator on astronaut training and operations. The first Chief Astronaut was Deke Slayton, appointed in 1962. The current Chief Astronaut is Patrick Forrester.\\r\\nSalaries for newly hired civilian astronauts are based on the federal government's General Schedule pay scale for grades GS-11 through GS-14. The astronaut's grade is based on his or her academic achievements and experience.[3] Astronauts can be promoted up to grade GS-15.[4] As of 2015, astronauts based at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, earn between $66,026 (GS-11 step 1) and $158,700 (GS-15 step 8 and above).[5]\\r\\nMilitary astronauts are detailed to the Johnson Space Center and remain on active duty for pay, benefits, leave, and similar military matters.\\r\\nThere are no age restrictions for the NASA Astronaut Corps. Astronaut candidates have ranged between the ages of 26 and 46, with the average age being 34. Candidates must be U.S. citizens to apply for the program.\\r\\nThere are three broad categories of qualifications: education, work experience, and medical.[6]\\r\\nCandidates must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering, biological science, physical science or mathematics. The degree must be followed by at least three years of related, progressively responsible, professional experience (graduate work or studies) or at least 1,000 pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. An advanced degree is desirable and may be substituted for experience (master's degree = 1 year or a doctoral degree = 3 years). Teaching experience, including experience at the K - 12 levels, is considered to be qualifying experience.\\r\\nCandidates must have the ability to pass the NASA long-duration space flight physical, which includes the following specific requirements:\\r\\nAs of May 2017[update] the corps has 44 active astronauts[7] and 36 \\"management astronauts\\", who are \\"employed at NASA but are no longer eligible for flight assignment\\"[8]. The highest number of active astronauts at one time, was in 2000 when there were 149.[9] All of the current astronaut corps are from the classes of 1996 (Group 16) or later.\\r\\nThere are currently 19 \\"international active astronauts\\", \\"who are assigned to duties at the Johnson Space Center\\"[10], who were selected by their home agency but trained with and serve alongside their NASA counterparts. International astronauts, Payload Specialists, and Spaceflight Participants are not considered members of the NASA Astronaut Corps.\\r\\nThe term \\"Astronaut Candidate\\" (informally \\"ASCAN\\"[11]) refers to individuals who have been selected by NASA as candidates for the NASA Astronaut Corps and are currently undergoing a candidacy training program at the Johnson Space Center. The most recent class of Astronaut Candidates was selected in 2017 after receiving more than 18,300 applications. Upon completion of a two-year training program, they will be promoted to the rank of Astronaut.[12]\\r\\nSelection as an Astronaut Candidate and subsequent promotion to Astronaut does not guarantee the individual will eventually fly in space. Some have voluntarily resigned or been medically disqualified after becoming astronauts but before being selected for flights.\\r\\nCivilian candidates are expected to remain with the Corps for at least five years after initial training; military candidates are assigned for specific tours. After these time limits, members of the Astronaut Corps may resign or retire at any time.\\r\\nThree members of the Astronaut Corps were killed during a ground test accident while preparing for the Apollo 1 mission. Eleven were killed during spaceflight, on Space Shuttle missions STS-51-L and STS-107.[13] Another four (Elliot See, Charles Bassett, Theodore Freeman, and Clifton Williams) were killed in T-38 plane crashes during training for space flight during the Gemini and Apollo programs. Another was killed in a 1967 automobile accident, and another died in a 1991 commercial airliner crash while traveling on NASA business.\\r\\nTwo members of the Corps have been involuntarily dismissed: Lisa Nowak and William Oefelein. Both were returned to service with the U.S. Navy.\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.","input":"What is the age limit to be an astronaut?"},{"output":"December 2013","context":"","input":"When did the civil war in south sudan start?"},{"output":"nursery rhyme","context":"\\"Hickory Dickory Dock\\" or \\"Hickety Dickety Dock\\" is a popular English nursery rhyme.

It was established and ruled by the Timurid dynasty with Turco-Mongol Chagatai roots from Central Asia, claiming direct descent from both Genghis Khan (through his son Chagatai Khan) and Timur,[11][12][13] but with significant Indian Rajput and Persian ancestry through marriage alliances;[14][15] only the first two Mughal emperors were fully Central Asian.[16] The dynasty was Indo-Persian in culture,[17] combining Persianate culture[10][18] with local Indian cultural influences[17] visible in its traits and customs.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beginning of the empire is conventionally dated to the victory by its founder Babur over Ibrahim Lodi, the last ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, in the First Battle of Panipat (1526).  During the reign of Humayun, the successor of Babur, the empire was briefly interrupted by the Sur Empire. The \\"classic period\\" of the Mughal Empire started in 1556 with the ascension of Akbar the Great to the throne.  Some Rajput kingdoms continued to pose a significant threat to the Mughal dominance of northwestern India, but most of them were subdued by Akbar. All Mughal emperors were Muslims; Akbar, however, propounded a syncretic religion in the latter part of his life called Dؐn-i Ilhؐ, as recorded in historical books like Ain-i-Akbari and Dabistn-i Mazhib.[20] The Mughal Empire did not try to intervene in the local societies during most of its existence, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[21][22] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[23] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[24] Traditional and newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, the Pashtuns, the Hindu Jats and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[25][26][27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nInternal dissatisfaction arose due to the weakness of the empire's administrative and economic systems, leading to its break-up and declarations of independence of its former provinces by the Nawab of Bengal, the Nawab of Awadh, the Nizam of Hyderabad and other small states. In 1739, the Mughals were crushingly defeated in the Battle of Karnal by the forces of Nader Shah, the founder of the Afsharid dynasty in Persia, and Delhi was sacked and looted, drastically accelerating their decline. By the mid-18th century, the Marathas had routed Mughal armies and won over several Mughal provinces from the Punjab to Bengal.[29] During the following century Mughal power had become severely limited, and the last emperor, Bahadur Shah II, had authority over only the city of Shahjahanabad. He issued a firman supporting the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and following the defeat was therefore tried by the British East India Company for treason, imprisoned and exiled to Rangoon.[30] The last remnants of the empire were formally taken over by the British, and the Government of India Act 1858 let the British Crown formally assume direct control of India in the form of the new British Raj.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal Empire at its peak extended over nearly all of the Indian subcontinent[6] and parts of Afghanistan. It was the third largest empire to have existed in the Indian subcontinent (along with the Maurya Empire and the British Indian Empire), spanning approximately four million square kilometres at its zenith,[5] second only to the Maurya Empire. The maximum expansion was reached during the reign of Aurangzeb, who ruled over more than 150 million subjects, nearly one quarter of the world's population at the time.[31] The Mughal Empire also ushered in a period of proto-industrialization,[32] and around the 17th century, Mughal India became the world's largest economic and manufacturing power,[33] producing a quarter of global industrial output up until the 18th century.[34][35] The Mughal Empire is considered \\"India's last golden age\\"[36] and one of the three Islamic Gunpowder Empires (along with the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Persia).[37] The reign of Shah Jahan, the fifth emperor, between 1628 and 1658, was the zenith of Mughal architecture with famous monuments such as the Taj Mahal and Moti Masjid at Agra, the Red Fort, the Jama Masjid, Delhi, and the Lahore Fort.\\r\\n\\r\\nContemporaries referred to the empire founded by Babur as the Timurid empire,[38] which reflected the heritage of his dynasty, and this was the term preferred by the Mughals themselves.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal designation for their own dynasty was Gurkani (Persian: ??????????, Grkniyn, meaning \\"sons-in-law\\").[8] The use of Mughal derived from the Arabic and Persian corruption of Mongol, and it emphasised the Mongol origins of the Timurid dynasty.[37] The term gained currency during the 19th century, but remains disputed by Indologists.[40] Similar terms had been used to refer to the empire, including \\"Mogul\\" and \\"Moghul\\".[10][41] Nevertheless, Babur's ancestors were sharply distinguished from the classical Mongols insofar as they were oriented towards Persian rather than Turco-Mongol culture.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother name for the empire was Hindustan, which was documented in the Ain-i-Akbari, and which has been described as the closest to an official name for the empire.[43] In the west, the term \\"Mughal\\" was used for the emperor, and by extension, the empire as a whole.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal Empire was founded by Babur (reigned 1526ÿ1530), a Central Asian ruler who was descended from the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur (the founder of the Timurid Empire) on his father's side and from Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother's side.[45] Ousted from his ancestral domains in Central Asia, Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass.[45] Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526.[45] The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun (reigned 1530ÿ1556), who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.[45] The Sur Empire (1540ÿ1555), founded by Sher Shah Suri (reigned 1540ÿ1545), briefly interrupted Mughal rule. Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing Persian cultural influence in the Mughal Empire. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun's triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAkbar the Great (reigned 1556ÿ1605) was born Jalal-ud-din Muhammad[46] in the Rajput Umarkot Fort,[47] to Humayun and his wife Hamida Banu Begum, a Persian princess.[48] Akbar succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.[45] Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari River. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government, and supported cultural developments.[45] At the same time, Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. India developed a strong and stable economy, leading to commercial expansion and economic development. Akbar allowed free expression of religion, and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult.[45] He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nJahangir (born Salim,[49] reigned 1605ÿ1627) was born to Akbar and his wife Mariam-uz-Zamani, an Indian Rajput princess.[50] Jahangir ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques.[45] Shah Jahan (reigned 1628ÿ1658) was born to Jahangir and his wife Jagat Gosaini, a Rajput princess.[49] During the reign of Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.[45] The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nShah Jahan's eldest son, the liberal Dara Shikoh, became regent in 1658, as a result of his father's illness. However, a younger son, Aurangzeb (reigned 1658ÿ1707), allied with the Islamic orthodoxy against his brother, who championed a syncretistic Hindu-Muslim culture, and ascended to the throne. Aurangzeb defeated Dara in 1659 and had him executed.[45] Although Shah Jahan fully recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb declared him incompetent to rule and had him imprisoned. During Aurangzeb's reign, the empire gained political strength once more.[45] Aurangzeb expanded the empire to include almost the whole of South Asia, but at his death in 1707, many parts of the empire were in open revolt.[45] Aurangzeb is considered India's most controversial king,[51] with some historians arguing his religious conservatism and intolerance undermined the stability of Mughal society,[45] while other historians question this, noting that he built Hindu temples,[52] employed significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors did, opposed bigotry against Hindus and Shia Muslims,[53] and married Hindu Rajput princess Nawab Bai.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAurangzeb's son, Shah Alam, repealed the religious policies of his father, and attempted to reform the administration. However, after his death in 1712, the Mughal dynasty sank into chaos and violent feuds. In 1719 alone, four emperors successively ascended the throne.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the reign of Muhammad Shah (reigned 1719ÿ1748), the empire began to break up, and vast tracts of central India passed from Mughal to Maratha hands. The far-off Indian campaign of Nadir Shah, who had priorly reestablished Iranian suzerainty over most of West Asia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia, culminated with the Sack of Delhi and shattered the remnants of Mughal power and prestige.[45] Many of the empire's elites now sought to control their own affairs, and broke away to form independent kingdoms.[45] But, according to Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal, the Mughal Emperor continued to be the highest manifestation of sovereignty. Not only the Muslim gentry, but the Maratha, Hindu, and Sikh leaders took part in ceremonial acknowledgements of the emperor as the sovereign of India.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II (1759ÿ1806) made futile attempts to reverse the Mughal decline but ultimately had to seek the protection of the Emir of Afghanistan, Ahmed Shah Abdali, which led to the Third Battle of Panipat between the Maratha Empire and the Afghans led by Abdali in 1761. In 1771, the Marathas recaptured Delhi from Afghan control and in 1784 they officially became the protectors of the emperor in Delhi,[55] a state of affairs that continued further until after the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Thereafter, the British East India Company became the protectors of the Mughal dynasty in Delhi.[54] The British East India Company took control of the former Mughal province of Bengal-Bihar in 1793 after it abolished local rule (Nizamat) that lasted until 1858, marking the beginning of British colonial era over the Indian Subcontinent. By 1857 a considerable part of former Mughal India was under the East India Company's control. After a crushing defeat in the war of 1857ÿ1858 which he nominally led, the last Mughal, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was deposed by the British East India Company and exiled in 1858. Through the Government of India Act 1858 the British Crown assumed direct control of East India Company-held territories in India in the form of the new British Raj. In 1876 the British Queen Victoria assumed the title of Empress of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorians have offered numerous explanations for the rapid collapse of the Mughal Empire between 1707 and 1720, after a century of growth and prosperity. In fiscal terms the throne lost the revenues needed to pay its chief officers, the emirs (nobles) and their entourages. The emperor lost authority, as the widely scattered imperial officers lost confidence in the central authorities, and made their own deals with local men of influence. The imperial army, bogged down in long, futile wars against the more aggressive Marathas lost its fighting spirit. Finally came a series of violent political feuds over control of the throne. After the execution of emperor Farrukhsiyar in 1719, local Mughal successor states took power in region after region.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nContemporary chroniclers bewailed the decay they witnessed, a theme picked up by the first British historians who wanted to underscore the need for a British-led rejuvenation.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1970s historians have taken multiple approaches to the decline, with little consensus on which factor was dominant. The psychological interpretations emphasise depravity in high places, excessive luxury, and increasingly narrow views that left the rulers unprepared for an external challenge. A Marxist school (led by Irfan Habib and based at Aligarh Muslim University) emphasises excessive exploitation of the peasantry by the rich, which stripped away the will and the means to support the regime.[58] Karen Leonard has focused on the failure of the regime to work with Hindu bankers, whose financial support was increasingly needed; the bankers then helped the Maratha and the British.[59] In a religious interpretation, some scholars argue that the Hindu powers revolted against the rule of a Muslim dynasty.[60] Finally, other scholars argue that the very prosperity of the Empire inspired the provinces to achieve a high degree of independence, thus weakening the imperial court.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nJeffrey G. Williamson has argued that the Indian economy went through deindustrialization in the latter half of the 18th century as an indirect outcome of the collapse of the Mughal Empire, with British rule later causing further deindustrialization.[62] According to Williamson, the decline of the Mughal Empire led to a decline in agricultural productivity, which drove up food prices, then nominal wages, and then textile prices, which led to India losing a share of the world textile market to Britain even before it had superior factory technology.[63] Indian textiles, however, still maintained a competitive advantage over British textiles up until the 19th century.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nSubah (Urdu: ????) was the term for a province in the Mughal Empire. The word is derived from Arabic. The governor of a Subah was known as a subahdar (sometimes also referred to as a \\"Subah\\"[65]), which later became subedar to refer to an officer in the Indian Army. The subahs were established by padshah (emperor) Akbar during his administrative reforms of 1572ÿ1580; initially they numbered 12, but his conquests expanded the number of subahs to 15 by the end of his reign. Subahs were divided into Sarkars, or districts. Sarkars were further divided into Parganas or Mahals. His successors, most notably Aurangzeb, expanded the number of subahs further through their conquests. As the empire began to dissolve in the early 18th century, many subahs became effectively independent, or were conquered by the Marathas or the British.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original twelve subahs created as a result of administrative reform by Akbar:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian economy was large and prosperous under the Mughal Empire.[66] During the Mughal era, the gross domestic product (GDP) of India in 1600 was estimated at about 22.4% of the world economy, the second largest in the world, behind only Ming China but larger than Europe. By 1700, the GDP of Mughal India had risen to 24.4% of the world economy, the largest in the world, larger than both Qing China and Western Europe.[67] Mughal India was the world leader in manufacturing,[33] producing about 25% of the world's industrial output up until the 18th century.[35] India's GDP growth increased under the Mughal Empire, with India's GDP having a faster growth rate during the Mughal era than in the 1,500 years prior to the Mughal era.[67] Mughal India's economy has been described as a form of proto-industrialization, like that of 18th-century Western Europe prior to the Industrial Revolution.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughals were responsible for building an extensive road system, creating a uniform currency, and the unification of the country.[68] The empire had an extensive road network, which was vital to the economic infrastructure, built by a public works department set up by the Mughals which designed, constructed and maintained roads linking towns and cities across the empire, making trade easier to conduct.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughals adopted and standardized the rupee (rupiya, or silver) and dam (copper) currencies introduced by Sur Emperor Sher Shah Suri during his brief rule.[69] The currency was initially 48 dams to a single rupee in the beginning of Akbar's reign, before it later became 38 dams to a rupee in the 1580s, with the dam's value rising further in the 17th century as a result of new industrial uses for copper, such as in bronze cannons and brass utensils. The dam was initially the most common coin in Akbar's time, before being replaced by the rupee as the most common coin in succeeding reigns.[7] The dam's value was later worth 30 to a rupee towards the end of Jahangir's reign, and then 16 to a rupee by the 1660s.[70] The Mughals minted coins with high purity, never dropping below 96%, and without debasement until the 1720s.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite India having its own stocks of gold and silver, the Mughals produced minimal gold of their own, but mostly minted coins from imported bullion, as a result of the empire's strong export-driven economy, with global demand for Indian agricultural and industrial products drawing a steady stream of precious metals into India.[7] Around 80% of Mughal India's imports were bullion, mostly silver,[72] with major sources of imported bullion including the New World and Japan,[71] which in turn imported large quantities of textiles and silk from the Bengal Subah province.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal Empire's workforce in the early 17th century consisted of about 64% in the primary sector (including agriculture) and 36% in the secondary and tertiary sectors, including over 11% in the secondary sector (manufacturing) and about 25% in the tertiary sector (service).[74] Mughal India's workforce had a higher percentage in the non-primary sector than Europe's workforce did at the time; agriculture accounted for 65ÿ90% of Europe's workforce in 1700, and 65ÿ75% in 1750, including 65% of England's workforce in 1750.[75] In terms of contributions to the Mughal economy, in the late 16th century, the primary sector contributed 52.4%, the secondary sector 18.2% and the tertiary sector 29.4%; the secondary sector contributed a higher percentage than in early 20th-century British India, where the secondary sector only contributed 11.2% to the economy.[76] In terms of urban-rural divide, 18% of Mughal India's labour force were urban and 82% were rural, contributing 52% and 48% to the economy, respectively.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nReal wages and living standards in 18th-century Mughal Bengal and South India were higher than in Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe.[78][62] According to economic historian Paul Bairoch, India as well as China had a higher GNP per capita than Europe up until the late 18th century,[79][80] before Western European per-capita income pulled ahead after 1800.[81] Mughal India also had a higher per-capita income in the late 16th century than British India did in the early 20th century.[76] However, in a system where wealth was hoarded by elites, wages were depressed for manual labour,[82] though no less than labour wages in Europe at the time.[78] In Mughal India, there was a generally tolerant attitude towards manual labourers, with some religious cults in northern India proudly asserting a high status for manual labour. While slavery also existed, it was limited largely to household servants.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian agricultural production increased under the Mughal Empire.[66] A variety of crops were grown, including food crops such as wheat, rice, and barley, and non-food cash crops such as cotton, indigo and opium. By the mid-17th century, Indian cultivators begun to extensively grow two new crops from the Americas, maize and tobacco.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal administration emphasized agrarian reform, which began under the non-Mughal emperor Sher Shah Suri, the work of which Akbar adopted and furthered with more reforms. The civil administration was organized in a hierarchical manner on the basis of merit, with promotions based on performance.[3] The Mughal government funded the building of irrigation systems across the empire, which produced much higher crop yields and increased the net revenue base, leading to increased agricultural production.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nA major Mughal reform introduced by Akbar was a new land revenue system called zabt. He replaced the tribute system, previously common in India and used by Tokugawa Japan at the time, with a monetary tax system based on a uniform currency.[83] The revenue system was biased in favour of higher value cash crops such as cotton, indigo, sugar cane, tree-crops, and opium, providing state incentives to grow cash crops, in addition to rising market demand.[84] Under the zabt system, the Mughals also conducted extensive cadastral surveying to assess the area of land under plow cultivation, with the Mughal state encouraging greater land cultivation by offering tax-free periods to those who brought new land under cultivation.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nMughal agriculture was in some ways advanced compared to European agriculture at the time, exemplified by the common use of the seed drill among Indian peasants before its adoption in Europe.[86] While the average peasant across the world was only skilled in growing very few crops, the average Indian peasant was skilled in growing a wide variety of food and non-food crops, increasing their productivity.[87] Indian peasants were also quick to adapt to profitable new crops, such as maize and tobacco from the New World being rapidly adopted and widely cultivated across Mughal India between 1600 and 1650. Bengali farmers rapidly learned techniques of mulberry cultivation and sericulture, establishing Bengal Subah as a major silk-producing region of the world.[84] Sugar mills appeared in India shortly before the Mughal era. Evidence for the use of a draw bar for sugar-milling appears at Delhi in 1540, but may also date back earlier, and was mainly used in the northern Indian subcontinent. Geared sugar rolling mills first appeared in Mughal India, using the principle of rollers as well as worm gearing, by the 17th century.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to evidence cited by the economic historians Immanuel Wallerstein, Irfan Habib, Percival Spear, and Ashok Desai, per-capita agricultural output and standards of consumption in 17th-century Mughal India were higher than in 17th-century Europe and early 20th-century British India.[89] The increased agricultural productivity led to lower food prices. In turn, this benefited the Indian textile industry. Compared to Britain, the price of grain was about one-half in South India and one-third in Bengal, in terms of silver coinage. This resulted in lower silver coin prices for Indian textiles, giving them a price advantage in global markets.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nUp until the 18th century, Mughal India was the most important center of manufacturing in international trade.[33] Up until 1750, India produced about 25% of the world's industrial output.[62] Manufactured goods and cash crops from the Mughal Empire were sold throughout the world. Key industries included textiles, shipbuilding, and steel. Processed products included cotton textiles, yarns, thread, silk, jute products, metalware, and foods such as sugar, oils and butter.[66] The growth of manufacturing industries in the Indian subcontinent during the Mughal era in the 17thÿ18th centuries has been referred to as a form of proto-industrialization, similar to 18th-century Western Europe prior to the Industrial Revolution.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early modern Europe, there was significant demand for products from Mughal India, particularly cotton textiles, as well as goods such as spices, peppers, indigo, silks, and saltpeter (for use in munitions).[66] European fashion, for example, became increasingly dependent on Mughal Indian textiles and silks. From the late 17th century to the early 18th century, Mughal India accounted for 95% of British imports from Asia, and the Bengal Subah province alone accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia.[90] In contrast, there was very little demand for European goods in Mughal India, which was largely self-sufficient, thus Europeans had very little to offer, except for some woolens, unprocessed metals and a few luxury items. The trade imbalance caused Europeans to export large quantities of gold and silver to Mughal India in order to pay for South Asian imports.[66] Indian goods, especially those from Bengal, were also exported in large quantities to other Asian markets, such as Indonesia and Japan.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest manufacturing industry in the Mughal Empire was textile manufacturing, particularly cotton textile manufacturing, which included the production of piece goods, calicos, and muslins, available unbleached and in a variety of colours. The cotton textile industry was responsible for a large part of the empire's international trade.[66] India had a 25% share of the global textile trade in the early 18th century.[91] Indian cotton textiles were the most important manufactured goods in world trade in the 18th century, consumed across the world from the Americas to Japan.[33] By the early 18th century, Mughal Indian textiles were clothing people across the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Europe, the Americas, Africa, and the Middle East.[63] The most important center of cotton production was the Bengal province, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nBengal accounted for more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of silks imported by the Dutch from Asia,[90] Bengali silk and cotton textiles were exported in large quantities to Europe, Indonesia, and Japan,[73] and Bengali muslin textiles from Dhaka were sold in Central Asia, where they were known as \\"daka\\" textiles.[92] Indian textiles dominated the Indian Ocean trade for centuries, were sold in the Atlantic Ocean trade, and had a 38% share of the West African trade in the early 18th century, while Indian calicos were a major force in Europe, and Indian textiles accounted for 20% of total English trade with Southern Europe in the early 18th century.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worm gear roller cotton gin, which was invented in India during the early Delhi Sultanate era of the 13thÿ14th centuries, came into use in the Mughal Empire some time around the 16th century,[88] and is still used in India through to the present day.[93] Another innovation, the incorporation of the crank handle in the cotton gin, first appeared in India some time during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire.[94] The production of cotton, which may have largely been spun in the villages and then taken to towns in the form of yarn to be woven into cloth textiles, was advanced by the diffusion of the spinning wheel across India shortly before the Mughal era, lowering the costs of yarn and helping to increase demand for cotton. The diffusion of the spinning wheel, and the incorporation of the worm gear and crank handle into the roller cotton gin, led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production during the Mughal era.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was reported that, with an Indian cotton gin, which is half machine and half tool, one man and one woman could clean 28 pounds of cotton per day. With a modified Forbes version, one man and a boy could produce 250 pounds per day. If oxen were used to power 16 of these machines, and a few people's labour was used to feed them, they could produce as much work as 750 people did formerly.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nMughal India had a large shipbuilding industry, which was also largely centered in the Bengal province. In terms of shipbuilding tonnage during the 16thÿ18th centuries, the annual output of Bengal alone totaled around 2,232,500 tons, larger than the combined output of the Dutch (450,000ÿ550,000 tons), the British (340,000 tons), and North America (23,061 tons).[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughals maintained a small fleet for carrying pilgrims to Mecca, and imported Arabian horses in Surat. Debal in Sindh was mostly autonomous. The Mughals also maintained various river fleets of Dhows, which transported soldiers over rivers and fought rebels. Among its admirals were Yahya Saleh, Munnawar Khan, and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh. The Mughals also protected the Siddis of Janjira. Its sailors were renowned and often voyaged to China and the East African Swahili Coast, together with some Mughal subjects carrying out private-sector trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian shipbuilding, particularly in Bengal, was advanced compared to European shipbuilding at the time, with Indians selling ships to European firms. Ship-repairing, for example, was very advanced in Bengal, where European shippers visited to repair vessels.[97] An important innovation in shipbuilding was the introduction of a flushed deck design in Bengal rice ships, resulting in hulls that were stronger and less prone to leak than the structurally weak hulls of traditional European ships built with a stepped deck design. The British East India Company later duplicated the flushed deck and hull designs of Bengal rice ships in the 1760s, leading to significant improvements in seaworthiness and navigation for European ships during the Industrial Revolution.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bengal Subah province was especially prosperous from the time of its takeover by the Mughals in 1590 until the British East India Company seized control in 1757.[99] It was the Mughal Empire's wealthiest province,[100] and the economic powerhouse of the Mughal Empire, generating 50% of the empire's GDP.[101] Domestically, much of India depended on Bengali products such as rice, silks and cotton textiles. Overseas, Europeans depended on Bengali products such as cotton textiles, silks and opium; Bengal accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia, for example, including more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of silks.[90] From Bengal, saltpeter was also shipped to Europe, opium was sold in Indonesia, raw silk was exported to Japan and the Netherlands, and cotton and silk textiles were exported to Europe, Indonesia and Japan.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nBengal was described as the Paradise of Nations by Mughal emperors.[102] The Mughals introduced agrarian reforms, including the modern Bengali calendar.[103] The calendar played a vital role in developing and organising harvests, tax collection and Bengali culture in general, including the New Year and Autumn festivals. The province was a leading producer of grains, salt, pearls, fruits, liquors and wines, precious metals and ornaments.[104] Its handloom industry flourished under royal warrants, making the region a hub of the worldwide muslin trade, which peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries. The provincial capital Dhaka became the commercial capital of the empire. The Mughals expanded cultivated land in the Bengal delta under the leadership of Sufis, which consolidated the foundation of Bengali Muslim society.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 150 years of rule by Mughal viceroys, Bengal gained semi-independence as a dominion under the Nawab of Bengal in 1717. The Nawabs permitted European companies to set up trading posts across the region, including firms from Britain, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal and Austria-Hungary. An Armenian community dominated banking and shipping in major cities and towns. The Europeans regarded Bengal as the richest place for trade.[104] By the late 18th century, the British displaced the Mughal ruling class in Bengal.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia's population growth accelerated under the Mughal Empire, with an unprecedented economic and demographic upsurge which boosted the Indian population by 60%[106] to 253% in 200 years during 1500ÿ1700.[107] The Indian population had a faster growth during the Mughal era than at any known point in Indian history prior to the Mughal era.[106][67] The increased population growth rate was stimulated by Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production.[84] By the time of Aurangzeb's reign, there were a total of 455,698 villages in the Mughal Empire.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table gives population estimates for the Mughal Empire, compared to the total population of India, including the regions of modern Pakistan and Bangladesh, and compared to the world population:\\r\\n\\r\\nCities and towns boomed under the Mughal Empire, which had a relatively high degree of urbanization for its time, with 15% of its population living in urban centres.[36] This was higher than the percentage of the urban population in contemporary Europe at the time and higher than that of British India in the 19th century;[36] the level of urbanization in Europe did not reach 15% until the 19th century.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Akbar's reign in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, 15% of the empire's total population. This was larger the entire urban population in Europe at the time, and even a century later in 1700, the urban population of England, Scotland and Wales did not exceed 13% of its total population,[108] while British India had an urban population that was under 13% of its total population in 1800 and 9.3% in 1881, a decline from the earlier Mughal era.[111] By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe historian Nizamuddin Ahmad (1551ÿ1621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, there were 120 large cities and 3200 townships.[36] A number of cities in India had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people,[36] with larger cities including Agra (in Agra Subah) with up to 800,000 people, Lahore (in Lahore Subah) with up to 700,000 people,[113] Dhaka (in Bengal Subah) with over 1 million people,[114] and Delhi (in Delhi Subah) with over 600,000 people.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nCities acted as markets for the sale of goods, and provided homes for a variety of merchants, traders, shopkeepers, artisans, moneylenders, weavers, craftspeople, officials, and religious figures.[66] However, a number of cities were military and political centres, rather than manufacturing or commerce centres.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nMughal influence can be seen in cultural contributions such as:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughals built Maktab schools in every province under their authority, where youth were taught the Quran and Islamic law such as the Fatawa-i-Alamgiri in their indigenous languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughals made a major contribution to the Indian subcontinent with development of their unique architecture. Many monuments were built during the Mughal era by the Muslim emperors, especially Shah Jahan, including the Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known to be one of the finer examples of Mughal architecture. Other World Heritage Sites include Humayun's Tomb, Fatehpur Sikri, the Red Fort, the Agra Fort, and the Lahore Fort.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe palaces, tombs, and forts built by the dynasty stand today in Agra, Aurangabad, Delhi, Dhaka, Fatehpur Sikri, Jaipur, Lahore, Kabul, Sheikhupura, and many other cities of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh.[122] With few memories of Central Asia, Babur's descendants absorbed traits and customs of South Asia[19] and became more or less naturalized. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the land the Mughals once ruled has separated into what is now India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan, their influence can still be seen widely today. Tombs of the emperors are spread throughout India, Afghanistan,[123] and Pakistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal artistic tradition was eclectic, borrowing from the European Renaissance as well as from Persian and Indian sources. Kumar concludes, \\"The Mughal painters borrowed individual motifs and certain naturalistic effects from Renaissance and Mannerist painting, but their structuring principle was derived from Indian and Persian traditions.\\"[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Persian was the dominant and \\"official\\" language of the empire, the language of the elite was a Persianised form of Hindustani called Urdu. The language was written in a type of Perso-Arabic script known as Nastaliq, and with literary conventions and specialised vocabulary borrowed from Persian, Arabic and Turkic; the dialect was eventually given its own name of Urdu.[125] Modern Hindi, which uses Sanskrit-based vocabulary along with Perso-Arabic loan words is mutually intelligible with Urdu.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nMughal India was one of the three Islamic Gunpowder Empires, along with the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Persia.[37][126][127] By the time he was invited by Lodi governor of Lahore, Daulat Khan, to support his rebellion against Lodi Sultan Ibrahim Khan, Babur was familiar with gunpowder firearms and field artillery, and a method for deploying them.  Babur had employed Ottoman expert Ustad Ali Quli, who showed Babur the standard Ottoman formationartillery and firearm-equipped infantry protected by wagons in the center and the mounted archers on both wings. Babur used this formation at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, where the Afghan and Rajput forces loyal to the Delhi Sultanate, though superior in numbers but without the gunpowder weapons, were defeated. The decisive victory of the Timurid forces is one reason opponents rarely met Mughal princes in pitched battle over the course of the empire's history.[128] In India, guns made of bronze were recovered from Calicut (1504) and Diu (1533).[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nFathullah Shirazi (c. 1582), a Persian polymath and mechanical engineer who worked for Akbar, developed an early multi gun shot. As opposed to the polybolos and repeating crossbows used earlier in ancient Greece and China, respectively, Shirazi's rapid-firing gun had multiple gun barrels that fired hand cannons loaded with gunpowder. It may be considered a version of a volley gun.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 17th century, Indians were manufacturing a diverse variety of firearms; large guns in particular, became visible in Tanjore, Dacca, Bijapur and Murshidabad.[131] Gujart supplied Europe saltpeter for use in gunpowder warfare during the 17th century,[132] and Mughal Bengal and Mlwa also participated in saltpeter production.[132] The Dutch, French, Portuguese and English used Chpra as a center of saltpeter refining.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 16th century, Akbar was the first to initiate and use metal cylinder rockets known as bans, particularly against war elephants, during the Battle of Sanbal.[134] In 1657, the Mughal Army used rockets during the Siege of Bidar.[135] Prince Aurangzeb's forces discharged rockets and grenades while scaling the walls. Sidi Marjan was mortally wounded when a rocket struck his large gunpowder depot, and after twenty-seven days of hard fighting Bidar was captured by the victorious Mughals.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder, James Riddick Partington described Indian rockets and explosive mines:[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian war rockets were formidable weapons before such rockets were used in Europe. They had bam-boo rods, a rocket-body lashed to the rod, and iron points. They were directed at the target and fired by lighting the fuse, but the trajectory was rather erratic. The use of mines and counter-mines with explosive charges of gunpowder is mentioned for the times of Akbar and Jahngir.\\r\\nLater, the Mysorean rockets were upgraded versions of Mughal rockets used during the Siege of Jinji by the progeny of the Nawab of Arcot. Hyder Ali's father Fatah Muhammad the constable at Budikote, commanded a corps consisting of 50 rocketmen (Cushoon) for the Nawab of Arcot. Hyder Ali realised the importance of rockets and introduced advanced versions of metal cylinder rockets. These rockets turned fortunes in favour of the Sultanate of Mysore during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, particularly during the Battle of Pollilur. In turn, the Mysorean rockets were the basis for the Congreve rockets, which Britain deployed in the Napoleonic Wars against France and the War of 1812 against the United States.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile there appears to have been little concern for theoretical astronomy, Mughal astronomers  made advances in observational astronomy and produced nearly a hundred Zij treatises. Humayun built a personal observatory near Delhi; Jahangir and Shah Jahan were also intending to build observatories, but were unable to do so. The astronomical instruments and observational techniques used at the Mughal observatories were mainly derived from Islamic astronomy.[137][138] In the 17th century, the Mughal Empire saw a synthesis between Islamic and Hindu astronomy, where Islamic observational instruments were combined with Hindu computational techniques.[137][138]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Hindu king Jai Singh II of Amber continued the work of Mughal astronomy. In the early 18th century, he built several large observatories called Yantra Mandirs, in order to rival Ulugh Beg's Samarkand observatory, and in order to improve on the earlier Hindu computations in the Siddhantas and Islamic observations in Zij-i-Sultani. The instruments he used were influenced by Islamic astronomy, while the computational techniques were derived from Hindu astronomy.[137][138]\\r\\n\\r\\nSake Dean Mahomed had learned much of Mughal chemistry and understood the techniques used to produce various alkali and soaps to produce shampoo. He was also a notable writer who described the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II and the cities of Allahabad and Delhi in rich detail and also made note of the glories of the Mughal Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Britain, Sake Dean Mahomed was appointed as shampooing surgeon to both Kings George IV and William IV.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most remarkable astronomical instruments invented in Mughal India is the seamless celestial globe. It was invented in Kashmir by Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in 998 AH (1589ÿ90 CE), and twenty other such globes were later produced in Lahore and Kashmir during the Mughal Empire. Before they were rediscovered in the 1980s, it was believed by modern metallurgists to be technically impossible to produce metal globes without any seams.[140]","input":"Who was the first mughal ruled on india?"},{"output":"triglyceride","context":"Glycogen is a multibranched polysaccharide of glucose that serves as a form of energy storage in humans,[2] animals,[3] fungi, and bacteria. The polysaccharide structure represents the main storage form of glucose in the body.\\r\\nGlycogen functions as one of two forms of long-term energy reserves, with the other form being triglyceride stores in adipose tissue (i.e., body fat). In humans, glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the liver and skeletal muscle.[2][4] In the liver, glycogen can make up from 5ÿ6% of the organ's fresh weight and the liver of an adult weighing 70?kg can store roughly 100ÿ120?grams of glycogen.[2][5] In skeletal muscle, glycogen is found in a low concentration (1ÿ2% of the muscle mass) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70?kg can store roughly 400?grams of glycogen.[2] The amount of glycogen stored in the bodyparticularly within the muscles and livermostly depends on physical training, basal metabolic rate, and eating habits. Small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells, including the kidneys, red blood cells,[6][7][8] white blood cells,[medical citation needed] and glial cells in the brain.[9] The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo.[10]\\r\\nApproximately 4?grams of glucose are present in the blood of humans at all times;[2] in fasted individuals, blood glucose is maintained constant at this level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle.[2] Glycogen stores in skeletal muscle serve as a form of energy storage for the muscle itself;[2] however, the breakdown of muscle glycogen impedes muscle glucose uptake, thereby increasing the amount of blood glucose available for use in other tissues.[2] Liver glycogen stores serve as a store of glucose for use throughout the body, particularly the central nervous system.[2] The human brain consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasted, sedentary individuals.[2]\\r\\nGlycogen is the analogue of starch, a glucose polymer that functions as energy storage in plants. It has a structure similar to amylopectin (a component of starch), but is more extensively branched and compact than starch. Both are white powders in their dry state. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol/cytoplasm in many cell types, and plays an important role in the glucose cycle. Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of triglycerides (lipids).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGlycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 8ÿ12 glucose units[11]. Glucose units are linked together linearly by ϫ(1L4) glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next. Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by ϫ(1L6) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain.[12]\\r\\nDue to the way glycogen is synthesised, every glycogen granule has at its core a glycogenin protein.[13]\\r\\nGlycogen in muscle, liver, and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form, composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45?millimoles of potassium per gram of glycogen.[4]\\r\\nAs a meal containing carbohydrates or protein is eaten and digested, blood glucose levels rise, and the pancreas secretes insulin. Blood glucose from the portal vein enters liver cells (hepatocytes). Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several enzymes, including glycogen synthase. Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this postprandial or \\"fed\\" state, the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases.\\r\\nAfter a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin secretion is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When it is needed for energy, glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. Glycogen phosphorylase is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8ÿ12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel.\\r\\nGlucagon, another hormone produced by the pancreas, in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin. In response to insulin levels being below normal (when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range), glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen) and gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from other sources).\\r\\nMuscle cell glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells. Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally, as well. As muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase, which is required to pass glucose into the blood, the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells. This is in contrast to liver cells, which, on demand, readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs.[citation needed]\\r\\nGlycogen was discovered by Claude Bernard. His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a \\"ferment\\" in the liver. By 1857, he described the isolation of a substance he called \\"la matire glycogne\\", or \\"sugar-forming substance\\". Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver, A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen. The empirical formula for glycogen of (C\\r\\n6H\\r\\n10O\\r\\n5)n was established by Kekule in 1858.[14]\\r\\nGlycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, endergonicit requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from uridine triphosphate (UTP), which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in a reaction catalysed by UTPglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose initially by the protein glycogenin, which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue, the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding ϫ(1L4)-bonded glucose. The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.\\r\\nGlycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate:\\r\\nIn vivo, phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100.[15] Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) by phosphoglucomutase. A special debranching enzyme is needed to remove the ϫ(1-6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates:\\r\\nThe most common disease in which glycogen metabolism becomes abnormal is diabetes, in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well.\\r\\nIn hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin levels prevent the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Glucagon is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia.\\r\\nVarious inborn errors of metabolism are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as glycogen storage diseases.\\r\\nLong-distance athletes, such as marathon runners, cross-country skiers, and cyclists, often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as \\"hitting the wall\\".\\r\\nGlycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways. First, during exercise, carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose (high glycemic index) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel,[16][17][citation needed] sparing carbohydrate use from all sources. Third, by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet, the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores.[18][19][20] This process is known as carbohydrate loading. In general, glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion.[21][22]\\r\\nWhen experiencing glycogen debt, athletes often experience extreme fatigue to the point that it is difficult to move. As a reference, the very best professional cyclists in the world will usually finish a 4- to 5-hr stage race right at the limit of glycogen depletion using the first three strategies.\\r\\nWhen athletes ingest both carbohydrate and caffeine following exhaustive exercise, their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly;[23][24][25] however, the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a clinically significant effect on glycogen repletion has not been established.[25]","input":"Which two forms of energy do muscles produce?"},{"output":"Member of Parliament","context":" \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nExecutive:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n Legislature:\\r\\n\\r\\nJudiciary:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nPolitical parties\\r\\n\\r\\nNational coalitions:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nState governments\\r\\n\\r\\nLegislatures:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLocal governments:\\r\\nRural bodies:\\r\\n\\r\\nUrban bodies:\\r\\n\\r\\nA Member of Parliament of the Rajya Sabha (abbreviated: MP) is the representative of the Indian states to the upper house of the Parliament of India (Rajya Sabha).

Currently incurable, this disease is the most commonly inherited neurological disorder, and affects approximately 1 in 2,500 people.[1][2] CMT was previously classified as a subtype of muscular dystrophy.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms of CMT usually begin in early childhood or early adulthood, but can begin later. Some people do not experience symptoms until their early thirties or forties. Usually, the initial symptom is foot drop early in the course of the disease. This can also cause hammer toe, where the toes are always curled. Wasting of muscle tissue of the lower parts of the legs may give rise to a \\"stork leg\\" or \\"inverted champagne bottle\\" appearance. Weakness in the hands and forearms occurs in many people as the disease progresses.\\r\\nLoss of touch sensation in the feet, ankles and legs, as well as in the hands, wrists and arms occur with various types of the disease. Early and late onset forms occur with 'on and off' painful spasmodic muscular contractions that can be disabling when the disease activates. High-arched feet (pes cavus) or flat-arched feet (pes planus) are classically associated with the disorder.[3] Sensory and proprioceptive nerves in the hands and feet are often damaged, while unmyelinated pain nerves are left intact. Overuse of an affected hand or limb can activate symptoms including numbness, spasm, and painful cramping.\\r\\nSymptoms and progression of the disease can vary. Involuntary grinding of teeth as well as squinting are prevalent and often go unnoticed by the person affected. Breathing can be affected in some; so can hearing, vision, as well as the neck and shoulder muscles. Scoliosis is common, causing hunching and loss of height. Hip sockets can be malformed. Gastrointestinal problems can be part of CMT,[4][5] as can difficulty chewing, swallowing, and speaking (due to atrophy of vocal cords).[6] A tremor can develop as muscles waste. Pregnancy has been known to exacerbate CMT, as well as severe emotional stress. Patients with CMT must avoid periods of prolonged immobility such as when recovering from a secondary injury as prolonged periods of limited mobility can drastically accelerate symptoms of CMT.[7]\\r\\nPain due to postural changes, skeletal deformations, muscle fatigue and cramping is fairly common in people with CMT. It can be mitigated or treated by physical therapies, surgeries, and corrective or assistive devices. Analgesic medications may also be needed if other therapies do not provide relief from pain.[8] Neuropathic pain is often a symptom of CMT, though, like other symptoms of CMT, its presence and severity varies from case to case. For some people, pain can be significant to severe and interfere with daily life activities. However, pain is not experienced by all people with CMT. When neuropathic pain is present as a symptom of CMT, it is comparable to that seen in other peripheral neuropathies, as well as postherpetic neuralgia and complex regional pain syndrome, among other diseases.[9]\\r\\nCharcotÿMarieÿTooth disease is caused by mutations that cause defects in neuronal proteins. Nerve signals are conducted by an axon with a myelin sheath wrapped around it. Most mutations in CMT affect the myelin sheath, but some affect the axon.\\r\\nThe most common cause of CMT (70ÿ80% of the cases) is the duplication of a large region on the short arm of chromosome 17 that includes the gene PMP22. Some mutations affect the gene MFN2, which codes for a mitochondrial protein. Cells contain separate sets of genes in their nucleus and in their mitochondria. In nerve cells, the mitochondria travel down the long axons. In some forms of CMT, mutated MFN2 causes the mitochondria to form large clusters, or clots, which are unable to travel down the axon towards the synapses. This prevents the synapses from functioning.[10]\\r\\nCMT is divided into the primary demyelinating neuropathies (CMT1, CMT3, and CMT4) and the primary axonal neuropathies (CMT2), with frequent overlap. Another cell involved in CMT is the Schwann cell, which creates the myelin sheath, by wrapping its plasma membrane around the axon.[11]\\r\\nNeurons, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts work together to create a functional nerve. Schwann cells and neurons exchange molecular signals that regulate survival and differentiation. These signals are disrupted in CMT.[11]\\r\\nDemyelinating Schwann cells causes abnormal axon structure and function. They may cause axon degeneration, or they may simply cause axons to malfunction.[1]\\r\\nThe myelin sheath allows nerve cells to conduct signals faster. When the myelin sheath is damaged, nerve signals are slower, and this can be measured by a common neurological test, electromyography. When the axon is damaged, on the other hand, this results in a reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP).[12]\\r\\nCMT can be diagnosed through symptoms, through measurement of the speed of nerve impulses (nerve conduction studies), through biopsy of the nerve, and through DNA testing. DNA testing can give a definitive diagnosis, but not all the genetic markers for CMT are known. CMT is first noticed when someone develops lower leg weakness, such as foot drop; or foot deformities, including hammertoes and high arches. But signs alone do not lead to diagnosis. Patients must be referred to a physician specialising in neurology or rehabilitation medicine. To see signs of muscle weakness, the neurologist asks patients to walk on their heels or to move part of their leg against an opposing force. To identify sensory loss, the neurologist tests for deep tendon reflexes, such as the knee jerk, which are reduced or absent in CMT. The doctor also asks about family history, because CMT is hereditary. The lack of family history does not rule out CMT, but helps rule out other causes of neuropathy, such as diabetes or exposure to certain chemicals or drugs.[13]\\r\\nIn 2010, CMT was one of the first diseases where the genetic cause of a particular patient's disease was precisely determined by sequencing the whole genome of an affected individual. This was done by the scientists employed by the Charcot Marie Tooth Association (CMTA)[14][15] Two mutations were identified in a gene, SH3TC2, known to cause CMT. Researchers then compared the affected patient's genome to the genomes of the patient's mother, father, and seven siblings with and without the disease. The mother and father each had one normal and one mutant copy of this gene, and had mild or no symptoms. The offspring that inherited two mutant genes presented fully with the disease.\\r\\nThe constant cycle of demyelination and remyelination, which occurs in CMT, can lead to the formation of layers of myelin around some nerves, termed an \\"onion bulb\\". These are also seen in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).[16] Muscles show fiber type grouping, a similarly non-specific finding that indicates a cycle of denervation/reinnervation. Normally, type I and type II muscle fibers show a checkerboard-like random distribution. However, when reinnervation occurs, the group of fibers associated with one nerve are of the same type. The standard for indicating fiber type is histoenzymatic adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase at pH 9.4).[17]\\r\\nCMT is a result of genetic mutations in a number of genes.[18] Based on the affected gene, CMT can be categorized into types and subtypes.[15]\\r\\nOften the most important goal for patients with CMT is to maintain movement, muscle strength, and flexibility. Therefore, an interprofessional team approach with occupational therapy, physical therapy, orthotist, podiatrist and or orthopedic surgeon is recommended.[19] PT typically focuses on muscle strength training, muscle, and ligament stretching while OT can provide education on energy conservation strategies and moderate aerobic exercise in activities of daily living. Physical therapy should be involved in designing an exercise program that fits a person's personal strengths and flexibility. Bracing can also be used to correct problems caused by CMT. An orthotist may address gait abnormalities by prescribing the use of ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs). These orthoses help control foot drop and ankle instability and often provide a better sense of balance for patients. Appropriate footwear is also very important for people with CMT, but they often have difficulty finding well-fitting shoes because of their high arched feet and hammer toes. Due to the lack of good sensory reception in the feet, CMT patients may also need to see a podiatrist for help in trimming nails or removing calluses that develop on the pads of the feet. A final decision a patient can make is to have surgery. Using a podiatrist or an orthopedic surgeon, patients can choose to stabilize their feet or correct progressive problems. These procedures include straightening and pinning the toes, lowering the arch, and sometimes, fusing the ankle joint to provide stability.[7] CMT patients must take extra care to avoid falling because fractures take longer to heal in someone with an underlying disease process. Additionally, the resulting inactivity may cause the CMT to worsen.[7]\\r\\nThe Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association classifies the chemotherapy drug vincristine as a \\"definite high risk\\" and states that \\"vincristine has been proven hazardous and should be avoided by all CMT patients, including those with no symptoms.\\"[20]\\r\\nThere are also several corrective surgical procedures that can be done to improve physical condition.[21]\\r\\nThe severity of symptoms vary widely even for the same type of CMT. There have been cases of monozygotic twins with varying levels of disease severity, showing that identical genotypes are associated with different levels of severity (see penetrance). Some patients are able to live a normal life and are almost or entirely asymptomatic.[22] A 2007 review stated that \\"Life expectancy is not known to be altered in the majority of cases\\".[23]\\r\\nThe disease is named after those who classically described it: Jean-Martin Charcot (1825ÿ1893), his pupil Pierre Marie (1853ÿ1940) (\\"Sur une forme particulire d'atrophie musculaire progressive, souvent familiale dbutant par les pieds et les jambes et atteignant plus tard les mains\\".

In recent decades the state has led the country in efforts to legalize cannabis, holding the first (unsuccessful) vote to decriminalize it in 1972 and, through Proposition 215, becoming the first state to legalize it for medical use in 1996. In the November 2016 election, voters passed an amendment legalizing recreational use of marijuana.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustrial hemp was first grown in what is now known as California as early as 1801 in what is now San Jose, with the state producing 13,000 pounds in 1807, and 220,000 pounds in 1810.[2]\\r\\nThe Poison Act was passed in 1907, and in 1913 an amendment (Stats. 1913, Ch. 342, p.?697) was made to make possession of \\"extracts, tinctures, or other narcotic preparations of hemp, or loco-weed, their preparations and compounds\\" a misdemeanor.[3] There's no evidence that the law was ever used or intended to restrict pharmaceutical cannabis; instead it was a legislative mistake, and in 1915 another amendment (Stats. 1915, Ch. 604, pp.?1067ÿ1068) forbade the sale or possession of \\"flowering tops and leaves, extracts, tinctures and other narcotic preparations of hemp or loco weed (Cannabis sativa), Indian hemp\\" except with a prescription.[3] Both bills were drafted and supported by the California State Board of Pharmacy.[3]\\r\\nIn 1925, possession, which had previously been treated the same as distribution, became punishable by up to 6 years in prison, and black market sale, which had initially been a misdemeanor punishable by a $100ÿ$400 fine and/or 50ÿ180 days in jail for first offenders, became punishable by 6 monthsÿ6 years.[3] In 1927, the laws designed to target opium usage were finally extended to Indian hemp.[3] In 1929, second offenses for possession became punishable by sentences of 6 monthsÿ10 years.[3] In 1937, cannabis cultivation became a separate offense.[3] In 1954, penalties for marijuana possession were hiked to a minimum 1ÿ10 years in prison, and sale was made punishable by 5ÿ15 years with a mandatory 3 years before eligibility for parole; two prior felonies raised the maximum sentences for both offenses to life imprisonment.[3]\\r\\nProposition 19, a ballot proposition previously attempting to decriminalize marijuana, was defeated in the November 1972 state election by a 66.5% majority.[4] In 1973, California's neighboring state of Oregon became the first state to decriminalize cannabis.[5]\\r\\nDecriminalization of marijuana, which treats the possession of small amounts of the drug as a civil, rather than a criminal, offense, was established in July 1975 when the Legislature passed Senate Bill 95, the Moscone Act.[3][5][6][7] SB 95 made possession of one ounce (28.5?grams) of marijuana a misdemeanor punishable by a $100 fine[8] (with the assessments added to fines in California, this will total about $480), with higher punishments for amounts greater than one ounce, for possession on school grounds, or for cultivation.[9]\\r\\nProposition 36 (also known as the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000) was approved by 61% of voters, requiring that \\"first and second offense drug violators be sent to drug treatment programs instead of facing trial and possible incarceration.\\"[10]\\r\\nOn September 30, 2010, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law CA State Senate Bill 1449, which further reduced the charge of possession of one ounce of cannabis or less, from a misdemeanor to an infraction, similar to a traffic violationa maximum of a $100 fine and no mandatory court appearance or criminal record.[11] The law became effective January 1, 2011.\\r\\nCalifornia's medical cannabis program was established when state voters approved Proposition 215 (also known as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996)[12] on the November 5, 1996 ballot with a 55% majority.[13] The proposition added Section 11362.5 to the California Health and Safety Code, modifying state law to allow people with cancer, anorexia, AIDS, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraines or other chronic illnesses the \\"legal right to obtain or grow, and use marijuana for medical purposes when recommended by a doctor\\". The law also mandated that doctors not be punished for recommending the drug, and required that federal and state governments work together \\"to implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need.\\"[12][13]\\r\\nVague wording became a major criticism of Prop. 215, though the law has since been clarified through California Supreme Court rulings and the passage of subsequent laws. The first solution of this came by legislation that established statewide guidelines for Proposition 215 by Senate Bill 420 in January 2003. To differentiate patients from non-patients, Governor Gray Davis signed California Senate Bill 420 (colloquially known as the Medical Marijuana Program Act) in 2003, establishing an identification card system for medical marijuana patients. SB 420 also allows for the formation of patient collectives, or non-profit organizations, to provide the drug to patients. In January, 2010, the California Supreme Court ruled in People v. Kelly, that SB 420 did not limit the quantity a patient can possess and all possession limits on medical marijuana in California were lifted.\\r\\nOn October 7, 2011, an extensive and coordinated crackdown on California's marijuana dispensaries was announced by the chief prosecutors of the state's four federal districts.,[14] which caused much widespread panic within the social community thereof. These subsided in the time following.\\r\\nIn February 2009, Tom Ammiano introduced the Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education Act, which would remove penalties under state law for the cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for persons the age of 21 or older. When the Assembly Public Safety Committee approved the bill on a 4 to 3 vote in January 2010, this marked the first time in United States history that a bill legalizing marijuana passed a legislative committee. While the legislation failed to reach the Assembly floor, Ammiano stated his plans to reintroduce the bill later in the year, depending on the success of Proposition 19, the Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act.[15] According to Time, California tax collectors estimated the bill would have raised about $1.3 billion a year in revenue.\\r\\nIn November 2010, California voters rejected Proposition 19, by a vote of 53.5% to 46.5%, an initiative that would have made possession and cultivation of cannabis for recreational usage legal for adults the age of 21 or older, and would regulate it similarly to alcohol.[16]\\r\\nCritics such as John Lovell, lobbyist for the California Peace Officers' Association, argued that too many people already struggle with alcohol and drug abuse, and legalizing another mind-altering substance would lead to a surge of use, making problems worse.[17] Apart from helping the state's budget by enforcing a tax on the sale of cannabis, proponents of the bill argued that legalization would reduce the amount of criminal activity associated with the drug.\\r\\nOn November 8, 2016, Proposition 64, also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, passed by a vote of 57% to 43%, legalizing the sale and distribution of cannabis in both a dry and concentrated form. California is one of eight states where recreational cannabis usage is legal, including Alaska, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington, and Nevada. Adults are allowed to possess up to one ounce of cannabis for recreational use and can grow up to six live plants individually or more commercially with a license. Licenses will be issued for cultivation and business establishment beginning in 2018.\\r\\nCalifornia was the first state to establish a medical marijuana program, enacted by Proposition 215 in 1996 and Senate Bill 420 in 2003. Prop. 215, also known as the Compassionate Use Act allows people the right to obtain and use cannabis for any illness if they obtain a recommendation from a doctor. California's Supreme Court has ruled there are no specified limits as to what a patient may possess in their private residence if the cannabis is strictly for the patient's own use.[18] Medical cannabis identification cards are issued through the California Department of Public Health's Medical Marijuana Program (MMP). The program began in three counties in May 2005, and expanded statewide in August of the same year. 37,236 cards have been issued throughout 55 counties as of December 2009. However, cannabis dispensaries within the state accept recommendations, with an embossed license, from a doctor who has given the patient an examination and believes cannabis would be beneficial for their ailment.\\r\\nCritics of California's medical cannabis program argued that the program essentially gave cannabis quasi-legality, as \\"anyone can obtain a recommendation for medical marijuana at any time for practically any ailment\\".[16] Acknowledging that there were instances in which the system was abused and that laws could be improved, Stephen Gutwillig of the Drug Policy Alliance[19] insisted that the passages of Proposition 215 were \\"nothing short of incredible\\". Gutwillig argued that because of the law, 200,000 patients in the state had safe and affordable access to medical cannabis to relieve pain and treat medical conditions, without having to risk arrest or buy off the black market.[16] Twelve other U.S. states have followed California's lead to enact medical marijuana laws of their own: Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.[20]\\r\\nRecreational usage of marijuana is legal under Proposition 64.

They are among the first people from a space habitat, \\"The Ark\\", to return to Earth after a devastating nuclear apocalypse.

Over 2,400 survivors live on a single massive station in Earth's orbit called \\"The Ark\\". After the Ark's life-support systems are found to be failing, 100 juvenile prisoners are sent to the surface in a last attempt to determine whether Earth is habitable. They discover not all humanity was destroyed and some survived the apocalypse: the Grounders, who live in clans locked in a power struggle; the Reapers, another group of Grounders who have become cannibals; and Mountain Men, who live in Mount Weather and locked themselves away before the apocalypse.\\r\\nIn the second season, the remaining 48 of the 100 are captured and taken to Mount Weather by the Mountain Men. It is eventually revealed that the Mountain Men are transfusing blood from imprisoned Grounders as an anti-radiation treatment. Medical tests of the 100 show an even more potent anti-radiation efficacy; their bone marrow will allow the mountain men to survive outside containment. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the Ark have successfully crash-landed various stations on Earth and begun an alliance with the Grounders to save groups of people, naming the main settlement at Alpha Station \\"Camp Jaha\\".\\r\\nIn the third season, Camp Jaha, now renamed \\"Arkadia\\", comes under new management when Pike, a former teacher and mentor, is elected as chancellor and begins a war with the Grounders. An artificial intelligence named A.L.I.E. was commanded to make life better for mankind and responded by solving the problem of human overpopulation by launching a nuclear apocalypse that devastated Earth. The AI takes over the minds of nearly everyone in Arkadia and Polis, the capital city of the Grounders. In the season three finale, Clarke manages to destroy A.L.I.E.\\r\\nIn the fourth season, hundreds of nuclear reactors around the world are melting down due to decades of neglect that will result in 96% of the planet becoming uninhabitable. Clarke and the others investigate ways to survive the coming wave of radiation.

Scholars generally agree that it included the coastal areas of today's Lebanon, northern Israel and southern Syria reaching as far north as Arwad, but there is some dispute as to how far south it went, the furthest suggested area being Ashkelon.[4] Its colonies later reached the Western Mediterranean, such as Cdiz in Spain and most notably Carthage in North Africa, and even the Atlantic Ocean. The civilization spread across the Mediterranean between 1500 BC and 300 BC.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhoenicia is an ancient Greek term used to refer to the major export of the region, cloth dyed Tyrian purple from the Murex mollusc, and referred to the major Canaanite port towns; not corresponding precisely to Phoenician culture as a whole as it would have been understood natively. Their civilization was organized in city-states, similar to those of ancient Greece,[5] perhaps the most notable of which were Tyre, Sidon, Arwad, Berytus, Byblos and Carthage.[6] Each city-state was a politically independent unit, and it is uncertain to what extent the Phoenicians viewed themselves as a single nationality. In terms of archaeology, language, lifestyle, and religion there was little to set the Phoenicians apart as markedly different from other residents of the Levant, such as their close relatives and neighbors, the Israelites.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAround 1050 BC, a Phoenician alphabet was used for the writing of Phoenician.[8] It became one of the most widely used writing systems, spread by Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean world, where it evolved and was assimilated by many other cultures, including the Roman alphabet used by Western Civilization today.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Phoenicians, like Latin Poenؐ (adj. poenicus, later pnicus), comes from Greek ?ٚ? (Phonikes). The word ? pho?nix meant variably \\"Phoenician person\\", \\"Tyrian purple, crimson\\" or \\"date palm\\" and is attested with all three meanings already in Homer.[10] (The mythical bird phoenix also carries the same name, but this meaning is not attested until centuries later.) The word may be derived from ?? phoin܇s \\"blood-red\\",[11] itself possibly related to ?? ph܇nos \\"murder\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is difficult to ascertain which meaning came first, but it is understandable how Greeks may have associated the crimson or purple color of dates and dye with the merchants who traded both products. Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a pre-Greek origin of the ethnonym.[12] The oldest attested form of the word in Greek may be the Mycenaean po-ni-ki-jo, po-ni-ki, possibly borrowed from Ancient Egyptian: fn?w [13] (literally \\"carpenters\\", \\"woodcutters\\"; likely in reference to the famed Lebanon cedars for which the Phoenicians were well-known), although this derivation is disputed.[14] The folk etymological association of ?ٻ with ? mirrors that in Akkadian, which tied kina?ni, kina??i \\"Canaan\\" to kina??u \\"red-dyed wool\\".[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land was natively known as kn?n (compare Eblaite ka-na-na-um, phn|ka-na-na) and its people as the kn?ny. In the Amarna letters of the 14th century BC, people from the region called themselves Kenaani or Kinaani, in modern English understood as/equivalent to Canaanite. Much later, in the sixth century BC, Hecataeus of Miletus writes that Phoenicia was formerly called ϫ khna, a name that Philo of Byblos later adopted into his mythology as his eponym for the Phoenicians: \\"Khna who was afterwards called Phoinix\\".[17] The ethnonym survived in North Africa until the fourth century AD (see Punic language).\\r\\n\\r\\nHerodotus's account (written c. 440 BC) refers to the myths of Io and Europa.\\r\\nAccording to the Persians best informed in history, the Phoenicians began the quarrel. These people, who had formerly dwelt on the shores of the Erythraean Sea, having migrated to the Mediterranean and settled in the parts which they now inhabit, began at once, they say, to adventure on long voyages,  freighting their vessels with the wares of Egypt and Assyria?...\\r\\nThe Greek historian Strabo believed that the Phoenicians originated from Bahrain.[18] Herodotus also believed that the homeland of the Phoenicians was Bahrain.[19][20] This theory was accepted by the 19th-century German classicist Arnold Heeren who said that: \\"In the Greek geographers, for instance, we read of two islands, named Tyrus or Tylos, and Aradus, which boasted that they were the mother country of the Phoenicians, and exhibited relics of Phoenician temples.\\"[21] The people of Tyre in South Lebanon in particular have long maintained Persian Gulf origins, and the similarity in the words \\"Tylos\\" and \\"Tyre\\" has been commented upon.[22] The Dilmun civilization thrived in Bahrain during the period 2200ÿ1600 BC, as shown by excavations of settlements and Dilmun burial mounds. However, some claim there is little evidence of occupation at all in Bahrain during the time when such migration had supposedly taken place.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanaanite culture apparently developed in situ from the earlier Ghassulian chalcolithic culture. Ghassulian itself developed from the Circum-Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex, which in turn developed from a fusion of their ancestral Natufian and Harifian cultures with Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) farming cultures, practicing the domestication of animals, during the 6200?BC climatic crisis which led to the Neolithic Revolution in the Levant.[24] Byblos is attested as an archaeological site from the Early Bronze Age. The Late Bronze Age state of Ugarit is considered quintessentially Canaanite archaeologically,[25] even though the Ugaritic language does not belong to the Canaanite languages proper.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenician alphabet consists of 22 letters, all consonants.[9] Starting around 1050 BC,[27] this script was used for the writing of Phoenician, a Northern Semitic language. It is believed to be one of the ancestors of modern alphabets.[28][29] By their maritime trade, the Phoenicians spread the use of the alphabet to Anatolia, North Africa, and Europe, where it was adopted by the Greeks who developed it into an alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants.[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"Phoenician\\" is by convention given to inscriptions beginning around 1050 BC, because Phoenician, Hebrew, and other Canaanite dialects were largely indistinguishable before that time.[27][8] The so-called Ahiram epitaph, engraved on the sarcophagus of king Ahiram from about 1000 BC shows essentially a fully developed Phoenician script.[32][33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenicians were among the first state-level societies to make extensive use of alphabets: the family of Canaanite languages, spoken by Israelites, Phoenicians, Amorites, Ammonites, Moabites and Edomites, was the first historically attested group of languages to use an alphabet, derived from the Proto-Canaanite script, to record their writings. The Proto-Canaanite script uses around 30 symbols but was not widely used until the rise of new Semitic kingdoms in the 13th and 12th centuries BC.[35] The Proto-Canaanite script is derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nFernand Braudel remarked in The Perspective of the World that Phoenicia was an early example of a \\"world-economy\\" surrounded by empires. The high point of Phoenician culture and sea power is usually placed c. 1200ÿ800?BC. Archaeological evidence consistent with this understanding has been difficult to identify. A unique concentration in Phoenicia of silver hoards dated between 1200 and 800 BC, however, contains hacksilver with lead isotope ratios matching ores in Sardinia and Spain.[37] This metallic evidence agrees with the biblical attestation of a western Mediterranean Tarshish said to have supplied King Solomon of Israel with silver via Phoenicia, during the latter's heyday (see 'trade', below).[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the most important Phoenician settlements had been established long before this: Byblos, Tyre in South Lebanon, Sidon, Simyra, Arwad, and Berytus, the capital of Lebanon, all appear in the Amarna tablets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe league of independent city-state ports, with others on the islands and along other coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, was ideally suited for trade between the Levant area, rich in natural resources, and the rest of the ancient world. Around 1200?BC, a series of poorly-understood events weakened and destroyed the adjacent Egyptian and Hittite empires. In the resulting power vacuum, a number of Phoenician cities rose as significant maritime powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhoenician societies rested on three power-bases: the king; temples and their priests; and councils of elders. Byblos first became the predominant center from where the Phoenicians dominated the Mediterranean and Erythraean (Red) Sea routes. It was here that the first inscription in the Phoenician alphabet was found, on the sarcophagus of Ahiram (c. 1200?BC).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, Tyre in South Lebanon gained in power. One of its kings, the priest Ithobaal (887ÿ856?BC), ruled Phoenicia as far north as Beirut, and part of Cyprus. Carthage was founded in 814?BC under Pygmalion of Tyre (820ÿ774?BC).[citation needed] The collection of city-states constituting Phoenicia came to be characterized by outsiders and the Phoenicians as Sidonia or Tyria. Phoenicians and Canaanites alike were called Sidonians or Tyrians, as one Phoenician city came to prominence after another.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersian King Cyrus the Great conquered Phoenicia in 539?BC. The Persians then divided Phoenicia into four vassal kingdoms: Sidon, Tyre, Arwad, and Byblos. They prospered, furnishing fleets for Persian kings. Phoenician influence declined after this. In 350 or 345?BC, a rebellion in Sidon led by Tennes was crushed by Artaxerxes III. Its destruction was described by Diodorus Siculus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexander the Great took Tyre in 332?BC after the Siege of Tyre. Alexander was exceptionally harsh to Tyre, executing 2,000 of the leading citizens, but he maintained the king in power. He gained control of the other cities peacefully: the ruler of Aradus submitted; the king of Sidon was overthrown. The rise of Macedon gradually ousted the remnants of Phoenicia's former dominance over the Eastern Mediterranean trade routes. Phoenician culture disappeared entirely in the motherland. Carthage continued to flourish in Northwest Africa. It oversaw the mining of iron and precious metals from Iberia, and used its considerable naval power and mercenary armies to protect commercial interests. Rome finally destroyed it in 146?BC, at the end of the Punic Wars.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Alexander, the Phoenician homeland was controlled by a succession of Macedonian rulers: Laomedon (323?BC), Ptolemy I (320), Antigonus II (315), Demetrius (301), and Seleucus (296). Between 286 and 197?BC, Phoenicia (except for Aradus) fell to the Ptolemies of Egypt, who installed the high priests of Astarte as vassal rulers in Sidon (Eshmunazar I, Tabnit, Eshmunazar II).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 197?BC, Phoenicia along with Syria reverted to the Seleucids. The region became increasingly Hellenized, although Tyre became autonomous in 126?BC, followed by Sidon in 111. Syria, including Phoenicia, was seized and ruled by king Tigranes the Great of Armenia from 82 until 69?BC, when he was defeated by Lucullus. In 65?BC, Pompey finally incorporated the territory as part of the Roman province of Syria. Phoenicia became a separate province c. 200 AD.\\r\\n\\r\\nA study by Pierre Zalloua and others (2008) claimed that six subclades of haplogroup J2 (J-M172) J2 in particular, were \\"a Phoenician signature\\" amongst modern male populations tested in \\"the coastal Lebanese Phoenician Heartland and the broader area of the rest of the Levant (the \\"Phoenician Periphery\\")\\", followed by \\"Cyprus and South Turkey; then Crete; then Malta and East Sicily; then South Sardinia, Ibiza, and Southern Spain; and, finally, Coastal Tunisia and cities like Tingris [sic] in Morocco\\". (Samples from other areas with significant Phoenician settlements, in Libya and southern France could not be included.) This deliberately sequential sampling represented an attempt to develop a methodology that could link the documented historical expansion of a population, with a particular geographic genetic pattern or patterns. The researchers suggested that the proposed genetic signature stemmed from \\"a common source of related lineages rooted in Lebanon\\".[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of the geographical communities tested, Zalloua pointed out subsequently (2013), carried significantly higher levels of the proposed \\"Phoenician signature\\" than the others. This suggested that genetic variation preceded religious variation and divisions and, by the time it became Phoenicia, \\"Lebanon already had well-differentiated communities with their own genetic peculiarities, but not significant differences, and religions came as layers of paint on top.\\" [41] Another study found evidence for genetic persistence on the island of Ibiza.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nLevantine Semites  Lebanese, Jews, Palestinians, and Syrians  are thought to be the closest surviving relatives of the ancient Phoenicians, with as much as 90% genetic similarity between modern Lebanese and Bronze Age Sidonians.[43][44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, a sixth-century BC skeleton of a young Carthaginian man, excavated from a Punic tomb in Byrsa Hill, was found to belong to the rare U5b2c1 maternal haplogroup. The lineage of this \\"Young Man of Byrsa\\" is believed to represent early gene flow from Iberia to the Maghreb.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenicians were among the greatest traders of their time and owed much of their prosperity to trade. At first, they traded mainly with the Greeks, trading wood, slaves, glass and powdered Tyrian purple. Tyrian purple was a violet-purple dye used by the Greek elite to color garments. In fact, the word Phoenician derives from the ancient Greek word phonios meaning \\"purple\\". As trading and colonizing spread over the Mediterranean, Phoenicians and Greeks seemed to have split that sea in two: the Phoenicians sailed along and eventually dominated the southern shore, while the Greeks were active along the northern shores. The two cultures rarely clashed, mainly in the Sicilian Wars, and eventually settled into two spheres of influence, the Phoenician in the west and the Greek to the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the centuries after 1200?BC, the Phoenicians were the major naval and trading power of the region. Phoenician trade was founded on the Tyrian purple dye, a violet-purple dye derived from the hypobranchial gland of the Murex sea-snail, once profusely available in coastal waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea but exploited to local extinction. James B. Pritchard's excavations at Sarepta in present-day Lebanon revealed crushed Murex shells and pottery containers stained with the dye that was being produced at the site. The Phoenicians established a second production center for the dye in Mogador, in present-day Morocco. Brilliant textiles were a part of Phoenician wealth, and Phoenician glass was another export ware.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Egypt, where grapevines would not grow, the 8th-century Phoenicians sold wine: the wine trade with Egypt is vividly documented by the shipwrecks located in 1997 in the open sea 50 kilometres (30?mi) west of Ascalon.[47] Pottery kilns at Tyre in South Lebanon and Sarepta produced the large terracotta jars used for transporting wine. From Egypt, the Phoenicians bought Nubian gold. Additionally, great cedar logs were traded with lumber-poor Egypt for significant sums. Sometime between 1075 and 1060 BC an Egyptian envoy by the name of Wen-Amon visited Phoenicia and secured seven great cedar logs in exchange for a mixed cargo including \\"4 crocks and 1 kak-men of gold; 5 silver jugs; 10 garments of royal linen; 10 kherd of good linen from Upper Egypt; 500 rolls of finished papyrus; 500 cows' hides; 500 ropes; 20 bags of lentils and 30 baskets of fish.\\" Those logs were then moved by ship from Phoenicia to Egypt.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom elsewhere, they obtained other materials, perhaps the most important being silver from (at least) Sardinia and the Iberian Peninsula. Tin was required which, when smelted with copper from Cyprus, created the durable metal alloy bronze. The archaeologist Glenn Markoe suggests that tin \\"may have been acquired from Galicia by way of the Atlantic coast or southern Spain; alternatively, it may have come from northern Europe (Cornwall or Brittany) via the Rhone valley and coastal Massalia\\".[49] Strabo states that there was a highly lucrative Phoenician trade with Britain for tin via the Cassiterides whose location is unknown but may have been off the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula.[50] Professor Timothy Champion, discussing Diodorus Siculus's comments on the tin trade, states that \\"Diodorus never actually says that the Phoenicians sailed to Cornwall. In fact, he says quite the opposite: the production of Cornish tin was in the hands of the natives of Cornwall, and its transport to the Mediterranean was organised by local merchants, by sea and then over land through France, well outside Phoenician control.\\"[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nTarshish (Hebrew: ????????????) occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, and one of the most recurring is that Tarshish is a place, probably a city or country, that is far from the Land of Israel by sea where trade occurs with Israel and Phoenicia. It was a place where Phoenicians reportedly obtained different metals, particularly silver, during the reign of Solomon. The Septuagint, the Vulgate and the Targum of Jonathan render Tarshish as Carthage, but other biblical commentators read it as Tartessos perhaps in ancient Hispania (Iberian Peninsula). William F. Albright (1941) and Frank M. Cross (1972)[52][53] suggested Tarshish might be or was Sardinia because of the discovery of the Nora Stone and Nora Fragment, the former of which mentions Tarshish in its Phoenician inscription. Christine M. Thompson (2003)[54] identified a concentration of hacksilver hoards dating between c.?1200 and 586 BC in Cisjordan Corpus. This silver-dominant Cisjordan Corpus is unparalleled in the contemporary Mediterranean, and within it occurs a unique concentration in Phoenicia of silver hoards dated between 1200 and 800 BC. Hacksilber objects in these Phoenician hoards have lead isotope ratios that match ores in Sardinia and Spain.[38] This metallic evidence agrees with the biblical memory of a western Mediterranean Tarshish that supplied Solomon with silver via Phoenicia. Assyrian records indicate Tarshish was an island, and the poetic construction of Psalm 72 points to its identity as a large island in the west  the island of Sardinia.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenicians established commercial outposts throughout the Mediterranean, the most strategically important being Carthage in Northwest Africa, southeast of Sardinia on the peninsula of present day Tunisia. Ancient Gaelic mythologies attribute a Phoenician/Scythian influx to Ireland by a leader called Fenius Farsa. Others also sailed south along the coast of Africa. A Carthaginian expedition led by Hanno the Navigator explored and colonized the Atlantic coast of Africa as far as the Gulf of Guinea; and according to Herodotus, a Phoenician expedition sent down the Red Sea by pharaoh Necho II of Egypt (c.?600?BC) even circumnavigated Africa and returned through the Pillars of Hercules after three years. Using gold obtained by expansion of the African coastal trade following the Hanno expedition, Carthage minted gold staters in 350?BC bearing a pattern, in the reverse exergue of the coins, which Mark McMenamin has controversially argued could be interpreted as a map. According to McMenamin, the Mediterranean is represented as a rectangle in the centre, a triangle to the right represents India in the east, and an irregular shape on the left represents America to the west.[55][56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2nd millennium BC, the Phoenicians traded with the Somalis. Through the Somali city-states of Mosylon, Opone, Malao, Sarapion, Mundus and Tabae, trade flourished.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greeks had two names for Phoenician ships: hippoi and galloi. Galloi means tubs and hippoi means horses. These names are readily explained by depictions of Phoenician ships in the palaces of Assyrian kings from the 7th and 8th centuries, as the ships in these images are tub shaped (galloi) and have horse heads on the ends of them (hippoi). It is possible that these hippoi come from Phoenician connections with the Greek god Poseidon equated with the Semitic God \\"Yam\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, a Phoenician trading ship, dating to 700 BC, was found near Gozo island. The vessel was about 50 feet long, which contained 50 amphorae full of wine and oil.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tel Balawat gates (850?BC) are found in the palace of Shalmaneser III, an Assyrian king, near Nimrud. They are made of bronze, and they portray ships coming to honor Shalmaneser.[58][59]\\r\\nThe Khorsabad bas-relief (7th century BC) shows the transportation of timber (most likely cedar) from Lebanon. It is found in the palace built specifically for Sargon II, another Assyrian king, at Khorsabad, now northern Iraq.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 10th century BC, the Phoenicians' expansive culture led them to establish cities and colonies throughout the Mediterranean. Canaanite deities like Baal and Astarte were being worshipped from Cyprus to Sardinia, Malta, Sicily, Spain, Portugal, and most notably at Carthage (Qart Hada?t) in modern Tunisia.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern Algeria\\r\\n\\r\\nCyprus\\r\\n\\r\\nModern Italy\\r\\n\\r\\nModern Libya\\r\\n\\r\\nThe islands of Malta\\r\\n\\r\\nModern Mauritania\\r\\n\\r\\nModern Portugal\\r\\n\\r\\nModern Spain\\r\\n\\r\\nModern Tunisia\\r\\n\\r\\nModern Turkey\\r\\n\\r\\nModern Morocco\\r\\n\\r\\nOther colonies\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenician alphabet was one of the first (consonantal) alphabets with a strict and consistent form. It is assumed that it adopted its simplified linear characters from an as-yet unattested early pictorial Semitic alphabet developed some centuries earlier in the southern Levant.[70][71] It is likely that the precursor to the Phoenician alphabet was of Egyptian origin, since Middle Bronze Age alphabets from the southern Levant resemble Egyptian hieroglyphs or an early alphabetic writing system found at Wadi-el-Hol in central Egypt.[72][73] In addition to being preceded by proto-Canaanite, the Phoenician alphabet was also preceded by an alphabetic script of Mesopotamian origin called Ugaritic. The development of the Phoenician alphabet from the Proto-Canaanite coincided with the rise of the Iron Age in the 11th century BC.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis alphabet has been termed an abjad  that is, a script that contains no vowels  from the first four letters aleph, beth, gimel, and daleth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest known representation of the Phoenician alphabet is inscribed on the sarcophagus of King Ahiram of Byblos, dating to the 11th century BC at the latest. Phoenician inscriptions are found in Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Cyprus and other locations, as late as the early centuries of the Christian Era. The Phoenicians are credited with spreading the Phoenician alphabet throughout the Mediterranean world.[75] Phoenician traders disseminated this writing system along Aegean trade routes, to Crete and Greece. The Greeks adopted the majority of these letters but changed some of them to vowels which were significant in their language, giving rise to the first true alphabet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenician language is classified in the Canaanite subgroup of Northwest Semitic. Its later descendant in Northwest Africa is termed Punic. In Phoenician colonies around the western Mediterranean, beginning in the 9th century BC, Phoenician evolved into Punic. Punic Phoenician was still spoken in the 5th century AD: St. Augustine, for example, grew up in Northwest Africa and was familiar with the language.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhoenician art lacks unique characteristics that might distinguish it from its contemporaries. This is due to its being highly influenced by foreign artistic cultures: primarily Egypt, Greece and Assyria. Phoenicians who were taught on the banks of the Nile and the Euphrates gained a wide artistic experience and finally came to create their own art, which was an amalgam of foreign models and perspectives.[76] In an article from The New York Times published on January 5, 1879, Phoenician art was described by the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nHe entered into other men's labors and made most of his heritage. The Sphinx of Egypt became Asiatic, and its new form was transplanted to Nineveh on the one side and to Greece on the other. The rosettes and other patterns of the Babylonian cylinders were introduced into the handiwork of Phoenicia, and so passed on to the West, while the hero of the ancient Chaldean epic became first the Tyrian Melkarth, and then the Herakles of Hellas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe religious practices and beliefs of Phoenicia were cognate generally to their neighbours in Canaan, which in turn shared characteristics common throughout the ancient Semitic world.[77][78][79] \\"Canaanite religion was more of a public institution than of an individual experience.\\" Its rites were primarily for city-state purposes; payment of taxes by citizens was considered in the category of religious sacrifices.[80] Unfortunately, many of the Phoenician sacred writings known to the ancients have been lost.[81][82]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhoenicians were known for being very religious. While there remain favourable aspects regarding Canaanite religion,[83][84][85] several of its reported practices have been widely criticized, in particular, temple prostitution,[86] and child sacrifice.[87] \\"Tophets\\" built \\"to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire\\" are condemned by God in Jeremiah 7:30-32, and in 2nd Kings 23:10 (also 17:17). Notwithstanding these and other important differences, cultural religious similarities between the ancient Hebrews and the Phoenicians persisted.[83][88]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanaanite religious mythology does not appear as elaborated compared with existent literature of their cousin Semites in Mesopotamia. In Canaan the supreme god was called El (????, \\"god\\").[89][90] The son of El was Baal (??????, \\"master\\", \\"lord\\"), a powerful dying-and-rising storm god.[91] Other gods were called by royal titles, as in Melqart meaning \\"king of the city\\",[92] or Adonis for \\"lord\\".[93] (Such epithets may often have been merely local titles for the same deities.) On the other hand, the Phoenicians, notorious for being secretive in business, might use these non-descript words as cover for the secluded name of the god,[94] known only to a select few initiated into the inmost circle, or not even used by them, much as their neighbors and close relatives the ancient Israelites/Judeans sometimes used the honorific Adonai (Heb: \\"My Lord\\") in place of the tetragrammatona practice which became standard (if not mandatory) in the Second Temple period onward.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Semitic pantheon was well-populated; which god became primary evidently depended on the exigencies of a particular city-state or tribal locale.[96][97] Due perhaps to the leading role of the city-state of Tyre, its reigning god Melqart was prominent throughout Phoenicia and overseas. Also of great general interest was Astarte (??????????)a form of the Babylonian Ishtara fertility goddess who also enjoyed regal and matronly aspects. The prominent deity Eshmun of Sidon was a healing god, seemingly cognate with deities such as Adonis (possibly a local variant of the same) and Attis. Associated with the fertility and harvest myth widespread in the region, in this regard Eshmun was linked with Astarte; other like pairings included Ishtar and Tammuz in Babylon, and Isis and Osiris in Egypt.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nReligious institutions of great antiquity in Tyre, called marzeh (????????, \\"place of reunion\\"), did much to foster social bonding and \\"kin\\" loyalty.[99] These institutions held banquets for their membership on festival days. Various marzeh societies developed into elite fraternities, becoming very influential in the commercial trade and governance of Tyre. As now understood, each marzeh originated in the congeniality inspired and then nurtured by a series of ritual meals, shared together as trusted \\"kin\\", all held in honor of the deified ancestors.[100] Later, at the Punic city-state of Carthage, the \\"citizen body was divided into groups which met at times for common feasts.\\" Such festival groups may also have composed the voting cohort for selecting members of the city-state's Assembly.[101][102]\\r\\n\\r\\nReligion in Carthage was based on inherited Phoenician ways of devotion. In fact, until its fall embassies from Carthage would regularly make the journey to Tyre to worship Melqart, bringing material offerings.[103][104] Transplanted to distant Carthage, these Phoenician ways persisted, but naturally acquired distinctive traits: perhaps influenced by a spiritual and cultural evolution, or synthesizing Berber tribal practices, or transforming under the stress of political and economic forces encountered by the city-state. Over time the original Phoenician exemplar developed distinctly, becoming the Punic religion at Carthage.[105] \\"The Carthaginians were notorious in antiquity for the intensity of their religious beliefs.\\"[106] \\"Besides their reputation as merchants, the Carthaginians were known in the ancient world for their superstition and intense religiosity. They imagined themselves living in a world inhabited by supernatural powers which were mostly malevolent. For protection they carried amulets of various origins and had them buried with them when they died.\\"[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Carthage, as at Tyre, religion was integral to the city's life. A committee of ten elders selected by the civil authorities regulated worship and built the temples with public funds. Some priesthoods were hereditary to certain families. Punic inscriptions list a hierarchy of cohen (priest) and rab cohenim (lord priests). Each temple was under the supervision of its chief priest or priestess. To enter the Temple of Eshmun one had to abstain from sexual intercourse for three days, and from eating beans and pork.[108] Private citizens also nurtured their own destiny, as evidenced by the common use of theophoric personal names, e.g., Hasdrubal, \\"he who has Baal's help\\" and Hamilcar [Abdelmelqart], \\"pledged to the service of Melqart\\".[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city's legendary founder, Elissa or Dido, was the widow of Acharbas the high priest of Tyre in service to its principal deity Melqart.[110] Dido was also attached to the fertility goddess Astarte. With her Dido brought not only ritual implements for the worship of Astarte, but also her priests and sacred prostitutes (taken from Cyprus).[111] The agricultural turned healing god Eshmun was worshipped at Carthage, as were other deities. Melqart became supplanted at the Punic city-state by the emergent god Baal Hammon, which perhaps means \\"lord of the altars of incense\\" (thought to be an epithet to cloak the god's real name).[105][112] Later, another newly arisen deity arose eventually to reign supreme at Carthage, a goddess of agriculture and generation who manifested a regal majesty, Tanit.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Baal Hammon (?????? ??????) has attracted scholarly interest, with most scholars viewing it as a probable derivation from the Northwest Semitic ?ammn (\\"brazier\\"), suggesting the meaning \\"Lord of the Brazier\\". This may be supported by incense burners and braziers found depicting the god. Frank Moore Cross argued for a connection to Hamn, the Ugaritic name for Mt. Amanus, an ancient name for the Nur Mountain range.[114] Modern scholars at first associated Baal Hammon with the Egyptian god Ammon of Thebes, both the Punic and the Egyptian being gods of the sun. Both also had the ram as a symbol. The Egyptian Ammon was known to have spread by trade routes to Libyans in the vicinity of modern Tunisia, well before arrival of the Phoenicians. Yet Baal Hammon's derivation from Ammon is no longer considered the most likely, as Baal Hammon has since been traced to Syrio-Phoenician origins, confirmed by recent finds at Tyre.[115] Baal Hammon is also presented as a god of agriculture: \\"Baal Hammon's power over the land and its fertility rendered him of great appeal to the inhabitants of Tunisia, a land of fertile wheat- and fruit-bearing plains.\\"[116][117]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"In Semitic religion El, the father of the gods, had gradually been shorn of his power by his sons and relegated to a remote part of his heavenly home; in Carthage, on the other hand, he became, once more, the head of the pantheon, under the enigmatic title of Ba'al Hammon.\\"\\r\\nPrayers of individual Carthaginians were often addressed to Baal Hammon. Offerings to Hammon also evidently included child sacrifice.[118][119][120] Diodorus (late 1st century BC) wrote that when Agathocles had attacked Carthage (in 310) several hundred children of leading families were sacrificed to regain the god's favour.[121] In modern times, the French novelist Gustave Flaubert's 1862 work Salammb? graphically featured this god as accepting such sacrifice.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goddess Tanit during the 5th and 4th centuries became queen goddess, supreme over the city-state of Carthage, thus outshining the former chief god and her associate, Baal-Hammon.[124][125] Tanit was represented by \\"palm trees weighed down with dates, ripe pomegranates ready to burst, lotus or lilies coming into flower, fish, doves, frogs... .\\" She gave to mankind a flow of vital energies.[126][127] Tanit may be Berbero-Libyan in origin, or at least assimilated to a local deity.[128][129]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother view, supported by recent finds, holds that Tanit originated in Phoenicia, being closely linked there to the goddess Astarte.[130][131] Tanit and Astarte: each one was both a funerary and a fertility goddess. Each was a sea goddess. As Tanit was associated with Ba'al Hammon the principal god in Punic Carthage, so Astarte was with El in Phoenicia. Yet Tanit was clearly distinguished from Astarte. Astarte's heavenly emblem was the planet Venus, Tanit's the crescent moon. Tanit was portrayed as chaste; at Carthage religious prostitution was apparently not practiced.[132][133] Yet temple prostitution played an important role in Astarte's cult at Phoenicia. Also, the Greeks and Romans did not compare Tanit to the Greek Aphrodite nor to the Roman Venus as they would Astarte. Rather the comparison of Tanit would be to Hera and to Juno, regal goddesses of marriage, or to the goddess Artemis of child-birth and the hunt.[134] Tertullian (c. 160 ÿ c.220), the Christian theologian and native of Carthage, wrote comparing Tanit to Ceres, the Roman mother goddess of agriculture.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nTanit has also been identified with three different Canaanite goddesses (all being sisters/wives of El): the above 'Astarte; the virgin war goddess 'Anat; and the mother goddess 'Elat or Asherah.[136][137][138] With her being a goddess, or symbolizing a psychic archetype, accordingly it is difficult to assign a single nature to Tanit, or clearly to represent her to consciousness.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nA problematic theory derived from sociology of religion proposes that as Carthage passed from being a Phoenician trading station into a wealthy and sovereign city-state, and from a monarchy anchored to Tyre into a native-born Libyphoenician oligarchy, Carthaginians began to turn away from deities associated with Phoenicia, and slowly to discover or synthesize a Punic deity, the goddess Tanit.[140] A parallel theory posits that when Carthage acquired as a source of wealth substantial agricultural lands in Africa, a local fertility goddess, Tanit, developed or evolved eventually to become supreme.[107] A basis for such theories may well be the religious reform movement that emerged and prevailed at Carthage during the years 397-360. The catalyst for such dramatic change in Punic religious practice was their recent defeat in war when led by their king Himilco (d. 396) against the Greeks of Sicily.[141]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch transformation of religion would have been instigated by a faction of wealthy land owners at Carthage, including these reforms: overthrow of the monarchy; elevation of Tanit as queen goddess and decline of Baal Hammon; allowance of foreign cults of Greek origin into the city (Demeter and Kore); decline in child sacrifice, with most votive victims changed to small animals, and with the sacrifice not directed for state purposes but, when infrequently done, performed to solicit the deity for private, family favors. This bold historical interpretation understands the reformer's motivation as \\"the reaction of a wealthy and cultured upper class against the primitive and antiquated aspects of the Canaanite religion, and also a political move intended to break the power of a monarchy which ruled by divine authority.\\" The reform's popularity was precarious at first. Later, when the city was in danger of imminent attack in 310, there would be a marked regression to child sacrifice. Yet eventually the cosmopolitan religious reform and the popular worship of Tanit together contributed to \\"breaking through the wall of isolation which had surrounded Carthage.\\"[142][143][144]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"When the Romans conquered Africa, Carthaginian religion was deeply entrenched even in Libyan areas, and it retained a great deal of its character under different forms.\\" Tanit became Juno Caelestis, \\"and Caelestis was supreme at Carthage itself until the triumph of Christianity, just as Tanit had been in pre-Roman times.\\" [128] Regarding Berber (Libyan) religious beliefs, it has also been said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"[Berber] belief in the powers of the spirits of the ancestors was not eclipsed by the introduction of new gods--Hammon, or Tanit--but existed in parallel with them. It is this same duality, or readiness to adopt new cultural forms while retaining the old on a more intimate level, which characterizes the [Roman era].\\"[145]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch Berber ambivalence, the ability to entertain multiple mysteries concurrently, apparently characterized their religion during the Punic era also. After the passing of Punic power, the great Berber king Masinissa (r. 202ÿ148), who long fought and challenged Carthage, was widely venerated by later generations of Berbers as divine.[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhoenician culture had a huge effect upon the cultures of the Mediterranean basin in the early Iron Age, and had been affected by them in turn. For example, in Phoenicia, the tripartite division between Baal, Mot and Yam seems to have influenced the Greek division between Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.[147] The Tartessos region probably embraced the whole southern part of the Iberian Peninsula.[148] Strab. 3.2.11). In various Mediterranean ports during the classical period, Phoenician temples sacred to Melkart were recognized as sacred to Greek Hercules. Stories like the Rape of Europa, and the coming of Cadmus also draw upon Phoenician influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recovery of the Mediterranean economy after the late Bronze Age collapse (c.?1200 BC) seems to have been largely due to the work of Phoenician traders and merchant princes, who re-established long distance trade between Egypt and Mesopotamia in the 10th century BC.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many countries and cities around the Mediterranean region that derive their names from the Phoenician Language. Below is a list with the respective meanings:\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the end of the Bronze Age (around 1200?BC) there was trade between the Canaanites (early Phoenicians), Egypt, Cyprus, and Greece. In a shipwreck found off of the coast of Turkey (the Ulu Bulurun wreck), Canaanite storage pottery along with pottery from Cyprus and Greece was found. The Phoenicians were famous metalworkers, and by the end of the 8th century BC, Greek city-states were sending out envoys to the Levant (the eastern Mediterranean) for metal goods.[149]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe height of Phoenician trade was circa the 7th and 8th centuries BC. There is a dispersal of imports (ceramic, stone, and faience) from the Levant that traces a Phoenician commercial channel to the Greek mainland via the central Aegean.[149] Athens shows little evidence of this trade with few eastern imports, but other Greek coastal cities are rich with eastern imports that evidence this trade.[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nAl Mina is a specific example of the trade that took place between the Greeks and the Phoenicians.[151] It has been theorized that by the 8th century BC, Euboean traders established a commercial enterprise with the Levantine coast and were using Al Mina (in Syria) as a base for this enterprise. There is still some question about the veracity of these claims concerning Al Mina.[150] The Phoenicians even got their name from the Greeks due to their trade. Their most famous trading product was purple dye, the Greek word for which is phoenos.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenician phonetic alphabet was adopted and modified by the Greeks probably in the 8th century BC (around the time of the hippoi depictions). This most likely did not come from a single instance but from a culmination of commercial exchange.[152] This means that before the 8th century, there was a relationship between the Greeks and the Phoenicians. Though there is no evidence to support the suggestion, it is probable that during this period there was also a passing of religious ideas.[citation needed] The legendary Phoenician hero Cadmus is credited with bringing the alphabet to Greece, but it is more plausible that it was brought by Phoenician emigrants to Crete,[153] whence it gradually diffused northwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both Phoenician and Greek mythologies, Cadmus is a Phoenician prince, the son of Agenor, the king of Tyre in South Lebanon. Herodotus credits Cadmus for bringing the Phoenician alphabet to Greece[154] approximately sixteen hundred years before Herodotus' time, or around 2000 BC,[155] as he attested:\\r\\n\\r\\nThese Phoenicians who came with Cadmus and of whom the Gephyraeans were a part brought with them to Hellas, among many other kinds of learning, the alphabet, which had been unknown before this, I think, to the Greeks. As time went on the sound and the form of the letters were changed.\\r\\nDue to the number of deities similar to the \\"Lord of the Sea\\" in classical mythology, there have been many difficulties attributing one specific name to the sea deity or the \\"PoseidonÿNeptune\\" figure of Phoenician religion. This figure of \\"Poseidon-Neptune\\" is mentioned by authors and in various inscriptions as being very important to merchants and sailors,[156] but a singular name has yet to be found. There are, however, names for sea gods from individual city-states. Yamm is the god of the sea of Ugarit, an ancient city-state north to Phoenicia. Yamm and Baal, the storm god of Ugaritic myth and often associated with Zeus, have an epic battle for power over the universe. While Yamm is the god of the sea, he truly represents vast chaos.[157] Baal, on the other hand, is a representative for order. In Ugaritic myth, Baal overcomes Yamm's power. In some versions of this myth, Baal kills Yamm with a mace fashioned for him, and in others, the goddess Athtart saves Yamm and says that since defeated, he should stay in his own province. Yamm is the brother of the god of death, Mot.[158] Some scholars have identified Yamm with Poseidon, although he has also been identified with Pontus.[159]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his Republic, Greek philosopher Plato contends that the love of money is a tendency of the soul found amongst Phoenicians and Egyptians, which distinguishes them from the Greeks who tend towards the love of knowledge.[160] In his Laws, he asserts that this love of money has led the Phoenicians and Egyptians to develop skills in cunning and trickery (ϫ?ϫ) rather than wisdom (?ϫ).[161]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his Histories, Herodotus gives the Persian and Greek accounts of a series of kidnappings that led to the Trojan War. While docked at a trading port in Argos, the Phoenicians kidnapped a group of Greek women including King Idacus's daughter, Io. The Greeks then retaliated by kidnapping Europa, a Phoenician, and later Medea. The Greeks refused to compensate the Phoenicians for the additional abduction, a fact which Paris used a generation later to justify the abduction of Helen from Argos. The Greeks then retaliated by waging war against Troy. After Troy's fall the Persians considered the Greeks to be their enemy.[162]\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram (also spelled Huran), the king of Tyre, is associated with the building of Solomon's temple.\\r\\n\\r\\n1 Kings 5:1 says: \\"Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.\\" 2 Chronicles 2:14 says: \\"The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, silver, brass, iron, stone, timber, royal purple (from the Murex), blue, and in crimson, and fine linens; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him?...\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the architect of the Temple, Hiram Abiff of Masonic lore.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, reforming prophets railed against the practice of drawing royal wives from among foreigners: Elijah execrated Jezebel, the princess from Tyre in South Lebanon who became a consort of King Ahab and introduced the worship of her god Baal.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong after Phoenician culture flourished, or Phoenicia existed as a political entity, Hellenized natives of the region where Canaanites still lived were referred to as \\"Syro-Phoenicians\\", as in the Gospel of Mark 7:26: \\"The woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by birth\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word Bible itself derives from Greek biblion, which means \\"book\\" and either derives from, or is the (perhaps ultimately Egyptian) origin of Byblos, the Greek name of the Phoenician city Gebal.[163]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legacies of the Phoenicians include:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Thus the winged figure of Tanith, the Carthaginian goddess of heaven, standing beneath the vault of heaven and the zodiac, holds the sun and moon in her hands, and is [flanked] by pillars, the symbols of the Great Mother Goddess. But on the lower plane of the stele, we find the same goddess stylized with upraised arms, possibly as a tree assimilated to the Egyptian life symbol. Her head is the sun, an illusion to the tree birth of the sun, and she is accompanied by two doves, the typical bird of the Great Goddess.\\" The \\"Egyptian life symbol\\" refers to the ankh.\\r\\n\\"It seems probable, therefore, that Tanith was a pre-Phoenician goddess of fertility of the Hamites, ...that she was so popular that after the coming of the Phoenicians they too worshipped her to such a degree that she largely displaced their native goddess Astart.\\"Barton (1934), p.?305\\r\\n\\"In Ugaritic mythology, Anath is by far the most important female figure, the goddess of love and war, virginal yet wanton, amorous yet given to uncontrollable outbursts of rage and appalling acts of cruelty. She is the daughter of El, the god of heaven, and of his wife the Lady Asherah of the Sea. ... Her foremost lover was her brother Baal. ... She was easily provoked to violence and, once she began to fight, would go berserk, smiting and killing left and right.\\" (60-2), who adds that the Phoenician Philo of Byblos (64ÿ141) compared Anath to the Greek virgin war goddess Athena. Also, Patai at 63-6 identifies Anath with the biblical \\"Queen of Heaven\\". At 61 Patai, referring to Anath in her r?le as goddess of love, mentions the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, and remarks that both Astarte and Anath as \\"typical goddesses of love, both chaste and promiscuous... [were] perennially fruitful without ever losing their virginity.\\"\\r\\n\\"Asherah was the chief goddess of the Canaanite pantheon... at Ugarit... . ...Asherah figured prominently as the wife of El the chief god. Her full name was 'Lady Asherah of the Sea'--apparently her domain proper was the sea, just as that of her husband El was heaven. She was, however, also referred to simply as Elath or Goddess. She was the 'Progenitress of the Gods': all other gods... were her children... . Asherah was a motherly goddess... .\\" Patai (1990), pp.?36-7. In his chapter \\"The Goddess Asherah\\" (34-53), Patai discusses widespread Hebrew worship of Asherah until the 6th century B.C.E. Patai (52ÿ3) notes ancient inscriptions (one found near Hebron) evidencing an early Jewish association of Asherah with Yahweh, a view repugnant to later orthodox Judaism.\\r\\nIt is an \\"illusion that an archetype can be finally explained and disposed of. Even the best attempts at explanation are only more or less successful translations into another metaphorical language. ... The most we can do is dream the myth onwards and give it a modern dress. And whatever [our] explanation or interpretation does to it, we do to our souls as well, with corresponding results for our own well being. ... Hence the \\"explanation\\" should always be such that the functional significance of the archetype remains unimpaired, so that an adequate and meaningful connection between the conscious mind and the archetype is assured. ... It represents or personifies certain instinctive data of the dark, primitive psyche, the real but invisible roots of consciousness.\\" ... \\"The archetype... is a psychic organ present in all of us. ... There is no 'rational' substitute for the archetype any more than there is for the cerebellum or the kidneys.\\"","input":"Founded by the phoenicians around 800 b.c the city of?"},{"output":"primates","context":"?Otolemur\\r\\n?Euoticus\\r\\n?Galago\\r\\n?Sciurocheirus\\r\\n?Galagoides\\r\\nGalagos /??le?o?z/, also known as bushbabies, bush babies, or nagapies (meaning \\"little night monkeys\\" in Afrikaans), are small nocturnal[2] primates native to continental Africa, and make up the family Galagidae (also sometimes called Galagonidae). They are sometimes included as a subfamily within the Lorisidae or Loridae.\\r\\nAccording to some accounts, the name \\"bushbaby\\" comes from either the animal's cries or its appearance. The Afrikaans name nagapie is because they are almost exclusively seen at night, while the Ghanaian name aposor is given to them because of their firm grip on branches.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn both variety and abundance, the bushbabies are the most successful strepsirrhine primates in Africa, according to the African Wildlife Foundation.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGalagos have large eyes that give them good night vision in addition to other characteristics, like strong hind limbs, acute hearing, and long tails that help them balance. Their ears are bat-like and allow them to track insects in the dark. They catch insects on the ground or snatch them out of the air. They are fast, agile creatures. As they bound through the thick bushes, they fold their delicate ears back to protect them. They also fold them during rest.[3] They have nails on most of their digits, except for the second toe of the hind foot, which bears a grooming claw. Their diet is a mixture of insects and other small animals, fruit, and tree gums.[4] They have pectinate (comb-like) incisors called toothcombs, and the dental formula: 2.1.3.32.1.3.3\\r\\nAfter a gestation period of 110ÿ133 days, young galagos are born with half-closed eyes and are initially unable to move about independently. After a few (6ÿ8) days, the mother carries the infant in her mouth, and places it on branches while feeding. Females may have singles, twins, or triplets, and may become very aggressive. Each newborn weighs less than half an ounce. For the first three days, the infant is kept in constant contact with the mother. The young are fed by the mother for six weeks and can feed themselves at two months. The young grow rapidly, often causing the mother to walk awkwardly as she transports them.[3]\\r\\nFemales maintain a territory, but share them with their offspring. Males leave their mothers' territories after puberty, but females remain, forming social groups consisting of closely related females and their young. Adult males maintain separate territories, which overlap with those of the female social groups; generally, one adult male mates with all the females in an area. Males that have not established such territories sometimes form small bachelor groups.[4]\\r\\nWhile keeping them as pets is not advised (like many other nonhuman primates, they are considered likely sources of diseases that can cross species barriers), it is certainly done. Equally, they are highly likely to attract attention from customs officials on importation into many countries. Reports from veterinary and zoological sources indicate captive lifetimes of 12.0 to 16.5 years, suggesting a natural lifetime over a decade.[5]\\r\\nGalagos communicate both by calling to each other, and by marking their paths with urine. By following the scent of urine, they can land on exactly the same branch every time.[3] All species of galago produce species-specific 'loud calls' or 'advertisement calls'. These calls have multiple different functions. One function is long-distance identification and differentiation of individual species, and scientists are now able to recognize all known galago species by their 'loud calls'.[6] At the end of the night, group members use a special rallying call and gather to sleep in a nest made of leaves, a group of branches, or a hole in a tree.\\r\\nGalagos have remarkable jumping abilities. The highest reliably reported jump for a galago is 2.25 m. According to a study published by the Royal Society, given the body mass of each animal and the fact that the leg muscles amount to about 25% of this, galago's jumping muscles should perform six to nine times better than those of a frog.[7] This is thought to be due to elastic energy storage in tendons of the lower leg, allowing far greater jumps than would otherwise be possible for an animal of their size.[7] In mid-flight, they tuck their arms and legs close to the body; they are then brought out at the last second to grab the branch. In a series of leaps, a galago can cover ten yards in mere seconds. The tail, which is longer than the length of the head and body combined, assists the powerful leg muscles in powering the jumps. They may also hop like a kangaroo or simply run/walk on four legs.[3] Such strong, complicated, and coordinated movements are due to the rostral half of the posterior parietal cortex that is linked to the motor, premotor, and visuomotor areas of the frontal cortex.[8]\\r\\nGenerally, the social structure of the galago has components of both social life and solitary life. This can be seen in their play. They swing off branches or climb high and throw things. Social play includes play fights, play grooming, and following-play. When following-play, two galagos jump sporadically and chase each other through the trees. The older galagos in a group prefer to rest alone, while younger ones are in constant contact with one another.[9] This is observed in the Galago garnetti species. Mothers often leave infants alone for long periods of time and do not attempt to stop infants from leaving them. On the opposite hand, the offspring tries to stay close to the mother and initiates actions of maintaining close proximity and activating social interactions with the mother.[10]\\r\\nGrooming is a very important part of galago daily life. They often autogroom before, during, and after rest. Social grooming is performed more often by males in the group. Females often reject the attempts made by the males to groom them.[9]\\r\\nGalagos are currently grouped into three genera, with the two former members of the now defunct genus Galagoides returned to their original genus Galago:[1]\\r\\nFamily Galagidae - galagos, or bushbabies\\r\\nA low-coverage genomic sequence of the northern greater galago, O. garnettii, is in progress. As it is a 'primitive' primate, the sequence will be particularly useful in bridging the sequences of higher primates (macaque, chimpanzee, human) to close nonprimates, such as rodents. The two-time planned coverage will not be sufficient to create a full genome assembly, but will provide comparative data across most of the human assembly.[citation needed]","input":"What type of animal is a bush baby?"},{"output":"after 1947.","context":"Land Reform refers to efforts to reform the ownership and regulation of land in India.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLand title formalisation has been part of Indias state policy from the very beginning.[1] Independent Indias most revolutionary land policy was perhaps the abolition of the Zamindari system (feudal land holding practices). Land-reform policy in India had two specific objectives: \\"The first is to remove such impediments to increase in agricultural production as arise from the agrarian structure inherited from the pastThe second object, which is closely related to the first, is to eliminate all elements of exploitation and social injustice within the agrarian system, to provide security for the tiller of soil and assure equality of status and opportunity to all sections of the rural population. (Government of India 1961 as quoted by Appu 1996[2])\\r\\nThere are four main categories of reforms:\\r\\nSince its independence in 1947, there has been voluntary and state initiated/mediated land reforms in several states[4][5] with dual objective of efficient use of land [3] and ensuring social justice.[6][7] The most notable and successful example of land reforms are in the states of West Bengal and Kerala. Other than these state sponsored attempts of reforming land ownership and control, there was another attempt to bring changes in the regime which achieved limited success; famously known as Bhoodan movement (Government of India, Ministry of Rural Development 2003, Annex XXXIX). Some other research has shown that during the movement, in Vidarbha region, 14 percent of the land records are incomplete, thus prohibiting transfer to the poor. 24 percent of the land promised had never actually become part of the movement. The Gramdan which arguably took place in 160,000 pockets did not legalise the process under the state laws (Committee on Land Reform 2009, 77, Ministry of Rural Development).\\r\\nAfter promising land reforms and elected to power in West Bengal in 1977, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) kept their word and initiated gradual land reforms, such as Operation Barga. The result was a more equitable distribution of land among the landless farmers, and enumeration of landless farmers. This has ensured an almost lifelong loyalty from the farmers and the communists were in power till 2011 assembly election.[8]\\r\\nIn land reform in Kerala, the only other large state where the CPI(M) came to power, state administrations have actually carried out the most extensive land, tenancy and agrarian labour wage reforms in the non-socialist late-industrialising world.[9] Another successful land reform program was launched in Jammu and Kashmir after 1947.\\r\\nAll in all, land reforms have been successful only in pockets of the country, as people have often found loopholes in the laws that set limits on the maximum area of land that is allowed to be held by any one person.[6][10][11][12]\\r\\nThe following table shows land ceilings for each state in India.","input":"When was land reform programme introduced in india?"},{"output":"The Writers' Coffee Shop, a virtual publisher based in Australia","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nFifty Shades of Grey is a 2011 erotic romance novel by British author E. L. James.[1] It is the first instalment in the Fifty Shades trilogy that traces the deepening relationship between a college graduate, Anastasia Steele, and a young business magnate, Christian Grey. It is notable for its explicitly erotic scenes featuring elements of sexual practices involving bondage/discipline, dominance/submission, and sadism/masochism (BDSM). Originally self-published as an ebook and a print-on-demand, publishing rights were acquired by Vintage Books in March 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifty Shades of Grey has topped best-seller lists around the world, selling over 125 million copies worldwide by June 2015. It has been translated into 52 languages, and set a record in the United Kingdom as the fastest-selling paperback of all time. Critical reception of the book, however, has tended towards the negative, with the quality of its prose generally seen as poor. Universal Pictures and Focus Features produced a film adaptation, which was released on 13 February 2015[2] and also received generally unfavourable reviews.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second and third volumes of the trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, were published in 2012. Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian, a version of Fifty Shades of Grey being told from Christian's point of view, was published in June 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnastasia \\"Ana\\" Steele is a 21-year-old college senior attending Washington State University in Vancouver, Washington. Her best friend is Katherine \\"Kate\\" Kavanagh, who writes for the college newspaper. Due to an illness, Kate is unable to interview 27-year-old Christian Grey, a successful and wealthy Seattle entrepreneur, and asks Ana to take her place. Ana finds Christian attractive as well as intimidating. As a result, she stumbles through the interview and leaves Christian's office believing it went poorly. Ana does not expect to meet Christian again, but he appears at the hardware store where she works. While he purchases various items including cable ties, masking tape, and rope, Ana informs Christian that Kate would like some photographs to illustrate her article about him. Christian gives Ana his phone number. Later, Kate urges Ana to call Christian and arrange a photo shoot with their photographer friend, Jos Rodriguez.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day Jos, Kate, and Ana arrive for the photo shoot at the Heathman Hotel, where Christian is staying. Christian asks Ana out for coffee and asks if she is dating anyone, specifically Jos. Ana replies that she is not dating anyone. During the conversation, Ana learns that Christian is also single, but he says he is not romantic. Ana is intrigued but believes she is not attractive enough for Christian. Later, Ana receives a package from Christian containing first edition copies of Tess of the d'Urbervilles, which stuns her. Later that night, Ana goes out drinking with her friends and ends up drunk dialling Christian, who informs her that he will be coming to pick her up because of her inebriated state. Ana goes outside to get some fresh air, and Jos attempts to kiss her, but he is stopped by Christian's arrival. Ana leaves with Christian, but not before she discovers that Kate has been flirting with Christian's brother, Elliot. Later, Ana wakes to find herself in Christian's hotel room, where he scolds her for not taking proper care of herself. Christian then reveals that he would like to have sex with her. He initially says that Ana will first have to fill in paperwork, but later goes back on this statement after making out with her in the elevator.\\r\\n\\r\\nAna goes on a date with Christian, on which he takes her in his helicopter, Charlie Tango, to his apartment. Once there, Christian insists that she sign a non-disclosure agreement forbidding her from discussing anything they do together, which Ana agrees to sign. He also mentions other paperwork, but first takes her to his playroom full of BDSM toys and gear. There, Christian informs her that the second contract will be one of dominance and submission, and there will be no romantic relationship, only a sexual one. The contract even forbids Ana from touching Christian or making eye contact with him. At this point, Christian realises that Ana is a virgin and takes her virginity without making her sign the contract. The following morning, Ana and Christian again have sex. His mother arrives moments after their sexual encounter and is surprised by the meeting, having previously thought Christian was homosexual, because he was never seen with a woman. Christian later takes Ana out to eat, and he reveals that he lost his virginity at age 15 to one of his mother's friends, Elena Lincoln, and that his previous dominant/submissive relationships failed due to incompatibility. Christian also reveals that in his first dominant/submissive relationship he was the submissive. Christian and Ana plan to meet again, and he takes Ana home, where she discovers several job offers and admits to Kate that she and Christian had sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next few days, Ana receives several packages from Christian. These include a laptop to enable her to research the BDSM lifestyle in consideration of the contract; to communicate with him, since she has never previously owned a computer; and to receive a more detailed version of the dominant/submissive contract. She and Christian email each other, with Ana teasing him and refusing to honour parts of the contract, such as only eating foods from a specific list. Ana later meets with Christian to discuss the contract and becomes overwhelmed by the potential BDSM arrangement and the potential of having a sexual relationship with Christian that is not romantic in nature. Because of these feelings, Ana runs away from Christian and does not see him again until her college graduation, where he is a guest speaker. During this time, Ana agrees to sign the dominant/submissive contract. Ana and Christian once again meet to further discuss the contract, and they go over Ana's hard and soft limits. Christian spanks Ana for the first time, and the experience leaves her both enticed and slightly confused. This confusion is exacerbated by Christian's lavish gifts and the fact that he brings her to meet his family. The two continue with the arrangement without Ana's having yet signed the contract. After successfully landing a job with Seattle Independent Publishing (SIP), Ana further bristles under the restrictions of the non-disclosure agreement and her complex relationship with Christian. The tension between Ana and Christian eventually comes to a head after Ana asks Christian to punish her in order to show her how extreme a BDSM relationship with him could be. Christian fulfils Ana's request, beating her with a belt, and Ana realises they are incompatible. Devastated, she breaks up with Christian and returns to the apartment she shares with Kate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fifty Shades trilogy was developed from a Twilight fan fiction series originally titled Master of the Universe and published episodically on fan-fiction websites under the pen name \\"Snowqueen's Icedragon\\". The piece featured characters named after Stephenie Meyer's characters in Twilight, Edward Cullen and Bella Swan.  After comments concerning the sexual nature of the material, James removed the story from the fan-fiction websites and published it on her own website, FiftyShades.com. Later she rewrote Master of the Universe as an original piece, with the principal characters renamed Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele and removed it from her website before publication.[3] Meyer commented on the series, saying \\"that's really not my genre, not my thing... Good on hershe's doing well. That's great!\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis reworked and extended version of Master of the Universe was split into three parts. The first, titled Fifty Shades of Grey, was released as an e-book and a print on demand paperback in May 2011 by The Writers' Coffee Shop, a virtual publisher based in Australia.[5][6] The second volume, Fifty Shades Darker, was released in September 2011; and the third, Fifty Shades Freed, followed in January 2012. The Writers' Coffee Shop had a restricted marketing budget and relied largely on book blogs for early publicity, but sales of the novel were boosted by word-of-mouth recommendation. The book's erotic nature and perceived demographic of its fan base as being composed largely of married women over thirty led to the book being dubbed \\"Mommy Porn\\" by some news agencies.[7][8] The book has also reportedly been popular among teenage girls and college women.[8][9][10] By the release of the final volume in January 2012, news networks in the United States had begun to report on the Fifty Shades trilogy as an example of viral marketing and of the rise in popularity of female erotica, attributing its success to the discreet nature of e-reading devices.[11][12] Due to the heightened interest in the series, the license to the Fifty Shades trilogy was picked up by Vintage Books for re-release in a new and revised edition in April 2012.[13][14] The attention that the series has garnered has also helped to spark a renewed interest in erotic literature. Many other erotic works quickly became best-sellers following Fifty Shade's success, while other popular works, such as Anne Rice's The Sleeping Beauty trilogy, have been reissued (this time without pseudonyms) to meet the higher demand.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 August 2012, Amazon UK announced that it had sold more copies of Fifty Shades of Grey than it had the entire Harry Potter series combined, making E. L. James its best-selling author, replacing J. K. Rowling, though worldwide the Harry Potter series sold more than 450 million copies compared with Fifty Shades of Grey's sales of 60 million copies.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nFifty Shades of Grey has topped best-seller lists around the world, including those of the United Kingdom and the United States.[17][18] The series had sold over 125 million copies worldwide by June 2015 and has been translated into 52 languages,[19][20] and set a record in the United Kingdom as the fastest-selling paperback of all time.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has received mixed to negative reviews, with most critics noting poor literary qualities of the work. Salman Rushdie said about the book: \\"I've never read anything so badly written that got published. It made Twilight look like War and Peace.\\"[22] Maureen Dowd described the book in The New York Times as being written \\"like a Bronte devoid of talent,\\" and said it was \\"dull and poorly written.\\"[23] Jesse Kornbluth of The Huffington Post said: \\"As a reading experience, Fifty Shades?... is a sad joke, puny of plot\\".[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrinceton professor April Alliston wrote, \\"Though no literary masterpiece, Fifty Shades is more than parasitic fan fiction based on the recent Twilight vampire series.\\"[25] Entertainment Weekly writer Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the book a \\"B+\\" rating and praised it for being \\"in a class by itself.\\"[26] British author Jenny Colgan in The Guardian wrote \\"It is jolly, eminently readable and as sweet and safe as BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism) erotica can be without contravening the trade descriptions act\\" and also praised the book for being \\"more enjoyable\\" than other \\"literary erotic books\\".[27] The Daily Telegraph noted that the book was \\"the definition of a page-turner\\", noting that the book was both \\"troubling and intriguing\\".[28] A reviewer for the Ledger-Enquirer described the book as guilty fun and escapism, and that it \\"also touches on one aspect of female existence [female submission]. And acknowledging that fact ÿ maybe even appreciating it ÿ shouldn't be a cause for guilt.\\"[29] The New Zealand Herald stated that the book \\"will win no prizes for its prose\\" and that \\"there are some exceedingly awful descriptions,\\" although it was also an easy read; \\"(If you only) can suspend your disbelief and your desire to ÿ if you'll pardon the expression ÿ slap the heroine for having so little self respect, you might enjoy it.\\"[30] The Columbus Dispatch stated that, \\"Despite the clunky prose, James does cause one to turn the page.\\"[31] Metro News Canada wrote that \\"suffering through 500 pages of this heroine's inner dialogue was torturous, and not in the intended, sexy kind of way\\".[32] Jessica Reaves, of the Chicago Tribune, wrote that the \\"book's source material isn't great literature\\", noting that the novel is \\"sprinkled liberally and repeatedly with asinine phrases\\", and described it as \\"depressing\\".[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book garnered some accolades. In December 2012, it won both \\"Popular Fiction\\" and \\"Book of the Year\\" categories in the UK National Book Awards.[34][35] In that same month, Publishers Weekly named E. L. James the 'Publishing Person of the Year', a decision whose criticism in the LA Times and the New York Daily News was referred to by and summarised in The Christian Science Monitor.[36]  Earlier, in April 2012, when E. L. James was listed as one of Time magazine's \\"100 Most Influential People in the World\\",[37] Richard Lawson of The Atlantic Wire criticised her inclusion due to the trilogy's fan fiction beginnings.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nFifty Shades of Grey has attracted criticism due to its depictions of BDSM, with some BDSM participants stating that the book confuses BDSM with abuse and presents it as a pathology to be overcome, as well as showing incorrect and possibly dangerous BDSM techniques.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoinciding with the release of the book and its surprising popularity, injuries related to BDSM and sex toy use spiked dramatically. In 2012, the year after the book was published, injuries requiring Emergency Room visits increased by over 50% from 2010 (the year before the book was published). This is speculated to be due to people unfamiliar with both the proper use of these toys and the safe practice of bondage and other \\"kinky\\" sexual fetishes attempting what they had read in the book.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has also been criticism against the fact that BDSM is part of the book. Archbishop Dennis Schnurr of Cincinnati said in an early February 2015 letter, \\"The story line is presented as a romance; however, the underlying theme is that bondage, dominance, and sadomasochism are normal and pleasurable.\\"[42] The feminist anti-pornography organisation Stop Porn Culture called for a boycott of the movie based on the book because of its sex scenes involving bondage and violence.[43] By contrast, Timothy Laurie and Jessica Kean argue that \\"film fleshes out an otherwise legalistic concept like 'consent' into a living, breathing, and at times, uncomfortable interpersonal experience,\\" and \\"dramatises the dangers of unequal negotiation and the practical complexity of identifying one's limits and having them respected.\\"[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral critics and scientists have expressed concern that the nature of the main couple's relationship is not BDSM at all, but rather is characteristic of an abusive relationship. In 2013, social scientist Professor Amy E. Bonomi published a study wherein the books were read by multiple professionals and assessed for characteristics of intimate partner violence, or IPV, using the CDC's standards for emotional abuse and sexual violence. The study found that nearly every interaction between Ana and Christian was emotionally abusive in nature, including stalking, intimidation, and isolation. The study group also observed pervasive sexual violence within the CDC's definition, including Christian's use of alcohol to circumvent Ana's ability to consent, and that Ana exhibits classic signs of an abused woman, including constant perceived threat, stressful managing, and altered identity.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nA second study in 2014 was conducted to examine the health of women who had read the series, compared with a control group that had never read any part of the novels. The results showed a correlation between having read at least the first book and exhibiting signs of an eating disorder, having romantic partners that were emotionally abusive and/or engaged in stalking behaviour, engaging in binge drinking in the last month, and having 5 or more sexual partners before age 24. The authors could not conclude whether women already experiencing these \\"problems\\" were drawn to the series, or if the series influenced these behaviours to occur after reading by creating underlying context.[47] The study's lead researcher contends that the books romanticise dangerous behaviour and \\"perpetuate dangerous abuse standards.\\"[48] The study was limited in that only women up to age 24 were studied, and no distinction was made among the reader sample between women who enjoyed the series and those that had a strong negative opinion of it, having only read it out of curiosity due to the media hype or other obligation.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the media hype, Dr. Drew and sexologist Logan Levkoff discussed on The Today Show[50] whether the book perpetuated violence against women; Levkoff said that while that is an important subject, this trilogy had nothing to do with it?ÿ this was a book about a consensual relationship. Dr. Drew commented that the book was \\"horribly written\\" in addition to being \\"disturbing\\" but stated that \\"if the book enhances women's real-life sex lives and intimacy, so be it.\\"[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2012, branches of the public library in Brevard County, Florida, removed copies of Fifty Shades of Grey from their shelves, with an official stating that it did not meet the selection criteria for the library and that reviews for the book had been poor. A representative for the library stated that it was due to the book's sexual content and that other libraries had declined to purchase copies for their branches.[52] Deborah Caldwell-Stone of the American Library Association commented that \\"If the only reason you don't select a book is that you disapprove of its content, but there is demand for it, there's a question of whether you're being fair. In a public library there is usually very little that would prevent a book from being on the shelf if there is a demand for the information.\\"[52] Brevard County public libraries later made their copies available to their patrons due to public demand.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Maca, Brazil, Judge Raphael Queiroz Campos ruled in January 2013 that bookstores throughout the city must either remove the series entirely from their shelves or ensure that the books are wrapped and placed out of the reach of minors.[54] The judge stated that he was prompted to make such an order after seeing children reading them,[55] basing his decision on a law stating that \\"magazines and publications whose content is improper or inadequate for children and adolescents can only be sold if sealed and with warnings regarding their content\\".[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2015, the Malaysian Home Ministry banned the Fifty Shades of Grey books shortly after banning its film adaption after permitting them for three years in local bookstores, citing morality-related reasons.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nA film adaptation of the book was produced by Focus Features,[58] Michael De Luca Productions, and Trigger Street Productions,[59] with Universal Pictures and Focus Features securing the rights to the trilogy in March 2012.[60] Universal is also the film's distributor. Charlie Hunnam was originally cast in the role of Christian Grey alongside Dakota Johnson in the role of Anastasia Steele,[61][62] but Hunnam gave up the part in October 2013,[63] with Jamie Dornan announced for the role on 23 October.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was released on 13 February 2015,[2] and although popular at the box office, critical reactions were mixed to negative.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nE. L. James announced the film's soundtrack would be released on 10 February 2015.[66][67] Prior to the soundtrack's release, the first single, \\"Earned It\\", by The Weeknd, was released on 24 December 2014.[68] On 7 January 2015, the second single, \\"Love Me like You Do\\" by Ellie Goulding was released.[69] Australian singer Sia released the soundtrack's third single, \\"Salted Wound\\", on 27 January 2015.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn album of songs selected by E. L. James was released on 11 September 2012 by EMI Classics under the title Fifty Shades of Grey: The Classical Album, and reached number four on the US Billboard classical music albums chart in October 2012.[71][72] A Seattle P-I reviewer favourably wrote that the album would appeal both to fans of the series and to \\"those who have no intention of reading any of the Grey Shades\\".[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy has inspired many parodies in print,[74][75] in film, online, and on stage. In November 2012, Universal Studios attempted to prevent the release of Fifty Shades of Grey: A XXX Adaptation, a pornographic film based on the novel, citing copyright and trademark infringement. Smash Pictures, the porn producer, later responded to the lawsuit with a counterclaim that \\"much or all\\" of the Fifty Shades material was placed in the public domain in its original Twilight-based form,[76] but later capitulated and stopped production of their film.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmazon.com lists over 50 book parodies, e.g.:\\r\\n\\r\\nStage productions include:","input":"Where was fifty shades of grey first published?"},{"output":"help recoup the cost of road construction and maintenance","context":"A toll road, also known as a turnpike or tollway, is a public or private road for which a fee (or toll) is assessed for passage. It is a form of road pricing typically implemented to help recoup the cost of road construction and maintenance.\\r\\nToll roads have existed in some form since antiquity, with tolls levied on passing travellers on foot, wagon or horseback; but their prominence increased with the rise of the automobile,[citation needed] and many modern tollways charge fees for motor vehicles exclusively. The amount of the toll usually varies by vehicle type, weight, or number of axles, with freight trucks often charged higher rates than cars.\\r\\nTolls are often collected at toll booths, toll houses, plazas, stations, bars, or gates. Some toll collection points are unmanned and the user deposits money in a machine which opens the gate once the correct toll has been paid. To cut costs and minimise time delay many tolls today are collected by some form of automatic or electronic toll collection equipment which communicates electronically with a toll payer's transponder. Some electronic toll roads also maintain a system of toll booths so people without transponders can still pay the toll, but many newer roads now use automatic number plate recognition to charge drivers who use the road without a transponder, and some older toll roads are being upgraded with such systems.\\r\\nCriticisms of toll roads include the time taken to stop and pay the toll, and the cost of the toll booth operatorsup to about one third of revenue in some cases. Automated toll paying systems help minimise both of these. Others object to paying \\"twice\\" for the same road: in fuel taxes and with tolls.\\r\\nIn addition to toll roads, toll bridges and toll tunnels are also used by public authorities to generate funds to repay the cost of building the structures. Some tolls are set aside to pay for future maintenance or enhancement of infrastructure, or are applied as a general fund by local governments, not being earmarked for transport facilities. This is sometimes limited or prohibited by central government legislation. Also road congestion pricing schemes have been implemented in a limited number of urban areas as a transportation demand management tool to try to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nToll roads have existed for at least the last 2,700 years, as tolls had to be paid by travellers using the SusaÿBabylon highway under the regime of Ashurbanipal, who reigned in the 7th century BC.[2] Aristotle and Pliny refer to tolls in Arabia and other parts of Asia. In India, before the 4th century BC, the Arthashastra notes the use of tolls. Germanic tribes charged tolls to travellers across mountain passes.\\r\\nA 14th-century example (though not for a road) is Castle Loevestein in the Netherlands, which was built at a strategic point where two rivers meet. River tolls were charged on boats sailing along the river. The ?resund in Scandinavia was once subject to a toll to the Danish Monarch, which once provided a sizable portion of the king's revenue.\\r\\nMany modern European roads were originally constructed as toll roads in order to recoup the costs of construction, maintenance and as a source of tax money that is paid primarily by someone other than the local residents. In 14th-century England, some of the most heavily used roads were repaired with money raised from tolls by pavage grants. Widespread toll roads sometimes restricted traffic so much, by their high tolls, that they interfered with trade and cheap transportation needed to alleviate local famines or shortages.[3]\\r\\nTolls were used in the Holy Roman Empire in the 14th and 15th centuries.\\r\\nIndustrialisation in Europe needed major improvements to the transport infrastructure which included many new or substantially improved roads, financed from tolls. The A5 road in Britain was built to provide a robust transport link between Britain and Ireland and had a toll house every few miles.\\r\\nIn the 20th century, road tolls were introduced in Europe to finance the construction of motorway networks and specific transport infrastructure such as bridges and tunnels. Italy was the first European country to charge motorway tolls, on a 50?km motorway section near Milan in 1924. It was followed by Greece, which made users pay for the network of motorways around and between its cities in 1927. Later in the 1950s and 1960s, France, Spain and Portugal started to build motorways largely with the aid of concessions, allowing rapid development of this infrastructure without massive State debts. Since then, road tolls have been introduced in the majority of the EU Member States.[4]\\r\\nIn the United States, prior to the introduction of the Interstate Highway System and the large federal grants supplied to states to build it, many states constructed their first controlled-access highways by floating bonds backed by toll revenues. Starting with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1940, and followed by similar roads in New Jersey (Garden State Parkway (1946) and New Jersey Turnpike, 1952), New York (New York State Thruway, 1954), Massachusetts (Massachusetts Turnpike, 1957), and others, numerous states throughout the 1950s established major toll roads. With the establishment of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s, toll road construction in the U.S. slowed down considerably, as the federal government now provided the bulk of funding to construct new freeways, and regulations required that such Interstate highways be free from tolls. Many older toll roads were added to the Interstate System under a grandfather clause that allowed tolls to continue to be collected on toll roads that predated the system. Some of these such as the Connecticut Turnpike and the RichmondÿPetersburg Turnpike later removed their tolls when the initial bonds were paid off. Many states, however, have maintained the tolling of these roads, however, as a consistent source of revenue.\\r\\nAs the Interstate Highway System approached completion during the 1980s, states began constructing toll roads again to provide new controlled-access highways which were not part of the original interstate system funding. Houston's outer beltway of interconnected toll roads began in 1983, and many states followed over the last two decades of the 20th century adding new toll roads, including the tollway system around Orlando, Florida, Colorado's E-470, and Georgia State Route 400.\\r\\nLondon, in an effort to reduce traffic within the city, instituted the London congestion charge in 2003, effectively making all roads within the city tolled.\\r\\nIn the United States, as states looked for ways to construct new freeways without federal funding again, to raise revenue for continued road maintenance, and to control congestion, new toll road construction saw significant increases during the first two decades of the 21st century. Spurred on by two innovations, the electronic toll collection system, and the advent of high occupancy and express lane tolls, many areas of the U.S saw large road building projects in major urban areas. Electronic toll collection, first introduced in the 1980s, reduces operating costs by removing toll collectors from roads. Tolled express lanes, by which certain lanes of a freeway are designated \\"toll only\\", increases revenue by allowing a free-to-use highway collect revenue by allowing drivers to bypass traffic jams by paying a toll. The E-ZPass system, compatible with many state systems, is the largest ETC system in the U.S., and is used for both fully tolled highways and tolled express lanes. Maryland Route 200 and the Triangle Expressway in North Carolina were the first toll roads built without toll booths, with drivers charged via ETC or by optical license plate recognition and are billed by mail.\\r\\nTurnpike trusts were established in England and Wales from about 1706 in response to the need for better roads than the few and poorly-maintained tracks then available. Turnpike trusts were set up by individual Acts of Parliament, with powers to collect road tolls to repay loans for building, improving, and maintaining the principal roads in Britain. At their peak, in the 1830s, over 1,000 trusts[5] administered around 30,000 miles (48,000?km) of turnpike road in England and Wales, taking tolls at almost 8,000 toll-gates.[6] The trusts were ultimately responsible for the maintenance and improvement of most of the main roads in England and Wales, which were used to distribute agricultural and industrial goods economically. The tolls were a source of revenue for road building and maintenance, paid for by road users and not from general taxation. The turnpike trusts were gradually abolished from the 1870s. Most trusts improved existing roads, but some new roads, usually only short stretches, were also built. Thomas Telford's Holyhead road followed Watling Street from London but was exceptional in creating a largely new route beyond Shrewsbury, and especially beyond Llangollen. Built in the early 19th century, with many toll booths along its length, most of it is now the A5. In the modern day, one major toll road is the M6 Toll, relieving traffic congestion on the M6 in Birmingham. A few notable bridges and tunnels continue as toll roads including the Severn Bridge, the Dartford Crossing and Mersey Gateway bridge.\\r\\nSome cities in Canada had toll roads in the 19th century. Roads radiating from Toronto required users to pay at toll gates along the street (Yonge Street, Bloor Street, Davenport Road, Kingston Road)[7] and disappeared after 1895.[8]\\r\\n19th-century plank roads were usually operated as toll roads. One of the first U.S. motor roads, the Long Island Motor Parkway (which opened on October 10, 1908) was built by William Kissam Vanderbilt II, the great-grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt. The road was closed in 1938 when it was taken over by the state of New York in lieu of back taxes.[9][10]\\r\\nRoad tolls were levied traditionally for a specific access (e.g. city) or for a specific infrastructure (e.g. roads, bridges). These concepts were widely used until the last century. However, the evolution in technology made it possible to implement road tolling policies based on different concepts. The different charging concepts are designed to suit different requirements regarding purpose of the charge, charging policy, the network to the charge, tariff class differentiation etc.:[11]\\r\\nTime Based Charges and Access Fees: In a time-based charging regime, a road user has to pay for a given period of time in which they may use the associated infrastructure. For the practically identical access fees, the user pays for the access to a restricted zone for a period or several days.\\r\\nMotorway and other Infrastructure Tolling: The term tolling is used for charging a well-defined special and comparatively costly infrastructure, like a bridge, a tunnel, a mountain pass, a motorway concession or the whole motorway network of a country. Classically a toll is due when a vehicle passes a tolling station, be it a manual barrier-controlled toll plaza or a free-flow multi-lane station.\\r\\nDistance or Area Charging: In a distance or area charging system concept, vehicles are charged per total distance driven in a defined area.\\r\\nSome toll roads charge a toll in only one direction. Examples include the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour Tunnel and Eastern Distributor (these all charge tolls city-bound) in Australia, the Severn Bridges where the M4 and M48 in Great Britain crosses the River Severn, in the United States, crossings between Pennsylvania and New Jersey operated by Delaware River Port Authority and crossings between New Jersey and New York operated by Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.This technique is practical where the detour to avoid the toll is large or the toll differences are small.\\r\\n.\\r\\n.\\r\\nTraditionally tolls were paid by hand at a toll gate. Although payments may still be made in cash, it is more common now to pay by credit card, by pre-paid card,[citation needed] or by an electronic toll collection system. In some places, payment is made using stickers which are affixed to the windscreen.\\r\\nThree systems of toll roads exist: open (with mainline barrier toll plazas); closed (with entry/exit tolls) and open road (no toll booths, only electronic toll collection gantries at entrances and exits, or at strategic locations on the mainline of the road). Modern toll roads often use a combination of the three, with various entry and exit tolls supplemented by occasional mainline tolls: for example the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the New York State Thruway implement both systems in different sections.\\r\\nOn an open toll system, all vehicles stop at various locations along the highway to pay a toll. (Not to be confused with \\"open road tolling\\", where no vehicles stop to pay toll.) While this may save money from the lack of need to construct toll booths at every exit, it can cause traffic congestion while traffic queues at the mainline toll plazas (toll barriers). It is also possible for motorists to enter an 'open toll road' after one toll barrier and exit before the next one, thus travelling on the toll road toll-free. Most open toll roads have ramp tolls or partial access junctions to prevent this practice, known in the U.S. as \\"shunpiking\\".\\r\\nWith a closed system, vehicles collect a ticket when entering the highway. In some cases, the ticket displays the toll to be paid on exit. Upon exit, the driver must pay the amount listed for the given exit. Should the ticket be lost, a driver must typically pay the maximum amount possible for travel on that highway. Short toll roads with no intermediate entries or exits may have only one toll plaza at one end, with motorists traveling in either direction paying a flat fee either when they enter or when they exit the toll road. In a variant of the closed toll system, mainline barriers are present at the two endpoints of the toll road, and each interchange has a ramp toll that is paid upon exit or entry. In this case, a motorist pays a flat fee at the ramp toll and another flat fee at the end of the toll road; no ticket is necessary. In addition, with most systems, motorists may pay tolls only with cash and/or change; debit and credit cards are not accepted. However, some toll roads may have travel plazas with ATMs so motorists can stop and withdraw cash for the tolls.\\r\\nThe toll is calculated by the distance travelled on the toll road or the specific exit chosen. In the United States, for instance, the Kansas Turnpike, Ohio Turnpike, Pennsylvania Turnpike, New Jersey Turnpike, most of the Indiana Toll Road, New York State Thruway, and Florida's Turnpike currently implement closed systems.\\r\\nThe Union Toll Plaza on the Garden State Parkway was the first ever to use an automated toll collection machine. A plaque commemorating the event includes the first quarter collected at its toll booths.[12]\\r\\nThe first major deployment of an RFID electronic toll collection system in the United States was on the Dallas North Tollway in 1989 by Amtech (see TollTag). The Amtech RFID technology used on the Dallas North Tollway was originally developed at Sandia Labs for use in tagging and tracking livestock. In the same year, the Telepass active transponder RFID system was introduced across Italy.\\r\\nHighway 407 in the province of Ontario, Canada, has no toll booths, and instead reads a transponder mounted on the windshields of each vehicle using the road (the rear licence plates of vehicles lacking a transponder are photographed when they enter and exit the highway). This made the highway the first all-automated toll highway in the world. A bill is mailed monthly for usage of the 407. Lower charges are levied on frequent 407 users who carry electronic transponders in their vehicles. The approach has not been without controversy: In 2003 the 407 ETR settled[13] a class action with a refund to users.\\r\\nThroughout most of the East Coast of the United States, E-ZPass (operated under the brand I-Pass in Illinois) is accepted on almost all toll roads. Similar systems include SunPass in Florida, FasTrak in California, Good to Go in Washington State, and ExpressToll in Colorado. The systems use a small radio transponder mounted in or on a customer's vehicle to deduct toll fares from a pre-paid account as the vehicle passes through the toll barrier. This reduces manpower at toll booths and increases traffic flow and fuel efficiency by reducing the need for complete stops to pay tolls at these locations.\\r\\nBy designing a tollgate specifically for electronic collection, it is possible to carry out open-road tolling, where the customer does not need to slow at all when passing through the tollgate. The U.S. state of Texas is testing a system on a stretch of Texas 121 that has no toll booths. Drivers without a TollTag have their license plate photographed automatically and the registered owner will receive a monthly bill, at a higher rate than those vehicles with TollTags.[14]\\r\\nThe first all-electric toll road in the eastern United States, the InterCounty Connector (Maryland Route 200) was partially opened to traffic in February 2011,[15] and the final segment was completed in November 2014.[16] The first section of another all-electronic toll road, the Triangle Expressway, opened at the beginning of 2012 in North Carolina.[17]\\r\\nSome toll roads are managed under such systems as the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) system. Private companies build the roads and are given a limited franchise. Ownership is transferred to the government when the franchise expires. This type of arrangement is prevalent in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, India, South Korea, Japan and the Philippines. The BOT system is a fairly new concept that is gaining ground in the United States, with California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi,[18] Texas, and Virginia already building and operating toll roads under this scheme. Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Tennessee are also considering the BOT methodology for future highway projects.\\r\\nThe more traditional means of managing toll roads in the United States is through semi-autonomous public authorities. Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia manage their toll roads in this manner. While most of the toll roads in California, Delaware, Florida, Texas, and Virginia are operating under the BOT arrangement, a few of the older toll roads in these states are still operated by public authorities.\\r\\nIn France, all toll roads are operated by private companies, and the government takes a part of their profit.[citation needed]\\r\\nToll roads have been criticized as being inefficient in various ways:[19]\\r\\nA number of additional criticisms are also directed at toll roads in general:","input":"What is the point of a toll road?"},{"output":"as early as the 1850s","context":"In association football, a substitute is a player who is brought on to the pitch during a match in exchange for an existing player. Substitutions are generally made to replace a player who has become tired or injured, or who is performing poorly, or for tactical reasons (such as bringing a striker on in place of a defender). Unlike some sports (such as American football or ice hockey), a player who has been substituted during a match may take no further part in it.\\r\\nMost competitions only allow each team to make a maximum of three substitutions during a game, although more substitutions are often permitted in non-competitive fixtures such as friendlies. Allowing a fourth substitution in extra time is currently being trialed at several tournaments, including the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup final.[1][2][3][4][5] Each team nominates a number of players (typically between five and seven, depending on the competition) who may be used as substitutes; these players typically sit in the technical area with the coaches, and are said to be \\"on the bench\\". When the substitute enters the field of play it is said they have come on or have been brought on, while the player they are substituting is coming off or being brought off.\\r\\nA player who is noted for frequently making appearances, or scoring important goals, as a substitute is often informally known as a \\"super sub\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of football substitutes goes back to at least the early 1860s as part of English public school football games. The original use of the term \\"substitute\\" in football was to describe the replacement of players who failed to turn up for matches. For example, in 1863, a match reports states: \\"The Charterhouse eleven played a match in cloisters against some old Carthusians but in consequence of the non-appearance of some of those who were expected it was necessary to provide three substitutes.[6] The substitution of absent players happened as early as the 1850s, for example from Eton College where the term \\"emergencies\\" is used.[7] Numerous references to players acting as a \\"substitute\\" occur in matches in the mid-1860s[8] where it is not indicated whether these were replacements of absent players or of players injured during the match.\\r\\nThe first use of a substitute in international football was on 15 April 1889, in the match between Wales and Scotland at Wrexham. Wales's original goalkeeper, Jim Trainer, failed to arrive; local amateur player Alf Pugh started the match and played for some 20 minutes until the arrival of Sam Gillam, who took over from him.[9]\\r\\nSubstitution during games was first permitted in 1958.[10] (Although as early as the qualifying phase for the 1954 World Cup, Horst Eckel of Germany is recorded as having been replaced by Richard Gottinger in their match with the Saarland on 11 October 1953.)[11] The use of substitutes in World Cup Finals matches was not allowed until the 1970 tournament.[12]\\r\\nThe number of substitutes usable in a competitive match has increased from zeromeaning teams were reduced if players' injuries could not allow them to play onto one (plus another for an injured goalkeeper) in 1958; to two out of a possible five in 1988;[13] to two plus one (injured goalkeeper) in 1994,[14] to three in 1995;[15][16] and most recently to a fourth substitute in certain competitions in extra time.[17]\\r\\nSubstitutions during matches in the English Football League were first permitted in the 1965ÿ66 season. During the first two seasons after the law was introduced, each side was permitted only one substitution during a game. Moreover, the substitute could only replace an injured player. From the 1967ÿ68 season, this rule was relaxed to allow substitutions for tactical reasons.[18]\\r\\nOn 21 August 1965, Keith Peacock of Charlton Athletic became the first substitute used in the Football League when he replaced injured goalkeeper Mike Rose eleven minutes into their away match against Bolton Wanderers.[19] On the same day, Bobby Knox became the first ever substitute to score a goal when he scored for Barrow against Wrexham.[20]\\r\\nArchie Gemmill of St Mirren was the first substitute to come on in a Scottish first-class match, on 13 August 1966 in a League Cup tie against Clyde when he replaced Jim Clunie after 23 minutes.[18]\\r\\nThe first official substitute in a Scottish League match was Paul Conn for Queen's Park vs Albion Rovers in a Division 2 match on 24 August 1966. Previously, on 20 January 1917, a player called Morgan came on for the injured Morrison of Partick Thistle after 5 minutes against Rangers at Firhill, but this was an isolated case and the Scottish League did not authorise substitutes until 1966.[18]\\r\\nIn later years, the number of substitutes permitted in Football League matches has gradually increased; at present each team is permitted to name either five or seven substitutes depending on the country and competition, of which a maximum of three may be used. In England, the Premier League increased the number of players on the bench to five in 1996, and it was announced that the number available on the bench would be seven for the 2008ÿ09 season.[21]\\r\\nAccording to the Laws of the Game (2014/15):[22]\\r\\nA player may only be substituted during a stoppage in play and with the permission of the referee. The player to be substituted (outgoing player) must have left the field of play before the substitute (incoming player) may enter the field of play; at that point the substitute becomes a player and the person substituted ceases to be a player. The incoming player may only enter the field at the half-way line. Failure to comply with these provisions may be punished by a caution (yellow card).\\r\\nA player that has been substituted may take no further part in a match, except where return substitutions are permitted.\\r\\nUnused substitutes still on the bench, as well as players who have been already substituted, remain under the authority of the referee. These are liable for misconduct, though cannot be said to have committed a foul. For example, in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Claudio Caniggia was shown the red card for cursing at the referee from the bench.\\r\\nUnder the Laws, the referee has no specific power to force a player to be substituted, even if the team manager or captain has ordered their player to be substituted. If a player refuses to be substituted play may simply resume with that player on the field. However, in some situations players may still be liable to punishment with a caution (yellow card) for time wasting or unsporting behaviour.\\r\\nA player who has been sent off (red card) may not be substituted; the team will have to make do with the remaining players. In the case of a goalkeeper who is sent off, such as in the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final, when Arsenal midfielder Robert Pirs was replaced by second-choice goalkeeper Manuel Almunia to replace Jens Lehmann, who received a red card less than 20 minutes into the match, the coach will usually (but is not required to) substitute an outfield player so that the backup goalkeeper can enter the game. If all substitutions have been used, or if no goalkeeper is available, an outfield player will take up the role of the goalkeeper. A famous example of this is when Chelsea goalkeepers Petr ?ech and Carlo Cudicini were both injured in the same game, which led to defender John Terry spending the remainder of the match in goal wearing third-choice goalkeeper Hilrio's shirt.[23]\\r\\nAccording to the Laws of the Game, \\"up to a maximum of three substitutes may be used in any match played in an official competition organised under the auspices of FIFA, the confederations or the member associations.\\" Also:\\r\\nThe term \\"super-sub\\" refers to a substitution made by the manager that subsequently saves the game, generally by scoring a late equalising or winning goal. Players regarded as \\"super-subs\\" include Azar Karadas for Brann, Santiago Solari for Real Madrid, Nwankwo Kanu for Arsenal, David Fairclough for Liverpool,[24] Adam Le Fondre for Reading,[25] Ole Gunnar Solskj?r and Javier Hernndez for Manchester United,[26][27] Mikael Forssell for Chelsea,[28] Leon Clarke for Wigan Athletic,[29] Brendon Santalab for Western Sydney Wanderers[30] Henrique for Brisbane Roar,[31] Archie Thompson, Joshua Kennedy and Tim Cahill for Australia.[32][33][34][35][36][37][38] and Stevie Kirk for Motherwell,[39]","input":"When were subs first used in english football?"},{"output":"Nunavut","context":"Canada is divided into ten provinces and three territories.

Its size made it the target of three-quarters of the sample measurements taken in the first 25 years of the experiment.

It required that all escaped slaves, upon capture, be returned to their masters and that officials and citizens of free states had to cooperate. Abolitionists nicknamed it the \\"Bloodhound Law\\" for the dogs that were used to track down runaway slaves.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1843, several hundred slaves a year were successfully escaping to the North, making slavery an unstable institution in the border states.[1]\\r\\nThe earlier Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 was a Federal law which was written with the intent to enforce Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution, which required the return of runaway slaves. It sought to force the authorities in free states to return fugitive slaves to their masters.\\r\\nMany Northern states wanted to circumvent the Fugitive Slave Act. Some jurisdictions passed \\"personal liberty laws\\", mandating a jury trial before alleged fugitive slaves could be moved; others forbade the use of local jails or the assistance of state officials in the arrest or return of alleged fugitive slaves. In some cases, juries refused to convict individuals who had been indicted under the Federal law.[2]\\r\\nThe Missouri Supreme Court routinely held with the laws of neighboring free states, that slaves who had been voluntarily transported by their owners into free states, with the intent of the masters' residing there permanently or indefinitely, gained their freedom as a result.[3] The Fugitive Slave Law dealt with slaves who escaped to free states without their master's consent. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842), that states did not have to offer aid in the hunting or recapture of slaves, greatly weakening the law of 1793.\\r\\nAfter 1840, the black population of rural Cass County, Michigan, grew rapidly as families were attracted by white defiance of discriminatory laws, by numerous highly supportive Quakers, and by low-priced land. Free and runaway blacks found Cass County a haven. Their good fortune attracted the attention of southern slaveholders. In 1847 and 1849, planters from Bourbon and Boone counties in northern Kentucky led raids into Cass County to recapture runaway slaves. The raids failed but the situation contributed to Southern demands in 1850 for passage of the strengthened Fugitive Slave Act.[4]\\r\\nSouthern politicians[who?] often exaggerated[citation needed] the number of escaped slaves and often blamed escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights. Since there was no way to confirm the number of runaway slaves,[dubious ÿ discuss] Congress enacted stricter laws regarding fugitive slaves in the United States.[5]\\r\\nIn response to the weakening of the original fugitive slave act, the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 penalized officials who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave, and made them liable to a fine of $1,000 (about $29,000 in present-day value). Law-enforcement officials everywhere were required to arrest people suspected of being a runaway slave on as little as a claimant's sworn testimony of ownership. The suspected slave could not ask for a jury trial or testify on his or her own behalf.[6] In addition, any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was subject to six months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Officers who captured a fugitive slave were entitled to a bonus or promotion for their work.\\r\\nSlave owners needed only to supply an affidavit to a Federal marshal to capture an escaped slave. Since a suspected slave was not eligible for a trial, the law resulted in the kidnapping and conscription of free blacks into slavery, as suspected fugitive slaves had no rights in court and could not defend themselves against accusations.[7]\\r\\nThe Act adversely affected the prospects of slave escape, particularly in states close to the North. One study finds that while slave prices rose across the South in the years after 1850 it appears that \\"the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act increased prices in border states by 15% to 30% more than in states further south\\", illustrating how the Act altered the chance of successful escape.[8]\\r\\nIn 1855, the Wisconsin Supreme Court became the only state high court to declare the Fugitive Slave Act unconstitutional, as a result of a case involving fugitive slave Joshua Glover and Sherman Booth, who led efforts that thwarted Glover's recapture. In 1859 in Ableman v. Booth, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled the state court.[9]\\r\\nIn November 1850, the Vermont legislature passed the \\"Habeas Corpus Law,\\" requiring Vermont judicial and law enforcement officials to assist captured fugitive slaves. It also established a state judicial process, parallel to the federal process, for people accused of being fugitive slaves. This law rendered the federal Fugitive Slave Act effectively unenforceable in Vermont and caused a storm of controversy nationally. It was considered a \\"nullification\\" of federal law, a concept popular in the South among states that wanted to nullify other aspects of federal law, and was part of highly charged debates over slavery. Noted poet and abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier had called for such laws, and the Whittier controversy heightened angry pro-slavery reactions to the Vermont law. Virginia governor John B. Floyd warned that nullification could push the South toward secession, while President Millard Fillmore threatened to use the army to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act in Vermont. No test events took place in Vermont, but the rhetoric of this flare-up echoed South Carolina's 1832 nullification crisis and Thomas Jefferson's 1798 Kentucky Resolutions.[10]\\r\\n\\"Jury nullification\\" occurred as local Northern juries acquitted men accused of violating the law. Secretary of State Daniel Webster was a key supporter of the law as expressed in his famous \\"Seventh of March\\" speech. He wanted high-profile convictions. The jury nullifications ruined his presidential aspirations and his last-ditch efforts to find a compromise between North and South. Webster led the prosecution against men accused of rescuing Shadrach Minkins in 1851 from Boston officials who intended to return Minkins to his owner; the juries convicted none of the men. Webster sought to enforce a law that was extremely unpopular in the North, and his Whig Party passed him over again when they chose a presidential nominee in 1852.[11]\\r\\nThe Fugitive Slave Law brought the issue home to anti-slavery citizens in the North, as it made them and their institutions responsible for enforcing slavery. \\"Where before many in the North had little or no opinions or feelings on slavery, this law seemed to demand their direct assent to the practice of human bondage, and it galvanized Northern sentiments against slavery.\\"[12] Moderate abolitionists were faced with the immediate choice of defying what they believed to be an unjust law, or breaking with their own consciences and beliefs. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852) to highlight the evils of slavery.[13][14]\\r\\nMany abolitionists defied the law openly. Reverend Luther Lee, pastor of the Wesleyan Methodist Church of Syracuse, New York, wrote in 1855:\\r\\nI never would obey it. I had assisted thirty slaves to escape to Canada during the last month. If the authorities wanted anything of me, my residence was at 39 Onondaga Street. I would admit that and they could take me and lock me up in the Penitentiary on the hill; but if they did such a foolish thing as that I had friends enough on Onondaga County to level it to the ground before the next morning.[15]\\r\\nThis was far from empty rhetoric. Several years before, in the Jerry Rescue, Syracuse abolitionists freed by force a fugitive slave who was to be sent back to the South; they successfully smuggled him to Canada.[16] The case of Anthony Burns was an example of an unsuccessful attempt by opponents of the Fugitive Slave Law to use force to free a captured slave.[17] Other famous examples include Shadrach Minkins in 1851 and Lucy Bagby in 1861, whose forcible return in 1861 has been cited by historians as important and \\"allegorical.\\"[18] Pittsburgh abolitionists organized groups whose purpose was the seizure and release of any slave passing through the city, as in the case of a free black servant of the Slaymaker family, erroneously \\"rescued\\" by black waiters in a hotel dining room.[6]\\r\\nOther opponents, such as African-American leader Harriet Tubman, simply treated the law as just another complication in their activities. One important consequence was that Canada became a major destination for escaped slaves; the black population of Canada increased from 40,000 to 60,000 between 1850 and 1860 and many reached freedom by the Underground Railroad.[19] In Pittsburgh, for example, during the September following the passage of the law, organized \\"squads\\" of escaped slaves set out for Canadaarmed and sworn to \\"die rather than be taken back into slavery\\"with more than 200 men leaving by the end of the month.[6]\\r\\nWith the outbreak of the American Civil War, General Benjamin Butler justified refusing to return runaway slaves under this law because the Union and the Confederacy were at war: he confiscated the slaves as contraband of war and set them free, figuring that the loss of workers would also damage the Confederacy.[20] As the war continued with little progress for the Union side, slavery came to be seen as an institution that needed to be undermined to weaken the Confederacy's economy. As such the US Congress eventually passed legislation that forbade US forces to return runaway slaves to their masters, and President Abraham Lincoln consolidated that shifting attitude towards slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation that made the institution's destruction an official war goal. Thus the spirit and letter of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 were completely abandoned.\\r\\nIncidents involving fugitive slaves:","input":"Who was involved in the fugitive slave law?"},{"output":"Basal Evangelical Mission society","context":"Rajyasamacharam or Rajya Samacharam is the first Malayalam journal published in Kerala,[1] started in June 1847.[2] Herman Gundert was the editor of the journal and was a religious propagator from German Basal Evangelical Mission society(BMS).

New Hampshire was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colony that became the state of New Hampshire was founded on the division in 1629 of a land grant given in 1622 by the Council for New England to Captain John Mason (former governor of Newfoundland) and Sir Ferdinando Gorges (who founded Maine). The colony was named New Hampshire by Mason after the English county of Hampshire, one of the first Saxon shires. Hampshire was itself named after the port of Southampton, which was known previously as simply \\"Hampton\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Hampshire was first settled by Europeans at Odiorne's Point in Rye (near Portsmouth) by a group of fishermen from England under David Thompson [1] in 1623, just three years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth.  Early historians believed the first native-born New Hampshirite, John Thompson, was born there.\\r\\n\\r\\nFisherman David Thompson had been sent by Mason, to be followed a few years later by Edward and William Hilton. They led an expedition to the vicinity of Dover, which they called Northam. Mason died in 1635 without ever seeing the colony he founded. Settlers from Pannaway, moving to the Portsmouth region later and combining with an expedition of the new Laconia Company (formed 1629) under Captain Neal, called their new settlement Strawbery Banke. In 1638 Exeter was founded by John Wheelwright.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1631, Captain Thomas Wiggin served as the first governor of the Upper Plantation (comprising modern-day Dover, Durham and Stratham). All the towns agreed to unite in 1639, but meanwhile Massachusetts had claimed the territory. In 1641 an agreement was reached with Massachusetts to come under its jurisdiction. Home rule of the towns was allowed. In 1653 Strawbery Banke petitioned the General Court of Massachusetts to change its name to Portsmouth, which was granted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between Massachusetts and the independent New Hampshirites was controversial and tenuous, and complicated by land claims maintained by the heirs of John Mason. In 1679 King Charles II separated New Hampshire from Massachusetts, issuing a charter for the royal Province of New Hampshire, with John Cutt as governor. New Hampshire was absorbed into the Dominion of New England in 1686, which collapsed in 1689. After a brief period without formal government (the settlements were de facto ruled by Massachusetts) William III and Mary II issued a new provincial charter in 1691. From 1699 to 1741 the governors of Massachusetts were also commissioned as governors of New Hampshire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe province's geography placed it on the frontier between British and French colonies in North America, and it was for many years subjected to native claims, especially in the central and northern portions of its territory. Because of these factors it was on the front lines of many military conflicts, including King William's War, Queen Anne's War, Father Rale's War, and King George's War. By the 1740s most of the native population had either been killed or driven out of the province's territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause New Hampshire's governorship was shared with that of Massachusetts, border issues between the two colonies were not properly adjudicated for many years. These issues principally revolved around territory west of the Merrimack River, which issuers of the Massachusetts and New Hampshire charters had incorrectly believed to flow primarily from west to east. In the 1730s New Hampshire political interest led by Lieutenant Governor John Wentworth were able to raise the profile of these issues to colonial officials and the crown in London, even while Governor and Massachusetts native Jonathan Belcher preferentially granted land to Massachusetts interests in the disputed area. In 1741 King George II ruled that the border with Massachusetts was approximately what it is today, and also separated the governorships of the two provinces. Benning Wentworth in 1741 became the first non-Massachusetts governor since Edward Cranfield succeeded John Cutt in the 1680s.\\r\\n\\r\\nWentworth promptly complicated New Hampshire's territorial claims by interpreting the provincial charter to include territory west of the Connecticut River, and began issuing land grants in this territory, which was also claimed by the Province of New York. The so-called New Hampshire Grants area became a subject of contention from the 1740s until the 1790s, when it was admitted to the United States as the state of Vermont.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Hampshire was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule during the American Revolution. The Massachusetts Provincial Congress called upon the other New England colonies for assistance in raising an army. In response, on May 22, 1775, the New Hampshire Provincial Congress voted to raise a volunteer force to join the patriot army at Boston. In January 1776, it became the first colony to set up an independent government and the first to establish a constitution,[2] but the latter explicitly stated \\"we never sought to throw off our dependence on Great Britain\\", meaning that it was not the first to actually declare its independence (that distinction instead belongs to Rhode Island).[3] The historic attack on Fort William and Mary (now Fort Constitution) helped supply the cannon and ammunition  for the Continental Army that was needed for the Battle of Bunker Hill that took place north of Boston a few months later. New Hampshire raised three regiments for the Continental Army, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd New Hampshire regiments. New Hampshire Militia units were called up to fight at the Battle of Bunker Hill, Battle of Bennington, Saratoga Campaign and the Battle of Rhode Island. John Paul Jones' ship the Sloop-of-war USS Ranger and the frigate USS Raleigh were built in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, along with other naval ships for the Continental Navy and privateers to hunt down British merchant shipping.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcord was named the state capital in 1808.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1830s, New Hampshire saw a major news story: the founding of the Republic of Indian Stream on its northern border with Canada over the unresolved post-revolutionary war border issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbolitionists from Dartmouth College founded the experimental, interracial Noyes Academy in Canaan, New Hampshire in 1835.

Hale. However the conservative Jacksonian Democrats usually maintained control, under the leadership of editor Isaac Hill. In 1856 the new Republican Party headed by Amos Tuck produced a political revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Abraham Lincoln gave speeches in March 1860, he was well regarded. However, the radical wing of the Republican Party increasingly took control. As early as January 1861, top officials were secretly meeting with Governor John A. Andrew of Massachusetts to coordinate plans in case the war came. Plans were made to rush militia units to Washington in an emergency.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Hampshire fielded 31,650 enlisted men and 836 officers during the American Civil War; of these, 1,803 enlisted men and 131 officers were killed or wounded.[6] The state provided eighteen volunteer infantry regiments (thirteen of which were raised in 1861 in response to Lincoln's call to arms), three rifle regiments (who served in the 1st United States Sharpshooters and 2nd United States Sharpshooters), one cavalry battalion (the 1st New Hampshire Volunteer Cavalry, which was attached to the 1st New England Volunteer Cavalry), and two artillery units (the 1st New Hampshire Light Battery and 1st New Hampshire Heavy Artillery), as well as additional men for the Navy and Marine Corps.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the most celebrated of New Hampshire's units was the 5th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry, commanded by Colonel Edward Ephraim Cross.[7] Called the \\"Fighting Fifth\\" in newspaper accounts, the regiment was considered among the Union's best both during the war (Major General Winfield Scott called the regiment \\"refined gold\\" in 1863) and by historians afterward.[7] The Civil War veteran and early Civil War historian William F. Fox determined that this regiment had the highest number of battle-related deaths of any Union regiment.[7] The 20th-century historian Bruce Catton said that the Fifth New Hampshire was \\"one of the best combat units in the army\\" and that Cross was \\"an uncommonly talented regimental commander.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe critical post of state Adjutant General was held in 1861-64 by elderly politician Anthony C. Colby (1792-1873) and his son Daniel E. Colby (1816-1891). They were patriotic, but were overwhelmed with the complexity of their duties. The state had no track of men who enlisted after 1861; no personnel records or information on volunteers, substitutes, or draftees. There was no inventory of weaponry and supplies. Nathaniel Head (1828-1883) took over in 1864, obtained an adequate budget and office staff, and reconstructed the missing paperwork. As a result, widows, orphans, and disabled veterans received the postwar payments they had earned.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1884 and 1903, New Hampshire attracted many immigrants. French Canadian migration to the state was significant, and at the turn of the century, French Canadians represented 16 percent of the state's population, and one-fourth the population of Manchester.[9] Polish immigration to the state was also significant; there were about 850 Polish Americans in Manchester in 1902.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe textile industry was hit hard by the depression and growing competition from southern mills. The closing of the Amoskeag Mills in 1935 was a major blow to Manchester, as was the closing of the former Nashua Manufacturing Company mill in Nashua in 1949 and the bankruptcy of the Brown Company paper mill in Berlin in the 1940s, which led to new ownership.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe post-World War II decades have seen New Hampshire increase its economic and cultural links with the greater Boston, Massachusetts, region. This reflects a national trend, in which improved highway networks have helped metropolitan areas expand into formerly rural areas or small nearby cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe replacement of the Nashua textile mill with defense electronics contractor Sanders Associates in 1952 and the arrival of minicomputer giant Digital Equipment Corporation in the early 1970s helped lead the way toward southern New Hampshire's role as a high-tech adjunct of the Route 128 corridor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe postwar years saw the rise of New Hampshire's political primary for President of the United States, which as the first primary in the quadrennial campaign season draws enormous attention.","input":"When was new hampshire founded as a colony?"},{"output":"during the Great Depression of the 1930s","context":"Quantitative easing (QE), also known as large-scale asset purchases,[1][2] is an expansionary monetary policy whereby a central bank buys predetermined amounts of government bonds or other financial assets in order to stimulate the economy and increase liquidity.[3][4] An unconventional form of monetary policy,[3] it is usually used when standard monetary policy has become ineffective at combating too low inflation or deflation.[5][6][7][8] A central bank implements quantitative easing by buying specified amounts of financial assets from commercial banks and other financial institutions, thus raising the prices of those financial assets and lowering their yield, while simultaneously increasing the money supply.[9][10] This differs from the more usual policy of buying or selling short-term government bonds to keep interbank interest rates at a specified target value.[11][12][13][14]\\r\\nExpansionary monetary policy to stimulate the economy typically involves the central bank buying short-term government bonds to lower short-term market interest rates.[15][16][17][18] However, when short-term interest rates reach or approach zero, this method can no longer work.[19] In such circumstances, monetary authorities may then use quantitative easing to further stimulate the economy, by buying assets that are riskier, or of longer maturity, than short-term government bonds, thereby lowering interest rates further out on the yield curve.[20][21]\\r\\nQuantitative easing can help ensure that inflation does not fall below a target.[14] Risks include the policy being more effective than intended in acting against deflation (leading to higher inflation in the longer term, due to increased money supply),[22] or not being effective enough if banks remain reluctant to lend and potential borrowers are unwilling to borrow.[23] According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and various economists, quantitative easing undertaken since the global financial crisis of 2007ÿ08 has mitigated some of the economic problems since the crisis.[24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard central bank monetary policies are usually enacted by buying or selling government bonds on the open market to reach a desired target for the interbank interest rate. However, if a recession or depression continues even when a central bank has lowered interest rates to nearly zero, the central bank can no longer lower interest rates, a situation known as the liquidity trap. The central bank may then implement quantitative easing by buying financial assets without reference to interest rates. This policy is sometimes described as a last resort to stimulate the economy.[27][28]\\r\\nA central bank enacts quantitative easing by purchasingregardless of interest ratesa predetermined quantity of bonds or other financial assets on financial markets from private financial institutions.[5][13] This action increases the excess reserves that banks hold. The goal of this policy is to facilitate an expansion of private bank lending; if private banks increase lending, it would increase the money supply, though QE does directly increase the broad money supply even without further bank lending. Additionally, if the central bank also purchases financial instruments that are riskier than government bonds, it can also lower the interest yield of those assets (as those assets are more scarce in the market, and thus their prices go up correspondingly).\\r\\nQuantitative easing, and monetary policy in general, can only be carried out if the central bank controls the currency used in the country. The central banks of countries in the Eurozone, for example, cannot unilaterally decide to employ quantitative easing. They must instead rely on the European Central Bank's governing council (composed of all national central banks governors) to agree on a common monetary policy, which they (national central banks) implement.[29]\\r\\nThe US Federal Reserve belatedly implemented policies similar to the current quantitative easing during the Great Depression of the 1930s.[30][31] Specifically, banks' excess reserves exceeded 6 percent in 1940, whereas they vanished during the entire postwar period until 2008.[32] Despite this fact, many commentators called the scope of the Federal Reserve quantitative easing program after the 2008 crisis \\"unprecedented\\".[33][34][35] [check quotation syntax]\\r\\nA policy termed 'quantitative easing' (vǻ??, ryteki kin'y kanwa) was first used by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to fight domestic deflation in the early 2000s.[20][36][37][38] The BOJ had maintained short-term interest rates at close to zero since 1999. The Bank of Japan had for many years, and as late as February 2001, stated that \\"quantitative easing ... is not effective\\" and rejected its use for monetary policy.[39]\\r\\nAccording to the Bank of Japan, the central bank adopted quantitative easing on 19 March 2001.[40][41] Under quantitative easing, the BOJ flooded commercial banks with excess liquidity to promote private lending, leaving them with large stocks of excess reserves and therefore little risk of a liquidity shortage.[42] The BOJ accomplished this by buying more government bonds than would be required to set the interest rate to zero. It later also bought asset-backed securities and equities and extended the terms of its commercial paperÿpurchasing operation.[43] The BOJ increased the commercial bank current account balance from 5?trillion to 35 trillion (approximately US$300 billion) over a four-year period starting in March 2001. The BOJ also tripled the quantity of long-term Japan government bonds it could purchase on a monthly basis.[citation needed]\\r\\nSince the global financial crisis of 2007ÿ08, policies similar to those undertaken by Japan have been used by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Eurozone. Quantitative easing was used by these countries because their risk-free short-term nominal interest rates (termed the federal funds rate in the US, or the official bank rate in the UK) were either at or close to zero.\\r\\nDuring the peak of the financial crisis in 2008, the US Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet dramatically by adding new assets and new liabilities without \\"sterilizing\\" these by corresponding subtractions. In the same period, the United Kingdom also used quantitative easing as an additional arm of its monetary policy to alleviate its financial crisis.[44][45][46]\\r\\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve System held between $700 billion and $800 billion of Treasury notes on its balance sheet before the recession. In late November 2008, the Federal Reserve started buying $600 billion in mortgage-backed securities.[47] By March 2009, it held $1.75 trillion of bank debt, mortgage-backed securities, and Treasury notes; this amount reached a peak of $2.1 trillion in June 2010. Further purchases were halted as the economy started to improve, but resumed in August 2010 when the Fed decided the economy was not growing robustly. After the halt in June, holdings started falling naturally as debt matured and were projected to fall to $1.7 trillion by 2012. The Fed's revised goal became to keep holdings at $2.054 trillion. To maintain that level, the Fed bought $30 billion in two- to ten-year Treasury notes every month.[48]\\r\\nIn November 2010, the Fed announced a second round of quantitative easing, buying $600 billion of Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011.[49][50] The expression \\"QE2\\" became a ubiquitous nickname in 2010, used to refer to this second round of quantitative easing by US central banks.[51] Retrospectively, the round of quantitative easing preceding QE2 was called \\"QE1\\".[52][53]\\r\\nA third round of quantitative easing, \\"QE3\\", was announced on 13 September 2012. In an 11ÿ1 vote, the Federal Reserve decided to launch a new $40 billion per month, open-ended bond purchasing program of agency mortgage-backed securities. Additionally, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that it would likely maintain the federal funds rate near zero \\"at least through 2015.\\"[54][55] According to NASDAQ.com, this is effectively a stimulus program that allows the Federal Reserve to relieve $40 billion per month of commercial housing market debt risk.[56] Because of its open-ended nature, QE3 has earned the popular nickname of \\"QE-Infinity.\\"[57] On 12 December 2012, the FOMC announced an increase in the amount of open-ended purchases from $40 billion to $85 billion per month.[58]\\r\\nOn 19 June 2013, Ben Bernanke announced a \\"tapering\\" of some of the Fed's QE policies contingent upon continued positive economic data. Specifically, he said that the Fed could scale back its bond purchases from $85 billion to $65 billion a month during the upcoming September 2013 policy meeting.[59][not in citation given] He also suggested that the bond-buying program could wrap up by mid-2014.[60] While Bernanke did not announce an interest rate hike, he suggested that if inflation followed a 2% target rate and unemployment decreased to 6.5%, the Fed would likely start raising rates. The stock markets dropped by approximately 4.3% over the three trading days following Bernanke's announcement, with the Dow Jones dropping 659 points between 19 and 24 June, closing at 14,660 at the end of the day on 24 June.[61] On 18 September 2013, the Fed decided to hold off on scaling back its bond-buying program,[62] and announced in December 2013 that it would begin to taper its purchases in January 2014.[63] Purchases were halted on 29 October 2014[64] after accumulating $4.5 trillion in assets.[65]\\r\\nDuring its QE programme, the Bank of England bought gilts from financial institutions, along with a smaller amount of relatively high-quality debt issued by private companies.[67] The banks, insurance companies, and pension funds could then use the money they received for lending or even to buy back more bonds from the bank. Further, the central bank could lend the new money to private banks or buy assets from banks in exchange for currency.[citation needed] These measures have the effect of depressing interest yields on government bonds and similar investments, making it cheaper for business to raise capital.[68] Another side effect is that investors will switch to other investments, such as shares, boosting their price and thus encouraging consumption.[67] QE can reduce interbank overnight interest rates and thereby encourage banks to loan money to higher interest-paying and financially weaker bodies.\\r\\nBeginning in March 2009, the Bank of England had purchased around S165 billion in assets as of September 2009 and around S175 billion in assets by the end of October 2009.[69] At its meeting in November 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to increase total asset purchases to S200 billion. Most of the assets purchased have been UK government securities (gilts); the Bank has also purchased smaller quantities of high-quality private-sector assets.[70] In December 2010, MPC member Adam Posen called for a S50 billion expansion of the Bank's quantitative easing programme, while his colleague Andrew Sentance has called for an increase in interest rates due to inflation being above the target rate of 2%.[71] In October 2011, the Bank of England announced that it would undertake another round of QE, creating an additional S75 billion.[72] In February 2012 it announced an additional S50 billion.[73] In July 2012 it announced another S50 billion,[74] bringing the total amount to S375 billion. The Bank has said that it will not buy more than 70% of any issue of government debt.[75] This means that at least 30% of any issue of government debt will have to be purchased and held by institutions other than the Bank of England. In 2012 the Bank estimated that quantitative easing had benefited households differentially according to the assets they hold; richer households have more assets.[76]\\r\\nIn August 2016, the Bank of England said it would buy an additional S60bn of UK government bonds and S10bn of corporate bonds, to address uncertainty over Brexit and worries about productivity and economic growth.[77]\\r\\nThe European Central Bank said that it would focus on buying covered bonds, a form of corporate debt. It signalled that its initial purchases would be worth about ?60?billion in May 2009.[78]\\r\\nAt the beginning of 2013, the Swiss National Bank had the largest balance sheet relative to the size of the economy it was responsible for, at close to 100% of Switzerland's national output. A total of 12% of its reserves were in foreign equities. By contrast, the US Federal Reserve's holdings equalled about 20% of US GDP, while the European Central Bank's assets were worth 30% of GDP.[79]\\r\\nIn a dramatic change of policy, following the new Jackson Hole Consensus, on 22 January 2015 Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, announced an 'expanded asset purchase programme': where ?60 billion per month of euro-area bonds from central governments, agencies and European institutions would be bought. Beginning in March 2015, the stimulus was planned to last until September 2016 at the earliest with a total QE of at least ?1.1 trillion. Mario Draghi announced the programme would continue: 'until we see a continued adjustment in the path of inflation', referring to the ECB's need to combat the growing threat of deflation across the eurozone in early 2015.[80][81]\\r\\nOn 10 March 2016, ECB increased its monthly bond purchases to ?80 billion from ?60 billion and started to include corporate bonds under the asset purchasing programme and announced new ultra-cheap four-year loans to banks.\\r\\nSwedish National Bank launched quantitative easing in February 2015, announcing government bond purchases of nearly 1.2 billion USD.[82] The annualised inflation rate in January 2015 was minus 0.3 percent, and the bank implied that Sweden's economy could slide into deflation.[82]\\r\\nIn early October 2010, the Bank of Japan announced that it would examine the purchase of 5?trillion (US$60 billion) in assets. This was an attempt to push down the value of the yen against the US dollar to stimulate the domestic economy by making Japanese exports cheaper; however, it was ineffective.[83]\\r\\nOn 4 August 2011 the BOJ announced a unilateral move to increase the commercial bank current account balance from 40 trillion (US$504 billion) to a total of 50 trillion (US$630 billion).[84][85] In October 2011, the Bank expanded its asset purchase program by 5?trillion ($66bn) to a total of 55?trillion.[86]\\r\\nOn 4 April 2013, the Bank of Japan announced that it would expand its asset purchase program by 60 to 70 trillion Yen a year. https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/outline/qqe.htm/\\r\\nThe Bank hoped to bring Japan from deflation to inflation, aiming for 2% inflation. The amount of purchases was so large that it was expected to double the money supply.[87] This policy has been named Abenomics, as a portmanteau of economic policies and Shinz Abe, the current Prime Minister of Japan.\\r\\nOn 31 October 2014, the BOJ announced the expansion of its bond buying program, to now buy 80 trillion Yen of bonds a year.[88]\\r\\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the quantitative easing policies undertaken by the central banks of the major developed countries since the beginning of the late-2000s financial crisis have contributed to the reduction in systemic risks following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. The IMF states that the policies also contributed to the improvements in market confidence and the bottoming-out of the recession in the G7 economies in the second half of 2009.[24]\\r\\nEconomist Martin Feldstein argues that QE2 led to a rise in the stock market in the second half of 2010, which in turn contributed to increasing consumption and the strong performance of the US economy in late 2010.[26] Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan calculated that as of July 2012, there was \\"very little impact on the economy.\\"[89] Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy Stein has said that measures of quantitive easing such as large-scale asset purchases \\"have played a significant role in supporting economic activity\\".[25]\\r\\nAccording to Neil Irwin, senior economic correspondent at The New York Times, quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve likely contributed to: i) Lower interest rates for corporate bonds and mortgage rates, helping support housing prices; ii) Higher stock market valuation, in terms of a higher price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 index; iii) Increased inflation rate and investor's expectations for future inflation; iv) Higher rate of job creation; and v) Higher rate of GDP growth.[90]\\r\\nSeveral studies published in the aftermath of the crisis found Large Scale Asset Purchases to have lowered long term interest rates on a variety of securities as well as lower credit risk. The impacts were to modestly increase inflation and boost GDP growth.[91][92][93][94][95]\\r\\nIncreasing the money supply tends to depreciate a country's exchange rates relative to other currencies, through the mechanism of the interest rate. Lower interest rates lead to a capital outflow from a country, thereby reducing foreign demand for a country's money, leading to a weaker currency. This feature of QE directly benefits exporters living in the country performing QE, as well as debtors, since the interest rate has fallen, meaning there is less money to be repaid. However, it directly harms creditors as they earn less money from lower interest rates. Devaluation of a currency also directly harms importers and consumers, as the cost of imported goods is inflated by the devaluation of the currency.[96]\\r\\nIn a fractional reserve monetary system the money supply will contract when repayments of bank loans (destroying money) exceed the amount of new credit extended. During the great depression, for example, the money supply fell by approximately 35%.[citation needed]\\r\\nQuantitative easing may cause higher inflation than desired if the amount of easing required is overestimated and too much money is created by the purchase of liquid assets.[22] On the other hand, QE can fail to spur demand if banks remain reluctant to lend money to businesses and households. Even then, QE can still ease the process of deleveraging as it lowers yields. However, there is a time lag between monetary growth and inflation; inflationary pressures associated with money growth from QE could build before the central bank acts to counter them.[97] Inflationary risks are mitigated if the system's economy outgrows the pace of the increase of the money supply from the easing. If production in an economy increases because of the increased money supply, the value of a unit of currency may also increase, even though there is more currency available. For example, if a nation's economy were to spur a significant increase in output at a rate at least as high as the amount of debt monetized, the inflationary pressures would be equalized. This can only happen if member banks actually lend the excess money out instead of hoarding the extra cash. During times of high economic output, the central bank always has the option of restoring reserves to higher levels through raising interest rates or other means, effectively reversing the easing steps taken.\\r\\nEconomists such as John Taylor[98] believe that quantitative easing creates unpredictability. Since the increase in bank reserves may not immediately increase the money supply if held as excess reserves, the increased reserves create the danger that inflation may eventually result when the reserves are loaned out.[99]\\r\\nIn the European Union, World Pensions Council (WPC) financial economists have also argued that artificially low government bond interest rates induced by QE will have an adverse impact on the underfunding condition of pension funds, since \\"without returns that outstrip inflation, pension investors face the real value of their savings declining rather than ratcheting up over the next few years\\".[100][101]\\r\\nAccording to Bloomberg reporter David Lynch, the new money from quantitative easing could be used by the banks to invest in emerging markets, commodity-based economies, commodities themselves, and non-local opportunities rather than to lend to local businesses that are having difficulty getting loans.[102]\\r\\nCritics frequently point to the redistributive effects of quantitative easing. For instance, British Prime Minister Theresa May openly criticized QE in July 2016 for its regressive effects: \\"Monetary policy ÿ in the form of super-low interest rates and quantitative easing ÿ has helped those on the property ladder at the expense of those who can't afford to own their own home.\\"[103] Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research wrote that \\"QE cash ends up overwhelmingly in profits, thereby exacerbating already extreme income inequality and the consequent social tensions that arise from it\\".[104] Anthony Randazzo of the Reason Foundation wrote that QE \\"is fundamentally a regressive redistribution program that has been boosting wealth for those already engaged in the financial sector or those who already own homes, but passing little along to the rest of the economy. It is a primary driver of income inequality\\".[104]\\r\\nThose critics are partly based on some evidence provided by central banks themselves. In 2012, a Bank of England report[105] showed that its quantitative easing policies had benefited mainly the wealthy, and that 40% of those gains went to the richest 5% of British households.[104][106]\\r\\nIn May 2013, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said that cheap money has made rich people richer, but has not done quite as much for working Americans.[107]\\r\\nAnswering similar critics expressed by MEP Molly Scott Cato, the President of the ECB Mario Draghi once declared:[108][109]\\r\\nSome of these policies may, on the one hand, increase inequality but, on the other hand, if we ask ourselves what the major source of inequality is, the answer would be unemployment. So, to the extent that these policies help ÿ and they are helping on that front ÿ then certainly an accommodative monetary policy is better in the present situation than a restrictive monetary policy.\\r\\nBRIC countries have criticized the QE carried out by the central banks of developed nations. They share the argument that such actions amount to protectionism and competitive devaluation. As net exporters whose currencies are partially pegged to the dollar, they protest that QE causes inflation to rise in their countries and penalizes their industries.[110][111][112][113]\\r\\nRichard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, warned in 2010 that QE carries \\"the risk of being perceived as embarking on the slippery slope of debt monetization. We know that once a central bank is perceived as targeting government debt yields at a time of persistent budget deficits, concern about debt monetization quickly arises.\\" Later in the same speech, he stated that the Fed is monetizing the government debt: \\"The math of this new exercise is readily transparent: The Federal Reserve will buy $110 billion a month in Treasuries, an amount that, annualized, represents the projected deficit of the federal government for next year. For the next eight months, the nation's central bank will be monetizing the federal debt.\\"[114] Ben Bernanke remarked in 2002 that the US government had a technology called the printing press (or, today, its electronic equivalent), so that if rates reached zero and deflation threatened, the government could always act to ensure deflation was prevented. He said, however, that the government would not print money and distribute it \\"willy nilly\\" but would rather focus its efforts in certain areas (e.g., buying federal agency debt securities and mortgage-backed securities).[115][116] According to economist Robert McTeer, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, there is nothing wrong with printing money during a recession, and quantitative easing is different from traditional monetary policy \\"only in its magnitude and pre-announcement of amount and timing\\".[117][118]\\r\\nProfessor Willem Buiter of the London School of Economics has proposed a terminology to distinguish quantitative easing, or an expansion of a central bank's balance sheet, from what he terms qualitative easing, or the process of a central bank adding riskier assets to its balance sheet:\\r\\nQuantitative easing is an increase in the size of the balance sheet of the central bank through an increase [in its] monetary liabilities (base money), holding constant the composition of its assets. Asset composition can be defined as the proportional shares of the different financial instruments held by the central bank in the total value of its assets. An almost equivalent definition would be that quantitative easing is an increase in the size of the balance sheet of the central bank through an increase in its monetary liabilities that holds constant the (average) liquidity and riskiness of its asset portfolio.\\r\\nQualitative easing is a shift in the composition of the assets of the central bank towards less liquid and riskier assets, holding constant the size of the balance sheet (and the official policy rate and the rest of the list of usual suspects). The less liquid and more risky assets can be private securities as well as sovereign or sovereign-guaranteed instruments. All forms of risk, including credit risk (default risk) are included.[119]\\r\\nIn introducing the Federal Reserve's response to the 2008ÿ09 financial crisis, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke distinguished the new program, which he termed \\"credit easing\\", from Japanese-style quantitative easing. In his speech, he announced,\\r\\nOur approachwhich could be described as \\"credit easing\\"resembles quantitative easing in one respect: It involves an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet. However, in a pure QE regime, the focus of policy is the quantity of bank reserves, which are liabilities of the central bank; the composition of loans and securities on the asset side of the central bank's balance sheet is incidental. Indeed, although the Bank of Japan's policy approach during the QE period was quite multifaceted, the overall stance of its policy was gauged primarily in terms of its target for bank reserves. In contrast, the Federal Reserve's credit easing approach focuses on the mix of loans and securities that it holds and on how this composition of assets affects credit conditions for households and businesses.[120]\\r\\nCredit easing involves increasing the money supply by the purchase not of government bonds but of private-sector assets, such as corporate bonds and residential mortgageÿbacked securities.[121][122] In 2010, the Federal Reserve purchased $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities to support the sagging mortgage market. These purchases increased the monetary base in a way similar to a purchase of government securities.[123]\\r\\nQuantitative easing has been nicknamed \\"printing money\\" by some members of the media,[124][125][126] central bankers,[127] and financial analysts.[128][129] Stephen Hester, chief executive officer of the RBS Group, said:\\r\\nWhat the Bank of England does in quantitative easing is it prints money to buy government debt, ... So the Quantitative Easing has enabled governments, this government, to run a big budget deficit without killing the economy because the Bank of England has financed it.[130]\\r\\nThe Dutch Central Bank itself sees QE as being a money creation operation:[131]\\r\\nThe Eurosystem directly injects money into the economy by purchasing the bonds with newly created electronic cash. This is called quantitative easing.\\r\\nHowever, QE is a very different form of money creation than it is commonly understood when talking about \\"money printing\\". Indeed, the term printing money usually implies that newly created money is used to directly finance government deficits or pay off government debt (also known as monetizing the government debt). However, with QE, the newly created money is directly used to buy government bonds or other financial assets,[124] Central banks in most developed nations (e.g., the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, and the EU) are prohibited from buying government debt directly from the government and must instead buy it from the secondary market.[123][132] This two-step process, where the government sells bonds to private entities that in turn sell them to the central bank, has been called \\"monetizing the debt\\" by many analysts.[123] Also, the Federal Reserve has mostly \\"sterilized\\" its bond purchases by paying interest to banks for reserve deposits. This removes money from circulation previously added by the Fed's bond purchases. The net effect is to raise bond prices, lowering borrowing rates for mortgages and other loans, without an inflationary increase in the money supply [133]\\r\\nThe distinguishing characteristic between QE and monetizing debt is that with the former, the central bank creates money to stimulate the economy, not to finance government spending (although an indirect effect of QE is to lower rates on sovereign bonds). Also, the central bank has the stated intention of reversing the QE when the economy has recovered (by selling the government bonds and other financial assets back into the market).[124] The only effective way to determine whether a central bank has monetized debt is to compare its performance relative to its stated objectives. Many central banks have adopted an inflation target. It is likely that a central bank is monetizing the debt if it continues to buy government debt when inflation is above target and if the government has problems with debt financing.[123]\\r\\nIn fact, with the failure of quantitative easing programmes around the world, more and more people are precisely calling for a more overt and direct money printing process, including monetary financing of government budgets, helicopter money or \\"QE for People\\" (see section below).\\r\\nIn response to concerns that QE is failing to create sufficient demand, particularly in the Eurozone, a number of economists have called for \\"QE for the people\\". Instead of buying government bonds or other securities by creating bank reserves, as the Federal Reserve and Bank of England have done, some suggest that central banks could make payments directly to households (in a similar fashion as Milton Friedman's helicopter money).[134] Economists Mark Blyth and Eric Lonergan argue in Foreign Affairs that this is the most effective solution for the Eurozone, particularly given the restrictions on fiscal policy.[135] They argue that based on the evidence from tax rebates in the United States, less than 5% of GDP transferred by the ECB to the household sector in the Eurozone would suffice to generate a recovery, a fraction of what it intends to be done under standard QE. Oxford economist, John Muellbauer, has suggested that this could be legally implemented using the electoral register.[136]\\r\\nOn 27 March 2015, 19 economists including Steve Keen, David Graeber, Ann Pettifor, Robert Skidelsky, and Guy Standing have signed a letter to the Financial Times calling on the European Central Bank to adopt a more direct approach to its quantitative easing plan announced earlier in February.[137]\\r\\nIn November 2015, more than 65 economists supported the campaign 'Quantitative Easing for People',[138] claiming that \\"Instead of flooding financial markets, money created through QE should be spent into the real economy, on essential public investment such as green infrastructure, affordable housing and/or distributed as a citizens dividend to all residents.\\"\\r\\nThose ideas were also discussed at the European Parliament on 17 February 2016.[139][140]\\r\\nA variant of QE for the people is People's Quantitative Easing, a policy proposed by Jeremy Corbyn during the 2015 Labour leadership election, which would require the Bank of England to create money to finance government investment via a National Investment Bank.[141]\\r\\nBased on research by economist Eric Swanson reassessing the effectiveness of the US Federal Open Market Committee action in 1961 known as Operation Twist, The Economist has posted that a similar restructuring of the supply of different types of debt would have an effect equal to that of QE.[142] Such action would allow finance ministries (e.g., the US Department of the Treasury) a role in the process now reserved for central banks.[142]","input":"When did the federal reserve start quantitative easing?"},{"output":"dated 17,500-18,000 years ago","context":"The bow and arrow is a ranged weapon system consisting of an elastic launching device (bow) and long-shafted projectiles (arrows).\\r\\n\\r\\nArchery is the art, practice or skill of using bows to shoot arrows.[1] A person who shoots arrows with a bow is called a bowman or an archer.

An arrow is a projectile with a pointed tip and a long shaft with stabilizer fins (fletching) towards the back, with a narrow notch (nock) at the very end to contact the bowstring.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo load an arrow for shooting (nocking an arrow), the archer places an arrow across the middle of the bow with the bowstring in the arrow's nock. To shoot, the archer pulls back (draws) the arrow, which also pulls the bowstring and flexes the bow limbs, storing elastic energy. Typically, the archer sights along the arrow to aim it. Finally the archer releases (looses) the arrow, allowing the limbs' stored potential energy to convert into kinetic energy, which is transmitted via the bowstring to the arrow, propelling it to fly forward with high velocity.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA container or bag for additional arrows for quick reloading is called a quiver.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen not in use, bows are generally kept unstrung, meaning one or both ends of the bowstring are detached from the bow. This removes all residual tension on the bow, and can help prevent it from losing strength or elasticity over time. For many bow designs, this also lets it straighten out more completely, reducing the space needed to store the bow. Returning the bowstring to its ready-to-use position is called stringing the bow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bow and arrow appears around the transition from the Upper Paleolithic to the Mesolithic.\\r\\nAfter the end of the last glacial period, use of the bow seems to have spread to every inhabited region, except for Australasia and most of Oceania.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest definite remains of bow and arrow are from Europe. Possible fragments from Germany were found at Mannheim-Vogelstang dated 17,500-18,000 years ago, and at Stellmoor dated 11,000 years ago. Azilian points found in Grotte du Bichon, Switzerland, alongside the remains of both a bear and a hunter, with flint fragments found in the bear's third vertebra, suggest the use of arrows at 13,500 years ago.[7]\\r\\nAt the site of Nataruk in Turkana County, Kenya, obsidian bladelets found embedded in a skull and within the thoracic cavity of another skeleton, suggest the use of stone-tipped arrows as weapons about 10,000 years ago.[8] Microliths discovered on the south coast of Africa suggest that projectile weapons of some sort may be at least 71,000 years old.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest extant bows in one piece are the elm Holmegaard bows from Denmark which were dated to 9,000 BCE. Several bows from Holmegaard, Denmark, date 8,000 years ago.[10]  High-performance wooden bows are currently made following the Holmegaard design.\\r\\nThe Stellmoor bow fragments from northern Germany were dated to about 8,000 BCE, but they were destroyed in Hamburg during the Second World War, before carbon 14 dating was available; their age is attributed by archaeological association.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bow was an important weapon for both hunting and warfare from prehistoric times until the widespread use of gunpowder in the 16th century.\\r\\nOrganised warfare with bows ended in the mid 17th century in Europe, but it persisted into the early 19th century in Eastern[clarification needed] cultures and in hunting and tribal warfare in the New World. In the Canadian Arctic bows were made until the end of the 20th century for hunting caribou, for instance at Igloolik.[12]  \\r\\nThe bow has more recently been used as a weapon of tribal warfare in some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa; an example was documented in 2009 in Kenya when Kisii people and Kalenjin people clashed, resulting in four deaths.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British upper class led a revival of archery from the late 18th century.[15]\\r\\nSir Ashton Lever, an antiquarian and collector, formed the Toxophilite Society in London in 1781, under the patronage of George, then Prince of Wales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic elements of a bow are a pair of curved elastic limbs, traditionally made from wood, joined by a riser. Both ends of the limbs are connected by a string known as the bow string.[5] By pulling the string backwards the archer exerts compressive force on the string-facing section, or belly, of the limbs as well as placing the outer section, or back, under tension. While the string is held, this stores the energy later released in putting the arrow to flight.[citation needed] The force required to hold the string stationary at full draw is often used to express the power of a bow, and is known as its draw weight, or weight.[16][17] Other things being equal, a higher draw weight means a more powerful bow, which is able to project heavier arrows at the same velocity or the same arrow at a greater velocity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe various parts of the bow can be subdivided into further sections. The topmost limb is known as the upper limb, while the bottom limb is the lower limb. At the tip of each limb is a nock, which is used to attach the bowstring to the limbs. The riser is usually divided into the grip, which is held by the archer, as well as the arrow rest and the bow window. The arrow rest is a small ledge or extension above the grip which the arrow rests upon while being aimed. The bow window is that part of the riser above the grip, which contains the arrow rest.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn bows drawn and held by hand, the maximum draw weight is determined by the strength of the archer.[17] The maximum distance the string could be displaced and thus the longest arrow that could be loosed from it, a bows draw length, is determined by the size of the archer.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nA composite bow uses a combination of materials to create the limbs, allowing the use of materials specialized for the different functions of a bow limb. The classic composite bow uses wood for lightness and dimensional stability in the core, horn to store energy in compression, and sinew for its ability to store energy in tension. Such bows, typically Asian, would often use a stiff end on the limb end, having the effect of a recurve.[19] In this type of bow, this is known by the Arabic name 'siyah'.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern construction materials for bows include laminated wood, fiberglass, metals,[21] and carbon fiber components.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn arrow usually consists of a shaft with an arrowhead attached to the front end, with fletchings and a nock at the other.[22] Modern arrows are usually made from carbon fibre, aluminum, fiberglass, and wood shafts. Carbon shafts have the advantage that they do not bend or warp, but they can often be too light weight to shoot from some bows and are expensive. Aluminum shafts are less expensive than carbon shafts, but they can bend and warp from use. Wood shafts are the least expensive option but often will not be identical in weight and size to each other and break more often than the other types of shafts.[23] Arrow sizes vary greatly across cultures and range from very short ones that require the use of special equipment to be shot to ones in use in the Amazon River jungles that are 8.5 feet (2.6 metres) long. Most modern arrows are 22 inches (56?cm) to 30 inches (76?cm) in length.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nArrows come in many types, among which are breasted, bob-tailed, barreled, clout, and target.[22] A breasted arrow is thickest at the area right behind the fletchings, and tapers towards the (nock) and head.[24] A bob-tailed arrow is thickest right behind the head, and tapers to the nock.[25] A barrelled arrow is thickest in the centre of the arrow.[26] Target arrows are those arrows used for target shooting rather than warfare or hunting, and usually have simple arrowheads.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor safety reasons, a bow should never be shot without an arrow nocked; without an arrow, the energy that is normally transferred into the projectile is instead directed back into the bow itself, which will cause damage to the bow's limbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end of the arrow that is designed to hit the target is called the arrowhead. Usually, these are separate items that are attached to the arrow shaft by either tangs or sockets. Materials used in the past for arrowheads include flint, bone, horn, or metal. Most modern arrowheads are made of steel, but wood and other traditional materials are still used occasionally. A number of different types of arrowheads are known, with the most common being bodkins, broadheads, and piles.[28] Bodkin heads are simple spikes made of metal of various shapes, designed to pierce armour.[25] A broadhead arrowhead is usually triangular or leaf-shaped and has a sharpened edge or edges. Broadheads are commonly used for hunting.[29] A pile arrowhead is a simple metal cone, either sharpened to a point or somewhat blunt, that is used mainly for target shooting. A pile head is the same diameter as the arrow shaft and is usually just fitted over the tip of the arrow.[30] Other heads are known, including the blunt head, which is flat at the end and is used for hunting small game or birds, and is designed to not pierce the target nor embed itself in trees or other objects and make recovery difficult.[25] Another type of arrowhead is a barbed head, usually used in warfare or hunting.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nBowstrings may have a nocking point marked on them, which serves to mark where the arrow is fitted to the bowstring before shooting.[31] The area around the nocking point is usually bound with thread to protect the area around the nocking point from wear by the archer's hands. This section is called the serving.[32] At one end of the bowstring a loop is formed, which is permanent. The other end of the bowstring also has a loop, but this is not permanently formed into the bowstring but is constructed by tying a knot into the string to form a loop. Traditionally this knot is known as the archer's knot, but is a form of the timber hitch. The knot can be adjusted to lengthen or shorten the bowstring. The adjustable loop is known as the \\"tail\\".[33] The string is often twisted (this being called the \\"flemish twist\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nBowstrings have been constructed of many materials throughout history, including fibres such as flax, silk, and hemp.[34] Other materials used were animal guts, animal sinews, and rawhide. Modern fibres such as Dacron or Kevlar are now used in commercial bowstring construction, as well as steel wires in some compound bows.[35] Compound bows have a mechanical system of pulley cams over which the bowstring is wound.[32] Nylon is useful only in emergency situations, as it stretches too much.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no one accepted system of classification of bows.[37] Bows may be described by various characteristics including the materials used, the length of the draw that they permit, the shape of the bow in sideways view, and the shape of the limb in cross-section.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon types of bow include:","input":"When was the bow and arrow first invented?"},{"output":"LeMat revolver","context":"American Civil War\\r\\nThe LeMat revolver was a .42 or .36 caliber cap & ball black powder revolver invented by Jean Alexandre LeMat of New Orleans, which featured an unusual secondary 20 gauge smooth-bore barrel capable of firing buckshot. It saw service with the armed forces of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War of 1861ÿ65 and the Army of the Government of National Defense during the Franco-Prussian War.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis unique sidearm was also known as the \\"Grape Shot Revolver.\\" It was developed in New Orleans in 1856 by Jean Alexander Le Mat, whose manufacturing effort was backed by P. G. T. Beauregard, who became a general in the Confederate States Army. Fewer than 100 were made by John Krider of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1859, including the first 25 prototypes. It is estimated that 2,900 were produced in Lige, Belgium and Paris, France. The European made pistols were shipped through Birmingham, England, where they were proofmarked.[1]\\r\\nApproximately 900 revolvers were shipped to the Confederate States Army and 600 to the Confederate States Navy through Bermuda to avoid the Southern Naval Blockade.[1][2]\\r\\nThe distinguishing characteristic of LeMat's revolver is that its 9-shot cylinder revolves around a separate central barrel of larger caliber than the chambers in the cylinder proper. The central barrel is smooth-bore and can function as a short-barreled shotgun (hence the name \\"Grape Shot Revolver\\") with the shooter selecting whether to fire from the cylinder or the smooth-bore barrel by flipping a lever on the end of the hammer. Flipping the lever up caused the movable striker to fall upon the primer set directly under the hammer, discharging the lower barrel, while leaving it in the standard position would fire the chambers in the cylinder, much like any other revolver.[3]\\r\\nLeMat originally chambered his pistol for .40 (or .42) caliber revolver bullets, with a .60 (20 gauge) smooth-bore barrel, and had a jointed ramrod (mounted on the right-hand side of the frame), which was used to load both barrels. Later, during the American Civil War, a lighter .35-caliber pistol with a .55 caliber (28-gauge) smooth bore barrel was produced, but as these were non-standard ammunition sizes (.36 or .44 caliber were most common for contemporary revolvers) LeMat owners had to cast their own bullets (as opposed to being issued them from general military stores). The final models of the LeMat were produced in .36 or .44 caliber in response to these criticisms, but too few of them managed to get past the Union blockade of the South during the Civil War to be of any real use.[4]\\r\\nLeMat hoped to market his adaptable revolver as a primary sidearm for dragoons and other mounted troops. He entered into a partnership with P. G. T. Beauregard (at that time a major in the U.S. Army) in April 1859 to market his handgun to the U.S. Army. Beauregard, besides being LeMat's cousin, was one of the first U.S. Army officers to resign and join the Confederacy.[3]\\r\\nWhen war broke out, LeMat received Confederate contracts for the production of five thousand revolvers, and plans were laid to manufacture the gun abroad and then import them into the Confederacy, which lacked the necessary facilities to produce the weapon locally. Confederate gun runners were able to slip shipments of the gun through the Union naval blockade and it is estimated that about 2,500 made it into Confederate service.[3]\\r\\nIn addition to General Beauregard and Colonel LeMat, LeMats revolver was used by such famous Confederate officers as Major Generals Braxton Bragg, J. E. B. Stuart, Richard H. Anderson, and Major Henry Wirz. Confederate Major General J. E. B. Stuart \\"was known to favor the LeMat revolver\\".[5] General Beauregard's personal engraved LeMat, which he carried throughout the war, is preserved at the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia.[6]\\r\\nThe LeMat revolver was manufactured from 1856 to 1865, with approximately 2,900 being produced. The first models were manufactured by John Krider of Philadelphia, with the second model (the first overseas model) being produced by Charles Frederic Girard and Son of Paris. Quality concerns prompted LeMat to consider production at the Birmingham Small Arms Company in Birmingham, England, but production was never mounted there. LeMat revolvers from France were shipped to the Confederate States forces via the United Kingdom, and all firearms landed in the UK were (and still are) required to be proofed. The LeMats which found their way through the Union blockade were stamped with British proof marks from the Birmingham Proof House, leading to the misapprehension that the pistols were actually manufactured in the UK. A handful are known to have been made illegitimately in the UK by an unknown manufacturer, believed to be the London Armoury Company, but only two examples survive to the present day and it is doubtful any of the English-made LeMats ever saw service during the U.S. Civil War.[7]\\r\\nThe original revolver, constructed of blued steel with grips of checkered walnut, was not considered to be a very accurate weapon although it was deadly at close range. Civil War cavalrymen, particularly in the South, preferred to carry several pistols, as it was faster to draw another loaded weapon than it was to try to reload a cap and ball revolver in combat.\\r\\nAfter the introduction of cartridge-firing firearms, the LeMat system appeared in pinfire, but this version is exceedingly rare. A centerfire version in 12mm Perrin or 11mm Chamelot-Delvigne, with a 24 gauge shot barrel, was made in later years in Belgium.[3] While having better sales than its pinfire relative, the centerfire LeMat also had no real commercial success due to the invention of the double-action system. With both weapons, loading was accomplished via a loading gate located at the 4 o'clock position for the cylinder, and by swinging the breech of the shot barrel up and left.[3]\\r\\nThe Pietta company of Brescia, Italy has manufactured modern reproductions of the LeMat revolver since 1985. United States distributors include Navy Arms Company, Dixie Gunworks and Cabela's. Canadian distributors include Marstar Canada, among others.[2]\\r\\nBibliography","input":"What gun does ed harris used in westworld?"},{"output":"six major functions; support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of minerals, and endocrine regulation","context":"The human skeleton is the internal framework of the body. It is composed of around 270 bones at birth ÿ this total decreases to around 206 bones by adulthood after some bones get fused together.[1] The bone mass in the skeleton reaches maximum density around age 21. The human skeleton can be divided into the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton is formed by the vertebral column, the rib cage, the skull and other associated bones. The appendicular skeleton, which is attached to the axial skeleton, is formed by the shoulder girdle, the pelvic girdle and the bones of the upper and lower limbs.\\r\\nThe human skeleton performs six major functions; support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of minerals, and endocrine regulation.\\r\\nThe human skeleton is not as sexually dimorphic as that of many other primate species, but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull, dentition, long bones, and pelvis exist. In general, female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population. The human female pelvis is also different from that of males in order to facilitate childbirth.[2] Unlike most primates, human males do not have penile bones.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe axial skeleton (80 bones) is formed by the vertebral column (32ÿ34 bones; the number of the vertebrae differs from human to human as the lower 2 parts, sacral and coccygeal bone may vary in length), a part of the rib cage (12 pairs of ribs and the sternum), and the skull (22 bones and 7 associated bones).\\r\\nThe upright posture of humans is maintained by the axial skeleton, which transmits the weight from the head, the trunk, and the upper extremities down to the lower extremities at the hip joints. The bones of the spine are supported by many ligaments. The erector spinae muscles are also supporting and are useful for balance.\\r\\nThe appendicular skeleton (126 bones) is formed by the pectoral girdles, the upper limbs, the pelvic girdle or pelvis, and the lower limbs. Their functions are to make locomotion possible and to protect the major organs of digestion, excretion and reproduction.\\r\\nThe skeleton serves six major functions: support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of minerals and endocrine regulation.\\r\\nThe skeleton provides the framework which supports the body and maintains its shape. The pelvis, associated ligaments and muscles provide a floor for the pelvic structures. Without the rib cages, costal cartilages, and intercostal muscles, the lungs would collapse.\\r\\nThe joints between bones allow movement, some allowing a wider range of movement than others, e.g. the ball and socket joint allows a greater range of movement than the pivot joint at the neck. Movement is powered by skeletal muscles, which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones. Muscles, bones, and joints provide the principal mechanics for movement, all coordinated by the nervous system.\\r\\nIt is believed that the reduction of human bone density in prehistoric times reduced the agility and dexterity of human movement. Shifting from hunting to agriculture has caused human bone density to reduce significantly.[4][5][6]\\r\\nThe skeleton helps to protect our many vital internal organs from being damaged.\\r\\nThe skeleton is the site of haematopoiesis, the development of blood cells that takes place in the bone marrow. In children, haematopoiesis occurs primarily in the marrow of the long bones such as the femur and tibia. In adults, it occurs mainly in the pelvis, cranium, vertebrae, and sternum.[7]\\r\\nThe bone matrix can store calcium and is involved in calcium metabolism, and bone marrow can store iron in ferritin and is involved in iron metabolism. However, bones are not entirely made of calcium, but a mixture of chondroitin sulfate and hydroxyapatite, the latter making up 70% of a bone. Hydroxyapatite is in turn composed of 39.8% of calcium, 41.4% of oxygen, 18.5% of phosphorus, and 0.2% of hydrogen by mass. Chondroitin sulfate is a sugar made up primarily of oxygen and carbon.\\r\\nBone cells release a hormone called osteocalcin, which contributes to the regulation of blood sugar (glucose) and fat deposition. Osteocalcin increases both the insulin secretion and sensitivity, in addition to boosting the number of insulin-producing cells and reducing stores of fat.[8]\\r\\nAnatomical differences between human males and females are highly pronounced in some soft tissue areas, but tend to be limited in the skeleton. The human skeleton is not as sexually dimorphic as that of many other primate species, but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull, dentition, long bones, and pelvis are exhibited across human populations. In general, female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population. It is not known whether or to what extent those differences are genetic or environmental.\\r\\nA variety of gross morphological traits of the human skull demonstrate sexual dimorphism, such as the median nuchal line, mastoid processes, supraorbital margin, supraorbital ridge, and the chin.[9]\\r\\nHuman inter-sex dental dimorphism centers on the canine teeth, but it is not nearly as pronounced as in the other great apes.\\r\\nLong bones are generally larger in males than in females within a given population. Muscle attachment sites on long bones are often more robust in males than in females, reflecting a difference in overall muscle mass and development between sexes. Sexual dimorphism in the long bones is commonly characterized by morphometric or gross morphological analyses.\\r\\nThe human pelvis exhibits greater sexual dimorphism than other bones, specifically in the size and shape of the pelvic cavity, ilia, greater sciatic notches, and the sub-pubic angle. The Phenice method is commonly used to determine the sex of an unidentified human skeleton by anthropologists with 96% to 100% accuracy in some populations.[10]\\r\\nWomen's pelvises are wider in the pelvic inlet and are wider throughout the pelvis to allow for child birth. The sacrum in the women's pelvis is curved inwards to allow the child to have a \\"funnel\\" to assist in the child's pathway from the uterus to the birth canal.\\r\\nThere are many classified skeletal disorders. One of the most common is osteoporosis. Also common is scoliosis, a side-to-side curve in the back or spine, often creating a pronounced \\"C\\" or \\"S\\" shape when viewed on an x-ray of the spine. This condition is most apparent during adolescence, and is most common with females.\\r\\nArthritis is a disorder of the joints. It involves inflammation of one or more joints. When affected by arthritis, the joint or joints affected may be painful to move, may move in unusual directions or may be immobile completely. The symptoms of arthritis will vary differently between types of arthritis. The most common form of arthritis: Osteoarthritis can affect both the larger and smaller joints of the human skeleton. The cartilage in the affected joints will degrade, soften and wear away. This decreases the mobility of the joints and decreases the space between bones where cartilage should be.\\r\\nOsteoporosis is a disease of bone where there is reduced bone mineral density, increasing the likelihood of fractures.[11] Osteoporosis is defined by the World Health Organization in women as a bone mineral density 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass, relative to the age and sex-matched average, as measured by Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, with the term \\"established osteoporosis\\" including the presence of a fragility fracture.[12] Osteoporosis is most common in women after menopause, when it is called \\"postmenopausal osteoporosis\\", but may develop in men and premenopausal women in the presence of particular hormonal disorders and other chronic diseases or as a result of smoking and medications, specifically glucocorticoids.[11] Osteoporosis usually has no symptoms until a fracture occurs.[11] For this reason, DEXA scans are often done in people with one or more risk factors, who have developed osteoporosis and be at risk of fracture.[11]\\r\\nOsteoporosis treatment includes advice to stop smoking, decrease alcohol consumption, exercise regularly, and have a healthy diet. Calcium supplements may also be advised, as may Vitamin D. When medication is used, it may include bisphosphonates, Strontium ranelate, and osteoporosis may be one factor considered when commencing Hormone replacement therapy.[11]\\r\\nThe study of human bones probably started in ancient Greece under Ptolemaic kings due to their link to Egypt. Herophilos, through his work by studying dissected human corpses in Alexandria is credited to be the pioneer of the field. His works are lost but are often cited by notable persons in the field such as Galen and Rufus of Ephesus. Galen himself did little dissection though and relied on the work of others like Marinus of Alexandria,[13] as well as his own observations of gladiator cadavers and animals.[14] According to Katherine Park, in medieval Europe dissection continued to be practiced, contrary to the popular understanding that such practices are taboo and thus completely banned.[15] The practice of holy autopsy, such as in the case of Clare of Montefalco further supports the claim.[16] Alexandria continued as a center of anatomy under Islamic rule, with Ibn Zuhr a notable figure. Chinese understandings are divergent, as the closest corresponding concept in the medicinal system seem to be the meridians, although given that Hua Tuo regularly performs surgery, there must be some distance between medical theory and actual understanding.\\r\\nLeonardo Da Vinci, among his many talents also contributed to the study of the skeleton, albeit unpublished in his time.[17] Many artists, Antonio Pollaiuolo being the first, performed dissections for better understanding of the body, although they concentrated mostly on the muscles.[18] Vesalius, regarded as the founder of modern anatomy authored the book De humani corporis fabrica, which contained many illustrations of the skeleton and other body parts, correcting some theories dating from Galen, such as the lower jaw being a single bone instead of two.[19] Various other figures like Alessandro Achillini also contributed to the further understanding of the skeleton.","input":"What is the function of the skelital system?"},{"output":"Native American allies under the Shawnee leader, Tecumseh","context":"Coordinates: 421949N 830255W? / ?42.33015N 83.04874W? / 42.33015; -83.04874\\r\\nThe Siege of Detroit, also known as the Surrender of Detroit, or the Battle of Fort Detroit, was an early engagement in the British-U.S. War of 1812. A British force under Major General Isaac Brock with Native American allies under the Shawnee leader, Tecumseh, used bluff and deception to intimidate the U.S. Brigadier General William Hull into surrendering the fort and town of Detroit, Michigan and his dispirited army, which actually outnumbered the victorious British and Native Americans.\\r\\nThe British victory reinvigorated the militia and civil authorities of Upper Canada, who had previously been pessimistic and affected by pro-U.S. agitators. Many Native American people in the Northwest Territory were inspired to take arms against U.S. outposts and settlers. The British held Detroit for more than a year before their small fleet on Lake Erie was defeated, which forced them to abandon the western frontier of Upper Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early months of 1812 as tension with Britain increased, many people including William Hull, Governor of the Michigan Territory, urged President of the United States James Madison and Secretary of War William Eustis to form an army which would secure the former Northwest Territory against Native Americans incited to take arms against the United States by British agents and fur trading companies. In particular it was urgently necessary to reinforce the outpost of Detroit, which had a population of 800 but a peacetime garrison of only 120 soldiers.[3] It was also suggested that this army might invade the western districts of Upper Canada, where support might be expected from the many recent immigrants from the United States who had been attracted by generous land grants.[4]\\r\\nMadison and Eustis concurred with this plan. Madison offered command of the army to Hull, an ageing veteran of the American Revolutionary War. Hull was initially reluctant to take the appointment, but no other officer with his prestige and experience was immediately available. After repeated pleas from Madison, Hull finally accepted, and was commissioned as a Brigadier General in the United States Army.[5]\\r\\nHull's army consisted initially of three regiments of Ohio militia under Colonels Lewis Cass, Duncan McArthur and James Findlay. When Hull took command of them at Dayton on 25 May, he found that they were badly equipped and ill-disciplined, and no arrangements had been made to supply them on the march. He made hasty efforts to remedy the deficiencies in equipment. Joined by the 4th U.S. Infantry under Lieutenant Colonel James Miller, the army marched north from Urbana on 10 June. On instructions from Eustis, Hull ignored an earlier route established by Anthony Wayne, and created a new route to Detroit across the Black Swamp area of northwest Ohio.[6] On 26 June, he received a letter from Eustis, dated 18 June, warning him that war was imminent and urging that he should make for Detroit \\"with all possible expedition\\".[7] Hull accordingly hastened his march. To lighten the load on his draught horses, worn out by the arduous march, he put his entrenching tools, medical supplies, officers' baggage and despatches, with some sick men and the army's band, aboard the packet vessel Cayahoga at the foot of the Maumee River, to be transported across Lake Erie.\\r\\nEustis had sent his first letter of 18 June by special messenger. Congress had passed the declaration of war later that day but Eustis sent a second letter to Hull with this vital information only by ordinary mail.[8] On 28 June, the postmaster at Cleveland, Ohio hired an express rider to rush the letter to Hull but even this arrived only on 2 July. The British ambassador in Washington had sent the news of the American declaration of war urgently to Britain and Canada and the military commanders in Canada had in turn hastened to inform all their outposts of the state of war. On 2 July, the unsuspecting Cayahoga was captured by a Canadian-manned armed brig of the Provincial Marine, General Hunter, near the British post at Amherstburg at the foot of the Detroit River.[7]\\r\\nHull reached Detroit on 5 July. Here he was reinforced by detachments of Michigan militia, including the 140 men of the Michigan Legionary Corps which Hull had established in 1805. The American army was short of supplies, especially food, as Detroit provided only soap and whiskey.[8] Nevertheless, Eustis urged Hull to attack Amherstburg. The fort there was defended by 300 British regulars, mainly from the 41st Regiment of Foot, 400 Native Americans, and some militia.[9] The post's commander was Colonel St. George, who was later superseded by Colonel Henry Procter of the 41st. Although Hull was not enthusiastic, writing to Eustis that \\"The British command the water and the savages\\",[10] his army crossed into Canada on 12 July. He issued several proclamations which were intended to induce Canadians to join or support his army. Some of his mounted troops raided up the Thames as far as Moraviantown. Although these moves discouraged many of the militia from opposing Hull's invasion, few of the inhabitants of the region, even those who had recently moved from the United States, actively aided Hull.\\r\\nAfter some indecisive skirmishes with British outposts along the Canard River, Hull decided he could not attack the British fort without artillery, which could not be brought forward because the carriages had decayed and needed repair, and he fell back.[11] Several of Hull's officers disagreed with this retreat and secretly discussed removing him from command. Hull had been quarreling with his militia Colonels since taking over the army, and he felt that he did not have their support, whether in the field or in the frequent councils of war he called.\\r\\nOn 17 July, a mixed force of British regulars, Canadian fur traders and Native Americans captured the important trading post of Mackinac Island on Lake Huron from its small American garrison who, like Hull earlier, were not aware that war had broken out. While many of the Natives who had taken part in the attack either remained at Mackinac or returned to their homes, at least one hundred Sioux, Menominee and Winnebago warriors began moving south from Mackinac to join those already at Amherstburg, while the news induced the previously neutral Wyandots living near Detroit to become increasingly hostile to the Americans. Hull learned of the capture of Mackinac on 3 August, when the paroled American garrison reached Detroit by schooner.[12] Fearing that this had \\"opened the northern hive of Indians\\",[13] Hull abandoned all the Canadian territory he held.\\r\\nHull's supply lines ran for 60 miles (97?km) along the Detroit River and the shore of Lake Erie, which was dominated by the British armed vessels, and were vulnerable to British and Native American raiders. On 4 August, at the Battle of Brownstown, a party under Tecumseh ambushed and routed an American detachment under Major van Horne, capturing more of Hull's despatches. Hull sent a larger party under James Miller to clear his lines of communication, and escort a supply convoy of 300 head of cattle and 70 pack horses loaded with flour, which was waiting at Frenchtown under Major Brush.[14] On 9 August, at the Battle of Maguaga, Miller forced a British and Native force under Major Adam Muir of the 41st Regiment to retreat some distance, but when the British re-formed their line, he declined to resume the attack. Miller, who was ill and whose losses in the engagement were heavier than those of the enemy, seemed to completely lose confidence and remained encamped near the battlefield until Hull ordered him to return to Detroit.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Major General Isaac Brock, the British commander in Upper Canada, was in York, the provincial capital, dealing with the unwilling Assembly and mobilising the province's militia. Although he had only a single regiment of regulars and some small detachments of veterans and artillery to support the militia, he was already aware that there was no immediate threat from the disorganised and badly-supplied American forces on the Niagara River, or from the lethargic American commander in chief, Major General Henry Dearborn, at Albany in Upper New York State. Only Hull's army was occupying or threatening Canadian territory. Late in July, Brock learned of the capture of Mackinac. He was also informed by Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, the Governor General of Canada, that an additional regiment he had asked for was being dispatched to Upper Canada, although as piecemeal detachments. Brock dispatched 50 of his small force of regulars and 250 volunteers from the militia westward from York to reinforce Amherstburg. On 5 August, he prorogued the Assembly and set out himself after them. He and his force sailed from Port Dover in batteaux and open boats and reached Amherstburg on 13 August,[15] at the same time as 200 additional Native American warriors (100 \\"Western Indians\\" from Mackinac and 100 Wyandots) who joined Tecumseh.\\r\\nAt Amherstburg, Brock immediately learned from Hull's captured despatches that the morale of Hull and his army was low, that they feared the numbers of Natives which might be facing them, and that they were short of supplies. Brock also quickly established a rapport with Tecumseh, ensuring that the Natives would cooperate with his moves. Brock and Tecumseh met for the first and only time shortly after Brock arrived at Amherstburg. Legend has it that Tecumseh turned to his warriors and said, \\"Here is a man!\\" Brock certainly wrote shortly afterwards, \\"... a more sagacious and a more gallant Warrior does not I believe exist.\\"[16]\\r\\nAgainst the advice of most of his subordinates, Brock determined on an immediate attack on Detroit. The British had already played on Hull's fear of the Natives by arranging for a misleading letter to fall into American hands. The letter asked that no more Natives be allowed to proceed from Fort Mackinac as there were already no less than 5,000 at Amherstburg and supplies were running short. Brock sent a demand for surrender to Hull, stating:\\r\\nThe force at my disposal authorizes me to require of you the immediate surrender of Fort Detroit. It is far from my intention to join in a war of extermination, but you must be aware, that the numerous body of Indians who have attached themselves to my troops, will be beyond control the moment the contest commences\\r\\n[citation needed]\\r\\nTo deceive the Americans into believing there were more British troops than there actually were, Brock's force carried out several bluffs. At the suggestion of Major Thomas Evans, the Brigade Major at Fort George, Brock gave his militia the cast-off uniforms of the 41st Regiment to make Hull believe most of the British force were regulars.[17] The troops were told to light individual fires instead of one fire per unit, thereby creating the illusion of a much larger army. They marched to take up positions in plain sight of the Americans then quickly ducked behind entrenchments, and marched back out of sight to repeat the manoeuvre. The same trick was carried out during meals, where the line would dump their beans into a hidden pot, then return out of view to rejoin the end of the queue.\\r\\nOn 15 August, gunners of the Provincial Marine set up a battery of one 18-pounder and two 12-pounder guns and two mortars on the Canadian shore of the Detroit River and began bombarding Fort Detroit, joined by two armed vessels (General Hunter and the 20-gun sloop-of-war Queen Charlotte in the river. In the early hours of the morning of 16 August, Tecumseh's warriors crossed the river about 5 miles (8.0?km) south of Detroit.[18] They were followed after daybreak by Brock's force, divided into three small \\"brigades\\". The first was composed of 50 men of the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles and some Lincoln and Kent militia; the second consisted of 50 men of the 41st Regiment with York, Lincoln, Oxford and Norfolk militia; the third was formed from the main body of the 41st (200 men) and 50 men of the Royal Artillery with five field guns (three 6-pounders and two 3-pounders).[2]\\r\\nBrock originally intended to occupy a fortified position astride Hull's supply line and wait for starvation and bombardment to force the Americans to surrender or come out to fight, but he then learned that on the previous day, Hull had sent a detachment of 400 men under Colonels Cass and McArthur to escort Brush's convoy to Detroit via a backwoods trail some distance from the lake and river,[19] and this detachment was only a few miles from the British rear. (Hull had sent messengers recalling this force the night before, but Cass and MacArthur had already encamped for the night and declined to move.) To avoid being caught between two fires, Brock advanced immediately against the rear of Fort Detroit, the side furthest from the river where the defences were weakest.[18] Tecumseh's warriors meanwhile paraded several times past a gap in the forests where the Americans could see them, while making loud war cries. One account claims that Tecumseh was behind the idea of displaying trumped-up troop levels. A Canadian officer (militia cavalry leader William Hamilton Merritt) noted that \\"Tecumseh extended his men, and marched them three times through an opening in the woods at the rear of the fort in full view of the garrison, which induced them to believe there were at least two or three thousand Indians.\\"[20] Because Merritt was not an eyewitness, his version has been disputed.\\r\\nAs the British prepared to attack, a shell exploded in the officers' mess inside the fort, causing casualties. Hull despaired of holding out against a force which seemingly consisted of thousands of British regulars and, hearing the Native war cries, began to fear a slaughter. Women and children, including his own daughter and grandchild, still resided within the fort. Against the advice of his subordinates, Hull hoisted a white flag of surrender. He sent messengers to Brock asking for three days to agree on terms of surrender. Brock replied he would allow him three hours. Hull surrendered his entire force, including Cass's and McArthur's detachment and Major Brush's supply convoy. There were rumours that General Hull had been drinking heavily prior to the surrender. He is reported to have said the Natives were \\"numerous beyond example,\\" and \\"more greedy of violence than the Vikings or Huns.\\"[21]\\r\\nBefore the surrender, the British bombardment had killed two American officers (including Lieutenant Porter Hanks, the former commander of Fort Mackinac, who was awaiting a court martial), and five other ranks. The answering fire from the guns of Fort Detroit wounded two British gunners.\\r\\nAfter Hull surrendered, the 1,600 Ohio militia from his army were paroled and were escorted south until they were out of danger of attack from the natives. Most of the Michigan militia had already deserted. The 582 American regulars were sent as prisoners to Quebec City.\\r\\nAmong the booty and military stores surrendered were 33 cannon,[22] 300 rifles, 2,500 muskets and the only armed American vessel on the Upper Lakes, the brig Adams. Surrendered and taken into British service, it was briefly recaptured two months later near Fort Erie but an intense US and British artillery barrage ensued, causing a fire that ultimately destroyed the battered hulk.\\r\\nThe news of the surrender of Hull's army was startling on both sides of the border. On the American side, many Natives took up arms and attacked American settlements and isolated military outposts.[23] In Upper Canada, the population and militia were encouraged, particularly in the Western districts where they had been threatened by Hull's army. Brock overlooked the local militia's former reluctance to perform their duty, instead rewarding those militiamen who had remained at their posts. More materially, the 2,500 muskets captured from Hull were distributed among the hitherto ill-equipped militia.\\r\\nThe British gained an important post on American territory and won control over Michigan Territory and the Detroit region for most of the following year. Brock was hailed as a hero, and Tecumseh's influence over the confederation of Natives was strengthened. Brock next intended to mount a pre-emptive attack into New York State to forestall an American attack across the Niagara River. He was thwarted by an armistice arranged by Sir George Prevost. When this ended, the Americans attacked in October near Queenston. At the ensuing Battle of Queenston Heights, Brock was killed leading a hasty counter-attack to recover a battery which had been captured by the Americans. Under Brock's successor, Major General Roger Hale Sheaffe, the British drove the Americans from their positions on the heights, and captured several hundred American soldiers. Nevertheless, the loss of Brock is generally reckoned to have been a severe blow to the British.\\r\\nA third American invasion of Canada took place in November, north of Lake Champlain. After the Americans accidentally fired on each other in the dark, they gave up and retreated after a brief engagement at Lacolle Mills. \\"The whole Canadian campaign had produced nothing but 'disaster, defeat, disgrace, and ruin and death'\\" the Green-Mountain Farmer, a Vermont newspaper, reported in January 1813.\\r\\nGeneral Hull was tried by court martial and was sentenced to death for his conduct at Detroit, but the sentence was commuted by President Madison to dismissal from the Army, in recognition of his honourable service in the American Revolution.\\r\\nAmerican attempts to regain Detroit were continually thwarted by poor communications and the difficulties of maintaining militia contingents in the field, until the Americans won a naval victory at the Battle of Lake Erie on 10 September 1813. This isolated the British at Amherstburg and Detroit from their supplies and forced them to retreat. Hull's successor, Major General William Henry Harrison, pursued the retreating British and their Native allies and defeated them at the Battle of the Thames, where Tecumseh was killed.\\r\\nThe British 41st Regiment, which subsequently became the Welch Regiment, was awarded the battle honour \\"Detroit\\", one of the few to be awarded to British regiments for the War of 1812. The captured colours of the 4th U.S. Infantry are currently in the Welch Regiment Museum at Cardiff Castle.[24]\\r\\nA patriotic song \\"The Bold Canadian\\" was written by a private on the campaign to commemorate the conquering of Detroit in Michigan Territory.[25]\\r\\nSix currently active regular battalions of the United States Army (5-3 FA, 1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf, 4-3 Inf, 1-5 Inf and 2-5 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of several American units (Freeman's Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery, and the old 1st, 4th and 19th Infantry Regiments) that participated in Hull's initial invasion of Canada and his subsequent surrender of Detroit.\\r\\nSix infantry/armoured regiments of the Canadian Army carry the battle honour Detroit to commemorate the service of ancestor units in the campaign. They are: the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, the Queen's York Rangers, the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry, the Essex and Kent Scottish Regiment the Lincoln and Welland Regiment, and The Lorne Scots. The 56th Field Artillery Regiment, RCA is also recognized for its links to the battle. In 2012, the Royal Canadian Mint released a 25S coin depicting Tecumseh to mark the War of 1812's bicentennial.","input":"Who won the battle of fort. detroit?"},{"output":"Protestant moral reformers","context":"The birth control movement in the United States was a social reform campaign from 1914 to around 1945 that aimed to increase the availability of contraception in the U.S. through education and legalization. The movement began in 1914 when a group of political radicals in New York City, led by Emma Goldman, Mary Dennett, and Margaret Sanger, became concerned about the hardships that childbirth and self-induced abortions brought to low-income women. Sanger, in particular, simultaneously sought to connect birth control to the organized eugenics movement, regularly appealing to the authority of eugenic scientists Karl Pearson, Charles Davenport, and others in her Birth Control Review from the early 1920s [1] Such figures sought to prevent population segments they deemed genetically 'undesirable' from reproducing. While seeking legitimacy for the birth control movement partly through the approval of organized eugenics, Sanger and other activists also worked on the political front. Since contraception was considered to be obscene at the time, the activists targeted the Comstock laws, which prohibited distribution of any \\"obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious\\" materials through the mail. Hoping to provoke a favorable legal decision, Sanger deliberately broke the law by distributing The Woman Rebel, a newsletter containing a discussion of contraception. In 1916, Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, but the clinic was immediately shut down by police, and Sanger was sentenced to 30 days in jail.\\r\\nA major turning point for the movement came during World War I, when many U.S. servicemen were diagnosed with venereal diseases. The government's response included an anti-venereal disease campaign that framed sexual intercourse and contraception as issues of public health and legitimate topics of scientific research. This was the first time a U.S. government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters; as a consequence, contraception transformed from an issue of morals to an issue of public health.\\r\\nEncouraged by the public's changing attitudes towards birth control, Sanger opened a second birth control clinic in 1923, but this time there were no arrests or controversy. Throughout the 1920s, public discussion of contraception became more commonplace, and the term \\"birth control\\" became firmly established in the nation's vernacular. The widespread availability of contraception signaled a transition from the stricter sexual mores of the Victorian era to a more sexually permissive society.\\r\\nLegal victories in the 1930s continued to weaken anti-contraception laws. The court victories motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to adopt contraception as a core component of medical school curricula, but the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources. In 1942, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America was formed, creating a nationwide network of birth control clinics. After World War II, the movement to legalize birth control came to a gradual conclusion, as birth control was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the remaining anti-contraception laws were no longer enforced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe practice of birth control was common throughout the U.S. prior to 1914, when the movement to legalize contraception began. Longstanding techniques included the rhythm method, withdrawal, diaphragms, contraceptive sponges, condoms, prolonged breastfeeding, and spermicides.[2] Use of contraceptives increased throughout the nineteenth century, contributing to a 50 percent drop in the fertility rate in the United States between 1800 and 1900, particularly in urban regions.[3] The only known survey conducted during the nineteenth century of American women's contraceptive habits was performed by Clelia Mosher from 1892 to 1912.[4] The survey was based on a small sample of upper-class women, and shows that most of the women used contraception (primarily douching, but also withdrawal, rhythm, condoms and pessaries) and that they viewed sex as a pleasurable act that could be undertaken without the goal of procreation.[5]\\r\\nAlthough contraceptives were relatively common in middle-class and upper-class society, the topic was rarely discussed in public.[6] The first book published in the United States which ventured to discuss contraception was Moral Physiology; or, A Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question, published by Robert Dale Owen in 1831.[7] The book suggested that family planning was a laudable effort, and that sexual gratification?ÿ without the goal of reproduction?ÿ was not immoral.[8] Owen recommended withdrawal, but he also discussed sponges and condoms.[9] That book was followed by Fruits of Philosophy: The Private Companion of Young Married People, written in 1832 by Charles Knowlton, which recommended douching.[10] Knowlton was prosecuted in Massachusetts on obscenity charges, and served three months in prison.[11]\\r\\nBirth control practices were generally adopted earlier in Europe than in the United States. Knowlton's book was reprinted in 1877 in England by Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant, with the goal of challenging Britain's obscenity laws.[12] They were arrested (and later acquitted) but the publicity of their trial contributed to the formation, in 1877, of the Malthusian League?ÿ the world's first birth control advocacy group?ÿ which sought to limit population growth to avoid Thomas Malthus's dire predictions of exponential population growth leading to worldwide poverty and famine.[13] By 1930, similar societies had been established in nearly all European countries, and birth control began to find acceptance in most Western European countries, except Catholic Ireland, Spain, and France.[14] As the birth control societies spread across Europe, so did birth control clinics. The first birth control clinic in the world was established in the Netherlands in 1882, run by the Netherlands' first female physician, Aletta Jacobs.[15] The first birth control clinic in England was established in 1921 by Marie Stopes, in London.[16]\\r\\nContraception was legal in the United States throughout most of the 19th century, but in the 1870s a social purity movement grew in strength, aimed at outlawing vice in general, and prostitution and obscenity in particular.[17] Composed primarily of Protestant moral reformers and middle-class women, the Victorian-era campaign also attacked contraception, which was viewed as an immoral practice that promoted prostitution and venereal disease.[18] Anthony Comstock, a postal inspector and leader in the purity movement, successfully lobbied for the passage of the 1873 Comstock Act, a federal law prohibiting mailing of \\"any article or thing designed or intended for the prevention of conception or procuring of abortion\\" as well as any form of contraceptive information.[19] Many states also passed similar state laws (collectively known as the Comstock laws), sometimes extending the federal law by outlawing the use of contraceptives, as well as their distribution. Comstock was proud of the fact that he was personally responsible for thousands of arrests and the destruction of hundreds of tons of books and pamphlets.[20]\\r\\nComstock and his allies also took aim at the libertarians and utopians who comprised the free love movement?ÿ an initiative to promote sexual freedom, equality for women, and abolition of marriage.[21] The free love proponents were the only group to actively oppose the Comstock laws in the 19th century, setting the stage for the birth control movement.[22]\\r\\nThe efforts of the free love movement were not successful and, at the beginning of the 20th century, federal and state governments began to enforce the Comstock laws more rigorously.[22] In response, contraception went underground, but it was not extinguished. The number of publications on the topic dwindled, and advertisements, if they were found at all, used euphemisms such as \\"marital aids\\" or \\"hygienic devices\\". Drug stores continued to sell condoms as \\"rubber goods\\" and cervical caps as \\"womb supporters\\".[23]\\r\\nAt the turn of the century, an energetic movement arose, centered in Greenwich Village, that sought to overturn bans on free speech.[24] Supported by radicals, feminists, anarchists, and atheists such as Ezra Heywood, Moses Harman, D. M. Bennett, and Emma Goldman, these activists regularly battled anti-obscenity laws and, later, the government's effort to suppress speech critical of involvement in World War I.[25] Prior to 1914, the free speech movement focused on politics, and rarely addressed contraception.[26]\\r\\nGoldman's circle of radicals, socialists, and bohemians was joined in 1912 by a nurse, Margaret Sanger, whose mother had been through 18 pregnancies in 22 years, and died at age 50 of tuberculosis and cervical cancer.[27] In 1913, Sanger worked in New York's Lower East Side, often with poor women who were suffering due to frequent childbirth and self-induced abortions.[28] After one particularly tragic medical case, Sanger wrote: \\"I threw my nursing bag in the corner and announced?... that I would never take another case until I had made it possible for working women in America to have the knowledge to control birth.\\"[29] Sanger visited public libraries, searching for information on contraception, but nothing was available.[30] She became outraged that working-class women could not obtain contraception, yet upper-class women who had access to private physicians could.[31]\\r\\nUnder the influence of Goldman and the Free Speech League, Sanger became determined to challenge the Comstock laws that outlawed the dissemination of contraceptive information.[32] With that goal in mind, in 1914 she launched The Woman Rebel, an eight-page monthly newsletter which promoted contraception using the slogan \\"No Gods, No Masters\\",[33] and proclaimed that each woman should be \\"the absolute mistress of her own body.\\"[34] Sanger coined the term birth control, which first appeared in the pages of Rebel, as a more candid alternative to euphemisms such as family limitation.[35]\\r\\nSanger's goal of challenging the law was fulfilled when she was indicted in August 1914, but the prosecutors focused their attention on articles Sanger had written on assassination and marriage, rather than contraception.[36] Afraid that she might be sent to prison without an opportunity to argue for birth control in court, she fled to England to escape arrest.[37]\\r\\nWhile Sanger was in Europe, her husband continued her work, which led to his arrest after he distributed a copy of a birth control pamphlet to an undercover postal worker.[38] The arrest and his 30-day jail sentence prompted several mainstream publications, including Harper's Weekly and the New-York Tribune, to publish articles about the birth control controversy.[39] Emma Goldman and Ben Reitman toured the country, speaking in support of the Sangers, and distributing copies of Sanger's pamphlet Family Limitation.[40] Sanger's exile and her husband's arrest propelled the birth control movement into the forefront of American news.[41]\\r\\nIn the spring of 1915 supporters of the Sangers?ÿ led by Mary Dennett?ÿ formed the National Birth Control League (NBCL), which was the first American birth control organization.[42] Throughout 1915, smaller regional organizations were formed in San Francisco, Portland, Oregon, Seattle, and Los Angeles.[43]\\r\\nSanger returned to the United States in October 1915. She planned to open a birth control clinic modeled on the world's first such clinic, which she had visited in Amsterdam. She first had to fight the charges outstanding against her.[44] Noted attorney Clarence Darrow offered to defend Sanger free of charge but, bowing to public pressure, the government dropped the charges early in 1916.[45] No longer under the threat of jail, Sanger embarked on a successful cross-country speaking tour, which catapulted her into the leadership of the U.S. birth control movement.[46] Other leading figures, such as William J. Robinson and Mary Dennett, chose to work in the background, or turned their attention to other causes.[46] Later in 1916, Sanger traveled to Boston to lend her support to the Massachusetts Birth Control League and to jailed birth control activist Van Kleeck Allison.[47]\\r\\nDuring Sanger's 1916 speaking tour, she promoted birth control clinics based on the Dutch model she had observed during her 1914 trip to Europe. Although she inspired many local communities to create birth control leagues, no clinics were established.[48] Sanger therefore resolved to create a birth control clinic in New York that would provide free contraceptive services to women.[49] New York state law prohibited the distribution of contraceptives or even contraceptive information, but Sanger hoped to exploit a provision in the law which permitted doctors to prescribe contraceptives for the prevention of disease.[50] On October 16, 1916, she, partnering with Fania Mindell and Ethel Byrne, opened the Brownsville clinic in Brooklyn. The clinic was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day.[51] A few days after opening, an undercover policewoman purchased a cervical cap at the clinic, and Sanger was arrested. Refusing to walk, Sanger and a co-worker were dragged out of the clinic by police officers.[52] The clinic was shut down, and it was not until 1923 that another birth control clinic was opened in the United States.[53]\\r\\nSanger's trial began in January 1917. She was supported by a large number of wealthy and influential women who came together to form the Committee of One Hundred, which was devoted to raising funds for Sanger and the NBCL.[54] The committee also started publishing the monthly journal Birth Control Review, and established a network of connections to powerful politicians, activists, and press figures.[55] Despite the strong support, Sanger was convicted; the judge offered a lenient sentence if she promised not to break the law again, but Sanger replied \\"I cannot respect the law as it exists today.\\"[56] She served a sentence of 30 days in jail.[56]\\r\\nIn protest to her arrest as well, Byrne was sentenced to 30 days in jail at Blackwells Island Prison and responded to her situation with a hunger strike protest. With no signs of ending her demonstration anytime soon, Byrne was force fed by prison guards. Weakened and ill, Byrne refused to end her hunger strike at the cost of securing early release from prison. However, Sanger accepted the plea bargain on her sisters behalf, agreeing that Byrne would be released early from prison if she ended her birth control activism. Horrified, Byrnes relationship quickly eroded with her sister and, both forcefully and willingly, she left the birth control movement. Due to the drama of Byrnes demonstration, the birth control movement became a headline news story in which the organizations purpose was distributed across the country.[57]\\r\\nOther activists were also pushing for progress. Emma Goldman was arrested in 1916 for circulating birth control information,[58] and Abraham Jacobi unsuccessfully tried to persuade the New York medical community to push for a change in law to permit physicians to dispense contraceptive information.[59]\\r\\nThe publicity from Sanger's trial and Byrne's hunger strike generated immense enthusiasm for the cause, and by the end of 1917 there were over 30 birth control organizations in the United States.[61] Sanger was always astute about public relations, and she seized on the publicity of the trial to advance her causes.[62] After her trial, she emerged as the movement's most visible leader.[63] Other leaders, such as William J. Robinson, Mary Dennett, and Blanche Ames Ames, could not match Sanger's charisma, charm and fervor.[64]\\r\\nThe movement was evolving from radical, working-class roots into a campaign backed by society women and liberal professionals.[65] Sanger and her fellow advocates began to tone down their radical rhetoric and instead emphasized the socioeconomic benefits of birth control, a policy which led to increasing acceptance by mainstream Americans.[66] Media coverage increased, and several silent motion pictures produced in the 1910s featured birth control as a theme (including Birth Control, produced by Sanger and starring herself).[67]\\r\\nOpposition to birth control remained strong: state legislatures refused to legalize contraception or the distribution of contraceptive information;[68] religious leaders spoke out, attacking women who would choose \\"ease and fashion\\" over motherhood;[69] and eugenicists were worried that birth control would exacerbate the birth rate differential between \\"old stock\\" white Americans and \\"coloreds\\" or immigrants.[70]\\r\\nSanger formed the New York Woman's Publishing Company (NYWPC) in 1918 and, under its auspices, became the publisher for the Birth Control Review.[71] British suffragette activist Kitty Marion, standing on New York street corners, sold the Review at 20 cents per copy, enduring death threats, heckling, spitting, physical abuse, and police harassment. Over the course of the following ten years, Marion was arrested nine times for her birth control advocacy.[72]\\r\\nSanger appealed her 1917 conviction and won a mixed victory in 1918 in a unanimous decision by the New York Court of Appeals written by Judge Frederick E. Crane. The court's opinion upheld her conviction, but indicated that the courts would be willing to permit contraception if prescribed by doctors.[73] This decision was only applicable within New York, where it opened the door for birth control clinics, under physician supervision, to be established.[74] Sanger herself did not immediately take advantage of the opportunity, wrongly expecting that the medical profession would lead the way; instead she focused on writing and lecturing.[75]\\r\\nThe birth control movement received an unexpected boost during World War I, as a result of a crisis the U.S. military experienced when many of its soldiers were diagnosed with syphilis or gonorrhea. The military undertook an extensive education campaign, focusing on abstinence, but also offering some contraceptive guidance.[76] The military, under pressure from purity advocates, did not distribute condoms, or even endorse their use, making the U.S. the only military force in World War I that did not supply condoms to its troops. When U.S. soldiers were in Europe, they found rubber condoms readily available, and when they returned to America, they continued to use condoms as their preferred method of birth control.[77]\\r\\nThe military's anti-venereal disease campaign marked a major turning point for the movement: it was the first time a government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters.[78] The government's public discourse changed sex from a secret topic into a legitimate topic of scientific research, and it transformed contraception from an issue of morals to an issue of public health.[79]\\r\\nIn 1917, advocate Emma Goldman was arrested for protesting World War 1 and American military conscription. Goldmans commitment to free speech on topics such as socialism, anarchism, birth control, labor/union rights, and free love eventually cost her American citizenship and the right to live in the United States. Due to her commitment to socialist welfare and anti-capitalism, Goldman was associated with communism which led to her expulsion from the country during the First Red Scare.[80] While World War 1 led to a breakthrough on American acceptance of birth control relating to public health, anti-communist WW1 propaganda sacrificed one of the birth control movement's most dedicated members.\\r\\nWhile an important birth control activist and leader, Mary Dennett advocated for a wide variety of organizations. Starting as a field secretary for the Massachusetts Womens Suffrage Association, she worked her way up to win an elected seat as a corresponding secretary for the National American Womens Suffrage Association. Dennett headed the literary department, undertaking assignments such as distributing pamphlets and leaflets. Following disillusionment with the NAWSAs organizational structure, Dennett, as described above, helped found the National Birth Control League. The NBCL took a strong stance against militant protest strategies and instead focused attention on legislation changes at both the state and federal level.[81] During World War I, Mary Dennett focused her efforts on the peace movement, but she returned to the birth control movement in 1918.[82] She continued to lead the NBCL, and collaborated with Sanger's NYWPC. In 1919, Dennett published a widely distributed educational pamphlet, The Sex Side of Life, which treated sex as a natural and enjoyable act.[83] However, in the same year, frustrated with the NBCL's chronic lack of funding, Dennett broke away and formed the Voluntary Parenthood League (VPL).[84] Both Dennett and Sanger proposed legislative changes that would legalize birth control, but they took different approaches: Sanger endorsed contraception but only under a physician's supervision; Dennett pushed for unrestricted access to contraception.[85] Sanger, a proponent of diaphragms, was concerned that unrestricted access would result in ill-fitting diaphragms and would lead to medical quackery.[86] Dennett was concerned that requiring women to get prescriptions from physicians would prevent poor women from receiving contraception, and she was concerned about a shortage of physicians trained in birth control.[85] Both legislative initiatives failed, partly because some legislators felt that fear of pregnancy was the only thing that kept women chaste.[87] In the early 1920s, Sanger's leadership position in the movement solidified because she gave frequent public lectures, and because she took steps to exclude Dennett from meetings and events.[88]\\r\\nAlthough Sanger was busy publishing the Birth Control Review during the years 1919ÿ1920, she was not formally affiliated with either of the major birth control organizations (NBCL or VPL) during that time. In 1921 she became convinced that she needed to associate with a formal body to earn the support of professional societies and the scientific community. Rather than join an existing organization, she considered creating a new one.[90] As a first step, she organized the First American Birth Control Conference, held in November 1921 in New York City. On the final night of the conference, as Sanger prepared to give a speech in the crowded Town Hall theater, police raided the meeting and arrested her for disorderly conduct. From the stage she shouted: \\"we have a right to hold [this meeting] under the Constitution?... let them club us if they want to.\\"[91] She was soon released.[91] The following day it was revealed that Patrick Joseph Hayes, the Archbishop of New York, had pressured the police to shut down the meeting.[92] The Town Hall raid was a turning point for the movement: opposition from the government and medical community faded, and the Catholic Church emerged as its most vocal opponent.[93] After the conference, Sanger and her supporters established the American Birth Control League (ABCL).[94]\\r\\nFour years after the New York Court of Appeals opened the doors for physicians to prescribe contraceptives, Sanger opened a second birth control clinic, which she staffed with physicians to make it legal under that court ruling (the first clinic had employed nurses).[95] This second clinic, the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB), opened on January 2, 1923.[96] To avoid police harassment the clinic's existence was not publicized, its primary mission was stated to be conducting scientific research, and it only provided services to married women.[97] The existence of the clinic was finally announced to the public in December 1923, but this time there were no arrests or controversy. This convinced activists that, after ten years of struggle, birth control had finally become widely accepted in the United States.[98] The CRB was the first legal birth control clinic in the United States, and quickly grew into the world's leading contraceptive research center.[98]\\r\\nFollowing the successful opening of the CRB in 1923, public discussion of contraception became more commonplace, and the term \\"birth control\\" became firmly established in the nation's vernacular.[99] Of the hundreds of references to birth control in magazines and newspapers of the 1920s, more than two-thirds were favorable.[100] The availability of contraception signaled the end of the stricter morality of the Victorian era, and ushered in the emergence of a more sexually permissive society.[100] Other factors that contributed to the new sexual norms included increased mobility brought by the automobile, anonymous urban lifestyles, and post-war euphoria.[100] Sociologists who surveyed women in Muncie, Indiana in 1925 found that all the upper class women approved of birth control, and more than 80 percent of the working class women approved.[101] The birth rate in America declined 20 percent between 1920 and 1930, primarily due to increased use of birth control.[102]\\r\\nAlthough clinics became more common in the late 1920s, the movement still faced significant challenges: Large sectors of the medical community were still resistant to birth control; birth control advocates were blacklisted by the radio industry; and state and federal laws?ÿ though generally not enforced?ÿ still outlawed contraception.[103]\\r\\nThe most significant opponent to birth control was the Catholic Church, which mobilized opposition in many venues during the 1920s.[104] Catholics persuaded the Syracuse city council to ban Sanger from giving a speech in 1924; the National Catholic Welfare Conference lobbied against birth control; the Knights of Columbus boycotted hotels that hosted birth control events; the Catholic police commissioner of Albany prevented Sanger from speaking there; the Catholic mayor of Boston, James Curley, blocked Sanger from speaking in public; and several newsreel companies, succumbing to pressure from Catholics, refused to cover stories related to birth control.[105] The ABCL turned some of the boycotted speaking events to their advantage by inviting the press, and the resultant news coverage often generated public sympathy for their cause.[106] However, Catholic lobbying was particularly effective in the legislative arena, where their arguments?ÿ that contraception was unnatural, harmful, and indecent?ÿ impeded several initiatives, including an attempt in 1924 by Mary Dennett to overturn federal anti-contraception laws.[107]\\r\\nDozens of birth control clinics opened across the United States during the 1920s, but not without incident.[108] In 1929, New York police raided a clinic in New York and arrested two doctors and three nurses for distributing contraceptive information that was unrelated to the prevention of disease.[109] The ABCL achieved a major victory in the trial, when the judge ruled that use of contraceptives to space births farther apart was a legitimate medical treatment that benefited the health of the mother.[110] The trial, in which many prominent physicians served as witnesses for the defense, brought a large segment of the medical community onto the side of birth control advocates.[111]\\r\\nBefore the advent of the birth control movement, eugenics had become very popular in Europe and the U.S., and the subject was widely discussed in articles, movies, and lectures.[112] Eugenicists had mixed feelings about birth control: they worried that it would exacerbate the birth rate differential between \\"superior\\" and \\"inferior\\" races, but they also recognized its value as a tool to \\"racial betterment\\".[113] Leaders of the birth control movement never considered eugenics to be their primary goal, focusing instead on free speech and women's rights, but around 1920 they started to make common cause with eugenicists, hoping to broaden the support base of the birth control movement.[114] Eugenics buttressed the birth control movement's aims by correlating excessive births with increased poverty, crime and disease.[115] Sanger published two books in the early 1920s that endorsed eugenics: Woman and the New Race and The Pivot of Civilization.[116] Sanger and other advocates endorsed negative eugenics (discouraging procreation of \\"inferior\\" persons), but did not advocate euthanasia or positive eugenics (encouraging procreation of \\"superior\\" persons).[117] Written in an essay titled The Eugenic Value of Birth Control Propaganda, Sanger argued that not until parents take control of their own reproduction would it be possibleto improve the quality of the generations of the future, but [also] to maintain civilization at its present levelOnly by intelligent mastery of the procreative powers can the great mass of humanity be awakened.\\"[118] In accordance, Sanger wished to use birth control as means of suppressing undesirable populations. She believed the only way for civilization to become enlightened was for the regeneration of the white race and for the elimination of other lesser races. Sanger hoped to use birth control to suppress the populations of African-Americans, poverty-stricken Americans, and those perceived to have either cognitive, emotional, or physical disabilities.[118] However, many eugenicists refused to support the birth control movement because of Sanger's insistence that a woman's primary duty was to herself, not to the state.[119]\\r\\nLike many white Americans in the U.S. in the 1930s, some leaders of the birth control movement believed that lighter-skinned races were superior to darker-skinned races.[120] They assumed that African Americans were intellectually backward, would be relatively incompetent in managing their own health, and would require special supervision from whites.[121] The dominance of whites in the movement's leadership and medical staff resulted in accusations of racism from blacks and suspicions that \\"race suicide\\" would be a consequence of large scale adoption of birth control.[122] These suspicions were misinterpreted by some of the white birth control advocates as lack of interest in contraception.[123]\\r\\nIn spite of these suspicions, many African-American leaders supported efforts to supply birth control to the African-American community. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem.[125] Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930.[126] The clinic was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers.[127] It was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).[127] In the early 1940s, the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA) initiated a program called the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS).[128] As with the Harlem clinic, the primary aim of the DNS and its programs was to improve maternal and infant health.[129] Based on her work at the Harlem clinic, Sanger suggested to the DNS that African Americans were more likely to take advice from a doctor of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted that whites be employed in the outreach efforts.[130] The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.[131]\\r\\nUnsurprisingly, the birth control movements association with racism, classism, etc., expounds the continual theme of feminist movements fighting only for certain women who fall under specific categories. Examples of this discrimination are common: between the 1820s and the 1840s, middle class voluntary associations looked down upon working women by hurting their societal image, claiming working class women were maternally neglectful regarding their dual responsibilities of domestic work and waged labor. Between the 1860s and the 1910s, womens suffrage associations appealed to southern white women by arguing white womens right to vote would ensure the racial superiority of whites over blacks. These organizations, in turn, discriminated against black women fighting to earn the right to vote for all. In the 1930s, the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching created an organization designed to fight against the lynching of black men. Yet, the association barred the participation of African-Americans and aimed its purpose, not for the end of racial superiority, but for the freeing of southern white women from forced domesticity.[132] These examples demonstrate how dominant womens rights movements excluded certain people based on class and skin color. The birth control movements racist influence is no different than the years of discrimination prominent organizations have long demonstrated.\\r\\nTwo important legal decisions in the 1930s helped increase the accessibility of contraceptives. In 1930, two condom manufacturers sued each other in the Youngs Rubber case, and the judge ruled that contraceptive manufacturing was a legitimate business enterprise. He went further, and declared that the federal law prohibiting the mailing of condoms was not legally sound.[133] Sanger precipitated a second legal breakthrough when she ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932, hoping to provoke a decisive battle in the courts.[134] The diaphragm was confiscated by the U.S. government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to the 1936 One Package legal ruling by Judge Augustus Hand. His decision overturned an important provision of the anti-contraception laws that prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.[135] This court victory motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to finally adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a core component of medical school curricula.[136] However, the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources until the 1960s.[137]\\r\\nBy 1938, over 400 contraceptive manufacturers were in business, over 600 brands of female contraceptives were available, and industry revenues exceeded $250?million per year.[138] Condoms were sold in vending machines in some public restrooms, and men spent twice as much on condoms as on shaving.[139] Although condoms had become commonplace in the 1930s, feminists in the movement felt that birth control should be the woman's prerogative, and they continued to push for development of a contraceptive that was under the woman's control, a campaign which ultimately led to the birth control pill decades later.[140] To increase the availability of high-quality contraceptives, birth control advocates established the HollandÿRantos company to manufacture contraceptives?ÿ primarily diaphragms, which were Sanger's recommended method.[141] By the 1930s, the diaphragm with spermicidal jelly had become the most commonly prescribed form of contraception;[142] in 1938, female contraceptives accounted for 85 percent of annual contraceptive sales.[143]\\r\\nThe 1936 One Package court battle brought together two birth control organizations?ÿ the ABCL and the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau (formerly the CRB)?ÿ who had joined forces to craft the successful defense effort.[144] Leaders of both groups viewed this as an auspicious time to merge the two organizations, so, in 1937, the Birth Control Council of America, under the leadership of Sanger, was formed to effect a consolidation.[145] The effort eventually led to the merger of the two organizations in 1939 as the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA).[146] Although Sanger continued in the role of president, she no longer wielded the same power as she had in the early years of the movement, and, in 1942, more conservative forces within the organization changed the name to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a name Sanger objected to because she considered it too euphemistic.[147] After World War II, the leadership of Planned Parenthood de-emphasized radical feminism and shifted focus to more moderate themes such as family planning and population policy.[148]\\r\\nThe movement to legalize birth control came to a gradual conclusion around the time Planned Parenthood was formed.[149] In 1942, there were over 400 birth control organizations in America, contraception was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the anti-contraception Comstock laws (which still remained on the books) were rarely enforced.[150]\\r\\nAfter World War II advocacy for reproductive rights transitioned into a new era which focused on abortion, public funding, and insurance coverage.[151]\\r\\nBirth control advocacy also took on a global aspect as organizations around the world began to collaborate. In 1946, Sanger helped found the International Committee on Planned Parenthood, which evolved into the International Planned Parenthood Federation and soon became the world's largest non-governmental international family planning organization.[152] In 1952, John D. Rockefeller III founded the influential Population Council.[153] Fear of global overpopulation became a major issue in the 1960s, generating concerns about pollution, food shortages, and quality of life, leading to well-funded birth control campaigns around the world.[154] The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development and the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women addressed birth control and influenced human rights declarations which asserted women's rights to control their own bodies.[155]\\r\\nIn the early 1950s in the United States, philanthropist Katharine McCormick provided funding for biologist Gregory Pincus to develop the birth control pill, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1960.[156] The pill became very popular and had a major impact on society and culture. It contributed to a sharp increase in college attendance and graduation rates for women.[157] New forms of intrauterine devices were introduced in the 1960s, increasing popularity of long acting reversible contraceptives.[158]\\r\\nIn 1965, the Supreme Court ruled in Griswold v. Connecticut that it was unconstitutional for the government to prohibit married couples from using birth control.\\r\\nIn 1967 activist Bill Baird was arrested for distributing a contraceptive foam and a condom to a student during a lecture on birth control and abortion at Boston University. Baird's appeal of his conviction resulted in the United States Supreme Court case Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972), which extended the Griswold holding to unmarried couples, and thereby legalized birth control for all Americans.\\r\\nIn 1970, Congress finally removed references to contraception from federal anti-obscenity laws;[159] and in 1973, the Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy.[160]\\r\\nAlso in 1970, Title X of the Public Health Service Act was enacted as part of the war on poverty, to make family planning and preventive health services available to low-income and the uninsured.[161] Without publicly funded family planning services, according to the Guttmacher Institute, the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the United States would be nearly two-thirds higher; the number of unintended pregnancies among poor women would nearly double.[162] According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, publicly funded family planning saves nearly $4 in Medicaid expenses for every $1 spent on services.[163]\\r\\nIn 1982, European drug manufacturers developed mifepristone, which was initially utilized as a contraceptive, but is now generally prescribed with a prostoglandin to induce abortion in pregnancies up to the fourth month of gestation.[164] To avoid consumer boycotts organized by anti-abortion organizations, the manufacturer donated the U.S. manufacturing rights to Danco Laboratories, a company formed by pro-choice advocates, with the sole purpose of distributing mifepristone in the U.S, and thus immune to the effects of boycotts.[165]\\r\\nIn 1997, the FDA approved a prescription emergency contraception pill (known as the morning-after pill), which became available over the counter in 2006.[166] In 2010, ulipristal acetate, a more effective emergency contraceptive was approved for use up to five days after unprotected sexual intercourse.[167] Fifty to sixty percent of abortion patients became pregnant in circumstances in which emergency contraceptives could have been used.[168] These emergency contraceptives, including Plan B and EllaOne, proved to be another battleground in the war over reproductive rights.[169] Opponents of emergency contraception consider it a form of abortion, because it may interfere with the ability of a fertilized embryo to implant in the uterus; while proponents contend that it is not abortion, because the absence of implantation means that pregnancy never commenced.[170]\\r\\nIn 2000, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that companies that provided insurance for prescription drugs to their employees but excluded birth control were violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[171]\\r\\nPresident Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on 23 March 2010. As of 1 August 2011, female contraception was added to a list of preventive services covered by the ACA that would be provided without patient co-payment. The federal mandate applied to all new health insurance plans in all states from 1 August 2012.[172][173] Grandfathered plans did not have to comply unless they changed substantially.[174] To be grandfathered, a group plan must have existed or an individual plan must have been sold before President Obama signed the law; otherwise they were required to comply with the new law.[175] The Guttmacher Institute noted that even before the federal mandate was implemented, twenty-eight states had their own mandates that required health insurance to cover the prescription contraceptives, but the federal mandate innovated by forbidding insurance companies from charging part of the cost to the patient.[176]\\r\\nIn 2017, the Trump administration issued a ruling letting insurers and employers refuse to provide birth control if doing so went against their \\"religious beliefs\\" or \\"moral convictions\\".[177] However, later that same year federal judge Wendy Beetlestone issued an injunction temporarily stopping the enforcement of the Trump administration ruling.[178]","input":"Who was involved in the moral reform movement?"},{"output":"ten years","context":"A decade is a period of ten years. The word is derived (via French and Latin) from the Ancient?Greek: Ѵ?? (/e?k??s/, transliteration=dekas), which means a group of ten.

It is located on the western end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., across from the Washington Monument. The architect was Henry Bacon; the designer of the primary statue ÿ Abraham Lincoln, 1920 ÿ was Daniel Chester French; the Lincoln statue was carved by the Piccirilli Brothers;[2] and the painter of the interior murals was Jules Guerin. Dedicated in 1922, it is one of several monuments built to honor an American president. It has always been a major tourist attraction and since the 1930s has been a symbolic center focused on race relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building is in the form of a Greek Doric temple and contains a large seated sculpture of Abraham Lincoln and inscriptions of two well-known speeches by Lincoln, \\"The Gettysburg Address\\" and his Second Inaugural Address. The memorial has been the site of many famous speeches, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech, delivered on August 28, 1963, during the rally at the end of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other monuments on the National Mall ÿ including the nearby Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Korean War Veterans Memorial, and National World War II Memorial ÿ the memorial is administered by the National Park Service under its National Mall and Memorial Parks group. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since October 15, 1966. It is open to the public 24 hours a day. In 2007, it was ranked seventh on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects. Since 2010, approximately 6 million people visit the memorial annually.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first public memorial to Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., was a statue by Lot Flannery erected in front of the District of Columbia City Hall in 1868, three years after Lincoln's assassination.[4][5] Demands for a fitting national memorial had been voiced since the time of Lincoln's death. In 1867, Congress passed the first of many bills incorporating a commission to erect a monument for the sixteenth president. An American sculptor, Clark Mills, was chosen to design the monument. His plans reflected the nationalistic spirit of the time, and called for a 70-foot (21?m) structure adorned with six equestrian and 31 pedestrian statues of colossal proportions, crowned by a 12-foot (3.7?m) statue of Abraham Lincoln. Subscriptions for the project were insufficient.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe matter lay dormant until the start of the 20th century, when, under the leadership of Senator Shelby M. Cullom of Illinois, six separate bills were introduced in Congress for the incorporation of a new memorial commission. The first five bills, proposed in the years 1901, 1902, and 1908, met with defeat because of opposition from Speaker Joe Cannon. The sixth bill (Senate Bill 9449), introduced on December 13, 1910, passed. The Lincoln Memorial Commission had its first meeting the following year and U.S. President William H. Taft was chosen as the commission's president. Progress continued at a steady pace and by 1913 Congress had approved of the Commission's choice of design and location.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were questions regarding the commission's plan. Many thought that architect Henry Bacon's Greek temple design was far too ostentatious for a man of Lincoln's humble character. Instead they proposed a simple log cabin shrine. The site too did not go unopposed. The recently reclaimed land in West Potomac Park was seen by many to be either too swampy or too inaccessible. Other sites, such as Union Station, were put forth. The Commission stood firm in its recommendation, feeling that the Potomac Park location, situated on the Washington Monument-Capitol axis, overlooking the Potomac River and surrounded by open land, was ideal. Furthermore, the Potomac Park site had already been designated in the McMillan Plan of 1901 to be the location of a future monument comparable to that of the Washington Monument.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Congressional approval and a $300,000 allocation, the project got underway. On February 12, 1914, a dedication ceremony was conducted and the following month the actual construction began. Work progressed steadily according to schedule. Some changes were made to the plan. The statue of Lincoln, originally designed to be 10 feet (3.0?m) tall, was enlarged to 19 feet (5.8?m) to prevent it from being overwhelmed by the huge chamber. As late as 1920, the decision was made to substitute an open portal for the bronze and glass grille which was to have guarded the entrance. Despite these changes, the Memorial was finished on schedule. Commission president William H. Taft ÿ who was then Chief Justice of the United States ÿ dedicated the Memorial on May 30, 1922 and presented it to President Warren G. Harding, who accepted it on behalf of the American people. Lincoln's only surviving son, 78-year-old Robert Todd Lincoln, was in attendance.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exterior of the Memorial echoes a classic Greek temple and features Yule marble from Colorado. The structure measures 189.7 by 118.5 feet (57.8 by 36.1?m) and is 99 feet (30?m) tall. It is surrounded by a peristyle of 36 fluted Doric columns, one for each of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln's death, and two columns in-antis at the entrance behind the colonnade. The columns stand 44 feet (13?m) tall with a base diameter of 7.5 feet (2.3?m). Each column is built from 12 drums including the capital. The columns, like the exterior walls and facades, are inclined slightly toward the building's interior. This is to compensate for perspective distortions which would otherwise make the memorial appear to bulge out at the top when compared with the bottom, a common feature of Ancient Greek architecture.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove the colonnade, inscribed on the frieze, are the names of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln's death and the dates in which they entered the Union.[Note 1] Their names are separated by double wreath medallions in bas-relief. The cornice is composed of a carved scroll regularly interspersed with projecting lions' heads and ornamented with palmetto cresting along the upper edge. Above this on the attic frieze are inscribed the names of the 48 states present at the time of the Memorial's dedication. A bit higher is a garland joined by ribbons and palm leaves, supported by the wings of eagles. All ornamentation on the friezes and cornices was done by Ernest C. Bairstow.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Memorial is anchored in a concrete foundation, 44 to 66 feet (13 to 20?m) in depth, constructed by M. F. Comer and Company and the National Foundation and Engineering Company, and is encompassed by a 187-by-257-foot (57 by 78?m) rectangular granite retaining wall measuring 14 feet (4.3?m) in height.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeading up to the shrine on the east side are the main steps. Beginning at the edge of the Reflecting Pool, the steps rise to the Lincoln Memorial Circle roadway surrounding the edifice, then to the main portal, intermittently spaced with a series of platforms. Flanking the steps as they approach the entrance are two buttresses each crowned with an 11-foot (3.4?m) tall tripod carved from pink Tennessee marble[10] by the Piccirilli Brothers.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Memorial's interior is divided into three chambers by two rows of four Ionic columns, each 50 feet (15?m) tall and 5.5 feet (1.7?m) across at their base. The central chamber, housing the statue of Lincoln, is 60 feet wide, 74 feet deep, and 60 feet high.[12] The north and south chambers display carved inscriptions of Lincoln's second inaugural address and his Gettysburg Address.[Note 2] Bordering these inscriptions are pilasters ornamented with fasces, eagles, and wreaths. The inscriptions and adjoining ornamentation are by Evelyn Beatrice Longman.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Memorial is replete with symbolic elements. The 36 columns represent the states of the Union at the time of Lincoln's death; the 48 stone festoons above the columns represent the 48 states in 1922. Inside, each inscription is surmounted by a 60-by-12-foot (18.3 by 3.7?m) mural by Jules Guerin portraying principles seen as evident in Lincoln's life: Freedom, Liberty, Immortality, Justice, and the Law on the south wall; Unity, Fraternity, and Charity on the north. Cypress trees, representing Eternity, are in the murals' backgrounds. The murals' paint incorporated kerosene and wax to protect the exposed artwork from fluctuations in temperature and moisture.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ceiling consists of bronze girders ornamented with laurel and oak leaves. Between these are panels of Alabama marble, saturated with paraffin to increase translucency. But feeling that the statue required even more light, Bacon and French designed metal slats for the ceiling to conceal floodlights, which could be modulated to supplement the natural light; this modification was installed in 1929. The one major alteration since was the addition of a handicapped elevator in the 1970s.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIN THIS TEMPLE\\r\\nAS IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE\\r\\nFOR WHOM HE SAVED THE UNION\\r\\nTHE MEMORY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN\\r\\nIS ENSHRINED FOREVER\\r\\n\\r\\nLying between the north and south chambers is the central hall containing the solitary figure of Lincoln sitting in contemplation. The statue was carved by the Piccirilli Brothers under the supervision of the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, and took four years to complete. The statue, originally intended to be only 10 feet (3.0?m) tall, was, on further consideration, enlarged so that it finally stood 19 feet (5.8?m) tall from head to foot, the scale being such that if Lincoln were standing, he would be 28 feet (8.5?m) tall. The widest span of the statue corresponds to its height. Of Georgia white marble, it weighs 175 short tons (159?t) and was shipped in twenty-eight pieces.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe statue rests upon an oblong pedestal of Tennessee marble 10 feet (3.0?m) high, 16 feet (4.9?m) wide, and 17 feet (5.2?m) deep. Directly beneath this lies a platform of Tennessee marble about 34.5 feet (10.5?m) long, 28 feet (8.5?m) wide, and 6.5 inches (0.17?m) high. Lincoln's arms rest on representations of Roman  fasces, a subtle touch that associates the statue with the Augustan (and imperial) theme (obelisk and funerary monuments) of the Washington Mall.[14] The statue is discretely bordered by two pilasters, one on each side. Between these pilasters, and above Lincoln's head, is engraved an epitaph of Lincoln[13] by Royal Cortissoz.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sculpture has been at the center of two urban legends. Some have claimed that the face of General Robert E. Lee was carved onto the back of Lincoln's head,[16] and looks back across the Potomac toward his former home, Arlington House, now within the bounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Another popular legend is that Lincoln is shown using sign language to represent his initials, with his left hand shaped to form an \\"A\\" and his right hand to form an \\"L\\", the president's initials. The National Park Service denies both legends.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, historian Gerald Prokopowicz writes that, while it is not clear that sculptor Daniel Chester French intended Lincoln's hands to be formed into sign language versions of his initials, it is possible that French did intend it, because he was familiar with American Sign Language, and he would have had a reason to do so, that is, to pay tribute to Lincoln for having signed the federal legislation giving Gallaudet University, a university for the deaf, the authority to grant college degrees.[17] The National Geographic Society's publication, \\"Pinpointing the Past in Washington, D.C.\\" states that Daniel Chester French had a son who was deaf and that the sculptor was familiar with sign language.[18][19] Historian James A. Percoco has observed that, although there are no extant documents showing that French had Lincoln's hands carved to represent the letters \\"A\\" and \\"L\\" in American Sign Language, \\"I think you can conclude that it's reasonable to have that kind of summation about the hands.\\"[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Sandage (1993) demonstrates, the Memorial has become a symbolically sacred venue especially for the Civil Rights Movement. In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution refused to allow the African-American contralto Marian Anderson to perform before an integrated audience at the organization's Constitution Hall. At the suggestion of Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harold L. Ickes, the Secretary of the Interior, arranged for a performance on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday of that year, to a live audience of 75,000, and a nationwide radio audience.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 28, 1963, the memorial grounds were the site of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which proved to be a high point of the American Civil Rights Movement. It is estimated that approximately 250,000 people came to the event, where they heard Martin Luther King Jr., deliver his historic I Have a Dream speech before the memorial honoring the president who had issued the Emancipation Proclamation 100 years earlier.  King's speech, with its language of patriotism and its evocation of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, was meant to match the symbolism of the Lincoln Memorial as a monument to national unity.[22] The D.C. police also appreciated the location because it was surrounded on three sides by water, so that any incident could be easily contained.[23] Twenty years later, on August 28, 1983, crowds gathered again to mark the 20th Anniversary Mobilization for Jobs, Peace and Freedom, to reflect on progress in gaining civil rights for African Americans and to commit to correcting continuing injustices.  The \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech is such a part of the Lincoln Memorial story, that the spot on which King stood, on the landing eighteen steps below Lincoln's statue, was engraved in 2003 in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the event.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the memorial on May 9, 1970, President Richard Nixon had a middle-of-the-night impromptu, brief meeting with protesters who, just days after the Kent State shootings, were preparing to march against the Vietnam War.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1962, vandals painted the words \\"nigger lover\\" in foot-high pink letters on the rear wall.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning of July 26, 2013, the memorial was shut down after the statue's base and legs were splashed with green paint.[27] It reopened later that day.[28] A 58-year-old Chinese national, Jiamei Tian, was later found responsible for the vandalism. Following her arrest at the Washington National Cathedral, she was admitted to St. Elizabeths Hospital, a psychiatric facility, and was later found to be incompetent to stand trial; she has since been released from the hospital.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 27, 2017, graffiti written in permanent marker was found at the memorial, the Washington Monument, the District of Columbia War Memorial, and the National World War II Memorial, saying \\"Jackie shot JFK\\", \\"blood test is a lie\\", as well as other claims. Street signs and utility boxes were also defaced. Authorities believed that a single person was responsible for all the vandalism.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 15, 2017, graffiti that Reuters reported \\"appeared to read 'fuck law'\\" was spray painted in red on one of the columns. The initials \\"M+E\\" were etched on the same pillar. A \\"mild, gel-type architectural paint stripper\\" was used to remove the paint without damaging the memorial. However, the etching was deemed \\"permanent damage.\\" A Smithsonian Institution directional sign several blocks away was also defaced.[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 18, 2017, Nurtilek Bakirov from Kyrgyzstan was arrested when a police officer saw him vandalizing the Memorial at around 1:00 PM EDT. Bakirov used a penny to carve the letters \\"HYPT MAEK\\" in what appeared to Cyrillic letters into the fifth pillar on the north side. As of  20?September?2017[update], police do not know what the words mean, although there is a possibility that they contain a reference to the vandal's name.  Court documents indicate that the letters can not be completely removed, but could be polished at the cost of approximately $2,000.  A conservator for the National Park Service said that the stone would weather over time, helping to obscure the letters, although she characterized it as \\"permanent damage\\".[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs one of the most prominent American monuments, the Lincoln Memorial is often featured in books, films, and television shows that take place in Washington; by 2003 it had appeared in over 60 films,[34] and in 2009, Mark S. Reinhart compiled some short sketches of dozens of uses of the Memorial in film and television.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome examples of films include Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, in a key scene where the statue and its inscription provide inspiration to freshman Senator Jefferson Smith, played by James Stewart[36] ÿ the Park Service did not want director Frank Capra to film at the Memorial, so he sent a large crew elsewhere as a distraction while a smaller crew filmed Stewart and Jean Arthur at the Memorial;[37] The Day the Earth Stood Still, a science fiction film in which the alien Klaatu visits the Memorial and is impressed by Lincoln's words carved there; the 2001 version of Planet of the Apes; X-Men: First Class; the 2011 film Transformers: Dark of the Moon, where Megatron destroys the statue of Lincoln and then sits on the chair as a throne;[38] and the 2016 horror movie The Purge: Election Year, in which the Lincoln Memorial is shown with dead and burning bodies on the steps and the columns defaced with giant letters that spell out \\"PURGE\\", written in human blood.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther films and television programs which have featured the Memorial include In the Line of Fire; National Treasure, in which the main characters discuss the possibility of stealing the Declaration of Independence while sitting on the steps of the Memorial; the comedy Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, where the statue of Lincoln helps defeat the Horus warriors; the \\"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\\" episode of The Simpsons;[40] the scene from Forrest Gump, in which Forrest (Tom Hanks) delivers a speech standing on a podium in front of the Memorial facing the reflecting pool; and the 2013 film White House Down, in which the President (Jamie Foxx) requests a fly-by of the Lincoln Memorial, at both the beginning and the end of the movie to pay homage to his hero.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the appearances of the Lincoln Memorial are actually digital visual effects, due to restrictive filming rules.[40]  As of 2017, according to the National Park Service, \\"Filming/photography is prohibited above the white marble steps and the interior chamber of the Lincoln Memorial.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nMitchell Newton-Matza argued in 2016, \\"Reflecting its cherished place in the hearts of Americans, the Lincoln Memorial has often been featured prominently in popular culture, especially motion pictures.\\"[42]  According to Tracey Gold Bennett, \\"The majesty of the Lincoln Memorial is a big draw for film location scouts, producers, and directors because this landmark has appeared in a considerable number of films.\\"[43]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJay Sacher writes: \\r\\nFrom high to low, the memorial is cultural shorthand for both American ideals and 1960s radicalism.

After being transmitted via the bite of an infected flea, the Y. pestis bacteria become localized in an inflamed lymph node, where they begin to colonize and reproduce. Buboes associated with the bubonic plague are commonly found in the armpits, upper femoral, groin and neck region. Acral gangrene (i.e., of the fingers, toes, lips and nose) is another common symptom.\\r\\nBecause of its bite-based mode of transmission, the bubonic plague is often the first of a progressive series of illnesses. Bubonic plague symptoms appear suddenly a few days after exposure to the bacterium. Symptoms include:\\r\\nOther symptoms include heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood (hematemesis), aching limbs, coughing, and extreme pain caused by the decay or decomposition of the skin while the person is still alive. Additional symptoms include extreme fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, lenticulae (black dots scattered throughout the body), delirium, and coma.\\r\\nBubonic plague is an infection of the lymphatic system, usually resulting from the bite of an infected flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (the rat flea). In very rare circumstances, as in the septicemic plague, the disease can be transmitted by direct contact with infected tissue or exposure to the cough of another human. The flea is parasitic on house and field rats, and seeks out other prey when its rodent hosts die. The bacteria remain harmless to the flea, allowing the new host to spread the bacteria. The bacteria form aggregates in the gut of infected fleas and this results in the flea regurgitating ingested blood, which is now infected, into the bite site of a rodent or human host. Once established, bacteria rapidly spread to the lymph nodes and multiply.\\r\\nY. pestis bacilli can resist phagocytosis and even reproduce inside phagocytes and kill them. As the disease progresses, the lymph nodes can haemorrhage and become swollen and necrotic. Bubonic plague can progress to lethal septicemic plague in some cases. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague.\\r\\nLaboratory testing is required in order to diagnose and confirm plague. Ideally, confirmation is through the identification of Y. pestis culture from a patient sample. Confirmation of infection can be done by examining serum taken during the early and late stages of infection. To quickly screen for the Y. pestis antigen in patients, rapid dipstick tests have been developed for field use.[12]\\r\\n?Samples taken for testing include:[13]\\r\\nSeveral classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1ÿ15%, compared to a mortality of 40ÿ60% in untreated cases.[14]\\r\\nPeople potentially infected with the plague need immediate treatment and should be given antibiotics within 24 hours of the first symptoms to prevent death. Other treatments include oxygen, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support. People who have had contact with anyone infected by pneumonic plague are given prophylactic antibiotics.[15] Using the broad-based antibiotic streptomycin has proven to be dramatically successful against the bubonic plague within 12 hours of infection.[16]\\r\\nThe first recorded epidemic affected the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) and was named the Plague of Justinian after emperor Justinian I, who was infected but survived through extensive treatment.[17][18] The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million (6th century outbreak) to 50 million people (two centuries of recurrence).[19][20] The historian Procopius wrote, in Volume II of History of the Wars, of his personal encounter with the plague and the effect it had on the rising empire. In the spring of 542, the plague arrived in Constantinople, working its way from port city to port city and spreading around the Mediterranean Sea, later migrating inland eastward into Asia Minor and west into Greece and Italy. Because the infectious disease spread inland by the transferring of merchandise through Justinians efforts in acquiring luxurious goods of the time and exporting supplies, his capital became the leading exporter of the bubonic plague. Procopius, in his work Secret History, declared that Justinian was a demon of an emperor who either created the plague himself or was being punished for his sinfulness.[20]\\r\\nIn the Late Middle Ages (1340ÿ1400) Europe experienced the most deadly disease outbreak in history when the Black Death, the infamous pandemic of bubonic plague, hit in 1347, killing a third of the human population.[where?] Some historians believe that society subsequently became more violent as the mass mortality rate cheapened life and thus increased warfare, crime, popular revolt, waves of flagellants, and persecution.[21] The Black Death originated in Central Asia and spread from Italy and then throughout other European countries. Arab historians Ibn Al-Wardni and Almaqrizi believed the Black Death originated in Mongolia. Chinese records also showed a huge outbreak in Mongolia in the early 1330s.[22] Research published in 2002 suggests that it began in early 1346 in the steppe region, where a plague reservoir stretches from the northwestern shore of the Caspian Sea into southern Russia. The Mongols had cut off the trade route, the Silk Road, between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe. The epidemic began with an attack that Mongols launched on the Italian merchants' last trading station in the region, Caffa in the Crimea.[16] In late 1346, plague broke out among the besiegers and from them penetrated into the town. When spring arrived, the Italian merchants fled on their ships, unknowingly carrying the Black Death. Carried by the fleas on rats, the plague initially spread to humans near the Black Sea and then outwards to the rest of Europe as a result of people fleeing from one area to another.\\r\\nThe plague resurfaced for a third time in the mid-19th century. Like the two previous outbreaks, this one also originated in Eastern Asia, most likely in Yunnan Province of China, where there are several natural plague foci.[23] The initial outbreaks occurred in the second half of the eighteenth century.[24][25] The disease remained localized in Southwest China for several years before spreading. In the city of Canton, beginning in January 1894, the disease killed 80,000 people by June. Daily water-traffic with the nearby city of Hong Kong rapidly spread the plague there, killing over 2,400 within two months.[26]\\r\\nAlso known as the modern pandemic, the third pandemic spread the disease to port cities throughout the world in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century via shipping routes.[27] The plague inflicted people in Chinatown in San Francisco from 1900-1904,[28] and the people of Oakland and east bay again from 1907-1909.[29] During the outbreak from 1900-1904 in San Francisco is when authorities made permanent the Chinese Exclusion Act. This law was originally signed into existence by President Chester A. Arthur in 1882. The Chinese Exclusion Act was supposed to last for ten years but was renewed in 1892 with the Geary Act and subsequently made permanent in 1902 during the outbreak of plague in Chinatown, San Francisco. The last major outbreak in the United States occurred in Los Angeles in 1924,[30] though the disease is still present in wild rodents, and can be passed to humans that come in contact with them.[31] According to the World Health Organization, the pandemic was considered active until 1959, when worldwide casualties dropped to 200 per year. In 1994, a plague outbreak in five Indian states caused an estimated 700 infections (including 52 deaths) and triggered a large migration of Indians within India as they tried to avoid the plague.\\r\\nFor over a decade since 2001, Zambia, India, Malawi, Algeria, China, Peru, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the most plague cases with over 1,100 cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo alone. From 1,000 to 2,000 cases are conservatively reported per year to the WHO.[32] From 2012 and to 2017 and reflecting political unrest and poor hygienic conditions, Madagascar began to host regular epidemics.[32]\\r\\nBetween 1900 and 2015, the United States had 1,036 human plague cases with an average of 9 cases per year. In 2015, 16 people in the Western United States developed plague, including 2 cases in Yosemite National Park.[33] These US cases usually occur in rural northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, southern Colorado, California, southern Oregon, and far western Nevada.[34]\\r\\nIn November 2017, the Madagascar Ministry of Health reported an outbreak to WHO (World Health Organization) with more cases and deaths than any recent outbreak in the country. Unusually most of the cases were pneumonic rather than bubonic.[35]\\r\\nThe scale of death and social upheaval associated with plague outbreaks has made the topic prominent in a number of historical and fictional accounts since the disease was first recognized. The Black Death in particular is described and referenced in numerous contemporary sources, some of which, including works by Chaucer, Boccaccio, and Petrarch, are considered part of the Western canon. The Decameron, by Boccaccio, is notable for its use of a frame story involving individuals who have fled Florence for a secluded villa to escape the Black Death. First person, sometimes sensationalized or fictionalized, accounts of living through plague years have also been popular across centuries and cultures.\\r\\nLater works, such as Albert Camus's novel The Plague or Ingmar Bergman's film The Seventh Seal have used bubonic plague in settings, such quarantined cities in either medieval or modern times, as a backdrop to explore a variety of concepts. Common themes include the breakdown of society, institutions, and individuals during the plague, the cultural and psychological existential confrontation with mortality, and the allegorical use of the plague in reference to contemporary moral or spiritual questions.\\r\\nSome of the earliest instances of biological warfare were said to have been products of the plague, as armies of the 14th century were recorded catapulting diseased corpses over the walls of towns and villages to spread the pestilence.\\r\\nLater, plague was used during the Second Sino-Japanese War as a bacteriological weapon by the Imperial Japanese Army. These weapons were provided by Shir Ishii's units and used in experiments on humans before being used on the field. For example, in 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service bombed Ningbo with fleas carrying the bubonic plague.[36] During the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials, the accused, such as Major General Kiyashi Kawashima, testified that, in 1941, 40 members of Unit 731 air-dropped plague-contaminated fleas on Changde. These operations caused epidemic plague outbreaks.[37]","input":"What was the host animal of the black plague?"},{"output":"6 April 2010","context":"The Equality Act 2010[1] is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and has the same goals as the four major EU Equal Treatment Directives, whose provisions it mirrors and implements.[2]\\r\\nThe primary purpose of the Act is to codify the complicated and numerous array of Acts and Regulations, which formed the basis of anti-discrimination law in Great Britain. This was, primarily, the Equal Pay Act 1970, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Race Relations Act 1976, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and three major statutory instruments protecting discrimination in employment on grounds of religion or belief, sexual orientation and age. It requires equal treatment in access to employment as well as private and public services, regardless of the protected characteristics of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. In the case of gender, there are special protections for pregnant women. The Act does not guarantee transsexuals' access to gender-specific services where restrictions are \\"a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim\\".[3] In the case of disability, employers and service providers are under a duty to make reasonable adjustments to their workplaces to overcome barriers experienced by disabled people.

Cognatic primogeniture for the British monarchy was instead abolished separately three years after the Equality Act came into force, with the enactment of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.\\r\\nAlthough the act was never going to change the law with regard to churches from its existing position, nor change the binding European Union law which covers many more Roman Catholics than those living in the United Kingdom, and although the position had been spelled out in the High Court in R (Amicus) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry,[10] a small number of Roman Catholic bishops in England and Wales made claims that they might in future be prosecuted under the Equality Act 2010 for refusing to allow women, married men, transsexual people, and gay people into the priesthood.[11][12][13] This claim was rejected by the government. A spokesman said an exemption in the law \\"covers ministers of religion such as Catholic priests\\"[11] and a document released by the Government Equalities Office states that \\"the Equality Bill will not change the existing legal position regarding churches and employment\\".[14] The legislation was also criticised by Anglican clergy.[15]\\r\\nCertain employment is exempted from the act, including:","input":"What year did the equality act come into effect?"},{"output":"the Cineflex V14HD gyro-stabilized camera system mounted under the chin of a helicopter","context":"Aerial America is a television series airing on the Smithsonian Channel.

When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges.[1] At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9?cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5ÿ9?cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5?cm/year.[2][3]:2\\r\\nEarlier theories (e.g. by Alfred Wegener and Alexander du Toit) of continental drift postulated that continents \\"ploughed\\" through the sea. The idea that the seafloor itself moves (and also carries the continents with it) as it expands from a central axis was proposed by Harry Hess from Princeton University in the 1960s.[4] The theory is well accepted now, and the phenomenon is known to be caused by convection currents in the asthenosphere, which is ductile, or plastic, and the brittle lithosphere (crust and upper mantle).[5][clarification needed]\\r\\nSeafloor spreading occurs at spreading centers, distributed along the crests of mid-ocean ridges. Spreading centers end in transform faults or in overlapping spreading center offsets. A spreading center includes a seismically active plate boundary zone a few kilometers to tens of kilometers wide, a crustal accretion zone within the boundary zone where the ocean crust is youngest, and an instantaneous plate boundary - a line within the crustal accretion zone demarcating the two separating plates.[6] Within the crustal accretion zone is a 1-2 km-wide neovolcanic zone where active volcanism occurs.[7][8]\\r\\nIn the general case, sea floor spreading starts as a rift in a continental land mass, similar to the Red Sea-East Africa Rift System today.[9] The process starts by heating at the base of the continental crust which causes it to become more plastic and less dense. Because less dense objects rise in relation to denser objects, the area being heated becomes a broad dome (see isostasy). As the crust bows upward, fractures occur that gradually grow into rifts. The typical rift system consists of three rift arms at approximately 120 degree angles. These areas are named triple junctions and can be found in several places across the world today. The separated margins of the continents evolve to form passive margins. Hess' theory was that new seafloor is formed when magma is forced upward toward the surface at a mid-ocean ridge.\\r\\nIf spreading continues past the incipient stage described above, two of the rift arms will open while the third arm stops opening and becomes a 'failed rift'. As the two active rifts continue to open, eventually the continental crust is attenuated as far as it will stretch. At this point basaltic oceanic crust begins to form between the separating continental fragments. When one of the rifts opens into the existing ocean, the rift system is flooded with seawater and becomes a new sea. The Red Sea is an example of a new arm of the sea. The East African rift was thought to be a \\"failed\\" arm that was opening somewhat more slowly than the other two arms, but in 2005 the Ethiopian Afar Geophysical Lithospheric Experiment[10] reported that in the Afar region, September 2005, a 60?km fissure opened as wide as eight meters.[11] During this period of initial flooding the new sea is sensitive to changes in climate and eustasy. As a result, the new sea will evaporate (partially or completely) several times before the elevation of the rift valley has been lowered to the point that the sea becomes stable. During this period of evaporation large evaporite deposits will be made in the rift valley. Later these deposits have the potential to become hydrocarbon seals and are of particular interest to petroleum geologists.\\r\\nSea floor spreading can stop during the process, but if it continues to the point that the continent is completely severed, then a new ocean basin is created. The Red Sea has not yet completely split Arabia from Africa, but a similar feature can be found on the other side of Africa that has broken completely free. South America once fit into the area of the Niger Delta. The Niger River has formed in the failed rift arm of the triple junction.\\r\\nAs new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is therefore colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13?cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone.[2] The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.[12]\\r\\nSince the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.\\r\\nAt the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (and in other areas), material from the upper mantle rises through the faults between oceanic plates to form new crust as the plates move away from each other, a phenomenon first observed as continental drift. When Alfred Wegener first presented a hypothesis of continental drift in 1912, he suggested that continents ploughed through the ocean crust. This was impossible: oceanic crust is both more dense and more rigid than continental crust. Accordingly, Wegener's theory wasn't taken very seriously, especially in the United States.\\r\\nSince then, it has been shown that the motion of the continents is linked to seafloor spreading by the theory of plate tectonics. In the 1960s, the past record of geomagnetic reversals was noticed by observing the magnetic stripe \\"anomalies\\" on the ocean floor.[13] This results in broadly evident \\"stripes\\" from which the past magnetic field polarity can be inferred by looking at the data gathered from simply towing a magnetometer on the sea surface or from an aircraft. The stripes on one side of the mid-ocean ridge were the mirror image of those on the other side. The seafloor must have originated on the Earth's great fiery welts, like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise.\\r\\nThe driver for seafloor spreading in plates with active margins is the weight of the cool, dense, subducting slabs that pull them along. The magmatism at the ridge is considered to be \\"passive upswelling\\", which is caused by the plates being pulled apart under the weight of their own slabs.[14][15] This can be thought of as analogous to a rug on a table with little friction: when part of the rug is off of the table, its weight pulls the rest of the rug down with it.\\r\\nThe depth of the seafloor (or the height of a location on a mid-ocean ridge above a baselevel) is closely correlated with its age (age of the lithosphere where depth is measured). The age-depth relation can be modeled by the cooling of a lithosphere plate[16][17] or mantle half-space in areas without significant subduction.[18]\\r\\nIn the half-space model,[18] the seabed height is determined by the oceanic lithosphere temperature, due to thermal expansion. Oceanic lithosphere is continuously formed at a constant rate at the mid-ocean ridges. The source of the lithosphere has a half-plane shape (x = 0, z < 0) and a constant temperature T1. Due to its continuous creation, the lithosphere at x > 0 is moving away from the ridge at a constant velocity v, which is assumed large compared to other typical scales in the problem. The temperature at the upper boundary of the lithosphere (z=0) is a constant T0 = 0. Thus at x = 0 the temperature is the Heaviside step function \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\n?\\r\\nz\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle T_{1}\\\\cdot \\\\Theta (-z)}\\r\\n\\r\\n. Finally, we assume the system is at a quasi-steady state, so that the temperature distribution is constant in time, i.e. T=T(x,z).\\r\\nBy calculating in the frame of reference of the moving lithosphere (velocity v), which have spatial coordinate x' = x-vt, we may write T = T(x',z,t) and use the heat equation: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nz\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n+\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t}}=\\\\kappa \\\\nabla ^{2}T=\\\\kappa {\\\\frac {\\\\partial ^{2}T}{\\\\partial ^{2}z}}+\\\\kappa {\\\\frac {\\\\partial ^{2}T}{\\\\partial ^{2}x'}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n where \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\kappa }\\r\\n\\r\\n is the thermal diffusivity of the mantle lithosphere.\\r\\nSince T depends on x' and t only through the combination \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n+\\r\\nv\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle x=x'+vt}\\r\\n\\r\\n, we have: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\nv\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial x'}}={\\\\frac {1}{v}}\\\\cdot {\\\\frac {\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThus: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nz\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n+\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nv\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t}}=\\\\kappa \\\\nabla ^{2}T=\\\\kappa {\\\\frac {\\\\partial ^{2}T}{\\\\partial ^{2}z}}+{\\\\frac {\\\\kappa }{v^{2}}}{\\\\frac {\\\\partial ^{2}T}{\\\\partial ^{2}t}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now use the assumption that \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nv\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle v}\\r\\n\\r\\n is large compared to other scales in the problem;

He has been portrayed by Eric Braeden since 1980. Initially a guest character who was to last for eight to twelve weeks, Victor has evolved into the soap opera's leading male figure. Created by William J. Bell as a \\"despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser\\", the character was planned to be killed off and never heard of again. However, after Bell saw Braeden's performance, he decided to sign the actor onto a contract. Braeden was hesitant to work on a soap opera, but eventually signed a contract, and has remained on the series as a regular cast member for a total of 38 years. The character is widely described as ruthless, and while loving to those he holds dear, is considered a villain. Over the years, he has also been the center of several controversial plots and relationships.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor arrived in Genoa City, Wisconsin for business, and he eventually formed his own worldwide conglomerate, Newman Enterprises. After his first marriage to Julia Newman (Meg Bennett), he formed a romance with stripper Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). Their union developed into a supercouple pairing, which has lasted over three decades. He shares two children with Nikki, Victoria (Amelia Heinle) and Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). During his first marriage to her, he cheated with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). He has also had a long-standing romantic history with Ashley, and they share a child together, Abby Newman (Melissa Ordway). He was briefly married to a woman named Hope Wilson (Signy Coleman) and they had a son together, Adam Newman (Justin Hartley), who grew up without knowledge of Victor being his father. He is also known for his long-standing business rivalry with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman). Victor has had several other romantic relationships, including one with his former daughter-in-law Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), which was poorly received by the actors and public.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidered an icon and leading man of the soap opera genre, Braeden's distinct performance of Victor has garnered widespread praise from critics, who have described him as legendary and \\"enthralling\\". Victor is famously characterized for his power-hungry ways and low-toned voice. Because of the character's popularity, he was made a spokesperson for the Canadian discount store Zellers. Apart from popularity and critical praise, Braeden has also garnered numerous accolades for his performance; most notably a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, presented to him in 2007.[1] He has been nominated at the Daytime Emmy Awards eight times for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, having won the award in 1998.[2] He has been pre-nominated three times in this category. Additionally, he was the recipient of the \\"Favorite Male Performer In A Daytime Serial\\" award at the 18th Annual People's Choice Awards in 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam J. Bell created Victor as a short-term non-contractual role, debuting on February 8, 1980.[3][4][5][6] Bell stated in 1997, \\"[Victor] would last between eight to twelve weeks, at which time he was to be shot by his wife.\\" However, once he saw Braeden's performance, he thought \\"the voice, the power, the inner strength\\", and knew he didn't want to lose the actor; \\"The first thing was to get Eric under contract, but he didn't want to go under contract\\", he said. However, Braeden was uneasy about the daytime soap opera genre, admitting years later he thought it was \\"too confining\\";[7] although soon signed a six-month contract. Bell immediately changed Victor's storyline to salvage, redeem and develop the character.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam J. Bell created Victor as a \\"despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser\\".[4] The soap opera's official website notes: \\"Victor is loving and protective toward family and loved ones, but if crossed, or if Victor feels that one is not living up to one's full potential; then he can more than live up to the adjective that many have used to describe him ruthless.\\"[8] The Los Angeles Times characterizes him as \\"charming but complicated\\",[9] while others publications have described him as a villain, as well as an evil, powerful and ruthless character.[10] Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote that Victor is a male chauvinist.[11] Although he is often considered malicious, Braeden stated that \\"Bill Bell was a very wise man\\" and that \\"he created someone in Victor who is a very lonely man yet also a man who can be affectionate and loving and forgiving\\".[12] Shelly Fralic of the Winnipeg Free Press described Victor in 2009, stating:[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nFralic also described the character as being \\"quixotic\\", who is \\"deeply layered with arrogance and angst, imbued with all the failings and bravado that a true villain possesses, his dastardly deeds leaving him most recently responsible not only for the death of his own heart donor, but for the near-death of his granddaughter Summer from peanut poisoning\\". She also noted that he's been jailed, thrown in a psychiatric ward and shot, had amnesia, epilepsy among other events, but \\"like all villains worth their salt, he's survived it all and inspired respect, if not adoration\\".[13] Braeden describes the character as \\"the villain\\" and as \\"defensive and always self-protective\\", stating that he's \\"not here to win a popularity contest\\". He stated that he enjoys portraying Victor \\"more than anything\\", also describing him as \\"very complex\\". Braeden said that \\"he fought himself to the position he arrived at a number of years ago\\", and that \\"he obviously doesn't suffer fools easily, doesn't suffer enemies easily. He wants relationships badly, but doesn't quite trust them. It's a tragic flaw in him because of his childhood.\\"[14] The actor, comparing himself to the character, noted that he is nothing like Victor, stating: \\"Money makes a lot of things happen for Victor. My God almighty, that's something else that I, Eric Braeden, would never do. I always confront things directly. But when that doesn't work for Victor, he gets out his wallet [...] If you are abusive to him, he will be abusive to you. No one gets away with that. I will not allow anyone to cross that line with the character.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2011, Michael Logan of TV Guide felt that Victor was \\"pushing it with the fans\\", stating: \\"The megalomaniacal patriarch earned considerable viewer backlash last month when he threw his ex-wife [Diane] from the back of an ambulance and left her bruised and bloodied.\\"[12] In an interview with Logan, Braeden stated that Victor \\"doesn't give a shit\\" and \\"he doesn't take any shit\\", saying that is \\"the whole point of the character\\". The actor also stated he does not like women defeating Victor, admitting that he wasn't pleased in a 2003 scene where his daughter Victoria (portrayed by Heather Tom) slaps him.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor over three decades, Victor has been romantically linked with Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). Nikki was originally from the lower walks of life, having been a stripper. After multiple failed relationships, she began a romance with Victor, who taught her about society.[15] They fall in love and have a child, Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), and later a son, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow).[15] The couple are widely considered a supercouple within the soap opera media. The writers of The Young and the Restless detailed their characters to marry and divorce or depart from each other in some form or fashion in a continuous cycle, which is a take on the original supercouple formula.[16] Soap Opera Digest relayed the beginning of the pairing's creation and their impact, described as an \\"inspired decision\\", led to Victor and Nikki becoming the series' most successful supercouple.[17] In an interview with Dose magazine, Scott said that the couple always has to get back together, but not without a challenge.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor and Nikki are recognized as one of daytime television's most prominent couples.[19] They have also garnered a large fan following, dubbed \\"Niktor\\" by viewers.[20] In addition, the couple's weddings have been reported by mainstream media.[21][22] Scott has said: \\"Lets face facts:  Victor and Nikki will always be a huge dynamic, theyve been in a circular cycle for over 30 years!  Finding a new leading man that you have chemistry with is like finding gold.\\"[23] In a 1994 interview with The Los Angeles Times, the newspaper reported that Victor's relationship with Nikki had \\"registered an enduring appeal among viewers\\", with Braeden replying that, \\"Arguably, it's the idea of this incredibly powerful, wealthy man taking a woman who comes from the wrong side of the tracks into his life, and shaping her and forming her more to his liking. But, of course, no one can shape or form anyone, she remains who she is, has retained her strength, and that causes conflict.\\"[24] In other interviews, Braeden stated that he loves working with Scott and that he \\"always thought it was an honestly felt love story with great material for conflict with Nikki\\".[25] He also stated in an interview that he considers Victor's storylines with Nikki to be some of his favorites.[26] Discussing Victor and Nikki's union, former As the World Turns actress Martha Byrne stated: \\"Young and Restless' Victor and Nikki are the perfect example of a couple who they can tear apart and put back together how many times? And [the writers] do it really well because they're so stable as characters that you can basically do anything with them now, and the audience will go on the journey with them.\\"[27] The Museum of Television and Radio wrote: \\"Combined with a series of social-issue storylines covering everything from AIDS to date rape to the plight of the elderly, as well as featuring a group of popular young African-American characters, and several long-term romantic and professional relationships, Victor and Nikki's love story has kept viewers enthralled for many years.\\" They also described their relationship as being a \\"dominant force\\" in the soap opera.[28] Daytime journalist Michael Fairman stated: \\"Victor and Nikki just cant, we mean cant, ever get it together long enough to find any happiness with each other. So, many would say that they deserve each other and the baggage and betrayals that come along with their co-dependent relationship.\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from Nikki, Victor is known for his relationship with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). While Ashley was at a low point in her life, he had an affair with her.[30] This led to her pregnancy, which he left Nikki for. However, Nikki was diagnosed with cancer and he returned to her, and Ashley aborted her baby; a move she regretted for many years. Ashley stole his sperm many years later, and had a child, Abby Carlton.[31] Abby was believed to be Brad Carlton's (Don Diamont) daughter until she was five years old. Victor was married to Ashley from 1990 to 1993. In 2008, Victor married Sabrina Costelana (Raya Meddine), which was short-lived following her accidental death. Afterward, he left town and Ashley tracked him down when nobody else could. They reconnected their romantic relationship, later remarried and Ashley became pregnant. Davidson stated she was surprised by Ashley's pregnancy, but decided to like the storyline as it was unexpected.[32] Victor and Ashley's second marriage ended after she miscarried the child.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor was noted for his controversial relationship with both of his sons' ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), with whom he initially had a  father-daughter relationship.[34][35] In 2003, Victor and Sharon shared a kiss,[34] causing issues in her marriage to Nicholas; she left town to \\"find herself\\". Victor supported Sharon throughout her legal problems, and paid her bail at first when she was wrongly convicted of murder in 2011.[36] Case stated that she thinks Sharon thinks of Victor \\"in a way like a father figure, but not quite. When she was younger she saw him as that, and then when she grew up she saw him less as a father and more like a hero\\", also stating that Victor is Sharon's \\"security blanket\\".[37] The dynamic of their relationship changed when Victor proposed a platonic marriage to Sharon in December 2011,[38] and while they end up marrying, but it is annulled shortly after.[39] However, months after the annulment, they begin a genuine romance. Joshua Morrow, who portrays Nicholas, told Soaps In Depth that he was \\"always kind of surprised that Nick just accepted this from his dad\\", and that \\"there were never any scenes showing legitimate anger\\".[40] Braeden didn't agree with the pairing either, stating that, \\"We all have gone through periods of playing something we didn't really like to play so much, but you do it.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps said that the relationship \\"hasnt worked out or caught fire through the writing, or with the fans watching on-screen!\\"[42] In August 2012, Victor and Sharon married a second time, and when he disappeared shortly after, she thought he was abandoning her.[43] Sharon later burned their prenuptial agreement, and took over this company. Talking about the situation, Case stated that the writers could have done this storyline \\"a million other ways\\" without \\"marrying him [Victor]\\".[41] In another interview, she spoke thoroughly of the relationship, labeling it incestuous. She stated: \\"Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you're bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things. Everybody is universally against incest! It was just so upsetting to the audience. Whenever the actors went to do [personal appearances], the fans would bring it up. Literally, every actor in the building was coming up to me, giving me feedback that they were getting about it!\\"[44] When asked if the marriage was about \\"daddy issues\\", Case said: \\"That's usually the case in a story like that, but I don't think it's one most people want to watch!\\"[44] Victor later returned home and annulled their second marriage. During an interview with The Province, Michael Muhney, who portrays Victor's son Adam, said that Victor and Sharon's marriage was \\"almost like an inside joke\\".[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, Braeden experienced multiple contract negotiation issues, leading to former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell writing both Victor and Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) out of the series.[46] Their departures were reportedly due to sudden salary cuts in the middle of already negotiated contracts.[46][47] During his onscreen absence, contract negotiations ensued with unknown predictions from the series.[46] On the situation of the soap cutting his contract, Braeden stated during an interview: \\"When I sign a three-year deal, I'm obligated to fulfill that deal. The producers, however, can come to me after a half-year and say, 'We've changed our minds.' Where in the world of business does this kind of contract exist? Do I blame the people for wanting to squeeze as much out of us as they can? I do not. The question is, when do you squeeze too much?\\"[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another interview with Soap Opera Digest, the actor spoke thoroughly of his departure, saying: \\"It's not that one hadn't agreed to a reduction, but they hit you with a sledgehammer. It's done in such an insulting fashion. It could have been dealt with in a far more gracious way. It is cold and hard-nosed... The whole thing was so calculated it was unbelievable... It's not even about the money.\\"[48] Despite this, during contract negotiations, Braeden refused to say that he had departed fully, but did not know when a return would occur.[47] However, within weeks, news broke that the actor and the series had managed a new contract.[49] In a statement issued by CBS Daytime, they said: \\"We're very happy that Eric will be remaining with The Young and the Restless. Victor Newman has been an important part of the Genoa City canvas for nearly 30 years, and we know our audience will be tuning in to see what his plans are next.\\"[49] Onscreen, Braeden exited November 2, 2009,[49] and made his return on January 15, 2010.[50] That same year, the actor celebrated thirty years on the soap opera.[51] In 2012, Braeden experienced further contract negotiations and speculation arose again that he would be leaving.[52] Published reports said that Victor would be absent from the canvas for two weeks and that his contract expired that November.[52] Two months later, it was announced that the actor had signed a new contract with The Young and the Restless,[53] furthering his portrayal of Victor for an unspecified period of time. Braeden stated that he was \\"very glad we got the negotiations successfully behind us\\".[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor Newman was born Christian Miller on March 7, 1947 in Buffalo, New York. He was put in an orphanage by his mother, Cora Miller (Dorothy McGuire), when he was seven years old.[8] His father was Albert Miller.[54] By the time he was a teenager, he left the orphanage and started to work his way through to becoming one of the world's wealthiest tycoons. He changed his name to \\"Victor Christian Newman,\\" Victor standing for \\"victorious\\" and Newman standing for \\"new man,\\" as he was a completely new man.[8] In 1970, Victor married Julia Newman (Meg Bennet) as he began to develop a strong business reputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1980, Victor and his wife Julia move to Genoa City to help Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) run her company, Chancellor Industries. Julia felt neglected by Victor and sleeps with her photographer, a man named Michael. Victor created his own company, Newman Enterprises, and ended up cheating on Julia as well, with Eve Howard (Margaret Mason) and later Lorie Brooks (Jaime Lyn Bauer). Julia became pregnant and it is assumed that it was Michael's child; Victor attacks him and Julia loses the child, revealed to actually have been Victor's. Eve later has a child, Cole Howard (J. Eddie Peck), believed to be Victor's son. Julia and Victor divorce and she leaves town with Michael, just as Victor begins a romance with stripper Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). Having been from the lower walks of life, Victor teaches Nikki about society. He later takes over the Prentiss family company, Prentiss Industries, and they scheme to get it back by using Lorie to seduce Victor into a marriage. On their wedding day, Victor signs the company back over to them and Lorie stands him up. Victor then tries returns to Nikki, who recently married Kevin Bancroft. Nikki ended up pregnant with Victor's child, but she ended up being manipulated into a marriage Tony DiSalvo to save her relationship with Kevin. Nikki later gives birth to a daughter named Victoria Newman (Ashley Nicole Millan). Nikki also later got involved with a man named Rick Daros, who nearly killed her before being saved by Victor. Eve Howard returns with her boyfriend, demanding that money be allocated to Cole in Victor's will, and later takes a job as his assistant, which prompts Julia to return to protect Victor. He planned to marry Eve but faked his death on the day of their wedding, and ends up marrying Nikki in April 1984. The following year, while Victor and Nikki are vacationing, Eve reappears with Rick, and they end up stealing money from them and escaping. Nikki facilitates Victor's reunion with his mother, Cora Miller, before her death.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite loving Nikki, Victor begins to fall for Ashley Abbott (Brenda Epperson) and they have an affair, enraging Nikki to sleep with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Ashley's brother and Victor's business rival. Ashley becomes pregnant and Victor leaves Nikki, but when Nikki is diagnosed with cancer, Victor returns to her and Ashley aborts the child. When Nikki goes into remission, Victor wanted to be with Ashley, who had moved on with her psychiatrist Steven Lassiter (Rod Arrants); Steven later dies, and while Ashley wanted Victor back, he had returned to Nikki in an attempted to salvage their marriage, resulting in the birth of their son Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Victor and Jack later hire Leanna Love (Barbara Crampton) to write a biography on Victor, when in reality, Jack wanted the book to be a tell-all expos on Victor. Leanna later writes a chapter about Victor's affair with Ashley and Nikki's illness, causing Victor to believe Nikki was behind the publication. He divorces her and marries Leanna to prove to the press that he didnt want to be with Ashley; their marriage was invalid, as the divorce wasnt finalized. Victor later takes over Jack's family company, Jabot Cosmetics, replacing him with Brad Carlton (Don Diamont). As a result, Jack spitefully marries Nikki, causing her relationship with Victor to become bitter. Victor marries Ashley, and years later; he tells Jack that he will give him back Jabot Cosmetics if he divorces Nikki. He agrees to do so, but Jack wasnt given full control of the company due to a legal loophole. Victor has a heart attack during a confrontation with Jack, and while he leaves him for dead, Victor recovers. As Jack and Nikki's marriage strained to due her alcoholism and pain killer addiction, she reconnected with Victor, who had decided to divorce Ashley.\\r\\n\\r\\nEve later returned to town again with her now-grown son Cole, who romanced Victor's daughter Victoria, unaware he was believed to be Victor's son. Victor later left Genoa City and traveled to Kansas, letting Nikki and the rest of the Newman family believe he had died. He meets Hope Adams (Signy Coleman). They returned to Genoa City and married. While Victor was in Kansas, Cole and Victoria had eloped, and when Victor revealed their sibling relation, the marriage was annulled. However, when Eve died, it was revealed that Cole was never Victor's son; Victoria and Cole remarry. Victor and Hope later have a son, Victor Adam Newman Jr. Hope wanted to return to Kansas and Victor was not interested; he divorced her and Victor Jr. was raised without knowing Victor was his father. Nikki had been engaged to Brad, much to Victor's dismay. On their wedding night, Victor was shot and Nikki returned to him; the mentally unstable Mari Jo Mason (Diana Barton) was revealed as the gunwoman. Victor and Nikki briefly reunite before he returns to Kansas after Hope's new husband, Cliff Wilson, had died. In 1997, Victor marries Diane Jenkins (Alex Donnelley), Jack's ex-girlfriend. Nikki had Victor have a vasectomy, but had frozen sperm for a future possibility. Nikki later marries Joshua Landers (Heath Kizzier), and in 1998, she is shot by Joshua's ex-wife, Veronica Landers (Candice Daly); Victor divorces Diane to marry Nikki on her deathbed, promising to remarry Diane after Nikki's death. When Nikki survived, their second marriage was invalidated, as Victor and Diane's divorce was never processed. Victor and Diane begin a bitter divorce over many months, during which Nikki reunites with Brad, and he and Jack take control of Newman Enterprises.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiane remained in love with Victor, and stole his frozen sperm to artificially inseminate herself. Unbeknownst to her, Ashley had also stolen Victor's sperm to inseminate herself. Diane gave birth to Christian Victor Newman, but was shocked to discover the sperm shed stolen was that of Jack. Ashley had received Victor's actual sperm sample and gives birth to Abby Carlton, whom she decides to pass off as Brad's child. Victor and Nikki later reunite, and in 2002, Maxwell Hollister (Sam Behrens) attempts to destroy Victor, using his estranged wife, revealed to be Lorie Brooks, in his plot. Originally, Max attempted to lead a hostile takeover of Julia Newman Martin's design firm, which Victor prevented. Now, Max used Lorie to keep Victor and Nikki apart, but Lorie could not follow through, and a ruined Max ends up leaving town. Months after, Victor and Nikki remarry in front of all of their loved ones. Ashley reveals that Abby is in fact Victor's daughter as she was diagnosed with cancer, and he welcomes her with open arms. After rescuing Nikki from a carjacker, Victor is diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. Victor and Nikki's marriage slowly strained as he was caught up in taking Jabot Cosmetics away from Jack, dealing with NVP Retreats, and Nikki's campaign for State Senator, which resulted in an affair with her campaign manager David Chow. Victor and Nikki eventually divorce after six years in 2008. Soon after, Hope dies and Victor's estranged son, now known as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), comes to Genoa City and works at Newman Enterprises.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor later falls in love with Sabrina Costelana (Raya Meddine), but she dies in a car accident with Nikki's devious husband, David Chow. Victor travels to Mexico and nearly dies, and Ashley is able to find him; they end up rekindling their romance. They remarried when Ashley became pregnant, but she miscarries when Adam gaslights her into having a hysterical pregnancy, but convinced her that she was still pregnant. Despite Adam stealing Nicholas daughter, Faith, and passing her off as Ashley's, she and Victor divorce as he reunites with Nikki again. Victor was later shot by Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk) and needed a heart transplant, receiving Colleen Carltons (Tammin Sursok) heart. Victor and Nikki left for treatment in Europe, and upon their return, Adam's scheme was revealed and he faked his death. Victor went searching for him in Canada and met Meggie McClaine (Sean Young); he brings her to Genoa City and she works as Nikki's assistant, but causes her to relapse into alcoholism. In reality, Meggie was trying to foil Victor and Nikki's union to marry him for his money. Victor marries her, but has her arrested soon after; Nikki moves on with Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan). Afterward, Victor's children file a lawsuit against him over a cosmetics line, which they win.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiane (Maura West), who had returned to Genoa City, reconnects with Victor and they remarry, however, it is annulled shortly after she finds him sleeping with Nikki and Victor learns of her affair with Tucker McCall (Stephen Nichols) and Jack. Afterward, Victor sends Nikki to a rehabilitation center for her alcoholism. Diane is murdered in August 2011, with Victor as a suspect. Nikki in fact murdered Diane in self-defense, causing Victor to falsely confess to murdering her to protect Nikki. While in jail, Victor marries his former daughter-in-law, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to push Nikki away, however when the entire murder plot is revealed, Nikki is not charged and Victor is freed. Victor and Sharon's marriage is annulled and he reunites with Nikki, however, she leaves him when some of his past schemes involving Victoria's marriage are exposed. To gain control of the cosmetics line Beauty of Nature, Victor slept with Genevieve Atkinson (Genie Francis). When Nikki reunites with Jack, Victor develops a genuine romance with Sharon to spite her. They marry a second time, however he disappears from town shortly after and Sharon believed he was abandoning her. She burned their prenuptial agreement and took over Newman Enterprises, while Jack and Tucker were buying up its stocks. While away, Victor had lost his memory and was working as a dock worker in Los Angeles; he was demanding better working conditions and the other workers planned to have him killed in an explosion, as a result, Genoa City believed Victor had died, but he returned shortly after. Upon his return, he annuls his marriage to Sharon and reunites with Nikki, just before Jack announces he is taking over Newman Enterprises, firing all of the Newman family and instating Adam. However, due to his addiction to pain killers, Jack gave up control of the company, leaving it to Adam.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor and Nikki finally remarry in March 2013 just before she is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. At their wedding, an assassin attempts to shoot Victor, but Adam takes the bullet and nearly dies for his father. As a result, he offers Victor the position of co-CEO at Newman, and they begin working together. However, their partnership ends several months later when Victor discovers that Adam's silent partner used to take Newman private again was Jack. Victor fears that Adam and Jack have been scheming to take back the company for themselves without Victor. In retaliating, Victor, who now owns Chancellor Industries according to Katherine Chancellor's will, has all major Newman clients sign to Chancellor, as Victor leaves Newman worthless so he could build up Chancellor. Adam signs over his shares in Newman over to Victor, who plans to merge Chancellor Industries with Newman. Nikki then reveals she gave birth to another son decades earlier before she was with Victor, revealed to be Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton). A subsidiary of the newly merged conglomerate, named Bonaventure Industries, later produced an illegal speed drug that Summer Newman (Hunter King) ended up overdosing on. Jack reported Victor to the FDA and he and his company were put under investigation. Dylan's supposed father and Nikki's former lover Ian Ward (Ray Wise) then arrives in town and causes pandemonium, to which Victor tries to get him out of town. It was later revealed that Victor had hired a lookalike to his granddaughter Cassie, named Mariah Copeland (Camryn Grimes), to haunt Sharon and learn a supposed secret she has. When his scheme is revealed, Nick and Sharon shun him and Nikki decides to move out for a while, but she and Victor later reunite. Victor and Nikki later learn that Ian is incapable of fathering children, leading to confusion. It is later revealed that Paul Williams (Doug Davidson), Nikki's ex-lover and longtime friend, is in fact Dylan's father, causing tension in Victor and Nikki's marriage, which continues when Victor goes to extensive lengths to awaken Phyllis (Gina Tognoni) from a coma in order to find out more information on Sharon's supposed secret. Nikki falls off the wagon and begins drinking again; she leaves Victor and refuses to take him back. Victor also sells Chancellor Industries back to Jill (Jess Walton), leaving the rest of the Newman family confused as to why he gave Chancellor up so easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Victor has Jack kidnapped and replaced by a lookalike, who turns out to be a Peruvian drug lord named Marco Annicelli, all in order for him to take over Jabot Cosmetics and merge it with Newman, becoming Newman Abbott Enterprises. Meanwhile, Victor and his children discover that Nikki has fallen off the wagon; they convince her to quit drinking again and she and Victor end up reuniting. Jack makes his way back to Genoa City just as Victor learns that Marco is dangerous; he plans on shooting Marco dead in the park, but it is actually Jack who he ends up shooting, who had finally returned to confront him. Jack ends up falling comatose while Victor frantically tries to get rid of Marco, who continues to masquerade around town. When Jack awakens, he reluctantly agrees to help Victor get Marco out of town and back in prison, which they end up doing successfully. With the real Jack back in Genoa City, the Newman Abbott merger comes to an end and both companies return to their separate states. Meanwhile, Adam, who had returned to town under the false identity of Gabriel Bingham, had teamed up with Ian (who had escaped prison) to create a computer virus to destroy Newman Enterprises for separate revenge on both their parts; the virus was known as the Paragon project, which later led to the revelation that \\"Gabriel\\" is in fact Adam. He agrees to stop Paragon, but Ian makes no such promise; on Halloween, when a party was being thrown in the Newman Enterprises ballroom, Ian is responsible for the building catching fire and a great panic ensuing. As a result, Ashley and Billy (Burgess Jenkins) offer to share office space at Jabot with Newman while the Newman building is being repaired, but Victor refuses to trust them. It is later revealed that Billy revived Paragon as an act of revenge against Victor, leading to Jack firing him and Victor filing a lawsuit against Jabot.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood News Weekly on Victor Newman (2010)\\r\\n\\r\\nChris Jancelewicz of The Huffington Post described Victor as \\"the very definition of daytime TV icon\\" and noted that, \\"Even people who have never seen an episode in their lives know his name, his face, and his powerful low voice.\\"[56] In the early 1990s, he was described as a heartthrob.[57] He is credited as being one of the soap opera world's leading stars.[58] Jamey Giddens of Zap2it considers Braeden the soap opera's leading male.[59] Tommy Garrett of Highlight Hollywood stated that Braeden \\"is known in the industry as the biggest daytime leading man of all time\\".[60] In 1993, Nancy Reichardt of The Los Angeles Times stated: \\"Victor Newman is one of those characters. When Eric Braeden first came on the show in the role, Victor was a villain, and what a villain! His portrayal proved so dynamic that this \\"minor\\" plot point has been ignored over the years. Today, Braeden is one of the show's leading men. The character has never lost his edge, but his knife-wielding days are long forgotten.\\"[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, The Museum of Television and Radio wrote that with the arrival of the character, who was an \\"enigmatic stranger popular with women\\", \\"the show's revived tableau was complete\\", saying it was an \\"amazingly seamless transition\\" and praised William J. Bell for the character's introduction.[28] Deanna Barnert of MSN Entertainment wrote of Braeden's tenure: \\"Eric Braeden first signed onto The Young and the Restless in 1980 for a mini-stint as a baddy, but stayed on to change the game in Genoa City forever, becoming one of daytime's most recognizable forces on and off screen.\\"[62] In 2010, Global News wrote that, \\"From the early days of The Young and the Restless, Victor Newman has been a symbol of power in Genoa City.\\"[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nBraeden's biography at Yahoo! notes that upon his casting as the ruthless businessman Victor, he \\"clicked with both the audience and the creative powers, and has been one of the series leading men for close to two decades\\".[64] Kim Muraro of LimeLife stated that instead of his originally planned three-month stay at the series, he \\"has become one of the most iconic characters in daytime TV\\".[65] Garrett, writing from Canyon News, wrote: \\"[Braeden] plays the mastermind mogul with real gusto. His innate acting skills are as legendary as his distinguished career. This week, we saw Braeden play ruthless, conniving and ultimately a loving father.\\"[66] Good News Weekly wrote: \\"There are some men that are larger than life. There are some men that transcend the TV screen. There are some men that touch the lives of millions of viewers. Victor Newman is one of those men.\\"[55] In 2005, Lynette Rice of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Braeden has transformed the character into a \\"global phenom\\".[67] BuddyTV noted the storyline where Victor locked his wife Julia's lover in a bomb shelter as \\"the turning point\\" in the character's life, making him a villain.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character of Victor has been used as a spokesperson for the Canadian discount store Zellers and appeared in an advert for it.[55] The commercials aired in November 1998.[69] In the adverts, Victor breaks the proverbial fourth wall, and begins speaking to the Zellers shopper on the other side of the television screen, praising her admirable combination of style and thrift. He steps closer and squashes his nose against the camera lens. According to the website StrategyOnline, the promotional ad campaign for Zellers featuring Victor proved to be the most popular installment to date as of May 1999; the staff of StrategyOnline wrote that the campaign \\"has garnered considerable praise in the marketing community ÿ and small wonder. Not only does it perform the considerable task of balancing an affordability message with strong branding, it does so in a category seldom noted for the quality of strategic thinking that goes into its advertising.\\"[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor's pairing with Nikki has received positive reviews from critics throughout the years; The News & Advance cited Victor and Nikki with other romances considered \\"epic\\" of the early supercouple era.[70] Global News wrote of their long-standing relationship, \\"Victor is the consummate womanizer and has been a part of many relationships over the years. Nonetheless, his heart belongs to one woman alone, the stunning Nikki Reed. Despite true love and good intention, the relationship between Victor and Nikki has always been troubled by poor timing and miscommunication.\\"[63] In 1990, The Washington Times wrote that, \\"Victor Newman's sudden marriage to Ashley Abbott fooled us all.\\"[71] In 1995, Sports Illustrated wrote of Victor's marriage to Hope, saying a \\"man with that much power could have married anyone, but he fell in love with a blind woman. Not for what she is, but who she's about.\\"[72] In 2002, Entertainment Weekly wrote that the soap opera was \\"keeping it real\\" with Victor and Nikki's third wedding.[73] Upon their fourth wedding in 2013, the magazine stated: \\"Say what you will about Victor (and weve all said a lot), but the ol boy definitely knows who is best for him  Nikki.\\"[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Victor's rivalry with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Allison Waldman of AOL TV said: \\"After all, their characters' on screen feud has been the stuff of soap legend. Victor and Jack have shared wives, corporations, but mostly, unabashed hatred. They despise each other.\\"[75] Additionally, Waldman wrote: \\"Braeden's contribution to the show these past three decades really cannot be understated. He's been a driving force as Victor primarily because he's a villain who's not quite pure evil. He has a heart and on occasion shows a vulnerability that makes him likable and even sympathetic\\" but \\"like a big jungle cat, he is not one to be tamed. That's why at any point, Victor can turn on someone he once professed to love [...] See, that's Victor. He makes viewers crazy with his actions, but he's so dynamic and interesting, that you can't stop watching him. Thank you, Eric Braeden. You are Victor and you have made him completely compelling for 30 years.\\"[75] In another article, Waldman called Braeden one of the biggest stars in the soap opera business.[76] Victor has adopted several nicknames on the show that have carried into the media. This includes \\"The Mustache\\" and \\"The Dark Night\\".[56] When asked which storyline he felt affinity for or strongly about in his thirty years during an interview with AOL TV, Braeden stated it was the scenes in which he met his dying mother, Cora Miller (Dorothy McGuire), for the first time since he was seven years old.[77] The actor credited it as the turning point of his career on the show, describing it as \\"a deeply-felt scene\\" and something he would never forget. He said:[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen asked during the same interview why he believed Victor had so much commercial appeal, Braeden responded: \\"I really don't know. I've always been a very emotional actor, in other words, the only criterion I go by when I film scenes is to make them as believable and real as possible. Maybe it's that. Maybe ÿ and I'm not sure if there's any truth to this ÿ but people can perhaps sense that I've seen a lot in my life. I've been through a lot, and maybe for that reason I can feel empathy.\\"[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nTommy Garrett of Highlight Hollywood also compared his performance to his portrayal of John Jacob Astor IV in the 1997 film Titanic, stating that the performances are \\"equally enthralling\\".[78] A writer from The Age describes Victor's voice as \\"gravel\\".[79] Toby Goldstein of The Orlando Sentinel stated that Victor is one of the characters contributing to the soap opera's longtime popularity.[80] Shelley Fralic of the Winnipeg Free Press named Braeden along with Susan Lucci (who portrayed Erica Kane on All My Children) to be the soap opera genre's biggest icons.[13] Fralic stated that he is the \\"eye of the Genoa City hurricane\\" and that \\"the thought of Y&R without Victor Newman ÿ his character is recovering from a heart transplant and was going to \\"disappear\\" to Belgium for rehabilitation ÿ is hard to imagine, rather like Dallas without J.R. Ewing, or The Sopranos without Tony.\\"[13]","input":"When did victor newman first appear on the young and the restless?"},{"output":"SI metric units","context":"Metrication in Australia effectively began in 1966 with the conversion to decimal currency under the auspices of the Decimal Currency Board.[1] The conversion of measurementsmetricationcommenced subsequently in 1971, under the direction of the Metric Conversion Board and actively proceeded until the Board was disbanded in 1981.\\r\\nBefore 1970, Australia mostly used the imperial system for measurement, which the Australian colonies had inherited from the United Kingdom. Between 1970 and 1988, imperial units were withdrawn from general legal use and replaced with SI metric units, facilitated through legislation and government agencies. SI units are now the sole legal units of measurement in Australia. Australia's largely successful transition to the metric system contrasts with the ongoing opposition to metrication in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there was debate in Australia's first Parliament after federation to consider adopting the metric system,[2] metric units first became legal for use in Australia in 1947 when Australia signed the Metre Convention (or Convention du Mtre). However, Imperial \\"Weights and Measures\\" were most commonly used until the Commonwealth government began the metric changeover in the 1970s. In 1960, SI units were adopted as a worldwide system of measurement by international agreement at the General Conference on Weights and Measures. The metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin,[nb 1] candela and mole were defined as base units in this system and units formed from combinations of these base units were known as \\"derived units\\". SI units were subsequently adopted as the basis for Australia's measurement standards, whereby they were defined as Australia's legal units of measurement.[3]\\r\\nIn 1968, a Select Committee of the Australian Senate examined metric \\"Weights and Measures\\" and came to the unanimous conclusion that it was both practical and desirable for Australia to change to the metric system. Some of their considerations included the \\"inherent advantages of the metric system\\" that meant that weighing and measuring was facilitated, \\"often with substantial increases in efficiency\\". Educationally, the reform would \\"simplify and unify the teaching of mathematics and science, reduce errors, save teaching time and give a better understanding of basic physical principles\\". In 1968, more than 75% of Australia's exports went to metric countries, and at that time it was noted that all countries except the United States were metric or were converting to the metric system. It was also noted that because of Australia's large migrant programme, more than 10 per cent of people over 16 years of age had used the metric system before coming to Australia. They also noted that school pupils were widely familiar with the metric system because it had been taught in the schools for many years.[4]\\r\\nBy 1968, metrication was already well under way in Australian industry. The pharmaceutical industry had metricated in 1965 and much of the chemical and electronics industries worked in metric unitsthere being no \\"Imperial\\" units for the latter. One of the country's major automobile manufacturers had already declared its intention to metricate before the Government announced its decision to change to the metric system. \\"The change itself provided a unique opportunity to rationalise and modernise industrial practices and bring Australia's technical standard specifications into accord with those adopted internationally\\".[4]\\r\\nOn 12 June 1970, the Australian Metric Conversion Act passed by the Australian Parliament was given assent. This Act created the Metric Conversion Board to facilitate the conversion of measurements from imperial to metric. A timeline of major developments in this conversion process is as follows:[2]\\r\\nThe Metric Conversion Board spent A$5.955 million during its 11 years of operation, and the federal government distributed $10 million to the states to support their conversion process. The cost of metrication for the private sector was not determined but the Prices Justification Tribunal reported that metrication was not used to justify price increases.[7]\\r\\nOpposition to metrication was not widespread.[7] The Metric Conversion Board did not proceed with education programmes as polling revealed that most people were learning units and their application independently of each other, rendering efforts to teach the systematic nature of the metric system unnecessary and possibly increasing the amount of opposition.[7]\\r\\nThe Metric Conversion Board was dissolved in 1981, but the conversion to the metric system was not completed until 1988. Between 1984 and 1988, the conversion was the responsibility of the National Standards Commission, later renamed the National Measurement Institute. In 1987, real estate became the last major industry to convert, and, in 1988, the few remaining imperial units were removed from general use.\\r\\nRestrictions of volume and masses that had previously compelled manufacturers to package products to rounded imperial sizes despite metric labelling, for example packaging a soft drink can as a rounded 13 imp fl oz but labelling it as 375 ml, were removed in 2008.[citation needed]\\r\\nAn early change was the metrication of horse racing. This was facilitated because the furlong (one eighth of a mile) is close to 200 m. Therefore, the Melbourne Cup was changed from 2 miles (3,219?m) to 3,200?m (1.988?mi), a reduction of 18.688 metres (61.312?ft) or about 0.58%. The first metric Melbourne Cup was raced in November 1972.[8]\\r\\nWhen the Australian Bureau of Meteorology was enlisted to introduce the metric system for weather reporting and forecasts, its public relations officer, Godfrey Wiseman, coined a series of jingles to educate the public, using the terms \\"frosty fives\\", \\"tingling tens\\", \\"temperate twenties\\", \\"thirsty thirties\\" and \\"fiery forties\\" to describe human sensation to temperatures in degrees Celsius. This was very successful because the public soon became aware of the significance of the descriptions.\\r\\nAs the culmination of this campaign, weather reports and forecasts in both Imperial and metric measures were only provided for one month. After that, purely metric measurements were used for temperature, wind speed, rainfall, air pressure and other meteorological phenomena.[9]\\r\\nAn important and very visible sign of metric conversion in Australia was the change in road signs and the accompanying traffic regulations; \\"M-day\\" for this change was 1 July 1974. Because of careful planning, almost every road sign in Australia was converted within a month. This was achieved by installing covered metric signs alongside the imperial signs before the change and then removing the imperial sign and uncovering the metric sign during the month of conversion.\\r\\nWhile road signs could not all be changed at the same time, there was little chance of confusion as to what any speed limit sign meant during this short change-over period. This was because the previous (MPH) signs had the signage in black on white and were rectangular, in the same style as current US speed limit signs, while the (km/h) signs which replaced them had the number indicating the speed limit inside a red circle, as is done in Europe.[10]\\r\\nRoad distance signs were also converted during this period. To avoid confusion as to whether the distance indicated was in miles or kilometres all the new kilometre signs had affixed to them a temporary yellow plate, on which was indicated the corresponding number of miles. These temporary plates were removed after about one year.\\r\\nExcept for bridge-clearance and flood-depth signs, dual marking was avoided. Though people opposed to metrication expressed the fear that ignorance of the meaning of metric speeds would lead to slaughter on the roads, this did not happen as most drivers under the age of 25 had been taught metric units at school and through them, their parents were familiar with metric speeds if not metric units as a whole.\\r\\nIt was believed that public education would be the most effective way of ensuring public safety. A Panel for Publicity on Road Travel, made up of the various motoring organisations, regulatory authorities and the media, planned a campaign to publicise the change. The resulting publicity campaign cost $200,000 and the Australian Government Department of Transport paid for it. The Board also produced 2.5 million copies of a pamphlet, \\"Motoring Goes Metric\\". This was distributed through post offices, police stations and motor registry offices.\\r\\n\\"For about a year before the change, motor car manufacturers fitted dual speedometers to their vehicles and, after 1974, all new cars were fitted with metric-only speedometers. Several kinds of speedometer conversion kits were available.\\r\\n\\"As a result of all these changes, conversion on the roads occurred without incident.\\"[11][12]\\r\\nThe building industry was the first major industry grouping in Australia to complete its change to metric. This was achieved within two years by January 1976 for all new buildings other than those for which design had commenced well before metrication began. The resulting savings for builders and their sub-contractors has been estimated at about 10% a year of gross turnover.[13]\\r\\nIn this the industry was grateful to the SAA (now Standards Australia) for the early production of the Standard AS 1155-1974 \\"Metric Units for Use in the Construction Industry\\", which specified the use of millimetres as the small unit for the metrication upgrade. In the adoption of the millimetre as the \\"small\\" unit of length for metrication (instead of the centimetre) the Metric Conversion Board leaned heavily on experience in the UK and within the ISO, where this decision had already been taken.[[Category:Articles with unsourced statements from October {{subst:2017}]][citation needed]\\r\\nThis was formally stated as follows: \\"The metric units for linear measurement in building and construction will be the metre (m) and the millimetre (mm), with the kilometre (km) being used where required. This will apply to all sectors of the industry, and the centimetre (cm) shall not be used.  the centimetre should not be used in any calculation and it should never be written down\\".[14]\\r\\nThe logic of using the millimetre in this context was that the metric system had been so designed that there would exist a multiple or submultiple for every use. Decimal fractions would not have to be used. Since the tolerances on building components and building practice would rarely be less than one millimetre, the millimetre became the sub-unit most appropriate to this industry.\\r\\nAlthough for the most part they are ignored in everyday life, it was not possible for education in the logical construction of the metric system to ignore the metric prefixes deci, centi, hecto and deka, since the derivation of the litre is dependent upon the knowledge that it derives from the volume of a cubic decimetre, i.e. 1000 cubic centimetres.\\r\\nHowever, in Australia, the prefix \\"centi\\" has been limited to use with the metre (mainly by the general public not associated with the building industry)unlike in Europe, where the centilitre may often be encountered.\\r\\nMetrication is mostly complete. Road signs solely use metric measurements, as do the speedometers and odometers in motor vehicles produced after 1974; There was no requirement for pre-1974 vehicles to have their speedometers and odometers converted to metric, so any remaining vehicles of this vintage will show miles.[citation needed] Privately imported vehicles, such as classic cars, also do not need to be so converted.[citation needed] The sale of oil and petrol is by the litre. However, vehicle tyre pressures are still commonly talked about in pounds per square inch.[15][16]\\r\\nFruits and vegetables are advertised, sold and weighed by the kilogram, groceries are packed and labelled in metric measures. Schooling is wholly metric. Newspaper reports are mostly in metric terms. In some cases old imperial standards were replaced with rounded metric values, as with horse racing or the size of beer glasses (rounded to the nearest 5?mL). The pre-metric names of beer glass sizes, including the pint, have been retained (although in South Australia the \\"pint\\" of beer is not an imperial pint, as it is elsewhere in Australia). Dressed timber is often sold in lengths such as 1.8, 2.1, 2.4, 3.0 and 3.6 metres, each multiples of 300?mm, thereby approximating foot length increments,[17] while pipes and conduits may be specified as having diameters of 12, 19, 25 and 32 etc. mm ? (based on \\"soft\\" conversions\\" of ?1?2, ?3?4, 1 and ?1?1?4?in).\\r\\nIn some cases goods manufactured to pre-metric standards are available, such as some bolts, nuts, screws[18][19] and pipe threads[20] and there are some instances where pre-metric measures may still be used:\\r\\nWhile Imperial units of measurements may sometimes be specified instead of SI units (usually, where the product originates from or is intended for an American market) apart from area measurements, the use of any measurement except in SI units is not \\"legal for trade\\" under current Australian legislation. [34]\\r\\nExamples where non-SI units are (sometimes) specified are:\\r\\nThe cultural transmission of British and American English in Australia has also been noted to be a cause for residual use of Imperial units of measure.[7]","input":"What is the unit of measurement in australia?"},{"output":"Palm Beach International Airport","context":"Palm Beach County\\r\\nPalm Beach International Airport (IATA: PBI,?ICAO: KPBI,?FAA LID: PBI) is a public airport three miles west of Palm Beach, Florida, in West Palm Beach. It serves the Miami metropolitan area. The airport is operated by Palm Beach County's Department of Airports. Road access to the airport is direct from I-95, Southern Boulevard, and Congress Avenue. The airport is bordered on the west by Military Trail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPalm Beach International Airport (KPBI) began operations in 1936 as Morrison Field. Morrison Field was named in honor of Miss Grace K. Morrison, a key participant in the planning and organization of the airfield. The first flight departing the field was a New York bound Eastern Air Lines DC-2 in 1936. The airport was dedicated on December 19, 1936.\\r\\nIn 1937 the airport expanded beyond an airstrip and an administration building when the Palm Beach Aero Corporation obtained a lease, built hangars and the first terminal on the south side of the airport. The new terminal was known as the Eastern Air Lines Terminal. The field was used by the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor Morrison Field was used for training and later as a staging base for the Allied invasion of France, with numerous aircraft departing Morrison en route to the United Kingdom to take part in the D-Day invasion of Normandy.\\r\\nIn 1947 the newly established U.S. Air Force moved to Brookley Field, later Brookley AFB, in Mobile, Alabama and service by Eastern Airlines and National Airlines resumed from Morrison Field. The name changed to Palm Beach International Airport on August 11, 1948. In September 1950 runway 5 was 6030?ft long, 9 was 7010?ft and 13 was 6930?ft.\\r\\nThe airport was again used by the U.S. Air Force in 1951 and renamed Palm Beach Air Force Base,[2] under the control of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS). USAF operations occupied the north half of the airfield while civil operations and the airline terminal used the south half. MATS used the base for training with the host unit being the 1707th Air Transport Wing (Heavy), and its 1740th Heavy Transport Training Unit. The 1707 ATW was known as the \\"University of MATS\\", becoming the primary USAF training unit for all Air Force personnel supporting and flying heavy transport aircraft. These included C-124 Globemaster II, C-118 Liftmaster, C-97 Stratofreighter, and C-54 Skymaster maintenance training along with aircrew and transition pilot training. Nearly 23,000 airmen trained at Palm Beach AFB during the 1950s and 1960s.\\r\\nThe Air Weather Service used Palm Beach AFB as headquarters for hurricane research, flying the first WB-50D Superfortress \\"Hurricane Hunter\\" aircraft from the base in 1956.\\r\\nAfter several years of Palm Beach County fighting the Air Force presence in West Palm Beach, the Air Force started to close down operations there. The 1707 ATW was inactivated on June 30, 1959 and reassigned to Tinker AFB, Oklahoma. With the wing's departure, Palm Beach County took over airfield operations. The Air Force retained a small presence at the base with the 9th Weather Group becoming the main operational unit at Palm Beach AFB, performing hurricane and weather research for the Air Weather Service. The Air Photographic and Charting Service (APCS) moved its 1370th Photo-Mapping Wing to the base, performing geodetic survey flights. During the early 1960s Palm Beach AFB was used by Air Force One, with President John F. Kennedy landing at the base when staying at the Kennedy home in Palm Beach. The Air Force finally closed Palm Beach AFB in 1962 and all property was conveyed to Palm Beach International Airport the same year.[2]\\r\\nDelta Air Lines began scheduled flights in 1959 and Capital Airlines in 1960. The first turbine-powered flights were Eastern Airlines Lockheed L-188 Electras in 1959, and Eastern DC-8 nonstops to Idlewild started in December 1960.\\r\\nIn October 1966 an eight-gate Main Terminal opened on the northeast side of the airport; in 1974 Delta Air Lines moved into its own six-gate terminal with the airport's first jetways. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) built a new Air Traffic Control Tower on the south side of the airport in this period.\\r\\nOn October 23, 1988 the 25-gate David McCampbell Terminal, named for World War II naval flying ace, Medal of Honor recipient and Palm Beach County resident CAPT David McCampbell, USN (Ret) was dedicated. The 550,000-square-foot (51,000?m2), Greiner-designed terminal was designed with expansion in mind and can be doubled in size when required.[3]\\r\\nIn 2003 the terminal was voted among the finest in the nation by readers of Conde Nast Traveler Magazine. In that year a new landscaped I-95 interchange was built to decrease traffic on Southern Boulevard (US 98) extending Turnage Boulevard (the road around the perimeter of the concourse).\\r\\nCompetition from rapidly expanding Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport cut growth at the airport in the 1990s. The 2001 recession and the September 11 terrorist attacks further inhibited growth, but development in South Florida since 2002 has finally led to a surge of passenger traffic at the airport. In addition, discount carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines began service to PBI. In 2006 the county embarked on an interim expansion program by breaking ground on a 7-story parking garage and the addition of 3 gates in Concourse C. Long range expansions include gates at Concourse B and the eventual construction of a new 14 gate Concourse D to be extended east from the present terminal.[citation needed]\\r\\nPalm Beach International Airport covers 2,120 acres (858?ha) and has three runways:[1]\\r\\nOn December 17, 2009 the runway designations were changed, the former runway designations were:[4] 9L-27R, 9R-27L and 13ÿ31.\\r\\nAs of 2018, Concourse A houses Bahamasair and Silver Airways. Concourse B houses American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, and United Airlines. Concourse C holds Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, and Spirit Airlines.\\r\\nA new 240-foot (73?m) Airport Traffic Control tower is active on the north side of the airport (west of concourse A, off Belvedere Rd.) along with a single-story, 9,000-square-foot (840?m2) ATBM Base Building.[5] The current tower lies on the southern side of the airport.\\r\\nThe Palm Beach County Fire Rescue Aviation Battalion is located between runways at PBI. The fire station which is located near the center of the airport grounds, is home to 13 pieces of specialized fire fighting equipment.[6]\\r\\nThese apparatus include:\\r\\nThe Trauma Hawk Station, which is located at the south west corner of the airport, Palm Beach County Fire Rescue has two Sikorsky S-76C helos.[11] The department partners with the Palm Beach County Health Care District to operate the Trauma Hawk Aero-Medical Program.[12] The Trauma Hawk program, which was established in November 1990, replaced the use of Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office helicopters to medevac critically injured patients to area hospitals.[12] air ambulances are identically equipped and can carry two patients each and up to four medical attendants if needed.[11] Each helicopter is staffed with a pilot, a registered nurse (RN) and a paramedic. The nurses and paramedics are Palm Beach County Fire Rescue employees while the pilots are Health Care District employees.[12]\\r\\nPalm Tran buses No. 40 and No. 44 serve the airport. Both provide connections to the West Palm Beach Tri-Rail/Amtrak/Greyhound station.\\r\\nIn conjunction with the slated construction of a new ATC tower at PBIA, the Federal Aviation Administration intended to transfer all of PBIA's air traffic controllers whose assigned sector is between 5 and 40 miles (60?km) from the airport to a remote facility at Miami International Airport. Ground traffic controllers, and approach controllers whose sector is within 5 miles (8?km) of the runway would have remained at PBIA. The FAA cited the move as a cost-cutting measure, but critics say that it creates a risk to South Florida air traffic if the Miami facility is damaged in a hurricane, or terrorist attack. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association opposed the move. The remote facility at Miami International Airport houses air traffic controllers for Miami and Fort Lauderdale international airports.\\r\\nDonald Trump sued to block the expansion of one of the runways at PBIA in 2010.[19] In 2015 he initiated a lawsuit over the flight path that passes over his Mar-a-Lago estate.[20]\\r\\nCoordinates: 264100N 800544W? / ?26.6832N 80.0956W? / 26.6832; -80.0956","input":"What airport is near west palm beach florida?"},{"output":"1,281,900","context":" Gen Joseph Dunford, USMC\\r\\nAmerican Revolutionary War\\r\\nWhiskey Rebellion\\r\\nIndian Wars\\r\\nBarbary Wars\\r\\nWar of 1812\\r\\nPatriot War\\r\\nMexicanÿAmerican War\\r\\nUtah War\\r\\nCortina Troubles\\r\\nReform War\\r\\nAmerican Civil War\\r\\nLas Cuevas War\\r\\nSpanishÿAmerican War\\r\\nBanana Wars\\r\\nPhilippineÿAmerican War\\r\\nBoxer Rebellion\\r\\nBorder War\\r\\nWorld War I\\r\\nRussian Civil War\\r\\nWorld War II\\r\\nCold War\\r\\nPersian Gulf War\\r\\nSomali Civil War\\r\\nBosnian War\\r\\nKosovo War\\r\\nGlobal War on Terrorism\\r\\nMilitary deployment after Hurricane Katrina\\r\\nPakistanÿUnited States skirmishes\\r\\nIntervention against ISIL\\r\\nArmy\\r\\nMarine Corps\\r\\nNavy\\r\\nAir Force\\r\\nCoast Guard\\r\\nThe United States Armed Forces[6] are the military forces of the United States of America. It consists of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard.[7] The President of the United States is the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces and forms military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), both federal executive departments, acting as the principal organs by which military policy is carried out. All five armed services are among the seven uniformed services of the United States.[8]\\r\\nFrom the time of its inception, the U.S. Armed Forces played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the founders of the United States were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played a critical role in the American Civil War, continuing to serve as the armed forces of the United States, although a number of its officers resigned to join the military of the Confederate States. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework. The Act merged the previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and the National Security Council.\\r\\nThe U.S. Armed Forces are one of the largest militaries in terms of the number of personnel. It draws its personnel from a large pool of paid volunteers. Although conscription has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972, but the Selective Service System retains the power to conscript males, and requires that all male citizens and residents residing in the U.S. between the ages of 18ÿ25 register with the service.[9]\\r\\nAs of 2017, the U.S. spends about US$610 billion annually to fund its military forces and Overseas Contingency Operations.[4] Put together, the U.S. constitutes roughly 40 percent of the world's military expenditures. The U.S. Armed Forces has significant capabilities in both defense and power projection due to its large budget, resulting in advanced and powerful technologies which enables a widespread deployment of the force around the world, including around 800 military bases outside the United States.[10] The U.S. Air Force is the world's largest air force, the U.S. Navy is the world's largest navy by tonnage, and the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps combined are the worlds second largest air arm.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the U.S. Armed Forces dates to 14 June 1775, with the creation of the Continental Army, even before the Declaration of Independence marked the establishment of the United States. The Continental Navy, established on 13 October 1775, and Continental Marines, established on 10 November 1775, were created in close succession by the Second Continental Congress in order to defend the new nation against the British Empire in the American Revolutionary War.\\r\\nThese forces demobilized in 1784 after the Treaty of Paris ended the War for Independence. The Congress of the Confederation created the current United States Army on 3 June 1784. The United States Congress created the current United States Navy on 27 March 1794 and the current United States Marine Corps on 11 July 1798. All three services trace their origins to their respective Continental predecessors. The 1787 adoption of the Constitution gave the Congress the power to \\"raise and support armies\\", to \\"provide and maintain a navy\\" and to \\"make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces\\", as well as the power to declare war. The President is the U.S. Armed Forces' commander-in-chief.\\r\\nThe United States Coast Guard traces its origin to the founding of the Revenue Cutter Service on 4 August 1790 which merged with the United States Life-Saving Service on 28 January 1915 to establish the Coast Guard. The United States Air Force was established as an independent service on 18 September 1947; it traces its origin to the formation of the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps, which was formed 1 August 1907 and was part of the Army Air Forces before becoming an independent service as per the National Security Act of 1947.\\r\\nCommand over the U.S. Armed Forces is established in the Constitution. The sole power of command is vested in the President by Article II as Commander-in-Chief. The Constitution also allows for the creation of \\"executive Departments\\" headed by \\"principal officers\\" whose opinion the President can require. This allowance in the Constitution formed the basis for creation of the Department of Defense in 1947 by the National Security Act. The DoD is headed by the Secretary of Defense, who is a civilian and member of the Cabinet. The Defense Secretary is second in the U.S. Armed Forces chain of command, with the exception of the Coast Guard, which is under the Secretary of Homeland Security, and is just below the President and serves as the principal assistant to the President in all defense-related matters.[13] Together, the President and the Secretary of Defense comprise the National Command Authority, which by law is the ultimate lawful source of military orders.[14]\\r\\nTo coordinate military strategy with political affairs, the President has a National Security Council headed by the National Security Advisor. The collective body has only advisory power to the President, but several of the members who statutorily comprise the council (the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Defense) possess executive authority over their own departments.[15]\\r\\nJust as the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, are in charge of the entire military establishment, maintaining civilian control of the military, so too are each of the Defense Department's constitutive military departments headed by civilians. The four DoD branches are organized into three departments, each with civilian heads. The Department of the Army is headed by the Secretary of the Army, the Department of the Navy is headed by the Secretary of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force is headed by the Secretary of the Air Force. The Marine Corps is organized under the Department of the Navy, however it is still considered a separate and equal service. The Coast Guard is under the Department of Homeland Security and receives its operational orders from the Secretary of Homeland Security. However, the Coast Guard may be transferred to the Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during a time of war, thereby placing it within the DoD.[16]\\r\\nThe President, Secretary of Defense and other senior executive officials are advised by a seven-member Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is headed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest-ranking officer in the United States military and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.[17] The rest of the body is composed of the heads of each of the DoD's service branches (the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force) as well as the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. Although commanding one of the five military branches, the Commandant of the Coast Guard is not a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Despite being composed of the highest-ranking officers in each of the respective branches, the Joint Chiefs of Staff does not possess operational command authority. Rather, the Goldwater-Nichols Act charges them only with advisory power.[18]\\r\\nAll of the branches work together during operations and joint missions in Unified Combatant Commands, under the authority of the Secretary of Defense with the typical exception of the Coast Guard. Each of the Unified Combatant Commands is headed by a Combatant Commander, a senior commissioned officer who exercises supreme command authority per 10 U.S.C.??164 over all of the forces, regardless of branch, within his geographical or functional command. By statute, the chain of command flows from the President to the Secretary of Defense to each of the Combatant Commanders.[19] In practice, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff often acts as an intermediary between the Secretary of Defense and the Combatant Commanders.\\r\\nThe United States has the world's largest military budget. In the fiscal year 2016, $580.3 billion in funding were enacted for the DoD and for \\"Overseas Contingency Operations\\" in the War on Terrorism.[4] Outside of direct DoD spending, the United States spends another $218 to $262?billion each year on other defense-related programs, such as Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, nuclear weapons maintenance and DoD.\\r\\nBy military department, $146.9?billion was allocated for the Department of the Army, $168.8?billion for the Department of the Navy, $161.8?billion for the Department of the Air Force and $102.8?billion for DoD-wide spending.[4] By function, $138.6 billion was requested for personnel, $244.4 billion for operations and maintenance, $118.9 billion for procurement, $69.0 billion for research and development, $1.3?billion for revolving and management funds, $6.9 billion for military construction and $1.3?billion for family housing.[4]\\r\\nThe projected active duty end strength in the armed forces for fiscal year 2017 was 1,281,900 servicemembers,[4] with an additional 801,200 people in the seven reserve components.[4] It is an all-volunteer military, but conscription through the Selective Service System can be enacted at the President's request and Congress' approval. All males ages 18 through 25 who are living in the United States are required to register with the Selective Service for a potential future draft.\\r\\nThe U.S. Armed Forces is the world's third largest military, after the Chinese's People's Liberation Army and the Indian Armed Forces, and has troops deployed around the globe.\\r\\nAs in most militaries, members of the U.S. Armed Forces hold a rank, either that of officer, warrant officer or enlisted, to determine seniority and eligibility for promotion. Those who have served are known as veterans. Rank names may be different between services, but they are matched to each other by their corresponding paygrade.[20] Officers who hold the same rank or paygrade are distinguished by their date of rank to determine seniority, while officers who serve in certain positions of office of importance set by law, outrank all other officers in active duty of the same rank and paygrade, regardless of their date of rank.[21] Currently, only one in four persons in the United States of the proper age meet the moral, academic and physical standards for military service.[22]\\r\\nFebruary 2018 Demographic Reports and end strengths for reserve components.[4][23][24][25][26]\\r\\nAs of 31 December 2010, U.S. Armed Forces troops were stationed in 150 countries; the number of non-contingent deployments per country ranges from 1 in Suriname to over 50,000 in Germany.[27] Some of the largest deployments are: 103,700 in Afghanistan, 52,440 in Germany (see list), 35,688 in Japan (USFJ), 28,500 in South Korea (USFK), 9,660 in Italy and 9,015 in the United Kingdom. These numbers change frequently due to the regular recall and deployment of units.\\r\\nAltogether, 77,917 military personnel are located in Europe, 141 in the former Soviet Union, 47,236 in East Asia and the Pacific, 3,362 in North Africa, the Near East and South Asia, 1,355 in sub-Saharan Africa and 1,941 in the Western Hemisphere excluding the United States itself.\\r\\nIncluding U.S. territories and ships afloat within territorial waters As of 31 December 2009, a total of 1,137,568 personnel were on active duty within the United States and its territories (including 84,461 afloat).[28] The vast majority (941,629 personnel) were stationed at bases within the contiguous United States. There were an additional 37,245 in Hawaii and 20,450 in Alaska while 84,461 were at sea, 2,972 in Guam and 179 in Puerto Rico.\\r\\nProspective service members are often recruited from high school or college, the target age ranges being 18ÿ35 in the Army, 18ÿ28 in the Marine Corps, 18ÿ34 in the Navy, 18ÿ39 in the Air Force and 18ÿ27 (up to age 32 if qualified for attending guaranteed \\"A\\" school) in the Coast Guard. With the permission of a parent or guardian, applicants can enlist at age 17 and participate in the Delayed Entry Program (DEP), in which the applicant is given the opportunity to participate in locally sponsored military activities, which can range from sports to competitions led by recruiters or other military liaisons (each recruiting station's DEP varies).\\r\\nAfter enlistment, new recruits undergo basic training (also known as \\"boot camp\\" in the Marine Corps, Navy and Coast Guard), followed by schooling in their primary Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), rating and Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) at any of the numerous training facilities around the United States. Each branch conducts basic training differently. The Marine Corps send all non-infantry MOS's to an infantry skills course known as Marine Combat Training prior to their technical schools. Air Force Basic Military Training graduates attend Technical Training and are awarded their Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) at the apprentice (3) skill level. All Army recruits undergo Basic Combat Training (BCT), followed by Advanced Individual Training (AIT), with the exceptions of cavalry scouts, infantry, armor, combat engineers and military police recruits who go to One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which combines BCT and AIT. The Navy sends its recruits to Recruit Training and then to \\"A\\" schools to earn a rating. The Coast Guard's recruits attend basic training and follow with an \\"A\\" school to earn a rating.\\r\\nInitially, recruits without higher education or college degrees will hold the pay grade of E-1 and will be elevated to E-2 usually soon after basic training. Different services have different incentive programs for enlistees, such as higher initial ranks for college credit, being an Eagle Scout and referring friends who go on to enlist as well. Participation in DEP is one way recruits can achieve rank before their departure to basic training.\\r\\nThere are several different authorized pay grade advancement requirements in each junior-enlisted rank category (E-1 to E-3), which differ by service. Enlistees in the Army can attain the initial pay grade of E-4 (specialist) with a four-year degree, but the highest initial pay grade is usually E-3 (members of the Army Band program can expect to enter service at the grade of E-4). Promotion through the junior enlisted ranks occurs after serving for a specified number of years (which can be waived by the soldier's chain of command), a specified level of technical proficiency or maintenance of good conduct. Promotion can be denied with reason.\\r\\nWith very few exceptions, becoming a non-commissioned officer (NCO) or petty officer in the U.S. Armed Forces is accomplished by progression through the lower enlisted ranks. However, unlike promotion through the lower enlisted tier, promotion to NCO is generally competitive. NCO ranks begin at E-4 or E-5, depending upon service and are generally attained between three and six years of service. Junior NCOs function as first-line supervisors and squad leaders, training the junior enlisted in their duties and guiding their career advancement.\\r\\nWhile considered part of the non-commissioned officer corps by law, senior non-commissioned officers (SNCOs) referred to as chief petty officers in the Navy and Coast Guard, or staff non-commissioned officers in the Marine Corps, perform duties more focused on leadership rather than technical expertise. Promotion to the SNCO ranks, E-7 through E-9 (E-6 through E-9 in the Marine Corps) is highly competitive. Personnel totals at the pay grades of E-8 and E-9 are limited by federal law to 2.5 percent and 1 percent of a service's enlisted force, respectively. SNCOs act as leaders of small units and as staff. Some SNCOs manage programs at headquarters level and a select few wield responsibility at the highest levels of the military structure. Most unit commanders have a SNCO as an enlisted advisor. All SNCOs are expected to mentor junior commissioned officers as well as the enlisted in their duty sections. The typical enlistee can expect to attain SNCO rank after 10 to 16?years of service.\\r\\nEach of the five services employs a single Senior Enlisted Advisor at departmental level. This individual is the highest ranking enlisted member within that respective service and functions as the chief advisor to the service secretary, service chief and Congress on matters concerning the enlisted force. These individuals carry responsibilities and protocol requirements equivalent to three-star general or flag officers. They are as follows:\\r\\nAdditionally, all services except for the Air Force have an active warrant officer corps. Above the rank of warrant Officer One, these officers may also be commissioned, but usually serve in a more technical and specialized role within units. More recently, they can also serve in more traditional leadership roles associated with the more recognizable officer corps. With one notable exception (Army helicopter and fixed-wing pilots), these officers ordinarily have already been in the military often serving in senior NCO positions in the field in which they later serve as a warrant officer as a technical expert. Most Army pilots have served some enlisted time. It is also possible to enlist, complete basic training, go directly to the Warrant Officer Candidate School at Fort Rucker, Alabama and then on to flight school.\\r\\nWarrant officers in the U.S. military garner the same customs and courtesies as commissioned officers. They may attend the officer's club, receive a command and are saluted by junior warrant officers and all enlisted service members.\\r\\nThe Air Force ceased to grant warrants in 1959 when the enlisted grades of E-8 and E-9 were created. Most non-flying duties performed by warrant officers in other services are instead performed by senior NCOs in the Air Force.\\r\\nOfficers receive a commission in one of the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces through one of the following routes.\\r\\nOfficers receive a commission assigning them to the officer corps from the President with the Senate's consent. To accept this commission, all officers must take an oath of office.\\r\\nThrough their careers, officers usually will receive further training at one or a number of the many staff colleges.\\r\\nCompany grade officers in pay grades O-1 through O-3 (known as \\"junior\\" officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) function as leaders of smaller units or sections of a unit, typically with an experienced SNCO (or CPO in the Navy and Coast Guard) assistant and mentor.\\r\\nField grade officers in pay grades O-4 through O-6 (known as \\"senior\\" officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) lead significantly larger and more complex operations, with gradually more competitive promotion requirements.\\r\\nGeneral officers, (known as flag officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) serve at the highest levels and oversee major portions of the military mission.\\r\\nThese are ranks of the highest honor and responsibility in the U.S. Armed Forces, but they are almost never given during peacetime and only a very small number of officers during wartime have held a five-star rank:\\r\\nNo corresponding rank exists for the Marine Corps or the Coast Guard. As with three- and four-star ranks, Congress is the approving authority for a five-star rank confirmation.\\r\\nThe rank of General of the Armies is considered senior to General of the Army, but was never held by active duty officers at the same time as persons who held the rank of General of the Army. It has been held by two people: John J. Pershing who received the rank in 1919 after World War I and George Washington who received it posthumously in 1976 as part of the American Bicentennial celebrations. Pershing, appointed to General of the Armies in active duty status for life, was still alive at the time of the first five-star appointments during World War?II and was thereby acknowledged as superior in grade by seniority to any World War?IIÿera Generals of the Army. George Washington's appointment by Public Law 94-479 to General of the Armies of the United States was established by law as having \\"rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present\\", making him not only superior to Pershing, but superior to any grade in the Army in perpetuity.\\r\\nIn the Navy, the rank of Admiral of the Navy theoretically corresponds to that of General of the Armies, though it was never held by active-duty officers at the same time as persons who held the rank of Fleet Admiral. George Dewey is the only person to have ever held this rank. After the establishment of the rank of Fleet Admiral in 1944, the Department of the Navy specified that the rank of Fleet Admiral was to be junior to the rank of Admiral of the Navy. However, since Dewey died in 1917 before the establishment of the rank of Fleet Admiral, the six-star rank has not been totally confirmed.\\r\\nThe Woman's Army Auxiliary Corps was established in the United States in 1942. Women saw combat during World War II, first as nurses in the Pearl Harbor attacks on 7 December 1941. The Woman's Naval Reserve, Marine Corps Women's Reserve and Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) were also created during this conflict. In 1944, WACs arrived in the Pacific and landed in Normandy on D-Day. During the war, 67 Army nurses and 16 Navy nurses were captured and spent three years as Japanese prisoners of war. There were 350,000 American women who served during World War II and 16 were killed in action. In total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations and commendations. Virginia Hall, serving with the Office of Strategic Services, received the second-highest U.S. combat award, the Distinguished Service Cross, for action behind enemy lines in France.\\r\\nAfter World War II, demobilization led to the vast majority of serving women being returned to civilian life. Law 625, The Women's Armed Services Act of 1948, was signed by President Truman, allowing women to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces in fully integrated units during peace time, with only the WAC remaining a separate female unit. During the Korean War of 1950ÿ1953, many women served in the Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals, with women serving in Korea numbering 120,000[dubious ÿ discuss]during the conflict. During the Vietnam War, 600 women served in the country as part of the Air Force, along with 500 members of the WAC and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff. The Ordnance Corps began accepting female missile technicians in 1974[30] and female crewmembers and officers were accepted into Field Artillery missile units.[31][32]\\r\\nIn 1974, the first six women naval aviators earned their wings as Navy pilots. The Congressionally mandated prohibition on women in combat places limitations on the pilots' advancement,[33] but at least two retired as captains.[34] In 1989, Captain Linda L. Bray, 29, became the first woman to command American soldiers in battle during the invasion of Panama. The 1991 Gulf War proved to be the pivotal time for the role of women in the U.S. Armed Forces to come to the attention of the world media; there are many reports of women engaging enemy forces during the conflict.[35]\\r\\nIn the 2000s, women can serve on U.S. combat ships, including in command roles. They are permitted to serve on submarines.[36] Women can fly military aircraft and make up 2% of all pilots in the U.S. Military. In 2003, Major Kim Campbell was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for landing her combat damaged A-10 Thunderbolt II with no hydraulic control and only one functional engine after being struck by hostile fire over Baghdad.\\r\\nOn 3 December 2015, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter announced that all military combat jobs would become available to women.[37] This gave women access to the roughly 10% of military jobs which were previously closed off due to their combat nature.[38] The decision gave military services until January 2016 to seek exceptions to the rule if they believe that certain jobs, such as machine gunners, should be restricted to men only.[39] These restrictions were due in part to prior studies which stated that mixed gender units are less capable in combat.[40] Physical requirements for all jobs remained unchanged, though.[40] Many women believe this will allow for them to improve their positions in the military, since most high-ranking officers start in combat positions. Since women are now available to work in any position in the military, female entry into the draft has been proposed.[41]\\r\\nSergeant Leigh Ann Hester became the first woman to receive the Silver Star, the third-highest U.S. decoration for valor, for direct participation in combat. In Afghanistan, Monica Lin Brown was presented the Silver Star for shielding wounded soldiers with her body.[42] In March 2012, the U.S. military had two women, Ann E. Dunwoody and Janet C. Wolfenbarger, with the rank of four-star general.[43][44] In 2016, Air Force General Lori Robinson became the first female officer to command a major Unified Combatant Command (USNORTHCOM) in the history of the United States Armed Forces.[45]\\r\\nDespite concerns of a gender gap, all personnel both men and women at the same rank and time of service are compensated the same rate across all branches.[46]\\r\\nA study conducted by the RAND Corporation also suggests that women who make the military their career see an improved rate of promotion, as they climb through the military ranks at a faster rate.[47]\\r\\nUnder current Department of Defense regulation, the various components of the U.S. Armed Forces have a set order of seniority. Examples of the use of this system include the display of service flags, placement of Soldiers, Marines, Sailors, Airmen and Coast Guardsmen in formation, etc. When the Coast Guard shall operate as part of the Department of the Navy, United States Coast Guard Academy cadets, the United States Coast Guard and the Coast Guard Reserve shall take precedence after United States Naval Academy midshipmen; the United States Navy; and Navy Reserve, respectively.[48]\\r\\nNote: While the U.S. Navy is older than the Marine Corps,[49] the Marine Corps takes precedence due to previous inconsistencies in the Navy's birth date. The Marine Corps has recognized its observed birth date on a more consistent basis. The Second Continental Congress is considered to have established the Navy on 13 October 1775 by authorizing the purchase of ships, but did not actually pass the \\"Rules for the Regulation of the Navy of the United Colonies\\" until 27 November 1775.[50] The Marine Corps was established by act of said Congress on 10 November 1775. The Navy did not officially recognize 13 October 1775 as its birth date until 1972, when thenÿChief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt authorized it to be observed as such.[49]","input":"What is the size of the us armed forces?"},{"output":"Expedition Everest  Legend of the Forbidden Mountain","context":"Expedition Everest  Legend of the Forbidden Mountain is a steel roller coaster built by Vekoma at Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The ride is themed around the Yeti protecting the Forbidden Mountain next to Mount Everest. It is listed in the 2011 book of Guinness World Records as the most expensive roller coaster in the world.[2] Including sets and extras, its total cost was reported to be US$100 million for six years of planning and construction.[2][3] It is the tallest artificial mountain in all of the Walt Disney Parks and Disney's 18th mountain-themed attraction.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attraction was announced publicly on April 22, 2003, during an event to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Disney's Animal Kingdom.[5] Its construction required three years and more than 38 miles of rebar, 5,000 tons of structural steel, and 10,000 tons of concrete.[6] Expedition Everest opened for previews on January 26, 2006,[1] and had its grand opening on April 7, 2006,[7] in ceremonies led by Disney CEO Bob Iger and theme parks chairman Jay Rasulo.\\r\\nThe attraction features a stand-by, Fastpass+, and a single-rider line.[1] The queue starts at the office of the fictional \\"Himalayan Escapes\\" travel agency, progressing to a replica temple with little holy figures. Visitors next enter a tea garden, followed by a room with equipment from a successful expedition, and then the \\"Yeti Museum\\", which contains information on the Yeti and a moulding of a Yeti footprint.[8] There are also about 8,000 artifacts brought from the Nepal trip in the museum.[9][10] The single-rider line skips all of the exhibits.\\r\\nThe riders board the roller coaster in the model village of Serka Zong, to begin a speedy route through the Himalayas to the base of Mount Everest.[4][8]\\r\\nThe train departs the station to the right and climbs a small lift leading to a short drop, then circles around to the 118-foot (36?m) lift hill, carrying the riders into the 199?1?2-foot-high (60.8?m) mountain. It is the tallest attraction at Walt Disney World, beating The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror by 6 inches. Disney keeps it just under 200 feet because law requires structures 200 feet or taller to have a blinking red light as a beacon for low-flying planes, which Disney feels would take parkgoers out of the experience. On the way up it passes through a ransacked temple with murals of the yeti, warning the riders that the mountain is his territory. At the top of the mountain the train curves around the main peak and goes through a cave. When it emerges, it draws to a halt in front of track that has been torn apart, presumably by the yeti. The train itself is held in place by a series of rubber tires while an automatic switch rotates the piece of track directly behind the train. The train then rolls backwards along a new route that spirals down through the mountain, coming to a halt in a large cave, where riders see the yeti's shadow on the wall as he tears up more track. This effect distracts riders from noticing another automatic track switch rotates in front of them. As the shadow moves away, the train rolls forward out of the mountain and down the main 80-foot (24?m) drop. It enters a 250 turn and speeds back up through another cave in the mountain, where the roars of the yeti are heard once more. The train exits from the rear of the mountain and enters a large helix before being lifted back into the mountain a final time. The train drops through a cave, where the yeti is reaching down toward it. On reaching the bottom of this drop, riders return to the unloading dock and depart into a gift shop. One ride takes about 2 minutes and 50 seconds.[8][11][12][13]\\r\\nExpedition Everest has six steam-like trains, each with six cars that together provide 17 rows seating two abreast, for a total of 36 riders per train. The trains are themed as the \\"Anandapur Rail Service\\" and are made to look old and rusty.[4][8] Riders must be at least 44 inches (110?cm) tall and are secured by a lap bar.[4][13] Up to five trains usually operate at once, but fewer can be used if guest demand is low.[1] To create the illusion of a \\"steam powered\\" train, engineers placed vents under the station. When a train comes into the station, steam comes up through the vents and enters the loading platform.[6]\\r\\nThe steel track is 4,424 feet (1,348?m) long and the lift is about 118 feet (36?m) high. Expedition Everest is the first ride to use Vekoma's newest track system, which places the rails on the outside of the ties rather than on the inside. This was the first large-scale installation of such a system.[12]\\r\\nAlthough moderate in height and length by contemporary standards, Expedition Everest was the first ride for Disney to have its trains travel both forward and backward. This is accomplished through two sets of track switches, one before the rear segment and one after. This was the second Disney roller coaster to run backwards, the first being Indiana Jones et le Temple du Pril: Backwards! at Disneyland Resort Paris (2000ÿ2004).[14] Expedition Everest, however, was the first Disney roller coaster to switch between forward and backward sections during a single ride.[15]\\r\\nThe mountain fa?ade, the Yeti audio-animatronic, and the roller coaster are three independent structures. Each structure reaches the ground-level and does not touch the other two structures. This was achieved via 4-D scheduling software that told builders how to construct it.[16]\\r\\nExpedition Everest is often compared to the 1959 Matterhorn Bobsleds roller coaster at Disneyland, which also features a snowy mountain setting and an \\"abominable snowman\\" figure throughout the ride.[17] Expedition Everest's mountain is made from 1,800 tons of steel and painted with 2,000 gallons of paint.[4][13] It is the tallest artificial mountain in the world, but not, as occasionally cited, the tallest point in Florida.[6] It is Disney's 18th mountain-themed attraction.[4] As of 2012[update], there are 20 mountain-themed attractions.\\r\\nThe artificial mountain is a model, not of Mount Everest, but of the fictional \\"forbidden mountain\\" guarded by the yeti in the story created by Walt Disney Imagineering for the attraction. Everest is represented by the barren background peak on the far right, which is made to seem far in the distance (an example of forced perspective).[13]\\r\\nThe yeti is the largest and most complex audio-animatronic figure ever built by Walt Disney Imagineering.[6][8] It is 25 feet (7.6?m) tall. Its \\"skin\\" measures 1,000 square feet (93?m2), and is held in place by 1,000 snaps and 250 zippers. Its movement is controlled by 19 actuators when functioning in \\"A-mode\\", its full mode of operation. In \\"A-mode,\\" it can move 5?ft (1.5?m) horizontally and 18?in (46?cm) vertically. The yeti's roars are provided by voice actor Fred Tatasciore.\\r\\nA few months after the ride opened in 2006, the yeti figure's framing split, threatening catastrophic malfunction if it were to be operated further in \\"A-mode\\". [18] Since then it has been operated only in the alternative \\"B-mode\\", in which a strobe-light effect is used to give the appearance of movement, earning it the nickname \\"Disco Yeti\\" from some fans. It is speculated that the problem was caused by damage to the yeti's concrete base structure, which is unlikely to be repaired until a major refurbishment in the distant future, because the design limits access to the yeti without major disassembly of the superstructure.[19] The problem with the concrete is rumored to have occurred due to a glitch in the 4-D scheduling software that prevented adequate curing of a portion of the Yeti's foundation before the fabrication of mountain elements and roller coaster track.[20]\\r\\nJoe Rohde, the Imagineer in charge of building the attraction and Animal Kingdom, was asked about the yeti at the 2013 D23 Expo. Rohde responded, \\"You have to understand, it's a giant complicated machine sitting on top of, like, a 46-foot tall tower in the middle of a finished building. So, it's really hard to fix, but we are working on it. And we continue to work on it. We have tried several 'things', none of them quite get to the key, turning of the 40-foot tower inside of a finished building, but we are working on it... I will fix the Yeti someday, I swear.\\" [21][22]\\r\\nIn 2005, Disney, Discovery Networks, and Conservation International conducted expeditions to Nepal as part of the promotion for Expedition Everest. The purpose was to conduct scientific and cultural research in remote areas of the Himalayas, the location of the yeti legend. Participants included Joe Rohde from Walt Disney Imagineering and scientists from Conservation International and Disney's Animal Kingdom.[10]\\r\\nThe expeditions and the making of the attraction were chronicled in three documentaries broadcast on Discovery's cable television channels in April 2006.[7] The first was Expedition Everest: Journey to Sacred Lands, broadcast on the Travel Channel on April 9 to coincide with the attraction's grand opening.[7] The second, Building A Thrill Ride: Expedition Everest, was aired on April 10[7] and detailed the planning and construction of the ride, along with some of the ideas that made it possible. (During construction, for example, instead of traditional scaffolding the Imagineers used interior poles that poked through the outside of the mountain and were connected by wooden platforms.)[6] This documentary also featured survival tips from Les Stroud. The third, Corwin's Quest: Realm of the Yeti, was broadcast on Animal Planet on April 15 and featured American animal and nature conservationist Jeff Corwin.[7]\\r\\nOn February 15, 2006, Disney staged an elaborate publicity stunt called \\"Everest in the City\\" in Times Square, New York City. They draped large billboards over the sides of several buildings, depicting Everest with a coaster car careening down the mountainside and the yeti looking on from another peak, its eyes glowing red and flashing when the text message \\"Disney was sent to 4Yeti as provided by Disney.[23]\\r\\nOn December 18, 2007, a 44-year-old guest was found unconscious after the train returned to the station. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A preliminary autopsy by the Orange County medical examiner's office concluded that the victim had died of dilated cardiomyopathy.[24]\\r\\nExpedition Everest is listed in the 2011 book of Guinness World Records as the most expensive roller coaster in the world.

In the 20th century, since the WW2 settlements failed to resolve ownership of such lesser areas of land, seas and islandsand because of the economic, military, and transportational importancetheir control, especially that of the Spratlys, has been in dispute between China and several Southeast Asian countries, such as Vietnam, from the mid-20th century onwards. True occupation and control are shared between the claimants (see claims and control below).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South China Sea Islands were discussed from the 4th century BC in the Chinese texts Yizhoushu, Classic of Poetry, Zuo Zhuan, and Guoyu, but only implicitly as part of the \\"Southern Territories\\" (Chinese: q; pinyin: Nn Zhu) or \\"South Sea\\" (q, Nn HҊi). During the Qin Dynasty (221ÿ206 BC), government administrators called the South China Sea Islands the \\"Three Mysterious Groups of Islands\\" (??^\\\\, Sn Shn Shn). But during the Eastern Han dynasty (23-220), the South China Sea was renamed \\"Rising Sea\\" (?q, ZhҊng HҊi), so the islands were called the \\"Rising Sea Islands\\" (?qY, ZhҊnghҊi Qt܇u). During the Jin Dynasty (265ÿ420), they were known as the \\"Coral Islands\\" (I, Shnh~ Zhu). From the Tang Dynasty (618ÿ907) to the Qing Dynasty (1644ÿ1912), various names were used for the islands, but in general Changsha and permutations referred to the Paracel Islands, while Shitang referred to the Spratly Islands. These variations included, for the Paracels: JiѸrѸ Lu܇zhu (?ޘQ?), Qؐzhu Yng (ۻ), Chngsh (), Qinl Chngsh (), and Qinl Shtng (f); for the Spratlys: Shtng (f), Shchung (fɢ), Wnl Shtng (ľf), and Wnl Chngsh (ľ).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Qing, the names Qianli Changsha and Wanli Shitang were in vogue, and Chinese fishermen from Hainan named specific islands from within the groups, although the Qing officially named 15 large islands in 1909. During China's Republican era (1912-1949), the government named the Spratlys Tunsh Q~ndҊo (a??) and then Nnsh Q~ndҊo (q??); the Paracels were Xؐsh Q~ndҊo (l??); Republican authorities mapped over 291 islands, reefs, and banks in surveys in 1932, 1935, and 1947. The People's Republic of China has retained the Republican-era names for the island groups, supplementing them with a list of 287 names for islands, reefs, banks, and shoals in 1983.[6] From 2011-2012, China's State Oceanic Administration named 1,660 nameless islands and islets under its claimed jurisdiction; in 2012, China announced plans to name a further 1,664 nameless features by August 2013. The naming campaign is intended to consolidate China's sovereignty claim over Sansha (??),[7] a city which includes islands from the Xisha (Paracel), Nansha (Spratly and James Shoal) and Zhongsha (, Zhngsh; Macclesfield Bank, Scarborough Shoal, and others) groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1405 to 1433,  Zheng He commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa in Ming dynasty in China. \\r\\nIn 1421, Zheng prepared the 6 edition  Mao Kun map, usually referred to by Chinese people as Zheng He's Navigation Map (simplified Chinese: aZ; traditional Chinese: ??D; pinyin: Zhng H hnghҊi t~), which included South China Sea Islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe countries with the most extensive activity in the South China Sea Islands are China and Vietnam.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 19th century, as a part of the occupation of Indochina, France claimed control of the Spratlys until the 1930s, exchanging a few with the British. During World War II, the South China Sea islands were all occupied by Japan. After the end of World War II, Japan returned all the South China Sea Islands back to China, which had been agreed by the Allied Nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe People's Republic of China, founded in 1949, claimed the islands as part of the province of Canton (Guangdong), and later of the Hainan special administrative region.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Republic of China (ROC) named 132 of the South China Sea Islands in 1932 and 1935. In 1933, the Chinese government lodged an official protest to the French government after its occupation of Taiping Island.[8] After World War II, the Chinese government received the islands from the surrending Japanese, according to international treaties made by the Allied Nations. In 1947, the Ministry of Interior of China renamed 149 of the islands. Later, in November 1947, the Secretaritat of Guangdong Government of China was authorised to publish the Map of the South China Sea Islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese and the French renounced their claims as soon as their respective occupations or colonisations ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1958, the People's Republic of China (PRC) issued a declaration defining its territorial waters within what is known as the nine-dotted line which encompassed the Spratly Islands. North Vietnam's prime minister, Ph?m V?n ??ng, sent a diplomatic note to Zhou Enlai, stating that \\"The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam respects this decision.\\" The diplomatic note was written on 14 September and was publicised in Nhan Dan newspaper (Vietnam) on 22 September 1958. Regarding this letter, there have been many arguments on its true meaning and the reason why Ph?m V?n ??ng decided to send it to Zhou Enlai. In an interview with BBC Vietnam, Dr. Balzs Szalontai provided the following analysis of this issue:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general context of the Chinese declaration was the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held in 1956, and the resulting treaties signed in 1958, such as the Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone. Understandably, the PRC government, though not being a member of the U.N., also wanted to have a say in how these issues were dealt with. Hence the Chinese declaration of September 1958. In these years, as I said before, North Vietnam could hardly afford to alienate China. The Soviet Union did not give any substantial support to Vietnamese reunification, and neither South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem nor the U.S. government showed readiness to give consent to the holding of all-Vietnamese elections as stipulated by the Geneva Agreements. On the contrary, Diem did his best to suppress the Communist movement in the South. This is why Pham Van Dong felt it necessary to take sides with China, whose tough attitude toward the Asian policies of the U.S. offered some hope. And yet he seems to have been cautious enough to make a statement that supported only the principle that China was entitled for 12-mile territorial seas along its territory but evaded the issue of defining this territory. While the preceding Chinese statement was very specific, enumerating all the islands (including the Paracels and the Spratlys) for which the PRC laid claim, the DRV statement did not say a word about the concrete territories to which this rule was applicable. Still, it is true that in this bilateral territorial dispute between Chinese and Vietnamese interests, the DRV standpoint, more in a diplomatic than a legal sense, was incomparably closer to that of China than to that of South Vietnam.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was also argued that, Pham Van Dong who represented North Vietnam at that time had no legal right to comment on a territorial part which belonged to the South Vietnam represented by Ngo Dinh Diem. Therefore, the letter has no legal value and is considered as a diplomatic document to show the support of the government of North Vietnam to the PRC at that time.[10]  In China, in 1959, the islands were put under an administrative office (ᬽ/banshichu). In 1988, the office was switched to the administration of the newly founded Hainan Province.[citation needed] The PRC strongly asserted its claims to the islands, but in the late 1990s, under the new security concept, the PRC put its claims less strongly.[citation needed]  According to the Kyodo News, in March 2010 PRC officials told US officials that they consider the South China Sea a \\"core interest\\" on par with Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang[11]  In July 2010 the Communist Party-controlled Global Times stated that \\"China will never waive its right to protect its core interest with military means\\"[12] and a Ministry of Defense spokesman said that \\"China has indisputable sovereignty of the South Sea and China has sufficient historical and legal backing\\" to underpin its claims.[13] China added a tenth-dash line to the east of Taiwan island in 2013 as a part of its official sovereignty claim to the disputed territories in the South China Sea.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the People's Republic of China and Vietnam, the Republic of China (i.e. Taiwan), Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines also claim and occupy some islands. Taiwan claims all the Spratly Islands, but occupies only one island and one shelf including Taiping Island. Malaysia occupies three islands on its continental shelf. The Philippines claim most of the Spratlys and call them the Kalayaan Group of islands, and they form a distinct municipality in the province of Palawan. The Philippines, however, occupy only eight islands. Brunei claims a relatively small area, including islands on Louisa Reef.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndonesia's claims are not on any island, but on maritime rights. (See South China Sea)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are no known native terrestrial animals. Birds include boobies and seagulls, which are very common on the islands. Their faeces can build up to a layer from 10?mm to 1 m annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are around 100ÿ200 native plant species on the islands. For example, the Paracels have 166 native species, but later the Chinese and the Vietnamese introduced 47 more species, including peanut, sweet potato, and various vegetables.","input":"What are the islands in the south china sea?"},{"output":"the first interactive electronic game with an electronic display in 1947","context":"The history of video games spans a period of time between the invention of the first electronic games and today, covering a long period of invention and changes.

The early history of video games, therefore, covers the period of time between the first interactive electronic game with an electronic display in 1947, the first true video games in the early 1950s, and the rise of early arcade video games in the 1970s (Pong and the beginning of the first generation of video game consoles with the Magnavox Odyssey, both in 1972). During this time there were a wide range of devices and inventions corresponding with large advances in computing technology, and the actual first video game is dependent on the definition of \\"video game\\" used.\\r\\nFollowing the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to use an electronic display, the first true video games were created in the early 1950s. Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the Bertie the Brain and Nimrod computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research. A series of games, generally simulating real-world board games, were created at various research institutions to explore programming, humanÿcomputer interaction, and computer algorithms. These include OXO and Christopher Strachey's draughts program in 1952, the first software-based games to incorporate a CRT display, and several chess and checkers programs. Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, featuring moving graphics on an oscilloscope. As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students by the end of the 1950s. These new programmers began to create games for non-academic purposes, leading up to the 1962 release of Spacewar! as one of the earliest known digital computer games to be available outside a single research institute.\\r\\nThroughout the rest of the 1960s, digital computer games were created by increasingly numerous programmers and sometimes sold commercially in catalogs. As the audience for video games expanded to more than a few dozen research institutions with the falling cost of computers, and programming languages that would run on multiple types of computers were created, a wider variety of games began to be developed. Video games transitioned into a new era in the early 1970s with the launch of the commercial video game industry with the display of the coin-operated arcade game Galaxy Game and the release of the first widely available arcade game Computer Space, and then in 1972 with the release of the immensely successful arcade game Pong and the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, which launched the first generation of video game consoles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"video game\\" has evolved over the decades from a purely technical definition to a general concept defining a new class of interactive entertainment. Technically, for a product to be a video game, there must be a video signal transmitted to a cathode ray tube (CRT) that creates a rasterized image on a screen.[1] This definition would preclude early computer games that outputted results to a printer or teletype rather than a display, any game rendered on a vector-scan monitor, any game played on a modern high definition display, and most handheld game systems.[1] From a technical standpoint, these would more properly be called \\"electronic games\\" or \\"computer games\\".[2]\\r\\nToday, however, the term \\"video game\\" has completely shed its purely technical definition and encompasses a wider range of technology. While still rather ill-defined, the term \\"video game\\" now generally encompasses any game played on hardware built with electronic logic circuits that incorporates an element of interactivity and outputs the results of the player's actions to a display.[3] Going by this broader definition, the first video games appeared in the early 1950s; they were tied largely to research projects at universities and large corporations, though, and had little influence on each other due to their primary purpose as academic and promotional devices rather than entertainment games.[4]\\r\\nThe ancestors to these games include the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate a cathode ray tube screen.[5] The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an oscilloscope, with a set of knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program.[6] It was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947.[7] While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories, the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes.[6][8][9] This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around the same time as the device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948, a chess simulation called Turochamp, though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time. Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent, but was never able to run the program on a computer.[9]\\r\\nThe earliest known[citation needed] publicly demonstrated electronic game was created in 1950. Bertie the Brain was an arcade game of tic-tac-toe, built by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition.[10] To showcase his new miniature vacuum tube, the additron tube, he designed a specialized computer to use it, which he built with the assistance of engineers from Rogers Majestic. The large metal computer, which was four meters tall, could only play tic-tac-toe on a lightbulb-backed display, and was installed in the Engineering Building at the Canadian National Exhibition from August 25 to September 9, 1950.[11][12] The game was a success at the two-week exhibition, with attendees lining up to play it as Kates adjusted the difficulty up and down for players. After the exhibition, Bertie was dismantled, and \\"largely forgotten\\" as a novelty. Kates has said that he was working on so many projects at the same time that he had no energy to spare for preserving it, despite its significance.[11]\\r\\nNearly a year later on May 5, 1951, the Nimrod computercreated by engineering firm and nascent computer developer Ferrantiwas presented at the Festival of Britain, and then showcased for three weeks in October at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled.[9] Using a panel of lights for its display, it was designed exclusively to play the game of Nim; moves were made by players pressing buttons which corresponded with the lights. Nimrod could play either the traditional or \\"reverse\\" form of the game.[4] The machine was twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and five feet tall.[9] It was based on an earlier Nim-playing machine, \\"Nimatron\\", designed by Edward Condon and built by Westinghouse Electric in 1940 for display at the New York World's Fair.[4] \\"Nimatron\\" had been constructed from electromechanical relays and weighed over a ton.[13] The Nimrod was primarily intended to showcase Ferranti's computer design and programming skills rather than entertain, and was not followed up by any future games.[4] Despite this, most of the onlookers at the Festival of Britain were more interested in playing the game than in the programming and engineering logic behind it.[9]\\r\\nAround this time, non-visual games were being developed at various research computer laboratories; for example, Christopher Strachey developed a simulation of the game draughts, or checkers, for the Pilot ACE that he unsuccessfully attempted to run for the first time in July 1951 at the British National Physical Laboratory and completed in 1952; this is the first known computer game to be created for a general-purpose computer, rather than a machine specifically made for the game like Bertie.[4][14] Strachey's program inspired Arthur Samuel to develop his own checkers game in 1952 for the IBM 701; successive iterations developed rudimentary artificial intelligence by 1955 and a version was shown on television in 1956.[4][9][15] Also in 1951, Dietrich Prinz wrote the first limited program of chess for the University of Manchester's general-purpose Ferranti Mark 1 computer, one of the first commercially available computers. The program was only capable of computing \\"mate-in-two\\" problems as it was not powerful enough to play a full game, and it had no video output.[16] Around the same time in the early 1950s, the RAND Corporation developed a series of combat simulation games of increasing complexity, where the player would enter orders to intercept enemy aircraft, or set up their forces to counter an enemy army invasion.[14] These simulations were not yet true video games, as they required human intervention to interpret the player's orders and the final results; the computer only controlled the paths that the enemies would take.[4]\\r\\nIn 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, a software program for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC was one of the first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35G16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory.[9][17] As a part of a thesis on humanÿcomputer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game.[18] The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow.[19] The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved.[20] Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded.[9] Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display.[21] Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made.[22] OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen.[4]\\r\\nThe first known game incorporating graphics that updated in real time, rather than only when the player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for a demonstration of the University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob, and a full rack of 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view.[4] The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion.[23] Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.[4]\\r\\nWhile further games like checkers and chess were developed on research computers, the next milestone in video games came in 1958 with Tennis for Two. Perhaps the first game created solely for entertainment rather than as a technology demonstration or a research tool, the program simulated a game of tennis. Created by American physicist William Higinbotham for visitors at the Brookhaven National Laboratory to be more entertaining for visitors on their public day than the usual static exhibits about nuclear power, the game ran on a Donner Model 30 analog computer and displayed a side view of a tennis court on an oscilloscope.[9][24][25] The players controlled the angle of their shots with attached controllers, and the game calculated and simulated the trajectory of the ball, including the possibility of hitting the net.[26] The game was first shown on October 18, 1958. Hundreds of visitors lined up to play the new game during its debut.[26] Due to the game's popularity, an upgraded version was shown the following year, with enhancements including a larger screen and different levels of simulated gravity.[27] Afterwards, having served its purpose, the game was dismantled for its component parts.[9] While the game had no innovations in game design or technological development, its status as an entertainment-focused game, rather than an academic project or technological showpiece, has led it to be considered one of the first \\"real\\" video games as they are generally thought of today.[4]\\r\\nOver the next few years, during 1957ÿ61, various computer games continued to be created in the context of academic computer and programming research, particularly as computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run in batches. A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate students, such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the TX-0 experimental computer.[28] These interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers, many of them students affiliated with the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) led by Alan Kotok, Peter Samson, and Bob Saunders. The games included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze.[29][30] Mouse in the Maze allowed users to use a light pen to set up a maze of walls on the monitor, and spots that represented bits of cheese or glasses of martini. A virtual mouse was then released and would traverse the maze to find the objects.[28] Additionally, the wargame simulations from the early 1950s by the RAND Corporation had expanded into more complicated simulations which required little human intervention, and had also sparked the creation of business management simulation games such as The Management Game, which was used in business schools such as at Carnegie Mellon University by 1958.[4] By 1961, there were over 89 different business simulation games in use, with various graphical capabilities.[31] As the decade ended, despite several video games having been developed, there was no such thing as a commercial video game industry; almost all games had been developed on or as a single machine for specific purposes, and the few simulation games were neither commercial nor for entertainment.[9]\\r\\nBy 1961, MIT had acquired the DEC PDP-1 minicomputer, the successor to the TX-0, which also used a vector display system. The system's comparatively small size and processing speed meant that, like with the TX-0, the university allowed its undergraduate students and employees to write programs for the computer which were not directly academically related whenever it was not in use. In 1961-62, Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen created the game Spacewar! on the PDP-1, inspired by science fiction books such as the Lensman series.[32][33] The game was copied to several of the early minicomputer installations in American academic institutions, making it potentially the first video game to be available outside a single research institute.[34]\\r\\nThe two-player game has the players engaged in a dogfight between two spaceships set against the backdrop of a randomly generated background starfield.[29][33] The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game.[35] The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. After the game's initial development, members of the TMRC worked to improve the game, adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body, and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP-1, a process which continued over the next few years. As the computer was uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad.[36] Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware.[37] Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience.[33][36] Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games.[38]\\r\\nAlthough the market for commercial gamesand software in generalwas small, due to the cost of computers limiting their spread to research institutions and large corporations, several were still created by programmers and distributed by the computer manufacturers. A number of games could be found in an April 1962 IBM program catalog. These included board games, \\"BBC Vik The Baseball Demonstrator\\", and \\"Three Dimensional Tic-Tack-Toe\\".[39] Following the spread of Spacewar, further computer games developed by programmers at universities were also developed and distributed over the next few years. These included the Socratic System, a question and answer game designed to teach medical students how to diagnose patients by Wallace Feurzeig in 1962,[40] and a dice game by Edward Steinberger in 1965.[41]\\r\\nThe creation of general programming languages like BASIC, which could be run on different hardware types, allowed for programs to be written for more than one specific computer, in turn letting games written in them to spread to more end players in the programming community than before. These games included a baseball simulation game written in BASIC by John Kemeny in 1965;[42] a BASIC bingo game by Larry Bethurum in 1966;[43] a basketball simulation game written in BASIC by Charles R. Bacheller in May 1967;[44] another baseball game that simulates the 1967 World Series written in BASIC by Jacob Bergmann in August 1967;[45] Space Travel, written by Ken Thompson for a Multics system in 1969 and which led in part to the development of the Unix operating system;[46] and Hamurabi, a text-based FOCAL game written by Doug Dyment in 1968 and converted to BASIC by David H. Ahl in 1969, and one of the first strategy video games ever made. Hamurabi and Space Travel were among several early mainframe games that were written during the time, and spread beyond their initial mainframe computers to general-purpose languages like BASIC.[47]\\r\\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers, primarily at research institutions and large companies. The history of video games transitioned into a new era early in the decade, however, with the rise of the commercial video game industry. In 1971, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck developed a coin-operated computer game, Galaxy Game, at Stanford University using a DEC PDP-11 computer with vector displays.[48] The pair was inspired to make the game by Spacewar; Tuck had remarked in 1966 while playing the game that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers, but in 1969 DEC released the PDP-11 for US$20,000; while this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, the pair felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.[49] Only prototype units were ever built, though the second prototype was adapted to run up to eight games at once; a few months before the initial installation at Stanford in November 1971, the pair met with Nolan Bushnell, who informed them of his own game he was making for a much lower price.[48][49]\\r\\nThat game was Computer Space, developed by Bushnell and Ted Dabney. They had found the Data General Nova, a US$4,000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of Spacewar at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would be much less expensive: as low as $100.[49][50] By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed for a short time in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy.[51] Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that Galaxy Game was not a real competitor to Computer Space, due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that Galaxy Game was a true expansion of Spacewar, while Computer Space just a pale imitation.[49] Some players at the time, however, believed Galaxy Game to actually be just a version of Spacewar!.[52] Galaxy Game's prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan.[49]\\r\\nAround the same time as Galaxy Game's protoype installation, Computer Space was released. It was the first coin-operated video game to be commercially sold (and the first widely available video game of any kind).[53] While it did well in its initial locations near college campuses, it performed very poorly in bars and arcades where pinball and other arcade games were typically placed; while it was commercially successful and made over US$1,000,000, it did not meet the high expectations of Nutting, who had expected to sell more than 1,500 units.[49][51] Bushnell and Dabney immediately started work on another game, using the same television set design as Computer Space, as well as founding their own company Atari, Inc. to back their projects.[53] While initially this game was to be a driving game that Bushnell planned to design, their first employee, Allan Alcorn, took a prototype ping-pong game suggestion of Bushnell's and expanded on it to create a game the company immediately seized on. They were unable to find a manufacturer, but on the evidence of the success of their prototype installation, decided to produce the game cabinets themselves.[49] Pong was released in 1972, a year after Computer Space. It was immensely commercially successful, selling over 8,000 units. It inspired copycat games to be sold in America, Europe, and Japan, and led to the popularization of the medium.[49][53]\\r\\nThat same year saw the release of the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console which could be connected to a television set. The inventor, Ralph H. Baer, had initially had the idea in 1951 to make an interactive game on a television set. Unable to do so with the technological constraints at the time, he began work on a device that would attach to a television set and display games in 1966, and the \\"Brown Box\\", the last prototype of seven, was licensed to Magnavox to adapt and produce. They announced the console in May 1972, and it went on sale that September. The console and its games featured numerous innovations beyond being the first video game device for home consumers: it was the first game to use a raster-scan video display, or television set, directly displayed via modification of a video signal; it was also the first video gaming device to be displayed in a television commercial.[54] It sold for US$100 and shipped with several games, including \\"Table tennis\\", which Bushnell had seen a demo of and which Pong had been based on.[49] The Odyssey sold over 100,000 units in 1972, and more than 350,000 by the end of 1975, buoyed by the popularity of the table tennis game, in turn driven by the success of Pong.[49][55] Pong and the Odyssey kicked off a new era of video gaming, with numerous other competitors starting up in the video game industry as it grew in popularity.[49]","input":"When was the first ever video game made?"},{"output":"Chris Jussel","context":"Antiques Roadshow is an American television program broadcast on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Public television stations.

Named for its large deposits of petrified wood, the fee area of the park covers about 230 square miles (600 square kilometers), encompassing semi-desert shrub steppe as well as highly eroded and colorful badlands. The park's headquarters is about 26 miles (42?km) east of Holbrook along Interstate 40 (I-40), which parallels the BNSF Railway's Southern Transcon, the Puerco River, and historic U.S. Route 66, all crossing the park roughly eastÿwest. The site, the northern part of which extends into the Painted Desert, was declared a national monument in 1906 and a national park in 1962. The park received 643,274 recreational visitors in 2016, representing a decrease of 19% from the prior year and slightly below the ten year average of about 660,000. Typical visitor activities include sightseeing, photography, hiking, and backpacking.\\r\\nAveraging about 5,400 feet (1,600?m) in elevation, the park has a dry windy climate with temperatures that vary from summer highs of about 100?F (38?C) to winter lows well below freezing. More than 400 species of plants, dominated by grasses such as bunchgrass, blue grama, and sacaton, are found in the park. Fauna include larger animals such as pronghorns, coyotes, and bobcats, many smaller animals, such as deer mice, snakes, lizards, seven kinds of amphibians, and more than 200 species of birds, some of which are permanent residents and many of which are migratory. About half of the park is designated wilderness.\\r\\nThe Petrified Forest is known for its fossils, especially fallen trees that lived in the Late Triassic Period, about 225?million years ago. The sediments containing the fossil logs are part of the widespread and colorful Chinle Formation, from which the Painted Desert gets its name. Beginning about 60?million years ago, the Colorado Plateau, of which the park is part, was pushed upward by tectonic forces and exposed to increased erosion. All of the park's rock layers above the Chinle, except geologically recent ones found in parts of the park, have been removed by wind and water. In addition to petrified logs, fossils found in the park have included Late Triassic ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and many other plants as well as fauna including giant reptiles called phytosaurs, large amphibians, and early dinosaurs. Paleontologists have been unearthing and studying the park's fossils since the early 20th?century.\\r\\nThe park's earliest human inhabitants arrived at least 8,000 years ago. By about 2,000 years ago, they were growing corn in the area and shortly thereafter building pit houses in what would become the park. Later inhabitants built above-ground dwellings called pueblos. Although a changing climate caused the last of the park's pueblos to be abandoned by about 1400?CE, more than 600 archeological sites, including petroglyphs, have been discovered in the park. In the 16th?century, Spanish explorers visited the area, and by the mid-19th?century a U.S. team had surveyed an eastÿwest route through the area where the park is now located and noted the petrified wood. Later, roads and a railway followed similar routes and gave rise to tourism and, before the park was protected, to large-scale removal of fossils. Theft of petrified wood remains a problem in the 21st?century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPetrified Forest National Park straddles the border between Apache County and Navajo County in northeastern Arizona. The park is about 30 miles (48?km) long from north to south, and its width varies from a maximum of about 12 miles (19?km) in the north to a minimum of about 1 mile (1.6?km) along a narrow corridor between the north and south, where the park widens again to about 4 to 5 miles (6 to 8?km).[9]\\r\\nI-40, former U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect the park generally eastÿwest along a similar route. Adamana, a ghost town, is about 1 mile (1.6?km) west of the park along the BNSF tracks. Holbrook, about 26 miles (42?km) west of park headquarters along I-40, is the nearest city.[9][10] Bisecting the park northÿsouth is Park Road, which runs between I-40 near park headquarters on the north and U.S. Route 180 on the south. Historic Highway?180, an earlier alignment of the modern route, crosses the southern edge of the park. Like Route?66, it has deteriorated and is closed. Many unpaved maintenance roads, closed to the public, intersect Park Road at various points.[11]\\r\\nThe fee area of the park covers about 230 square miles (600?km2).[3] The Navajo Nation borders the park on the north and northeast. State-owned land, federal land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, and private land, much of it used for cattle ranching, adjoin the other borders. The parks elevation above sea level varies from a low of 5,340 feet (1,630?m) along the Puerco River to a high of 6,230 feet (1,900?m) at Pilot Rock; the average elevation is about 5,400 feet (1,600?m). The terrain varies from gentle hills and major petrified wood deposits in the south to eroded badlands in the north. Most of the park's intermittent streamsincluding Lithodendron Wash, Dead Wash, Ninemile Wash, and Dry Washempty into the Puerco River. In the southern part of the park, Cottonwood Wash and Jim Camp Wash flow into the Little Colorado River.[11]\\r\\nPetrified Forest National Park is known for its fossils, especially of fallen trees that lived in the Late Triassic period of the Mesozoic era, about 225?million years ago. During this period, the region that is now the park was near the equator on the southwestern edge of the supercontinent Pangaea, and its climate was humid and sub-tropical.[12] What later became northeastern Arizona was a low plain flanked by mountains to the south and southeast and a sea to the west. Streams flowing across the plain from the highlands deposited inorganic sediment and organic matter, including trees as well as other plants and animals that had entered or fallen into the water. Although most organic matter decays rapidly or is eaten by other organisms, some is buried so quickly that it remains intact and may become fossilized.[13] Within the park, the sediments containing the fossil logs for which the park is named are part of the Chinle Formation.[12]\\r\\nThe colorful Chinle, which appears on the surface in many parts of the southwestern United States and from which the Painted Desert gets its name, is up to 800 feet (240?m) thick in the park.[13] It consists of a variety of sedimentary rocks including beds of soft, fine-grained mudstone, siltstone, and claystonemuch of which is bentoniteas well as harder sandstone and conglomerate, and limestone.[12][13] Exposed to wind and water, the Chinle usually erodes differentially into badlands made up of cliffs, gullies, mesas, buttes, and rounded hills.[13] Its bentonite clay, which swells when wet and shrinks while drying, causes surface movement and cracking that discourages plant growth. Lack of plant cover makes the Chinle especially susceptible to weathering.[12]\\r\\nAbout 60?million years ago, tectonic movements of Earths crust began to uplift the Colorado Plateau, of which the Painted Desert is part.[12] Eventually parts of the plateau rose to 10,000 feet (3,000?m) above sea level.[12] This warping of Earths surface led to the gradual and continuing destruction of the plateau by erosion.[14] An unconformity (break in the rock record) of about 200?million years occurs within the park, where erosion has removed all the rock layers above the Chinle except geologically recent ones. The Bidahochi Formation, laid down only 8 to 4?million years ago, rests directly atop the Chinle, and rocks laid down in the Jurassic, Cretaceous, and much of the Tertiary are absent.[12]\\r\\nDuring the period of the Bidahochi deposition, a large lake basin covered much of northeastern Arizona. The older (lower) layers of the formation consist of fluvial and lacustrine (lake-related) deposits of silt, sand, and clay. The younger (upper) Bidahochi contains ash and lava from volcanoes that erupted nearby and as far away as southwestern Nevada.[12] Although much of the Bidahochi has since eroded, a small part of it outcrops in the northern part of the parkon Pilot Rock in the parks wilderness section and along the rim of the Painted Desert between Pintado and Tawa points.[13] Exposed by erosion of the Bidahochi are volcanic landforms called maars (flat-bottomed, roughly circular volcanic craters of explosive origin). A maar vent can be seen from the Pintado Point lookout.[12]\\r\\nDuring the Quaternary Period (2.6?million years ago up to today), deposits of windblown sand and alluvium covered much of the Chinle and Bidahochi. Older dunes range in age from 500,000?years at higher elevations in the northern part of the park to about 10,000?years in sandy drainage areas such as Lithodendron Wash. Stabilized by grasses and other vegetation, young dunes of about 1,000?years old are found throughout the park.[12]\\r\\nDuring the Late Triassic, downed trees accumulating in river channels in what became the park were buried periodically by sediment containing volcanic ash. Groundwater dissolved silica (silicon dioxide) from the ash and carried it into the logs, where it formed quartz crystals that gradually replaced the organic matter. Traces of iron oxide and other substances combined with the silica to create varied colors in the petrified wood.[15]\\r\\nIn Petrified Forest National Park, most of the logs in the park retained their original external form during petrification but lost their internal structure. However, a small fraction of the logs and most of the parks petrified animal bones have cells and other spaces that are mineral-filled but still retain much of their original organic structure. With these permineralized fossils, it is possible to study the cellular make-up of the original organisms with the aid of a microscope. Other organic mattertypically leaves, seeds, cones, pollen grains, spores, small stems, and fish, insect, and animal remainshave been preserved in the park as compression fossils, flattened by the weight of the sediments above until only a thin film remains in the rock.[16]\\r\\nMuch of the parks petrified wood is from Araucarioxylon arizonicum trees, while some found in the northern part of the park is from Woodworthia arizonica and Schilderia adamanica trees. At least nine species of fossil trees from the park have been identified; all are extinct. The park has many other kinds of fossils besides trees. The Chinle, considered one of the richest Late Triassic fossil-plant deposits in the world, contains more than 200 fossil plant taxa. Plant groups represented in the park include lycopods, ferns, cycads, conifers, ginkgoes, as well as unclassified forms.[15] The park has also produced many fossil vertebratesincluding giant crocodile-like reptiles called phytosaurs, large salamander-like amphibians called Buettneria, and early dinosaursand invertebrates, including freshwater snails and clams.[17]\\r\\nAverage summer daytime temperatures range in the mid- to high 90s Fahrenheit.[18] Because the clear skies of the park allow for rapid cooling at night, summer lows are sometimes 40?F (22?C) below the daily highs.[18] July is the warmest month, with an average high of 92?F (33?C) and an average low of 60?F (16?C).[19] January is the coldest month, when highs average 48?F (9?C) and lows average 21?F (?6?C).[19] The highest recorded temperature was 107?F (42?C) in 1998, and the lowest was ?27?F (?33?C) in 1971.[19]\\r\\nWinter winds can reach 60 miles per hour (97?km/h).[18] Summer breezes are lighter, but the 10-mile-per-hour (16?km/h) average wind causes frequent sandstorms and dust devils, some of which reach altitudes of several thousand feet.[18]\\r\\nRain is heaviest from July through September, when about half of the park's annual average precipitation falls during short, violent thunderstorms.[20] August is generally the wettest month.[19] At an elevation of more than 5,000 feet (1,500?m),[1] Petrified Forest National Park has a chance of light snow from October through March, although snow cover rarely persists.[20] The average relative humidity of the area is well below 50?percent and at times less than 15?percent.[18]\\r\\nRuins at Puerco Pueblo in 2010\\r\\nBowls found at Stone Axe Ruin\\r\\nMore than 600 archeological sites have been found inside the boundaries of Petrified Forest National Park. Evidence suggests that the earliest inhabitants of the park arrived at least 8,000 years ago. Two Folsom-type spear points, the earliest artifacts of Paleo-Indians found in the park, are at least that old. Between 6000?BCE and 1?CE, the ArchaicÿEarly Basketmaker Era, nomadic groups established seasonal camps in the Petrified Forest from which they hunted small game such as rabbits, pronghorn antelope, and deer and harvested seeds from Indian ricegrass and other wild plants. Around 150?BCE, they began to grow corn in the area. By 1?CE, as their farming techniques improved, some built houses in the Petrified Forest and began to stay there year-round.[21]\\r\\nThe early farmers from the Early Basketmaker II Era, lived in the Petrified Forest from about 1?CE to about 800?CE. They occupied pit houses at fewer than 100 sites, at first on mesas or other vantage points and later at the base of bluffs and in lowlands, where the soil was better. As climatic conditions worsened for farming between 750 and 900?CE, the settlements changed with the Pueblo I Era. Rather than below-ground pits, the Pueblo Builders constructed above-ground houses and storerooms that may have been capable of storing food for more than one year. At the same time, climatic conditions changed again, this time for the better, between 900 and 1275?CE. More than 200 pueblo-builder sites have been identified in the park at a wide variety of locationsat the mouths of washes, near seeps, and on moisture-holding sand dunes.[22]\\r\\nDuring the Pueblo I Era, most sites were single-family homes, but as soils became exhausted many sites were abandoned by 1250?CE in favor of very large multi-room pueblos close to more dependable sources of water.[23] The Pueblo Builders constructed two of these large pueblos, one called Stone Axe, about 0.5 miles (0.8?km) east of the park, and the other at Puerco Pueblo, which overlooks the Puerco River near the middle of the park.[24] There they built about 100 one-story rooms around an open plaza.[24] The rooms had no windows or doors but each could be entered by climbing a ladder and descending through a hole in the roof. At its peak, perhaps 200 people lived in this pueblo.[24] Over time, however, a persistently dry climate led to out-migration, and the last residents abandoned Puerco Pueblo in about 1380?CE.[25]\\r\\nAt Puerco Pueblo and many other sites within the park, petroglyphsimages, symbols, or designshave been scratched, pecked, carved, or incised on rock surfaces, often on a patina known as desert varnish. Most of the petroglyphs in Petrified Forest National Park are thought to be between 650 and 2,000 years old.[26]\\r\\nFrom the 16th through the 18th?centuries, explorers looking for routes between Spanish colonies along the Rio Grande to the southeast and other Spanish colonies on the Pacific coast to the west passed near or through the area, which they called El Desierto Pintado, the Painted Desert. However, the park's oldest Spanish inscriptions, left by descendants of the region's early Spanish colonists, date only to the late 19th?century.[27]\\r\\nAfter the Southwest became part of the U.S., explorers continued to look for good eastÿwest routes along the 35th?parallel. In 1853, a crew led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Amiel Whipple surveyed along a sandy wash in the northern part of the Petrified Forest. So impressed was Whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it Lithodendron Creek (Stone Tree Creek). Geologist Jules Marcou, a member of the Whipple expedition, observed that the petrified trees were from the Triassic.[27]\\r\\nA slightly later route along the parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19th?century, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar eastÿwest routes. Homesteaders who stayed in the area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20th?century.[27]\\r\\nAlso close to the 35th?parallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the founding of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route?66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road. Interstate?40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway.[27]\\r\\nIncreasing tourist and commercial interest in petrified wood during the late 19th?century began to alarm residents of the region. In 1895, the Arizona Territorial Legislature asked the U.S. Congress to create a petrified forest national park. Although this first attempt failed, in 1906 the Antiquities Act signed by President Theodore Roosevelt was used to create the Petrified Forest National Monument. Between 1934 and 1942, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps built road, trails, and structures in the monument, and the government acquired additional land in the Painted Desert section. The monument became a national park in 1962. Six years after the signing of the Wilderness Act in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, wilderness areas (where human activity is limited), were designated in the park. In 2004, President George W. Bush signed a bill authorizing the eventual expansion of the park from 93,353?acres (about 146?mi2 or 378?km2) to 218,533?acres (about 341?mi2 or 884?km2).[27] Theft of petrified wood is still a problem. Despite a guard force of seven National Park Service rangers, fences, warning signs, and the threat of a $325?fine, an estimated 12 short tons (11,000?kg) of the fossil wood is stolen from the Petrified Forest every year.[28]\\r\\nJessee Walter Fewkes, the first archeologist to visit Puerco Ruin, predicted in the late 19th?century that it would yield many artifacts.[29] Conservationist John Muir conducted the first excavations of the ruin in 1905ÿ06. Although he did not publish his findings, he urged the federal government to preserve Petrified Forest.[29] Professional archeological work in the park began in the early 20th?century when Walter Hough conducted excavations at Puerco Ruin and other sites.[27] In 1919, a phytosaur skull was discovered near Blue Mesa in the Petrified Forest and sent to the Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley, California.[27] In 1921, Annie Alexander, founder of the museum, visited Blue Mesa to collect more of the phytosaur and other specimens; this led to further excavations by paleontologist Charles Camp.[27] Since then, more than 250 fossil sites have been documented in the park.[30] In the 1930s, the Civil Works Administration funded research in the park by archeologists H.P. Mera and C.B. Cosgrove.[27] A National Park Service resurvey of the Petrified Forest in the early 1940s identified most of the large sites with stone ruins, and subsequent surveys since 1978 have identified a total of more than 600 artifact sites, many of them small.[29] Research in paleontology and archeology continues at the park in the 21st?century.[27]\\r\\nA 2005 survey found that 447 species of flora, of which 57 species are invasive, occur in the park.[31] Although the park is known for its fossils and eroded badlands, its main environment is semi-desert shrub steppe. Protected from development and overgrazing for many years, the park has some of the best grassland in northeastern Arizona.[32] In the northern part of the park, the volcanic soils of the Bidahochi Formation support abundant plant life along the Painted Desert rim.[32] In contrast to the relatively bare badlands below, the rim is covered with shrubs, small trees, grasses, and herbs.[32]\\r\\nThe dominant plants in the park include more than 100 grass species, many native to the region. Growing among the grasses are flowering species such as evening primrose, mariposa lily, and blue flax, and shrubs such as sagebrush, saltbush, and rabbitbrush. Among the wide variety of grasses are native perennial bunchgrass, blue grama, sacaton, sideoats grama, bearded sprangletop, and bush muhly. Invasive species that crowd out slower-spreading natives include annual lovegrass and brome (cheat grass).[32]\\r\\nTrees and shrubs grow in riparian zones along the park's washes. Willows and cottonwoods are the larger plants, joined by rushes and sedges. Here the invasive Eurasian tamarisk, also known as saltcedar, threatens native plants by crowding, using most of the available water, and increasing soil salinity by exuding salt through its leaves.[32]\\r\\nSome of the larger animals roaming the grasslands include pronghorns, black-tailed jackrabbits (hares), Gunnison's prairie dogs, coyotes, bobcats and foxes. Pronghorns, the fastest land animals in North America, are capable of 60-mile-per-hour (97?km/h) sprints.[32] The blood vessels in the huge, thin-walled ears of the jackrabbits act as heat exchangers. These hares are known for their bursts of speed, long leaps, and zigzag routes, all of which protect them from being eaten by golden eagles and other predators.[33] The prairie dogs live in large colonies or \\"towns\\", near which many other species find food and shelter.[32] Coyotes dine largely on rodents but also eat fruits, reptiles, insects, small mammals, birds, and carrion.[33]\\r\\nBobcats and bullsnakes hunt smaller animals, such as deer mice and white-tailed antelope squirrels in the park's riparian zones. Western pipistrelle bats feast on insects,[32] and pallid bats eat beetles, centipedes, cicadas, praying mantises, scorpions, and other arthropods.[33] On the Painted Desert rim, small animals find food and shelter among the denser foliage, and mule deer sometimes frequent the area.[32]\\r\\nMore than 16 kinds of lizards and snakes live in various habitats in the park and consume large quantities of insects, spiders, scorpions, other reptiles, and small mammals. The collared lizard, which occurs in every habitat, is the largest and most often seen.\\r\\nPlateau striped whiptails, a species consisting entirely of females, prefer grasslands and developed areas. Side-blotched lizards live in rocky areas of the park but are seldom seen. Gopher snakes, which sometimes imitate rattlesnakes when disturbed, are among the most common snakes in the park. The Western rattlesnake, the only venomous snake found in the park, prefers grasslands and shrub areas.[34]\\r\\nSeven kinds of amphibians, which drink no water but absorb it through their permeable skins, have been identified in Petrified Forest National Park. Tiger salamanders, found in grassland and near major drainages, are the only salamander species known in Arizona. Woodhouses toads, which are seldom seen, are the largest toads in the park. They like grasslands, riparian corridors, and developed areas. Red-spotted toads, most active in the rainy season, July through September, are found in rocky areas near streams and in canyons. The Great Plains toad, the most common toad in the park, prefers grasslands. Resident spadefoot toads include the New Mexico, plains, and Couch's varieties.[35]\\r\\nA survey conducted in 2006 identified 216 species of birds known to have occurred in Petrified Forest National Park since the park became a protected area in 1906. Of those, 33 species breed within the park, 6 other species probably do, and 18 species live in the park year-round. Thirty-five species live in the park only during the summer and 11 species only during the winter. The greatest diversity of birds occurs during fall and winter migrations.[36]\\r\\nRaptors, songbirds, and ground birds are found in the park's grassland, while the Puerco River's riparian corridor is a good place for year-round residents as well as migrants such as warblers, vireos, avocets, and killdeer. Developed areas around the visitor center and museum attract western tanagers, hermit warblers, house finches, and others. Occasional shorebirds and eastern birds also visit the park.[37]\\r\\nBirds commonly seen in the park include the common raven and the western meadowlark, known for its charming song. Anna's hummingbird, which can hover and fly backwards as well as forwards, is among the smallest birds in the park. The largest is the golden eagle, with a wingspan of up to 7 feet (2?m).[37]\\r\\nThe park is open every day except Christmas (December 25) on a schedule that varies slightly with the seasons. In 2010, it and its Painted Desert Visitor Center and Rainbow Forest Museum were open from 7?a.m. to 7?p.m. from May?9 through September?6 but opened as early as 8?a.m. and closed as late as 5?p.m. during other parts of the year. The Painted Desert Inn (a historic museum and bookstore) is open from 9?a.m. to 5?p.m. year-round except Christmas. Park clocks are always set to Mountain Standard Time, as Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time.[38]\\r\\nThe Painted Desert Visitor Center, designed by modernist architect Richard Neutra, is part of the Painted Desert Community Complex Historic District and is on the National Register of Historic Places.[39] Eight other sites within the park are also on the National Register, including the Painted Desert Inn and associated cabins, the Agate House Pueblo, the Painted Desert Petroglyphs and Ruins Archeological District, Newspaper Rock Petroglyphs Archeological District, Puerco Ruin and Petroglyphs, the Flattop Site (an archeological site), the Twin Buttes Archeological District, and the 35th Parallel Route (also known as the Beale Camel Trail). The Painted Desert Inn was upgraded to a National Historic Landmark in 1987.[40]\\r\\nThe visitor center, which is near the north entrance to the park, offers visitor information and shows a 20-minute orientation movie, \\"Timeless Impressions\\", once every half-hour. It has a bookstore, exhibits, a restaurant open from 8?a.m. to 3?p.m., a gift shop, a gas station, a post office open from 11?a.m. to 1?p.m. Monday through Friday, a postal drop box, and public restrooms. The Rainbow Forest Museum complex 2 miles (3.2?km) north of the park's south entrance offers services including information and \\"Timeless Impressions\\" showings once every half-hour. It has a bookstore, fossil exhibits, an interactive Triassic Virtual Tour, limited food service, a gift shop, and public restrooms. The Painted Desert Inn, 2 miles (3.2?km) north of the Painted Desert Visitor Center, offers visitor information. It has a bookstore, museum exhibits (including the building itself), and public restrooms.[41]\\r\\nNo campgrounds or overnight lodging are available in the park, although nearby communities such as Holbrook offer motels and other accommodations.[41] Overnight parking is not allowed[41] except in the case of backpackers with wilderness hiking permits.[42] Sightseeing is available by private automobile, motorcycle, commercial tour, bicycle, and hiking. The park road, parking lots, and turn-outs are big enough to accommodate large recreational vehicles. Off-road vehicle travel, including by mountain bike, is not allowed.[43] With a few exceptions such as unpaved Old Highway 66, bicycles must stay on paved roads such as the 28-mile (45?km) main park road and stay off trails and unpaved surfaces.[44]\\r\\nThe park's seven maintained hiking trails, some paved, vary in length from less than 0.5 miles (0.8?km) to nearly 3 miles (4.8?km). Pets are allowed on these trails if kept on a leash, but bicycles are not. These named trails are Painted Desert Rim, Puerco Pueblo, Blue Mesa, Crystal Forest, Giant Logs, Long Logs, and Agate House.[45] Hikers and backpackers may also visit the park's wilderness areas. Free permits are required for overnight stays; they are issued from the Painted Desert Visitor Center, Painted Desert Inn, and Rainbow Forest Museum. Most backpackers enter the wilderness at the north end of the park, where parking and an access trail are available at Painted Desert Inn. Group camping is limited to eight people.[42] Horseback riding is allowed in the wilderness areas; water for horses is available at the service station near the Painted Desert Visitor Center. Riders and hikers are asked to travel along dry washes as much as possible to reduce the impact on fragile desert soils.[46]\\r\\nRangers offer a variety of programs about the park. Regularly scheduled events include a Painted Desert Inn tour, a Triassic program at the Rainbow Forest Museum sunroom, a talk or walk along the Giant Logs Trail behind the museum, and a Puerco Pueblo guided walk.[47] The park hosts special events related to Earth Science Week and National American Indian Heritage Month.[48] On Saturdays from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day at the Painted Desert Inn, artisans from the region give cultural demonstrations related to ancient peoples, intertribal relationships, and European-descent cultures.[49] For students and teachers, the rangers offer educational materials and field-trip talks.[50] In some years during the summer months, artists-in-residence work in the park.[51]","input":"Where is the petrified forest national park located?"},{"output":"after birth","context":"Meconium is the earliest stool of a mammalian infant. Unlike later feces, meconium is composed of materials ingested during the time the infant spends in the uterus: intestinal epithelial cells, lanugo, mucus, amniotic fluid, bile, and water. Meconium, unlike later feces, is viscous and sticky like tar, its color usually being a very dark olive green; it is almost odorless. When diluted in amniotic fluid, it may appear in various shades of green, brown, or yellow. It should be completely passed by the end of the first few days after birth, with the stools progressing toward yellow (digested milk).\\r\\nMeconium is normally retained in the infant's bowel until after birth, but sometimes it is expelled into the amniotic fluid (also called \\"amniotic liquor\\") prior to birth or during labor and delivery. The stained amniotic fluid (called \\"meconium liquor\\" or \\"meconium stained liquor\\") is recognised by medical staff that this may be a sign of fetal distress. Some post-dates pregnancies (where the woman is more than 40 weeks pregnant) may also have meconium stained liquor without fetal distress. Medical staff may aspirate the meconium from the nose and mouth of a newborn immediately after delivery in the event the baby shows signs of respiratory distress to decrease the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome.\\r\\nMeconium had been thought to be sterile until researchers found bacterial communities in it so developed that they seemed to fall into two categories. Around half of the samples appeared to be dominated by bacteria that produce lactic acid, such as lactobacillus, while the other half mostly contained a family of so-called enteric bacteria, such as Escherichia coli.[1]\\r\\nThe Latin term meconium derives from the Greek ׻Ұ?, mknion, a diminutive of ?, mkn, i.e. poppy, in reference either to its tarry appearance that may resemble some raw opium preparations, or to Aristotle's belief that it induces sleep in the fetus.[2][3][4]\\r\\nA symptom of both Hirschsprung's disease and cystic fibrosis is the failure to pass meconium.\\r\\nMeconium can be tested for various drugs, to check for in utero exposure. Using meconium, a Canadian research group showed that by measuring a by-product of alcohol (FAEE) they could objectively detect babies exposed to excessive maternal drinking of alcohol in pregnancy.[5] In the USA, the results of meconium testing may be used by child protective services and other law enforcement agencies to determine the eligibility of the parents to keep the newborn.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the time that the amniotic fluid is stained with meconium it will be homogeneously distributed throughout the fluid making it brown. This indicates that the fetus passed the meconium some time ago such that sufficient mixing occurred as to establish the homogeneous mixture. Terminal meconium occurs when the fetus passes the meconium a short enough time before birth/caesarean section that the amniotic fluid remains clear, but individual clumps of meconium are in the fluid.\\r\\nThe meconium sometimes becomes thickened and congested in the intestines, a condition known as meconium ileus. Meconium ileus is often the first sign of cystic fibrosis.[7] In cystic fibrosis, the meconium can form a bituminous black-green mechanical obstruction in a segment of the ileum. Beyond this there may be a few separate grey-white globular pellets. Below this level, the bowel is a narrow and empty micro-colon. Above the level of the obstruction, there are several loops of hypertrophied bowel distended with fluid. No meconium is passed, and abdominal distension and vomiting appear soon after birth. About 20% of cases of cystic fibrosis present with meconium ileus, while approximately 20% of one series of cases of meconium ileus did not have cystic fibrosis.[8] The presence of meconium ileus is not related to the severity of the cystic fibrosis.[9] The obstruction can be relieved in a number of different ways.[10]\\r\\nMeconium ileus should be distinguished from meconium plug syndrome, in which a tenacious mass of mucus prevents the meconium from passing and there is no risk of intestinal perforation. Meconium ileus has a significant risk of intestinal perforation. In barium enema, meconium plug syndrome rather shows normal or dilated colon as compared to micro-colon in meconium ileus.\\r\\nMeconium from 13-hour-old newborn.\\r\\nThis image compares the appearance of meconium (from 48 hours after normal delivery at term) to the appearance of the same infant's faeces after 1 week of breastfeeding.","input":"When does a baby have its first bowel movement?"},{"output":"Warren Hastings","context":"The Governor-General of India (or, from 1858 to 1947, officially the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, commonly shortened to Viceroy of India) was originally the head of the British administration in India and, later, after Indian independence in 1947, the representative of the Indian head of state. The office was created in 1773, with the title of Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William. The officer had direct control only over Fort William, but supervised other British East India Company officials in India. Complete authority over all of British India was granted in 1833, and the official came to be known as the \\"Governor-General of India\\".\\r\\nIn 1858, the territories of the East India Company came under the direct control of the British government; see British Raj. The governor-general (now also the viceroy) headed the central government of India, which administered the provinces of British India, including the Punjab, Bengal, Bombay, Madras, the United Provinces, and others.[1] However, much of India was not ruled directly by the British government; outside the provinces of British India, there were hundreds of nominally sovereign princely states or \\"native states\\", whose relationship was not with the British government, but directly with the monarch. To reflect the governor-general's role as the representative of the monarch to the feudal rulers of the princely states, from 1858 the term Viceroy and Governor-General of India (known in short as the Viceroy of India) was applied to him.\\r\\nThe title of viceroy was abandoned when British India split into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan, but the office of governor-general continued to exist in each country separatelyuntil they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956, respectively.\\r\\nUntil 1858, the governor-general was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company, to whom he was responsible. Thereafter, he was appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the British government; the Secretary of State for India, a member of the UK Cabinet, was responsible for instructing him on the exercise of his powers. After 1947, the sovereign continued to appoint the governor-general, but did so on the advice of the Indian government.\\r\\nGovernors-General served at the pleasure of the sovereign, though the practice was to have them serve five-year terms. Governors-General could have their commission rescinded; and if one was removed, or left, a provisional governor-general was sometimes appointed until a new holder of the office could be chosen. The first Governor-General of British India was Warren Hastings, and the first Governor-General of independent India was Louis Mountbatten.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany parts of the Indian subcontinent were governed by the East India Company, which nominally acted as the agent of the Mughal Emperor. In 1773, motivated by corruption in the Company, the British government assumed partial control over the governance of India with the passage of the Regulating Act of 1773. A Governor-General and Supreme Council of Bengal were appointed to rule over the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal. The first Governor-General and Council were named in the Act.\\r\\nThe Charter Act 1833 replaced the Governor-General and Council of Fort William with the Governor-General and Council of India. The power to elect the Governor-General was retained by the Court of Directors, but the choice became subject to the Sovereign's approval.\\r\\nAfter the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the East India Company's territories in India were put under the direct control of the Sovereign. The Government of India Act 1858 vested the power to appoint the Governor-General in the Sovereign. The Governor-General, in turn, had the power to appoint all lieutenant governors in India, subject to the Sovereign's approval.\\r\\nIndia and Pakistan acquired independence in 1947, but Governors-General continued to be appointed over each nation until republican constitutions were written. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma remained Governor-General of India for some time after independence, but the two nations were otherwise headed by native Governors-General. India became a secular republic in 1950; Pakistan became an Islamic one in 1956.\\r\\nThe Governor-General originally had power only over the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal. The Regulating Act, however, granted them additional powers relating to foreign affairs and defence. The other Presidencies of the East India Company (Madras, Bombay and Bencoolen) were not allowed to declare war on or make peace with an Indian prince without receiving the prior approval of the Governor-General and Council of Fort William.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe powers of the Governor-General, in respect of foreign affairs, were increased by the India Act 1784. The Act provided that the other Governors under the East India Company could not declare war, make peace or conclude a treaty with an Indian prince unless expressly directed to do so by the Governor-General or by the Company's Court of Directors.\\r\\nWhile the Governor-General thus became the controller of foreign policy in India, he was not the explicit head of British India. That status came only with the Charter Act 1833, which granted him \\"superintendence, direction and control of the whole civil and military Government\\" of all of British India. The Act also granted legislative powers to the Governor-General and Council.\\r\\nAfter 1858, the Governor-General (now usually known as the Viceroy) functioned as the chief administrator of India and as the Sovereign's representative. India was divided into numerous provinces, each under the head of a Governor, Lieutenant Governor or Chief Commissioner or Administrator. Governors were appointed by the British Government, to whom they were directly responsible; Lieutenant Governors, Chief Commissioners, and Administrators, however, were appointed by and were subordinate to the Viceroy. The Viceroy also oversaw the most powerful princely rulers: the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maharaja of Mysore, the Maharaja (Scindia) of Gwalior, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir and the Gaekwad (Gaekwar) Maharaja of Baroda. The remaining princely rulers were overseen either by the Rajputana Agency and Central India Agency, which were headed by representatives of the Viceroy, or by provincial authorities.\\r\\nThe Chamber of Princes was an institution established in 1920 by a Royal Proclamation of King-Emperor George V to provide a forum in which the princely rulers could voice their needs and aspirations to the government. The chamber usually met only once a year, with the Viceroy presiding, but it appointed a Standing Committee, which met more often.\\r\\nUpon independence in August 1947, the title of Viceroy was abolished. The representative of the British Sovereign became known once again as the Governor-General. C. Rajagopalachari became the only Indian Governor-General. However, once India acquired independence, the Governor-General's role became almost entirely ceremonial, with power being exercised on a day-to-day basis by the Indian cabinet. After the nation became a republic in 1950, the President of India continued to perform the same functions.\\r\\nThe Governor-General was always advised by a Council on the exercise of his legislative and executive powers. The Governor-General, while exercising many functions, was referred to as the \\"Governor-General in Council.\\"\\r\\nThe Regulating Act 1773 provided for the election of four counsellors by the East India Company's Court of Directors. The Governor-General had a vote along with the counsellors, but he also had an additional vote to break ties. The decision of the Council was binding on the Governor-General.\\r\\nIn 1784, the Council was reduced to three members; the Governor-General continued to have both an ordinary vote and a casting vote. In 1786, the power of the Governor-General was increased even further, as Council decisions ceased to be binding.\\r\\nThe Charter Act 1833 made further changes to the structure of the Council. The Act was the first law to distinguish between the executive and legislative responsibilities of the Governor-General. As provided under the Act, there were to be four members of the Council elected by the Court of Directors. The first three members were permitted to participate on all occasions, but the fourth member was only allowed to sit and vote when legislation was being debated.\\r\\nIn 1858, the Court of Directors ceased to have the power to elect members of the Council. Instead, the one member who had a vote only on legislative questions came to be appointed by the Sovereign, and the other three members by the Secretary of State for India.\\r\\nThe Indian Councils Act 1861 made several changes to the Council's composition. Three members were to be appointed by the Secretary of State for India, and two by the Sovereign. (The power to appoint all five members passed to the Crown in 1869). The Viceroy was empowered to appoint an additional six to twelve members (changed to ten to sixteen in 1892, and to sixty in 1909). The five individuals appointed by the Sovereign or the Indian Secretary headed the executive departments, while those appointed by the Viceroy debated and voted on legislation.\\r\\nIn 1919, an Indian legislature, consisting of a Council of State and a Legislative Assembly, took over the legislative functions of the Viceroy's Council. The Viceroy nonetheless retained significant power over legislation. He could authorise the expenditure of money without the Legislature's consent for \\"ecclesiastical, political [and] defense\\" purposes, and for any purpose during \\"emergencies.\\" He was permitted to veto, or even stop debate on, any bill. If he recommended the passage of a bill, but only one chamber cooperated, he could declare the bill passed over the objections of the other chamber. The Legislature had no authority over foreign affairs and defence. The President of the Council of State was appointed by the Viceroy; the Legislative Assembly elected its President, but the election required the Viceroy's approval.\\r\\nUntil 1833, the title of the position was \\"Governor-General of Bengal\\". The Government of India Act 1833 converted the title into \\"Governor-General of India.\\" The title \\"Viceroy and Governor-General\\" was first used in the queen's proclamation appointing Viscount Canning in 1858.[3] It was never conferred by an act of parliament, but was used in warrants of precedence and in the statutes of knightly orders. In usage, \\"viceroy\\" is employed where the governor-general's position as the monarch's representative is in view.[4] The viceregal title was not used when the sovereign was present in India. It was meant to indicate new responsibilities, especially ritualistic ones, but it conferred no new statutory authority. The governor-general regularly used the title in communications with the Imperial Legislative Council, but all legislation was made only in the name of the Governor-General-in-Council (or the Government of India).[5]\\r\\nThe Governor-General was styled Excellency and enjoyed precedence over all other government officials in India. He was referred to as 'His Excellency' and addressed as 'Your Excellency'. From 1858 to 1947, the Governor-General was known as the Viceroy of India (from the French roi, meaning 'king'), and wives of Viceroys were known as Vicereines (from the French reine, meaning 'queen'). The Vicereine was referred to as 'Her Excellency' and was also addressed as 'Your Excellency'. Neither title was employed while the Sovereign was in India. However, the only reigning British Sovereign to visit India during the period of British rule was King George V, who accompanied by his consort Queen Mary attended the Delhi Durbar in 1911.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen the Order of the Star of India was founded in 1861, the Viceroy was made its Grand Master ex officio. The Viceroy was also made the ex officio Grand Master of the Order of the Indian Empire upon its foundation in 1877.\\r\\nMost Governors-General and Viceroys were peers. Frequently, a Viceroy who was already a peer would be granted a peerage of higher rank, as with the granting of a marquessate to Lord Reading and an earldom and later a marquessate to Freeman Freeman-Thomas. Of those Viceroys who were not peers, Sir John Shore was a baronet, and Lord William Bentinck was entitled to the courtesy title 'Lord' because he was the son of a Duke. Only the first and last Governors-General?ÿ Warren Hastings and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari?ÿ as well as some provisional Governors-General, had no honorific titles at all.\\r\\nFrom around 1885, the Viceroy of India was allowed to fly a Union Flag augmented in the centre with the 'Star of India' surmounted by a Crown. This flag was not the Viceroy's personal flag; it was also used by Governors, Lieutenant Governors, Chief Commissioners and other British officers in India. When at sea, only the Viceroy flew the flag from the mainmast, while other officials flew it from the foremast.\\r\\nFrom 1947 to 1950, the Governor-General of India used a dark blue flag bearing the royal crest (a lion standing on the Crown), beneath which was the word 'India' in gold majuscules. The same design is still used by many other Commonwealth Realm Governors-General. This last flag was the personal flag of the Governor-General only.\\r\\nThe Governor-General of Fort William resided in Belvedere House, Calcutta, until the early nineteenth century, when Government House was constructed. In 1854, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal took up residence there. Now, the Belvedere Estate houses the National Library of India.\\r\\nLord Wellesley, who is reputed to have said that India should be governed from a palace, not from a country house, constructed a grand mansion, known as Government House, between 1799 and 1803. The mansion remained in use until the capital moved from Calcutta to Delhi in 1912. Thereafter, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, who had hitherto resided in Belvedere House, was upgraded to a full Governor and transferred to Government House. Now, it serves as the residence of the Governor of the Indian state of West Bengal, and is referred to by its Bengali name Raj Bhavan.\\r\\nAfter the capital moved from Calcutta to Delhi, the Viceroy occupied the newly built Viceroy's House, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Though construction began in 1912, it did not conclude until 1929; the palace was not formally inaugurated until 1931. The final cost exceeded S877,000 (over S35,000,000 in modern terms)?ÿ more than twice the figure originally allocated. Today the residence, now known by the Hindi name of 'Rashtrapati Bhavan', is used by the President of India.\\r\\nThroughout the British administration, Governors-General retreated to the Viceregal Lodge (Rashtrapati Niwas) at Shimla each summer to escape the heat, and the government of India moved with them. The Viceregal Lodge now houses the Indian Institute of Advanced Study.\\r\\nBadge of the Governor-General (1885ÿ1947)\\r\\nStandard of the Governor-General (1885ÿ1947)\\r\\nStandard of the Governor-General (1947ÿ50)","input":"Who is the 1st governor general of india?"},{"output":"a crossover SUV","context":"The Jeep Cherokee is a line of vehicles sold by Jeep under various vehicle classes. Originally sold as a variant of the popular Jeep Wagoneer, the Cherokee has evolved from a full-size SUV to one of the first compact SUVs and eventually into its current incarnation as a crossover SUV. The nameplate has been in continuous use in some form since 1974 and also spawned Jeep's most successful vehicle, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which was originally slated to be part of the Cherokee's lineup. The vehicle is named after the Cherokee tribe of Native Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cherokee was a rebadged reintroduction of a two-door body style Jeep Wagoneer, with a redesigned greenhouse that eliminated the car's C-pillar. Instead the Cherokee sported a much wider D-pillar and a single, long fixed rear side window with an optional flip-out section. Previously, a two-door version had been available in the Jeep Wagoneer line (from 1963 to 1967), although this had the same pillar and window configuration as the four-door Wagoneer. The Cherokee replaced the Jeepster Commando, whose sales had not met expectations despite an extensive 1972 revamp. The Cherokee appealed to a younger market than the Wagoneer, which was regarded more as a family SUV.\\r\\nThe Cherokee was marketed as the \\"sporty\\" two-door variant of Jeep's station wagon. The term \\"sport(s) utility vehicle\\" appears for the first time in the 1974 Cherokee sales brochure.[2][3][4] A four-door was not added to the lineup until 1977. Other than the base model, the trim levels of the Cherokee included the S (Sport), Chief, Golden Eagle, Golden Hawk, Limited, Classic, Sport, Pioneer, and Laredo.\\r\\nWhile the Wagoneer continued in production for another eight years as the Grand Wagoneer, the Cherokee nameplate was moved to a new platform for 1984. Without a traditional body-on-frame chassis, the Cherokee instead featured a light-weight unibody design.[7]\\r\\nThis generation Cherokee would eventually be well-known as an innovator of the modern SUV, as it spawned competitors as other automakers began to notice that this Jeep design began replacing regular cars.[8] It also began to supplant the role of the station wagon and \\"transformed from truck to limousine in the eyes of countless suburban owners.\\"[9] The XJ is a \\"significant link in the evolution of the 4x4.\\"[10]\\r\\nIt would prove to be so popular that the second generation Cherokee's replacement was released as a separate vehicle altogether as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, itself starting a successive line of vehicles as Jeep's flagship vehicle.\\r\\nThe third generation, marketed as the Jeep Liberty in North America to differentiate itself from the Grand Cherokee, was introduced in April 2001 for the 2002 model year.\\r\\nThe Cherokee was priced between the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee. It remained the smallest of the 4-door Jeep SUVs up until the crossover-based 4-door Compass and Patriot arrived for 2007. The Cherokee featured unibody-construction. It was assembled at the Toledo North Assembly Plant in the United States, as well as in other countries including Egypt and Venezuela.\\r\\nIt was the first Jeep vehicle to use rack and pinion steering.[11] It also the first Jeep to use the two then-new PowerTech engines; the 150 horsepower (110?kW) 2.4 L straight-4, which was discontinued in 2006, and the 210 horsepower (160?kW) 3.7 L V6. However, the Cherokee was not the first Jeep vehicle to use an independent front suspension, as the Wagoneer first used it in the 1963 model. But, that independent front suspension was limited to four wheel drive versions and, even then, was a short lived option.[12]\\r\\nStill using the Jeep Liberty name in North America, the Cherokee was redesigned in 2008. For the first time, a rebadged version of a Jeep model existed, as Dodge sold this version of the Cherokee as the Dodge Nitro during the same time period as the fourth-generation Cherokee. It was eventually discontinued both due to slow sales as well as Sergio Marchionne wanting to avoid duplicated vehicles with Dodge and Jeep (as well as Chrysler) sharing the same sales network.\\r\\nWith the smaller Patriot and Compass now available to cater to MPG-conscious buyers, the four-cylinder engine was dropped from the Cherokee's offerings. The iron-block, aluminum-head V6 was the only engine available for 2008. Towing capacity was 5,000 pounds (2,268?kg). Jeep discontinued the Cherokee's CRD for the American market because it couldn't meet tougher 2007 emissions standards for diesel engines. Transmission choices were both carry-overs: a six-speed manual or a four-speed automatic. Standard equipment included electronic stability control with roll mitigation, traction control, and anti-lock brakes with brake assist. New Features included standard side airbags. Optional features are rain-sensing wipers, Sirius Satellite Radio, Bluetooth, a navigation system, and the MyGig entertainment system, complete with a 30GB hard drive.\\r\\nFor the fifth generation, the Cherokee nameplate returned to North America as the vehicle was converted to a crossover and grew to midsize in order to make room for the Jeep Renegade below the Cherokee and Compass. It was introduced for the 2014 model year at the 2013 New York International Auto Show and the sales started in November 2013.[16][19][19] The Cherokee is the first Jeep vehicle to be built on the Fiat Compact/Compact U.S. Wide platform, co-developed by Chrysler and Fiat.[18] The Jeep Cherokee is built at Toledo North Assembly Plant in Toledo, Ohio.[20]\\r\\nThe Cherokee has a highway fuel economy rating of 31 miles per U.S. gallon (7.6?L/100?km; 37?mpg?imp)[18] and a 45% better fuel economy rating than the Liberty/Cherokee it replaced.[19][20]\\r\\nDespite its controversial front-end styling,[19][20] the fifth-generation Cherokee would become such a sales success that FCA discontinued the slow-selling Dodge Dart and Chrysler 200 (both mechanically similar to the Cherokee) in order to increase production capacity for the Cherokee to meet demand. For 2019 the front end is to be updated to a more conservative style.","input":"What kind of car is a jeep cherokee?"},{"output":"Congress declared war on the Empire of Japan","context":"The results of the attack on Pearl Harbor were many and significant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor. After two hours of bombing, 18 U.S. ships were sunk or damaged, 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed, and 2,403 men were killed.\\r\\nThe day after the attack, President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed a joint session of the 77th United States Congress. Roosevelt called December 7 \\"a date which will live in infamy\\". Congress declared war on the Empire of Japan amid outrage at the attack, the deaths of thousands of Americans, and the late delivery of the note from the Japanese government breaking off relations with the U.S. government. Pacifist Representative Jeannette Rankin, a Republican from Montana, cast the only dissenting vote. Roosevelt signed the declaration of war later the same day. Continuing to intensify its military mobilization, the U.S. government finished converting to a war economy, a process begun by provision of weapons and supplies to the Soviet Union and the British Empire. Japanese Americans from the West Coast were sent to internment camps for the duration of the war.\\r\\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor immediately galvanized a divided nation into action. Public opinion had been moving towards support for entering the war during 1941, but considerable opposition remained until the attack. Overnight, Americans united against the Empire of Japan in response to calls to \\"Remember Pearl Harbor.\\" American solidarity in the war effort probably made possible the unconditional surrender position later taken by the Allied Powers. Some historians, among them Samuel Eliot Morison, believe the attack doomed Imperial Japan to defeat simply because it awakened the \\"sleeping giant\\", regardless of whether the fuel depots or machine shops had been destroyed or even if the carriers had been caught in port and sunk. U.S. industrial and military capacity, once mobilized, was able to pour overwhelming resources into both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters. Others, such as Clay Blair, Jr.,[1] and Mark Parillo[2] believe Japanese trade protection was so incompetent that American submarines alone might have strangled Japan into defeat.\\r\\nThe closest friend Roosevelt had in the developing Allied alliance, Sir Winston Churchill, stated that his first thought regarding American assistance to the United Kingdom was that \\"We have won the war\\"[3] very soon after Pearl Harbor had been attacked.\\r\\nPerceptions of treachery in the attack before a declaration of war sparked fears of sabotage or espionage by Japanese sympathizers residing in the U.S., including citizens of Japanese descent and was a factor in the subsequent Japanese internment in the western United States. Other factors included misrepresentations of intelligence information suggesting sabotage, notably by General John DeWitt, commanding general of Western Defense Command on the Pacific Coast, who had personal feelings against Japanese Americans.[4] In February 1942, Roosevelt signed United States Executive Order 9066, requiring all Japanese Americans to submit themselves for internment.\\r\\nPropaganda made repeated use of the attack, because its effect was enormous and impossible to counter.[5] \\"Remember Pearl Harbor!\\" became the watchwords of the war.[6]\\r\\nThe American government understated the damage inflicted, in hopes of preventing the Japanese from learning it, but the Japanese had, through surveillance, a good estimate.[7]\\r\\nOn December 8, 1941, the Empire of Japan declared war on the United States and the British Empire. The Japanese document discussed world peace and the disruptive actions of the United States and the United Kingdom. The document claimed all avenues for averting war had been exhausted by the Government of Japan.\\r\\nAlthough the Imperial Japanese government had made some effort to prepare their population for war via anti-U.S. propaganda, it appears most Japanese were surprised, apprehensive, and dismayed by the news they were now at war with the U.S., a country many Japanese admired. Nevertheless, the people at home and overseas thereafter generally accepted their government's account of the attack and supported the war effort until their nation's surrender in 1945.[8]\\r\\nJapan's national leadership at the time appeared to have believed war between the U.S. and Japan had long been inevitable. In any case, Japanese-American relationships had already significantly deteriorated since Japan's invasion of China beginning in the early 1930s, of which the United States strongly disapproved. In 1942, Sabur Kurusu, former Japanese ambassador to the United States, gave an address in which he talked about the \\"historical inevitability of the war of Greater East Asia.\\"[9] He said war had been a response to Washington's longstanding aggression toward Japan. For example, provocations against Japan included the San Francisco School incident, Naval Limitations Treaty, other unequal treaties, the Nine Power Pact, constant economic pressure against Japan, culminating in the \\"belligerent\\" scrap metal and oil embargo in 1941 by the United States and Allied countries to contain and/or reverse the actions of the Empire of Japan especially in Indochina during her expansion of influence and interests throughout Asia. In light of Japan's dependence on imported oil, the trade embargoes were especially significant. These pressures directly influenced Japan to go into alliance with Germany and Italy through the Tripartite Pact. According to Kurusu, because of these reasons, the Allies had already provoked war with Japan long before the attack at Pearl Harbor, and the United States was already preparing for war with Japan. Kurusu also states the United States was also looking for world domination, beyond just Asia, with \\"sinister designs\\".[9] Some of this view seems to have been shared by Adolf Hitler, when he called it one of the reasons Germany declared war on the United States. He also had mentioned European imperialism toward Japan many years before. Therefore, according to Kurusu, Japan had no choice but to defend herself and so should rapidly continue to militarize, bring Germany and Italy closer as allies and militarily combat the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands.\\r\\nJapan's leaders also saw themselves as justified in their conduct, believing that they were building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. They also explained Japan had done everything possible to alleviate tension between the two nations. The decision to attack, at least for public presentation, was reluctant and forced on Japan. Of the Pearl Harbor attack itself, Kurusu said it came in direct response to a virtual ultimatum from the U.S. government, the Hull note, and so the surprise attack was not treacherous. Since the Japanese-American relationship already had hit its lowest point, there was no alternative; in any case, had an acceptable settlement of differences been reached, the Carrier Striking Task Force could have been called back.\\r\\nOn December 11, 1941, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States, and the United States reciprocated, formally entering the war in Europe.\\r\\nGerman dictator Adolf Hitler and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini were under no obligation to declare war on the United States under the mutual defense terms of the Tripartite Pact until the US counterattacked Japan. However, relations between the European Axis Powers and the United States had deteriorated since 1937. On December 4, 1941, the Germans learned of the U.S. military's contingency planning to get troops in Continental Europe by 1943; this was Rainbow Five, made public by sources unsympathetic to Roosevelt's New Deal, and published by the Chicago Tribune on that date.[10] Moreover, with Roosevelt's initiation of a Neutrality Patrol, which in fact also escorted British ships, as well as orders to U.S. Navy destroyers first to actively report U-boats, then \\"shoot on sight\\", American neutrality was honored more in the breach than observance.[11]\\r\\nHaving been unaware of Japanese plans, Hitler was initially furious that the United States had been dragged into the war at a time when he had not yet acquired full control of continental Europe  on the very day of the Pearl Harbor attack, Hitler himself had issued his Nacht und Nebel decree, concerning the suppression of resistance activities within Nazi-occupied lands. Hitler, who had previously declared the Japanese \\"Honorary Aryans\\" claimed that \\"this is what happens when your allies are not Anglo-Saxons\\".[12][citation needed] However, he decided war with the United States was unavoidable, and the Pearl Harbor attack, the publication of Rainbow Five, and Roosevelt's post-Pearl Harbor address, which focused on European affairs as well as the situation with Japan, probably contributed to the declaration. Hitler expected the United States would soon declare war on Germany in any event.[13] He disastrously underestimated American military production capacity, the United States' own ability to fight on two fronts, and the time his own Operation Barbarossa would require. Similarly, the Nazis may have hoped the declaration of war, a showing of solidarity with Japan, would result in closer collaboration with the Japanese in Eurasia, particularly against the Soviet Union  something that would not materialize, due to existing relations between Moscow and Tokyo at that time, as well as information submitted in mid-September 1941 by the Soviets' top spy in Japan, Richard Sorge, that the Japanese armed forces were not likely to abrogate any treaties between Japan and the Soviets unless:\\r\\nThe decision to declare war on the United States allowed the United States to enter the European war in support of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union without much public opposition.[15][16][17][18][19]\\r\\nEven as early as mid-March 1941,[20] President Roosevelt was quite acutely aware of Hitler's hostility towards the United States, and the destructive potential it presented, in reference to Hitler's statement of a \\"new order in Europe\\" during the Fhrer's own Berlin Sportpalast speech of January 30, 1941, the eighth anniversary of the Nazis' Machtergreifung:[21]\\r\\n...Nazi forces are not seeking mere modifications in colonial maps or in minor European boundaries. They openly seek the destruction of all elective systems of government on every continent, including our own. They seek to establish systems of government based on the regimentation of all human beings by a handful of individual rulers who seize power by force.\\r\\nYes, these men and their hypnotized followers call this a \\"New Order.\\" It is not new, and it is not order. For order among nations presupposes something enduring, some system of justice under which individuals over a long period of time are willing to live. Humanity will never permanently accept a system imposed by conquest, and based on slavery. These modern tyrants find it necessary to their plans to eliminate all democracies  eliminate them one by one. The nations of Europe, and indeed we, ourselves, did not appreciate that purpose. We do now.[22]\\r\\nAuthor Ian Kershaw records Hitler's initial reaction to the attack, when he was first informed about it on the evening of 7 December at Fhrer Headquarters: \\"We can't lose the war at all. We now have an ally which has never been conquered in 3,000 years\\".[23] Well before the attack, in 1928 Hitler had confided in the text of his then-unpublished Zweites Buch that while the Soviet Union was the most important immediate foe that the Third Reich had to defeat, the United States was the most important long-term challenge to Nazi aims.[24]\\r\\nHitler awarded Imperial Japanese ambassador to Nazi Germany Hiroshi shima the Grand Cross of the Order of the German Eagle in Gold (1st class) after the attack, praising Japan for striking hard and without first declaring war.[25]\\r\\nAs a result of the Japanese attack on the Americans, William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Prime Minister of the Dominion of Canada advised George VI, King of Canada, that a state of war should exist between Canada and Japan.\\r\\nIn the late evening of December 7, 1941, the Canadian Prime Minister, W. L. Mackenzie King, announced the Cabinet's decision to declare war on Japan. The King approved Canada's declaration of war in the following proclamation issued on December 8, 1941.\\r\\nWhereas by and with the advice of our Privy Council for Canada we have signified our approval of the issue of a proclamation in the Canada Gazette declaring that a state of war with Japan exists and has existed in Canada as and from the 7th day of December 1941.\\r\\nNow, therefore, we do hereby declare and proclaim that a state of war with Japan exists and has existed as and from the seventh day of December 1941.\\r\\nOf all which our loving subjects and all others whom these presents may concern are hereby required to take notice and to govern themselves accordingly.[26]\\r\\nCanada remained focused on the European theatre however, and following VE Day was still in the process of transitioning its military force for a campaign in east Asia and the western Pacific when VJ Day arrived.\\r\\nPresident Roosevelt appointed the Roberts Commission, headed by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts, to investigate and report facts and findings with respect to the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the first of many official investigations (nine in all). Both the Fleet commander, Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, and the Army commander, Lieutenant General Walter Short (the Army had been responsible for air defense of Hawaii, including Pearl Harbor, and for general defense of the islands against hostile attack), were relieved of their commands shortly thereafter. They were accused of \\"dereliction of duty\\" by the Roberts Commission for not making reasonable defensive preparations. None of the investigations conducted during the War, nor the Congressional investigation afterward, provided enough reason to reverse those actions. The decisions of the Navy and War Departments to relieve both was controversial at the time and has remained so. However, neither was court-martialed as would normally have been the result of dereliction of duty. On May 25, 1999, the U.S. Senate voted to recommend both officers be exonerated on all charges, citing \\"denial to Hawaii commanders of vital intelligence available in Washington\\".\\r\\nA Joint Congressional Committee was also appointed, on September 14, 1945, to investigate the causes of the attack and subsequent disaster, and was convened on November 15, 1945.[27]\\r\\nThe Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor coupled with their alliance with the Nazis and the ensuing war in the Pacific fueled anti-Japanese sentiment, racism, xenophobia, and anti-Axis sentiment in the Allied nations like never before. Japanese, Japanese-Americans and Asians having a similar physical appearance were regarded with deep seated suspicion, distrust and hostility. The attack was viewed as having been conducted in an extremely underhanded way and also as a very \\"treacherous\\" or \\"sneaky attack\\". Suspicions were further fueled by the Niihau Incident, as historian Gordon Prange stated \\"the rapidity with which the three resident Japanese went over to the pilot's cause\\" which troubled the Hawaiians. \\"The more pessimistic among them cited the Niihau Incident as proof that no one could trust any Japanese, even if an American citizen, not to go over to Japan if it appeared expedient.\\"[28]\\r\\nThe attack, the subsequent declarations of war, and fear of \\"Fifth Columnists\\" resulted in internment of Japanese, German, and Italian populations in the United States and others, for instance the Japanese American internment, German American internment, Italian American internment, and Japanese Canadian internment. The attack resulted in the United States fighting the Germans and Italians among others in Europe and Japan in the Pacific.\\r\\nThe consequences were world-changing. Prime Minister Winston Churchill knew that the survival of the British Empire depended on American aid, and since 1940 had frequently asked Roosevelt to declare war. Churchill aide John Colville stated that the prime minister and American Ambassador John Gilbert Winant, who also supported the British, \\"sort of danced around the room together\\" as the United States would now enter the war, making a British victory likely.[29]:164ÿ165 Churchill later wrote, \\"Being saturated and satiated with emotion and sensation, I went to bed and slept the sleep of the saved and thankful.\\"[30] By opening the Pacific War, which ended in the unconditional surrender of Japan, it broke the power of an Asian check on Soviet expansion. The Allied victory in this war and subsequent U.S. emergence as a dominant world power, eclipsing Britain, have shaped international politics ever since.\\r\\nPearl Harbor is generally regarded as an extraordinary event in American history, remembered as the first time since the War of 1812 that America was attacked in strength on its territory by another country ÿ with only the September 11 attacks almost 60 years later being of a similarly catastrophic scale. It was the first decisive defeat for the United States in World War II. It has become synonymous with \\"surprise attack\\" ever since in American parlance. The U.S. mistakes of intelligence collection, sharing, and analysis leading to the Japanese success at Pearl Harbor did not, in the end, lead to lessons learned.[31]\\r\\nSome Japanese today feel they were compelled to fight because of threats to their national interests and an embargo imposed by the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The most important embargo was on oil on which its Navy and much of the economy was dependent.[32] For example, Japan Times, an English-language newspaper owned by one of the major news organizations in Japan (Asahi Shimbun), ran numerous columns in the early 2000s echoing Kurusu's comments in reference to the Pearl Harbor attack.[33]\\r\\nIn putting the Pearl Harbor attack into context, Japanese writers repeatedly contrast the thousands of U.S. non-combatants killed there with the hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians killed in U.S. air attacks on Japan later in the war, even without mentioning the 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States.\\r\\nHowever, in spite of the perceived inevitability of the war by many Japanese, many also believe the Pearl Harbor attack, although a tactical victory, was actually part of a seriously flawed strategy for engaging in war with the U.S. As one columnist wrote, \\"The Pearl Harbor attack was a brilliant tactic, but part of a strategy based on the belief that a spirit as firm as iron and as beautiful as cherry blossoms could overcome the materially wealthy United States. That strategy was flawed, and Japan's total defeat would follow.\\"[34] In 1991, the Japanese Foreign Ministry released a statement saying Japan had intended to make a formal declaration of war to the United States at 1?p.m. Washington time, 25 minutes before the attack at Pearl Harbor was scheduled to begin. This officially acknowledged something that had been publicly known for years. Diplomatic communications had been coordinated well in advance with the attack, but had failed delivery at the intended time. It appears the Japanese government was referring to the \\"14-part message\\", which did not actually break off negotiations, let alone declare war, but did officially raise the possibility of a break in relations. However, because of various delays, the Japanese ambassador was unable to deliver this message until well after the attack had begun.\\r\\nImperial Japanese military leaders appear to have had mixed feelings about the attack. Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto was unhappy about the botched timing of the breaking off of negotiations. He is on record as having said, in the previous year, \\"I can run wild for six months ... after that, I have no expectation of success.\\"[35] The reports of American reactions, terming it a \\"sneak attack\\" and \\"infamous behavior\\", confirmed that the effect on American morale had been the opposite of intended.[36]\\r\\nThe Prime Minister of Japan during World War II, Hideki Tj later wrote, \\"When reflecting upon it today, that the Pearl Harbor attack should have succeeded in achieving surprise seems a blessing from Heaven.\\"\\r\\nYamamoto had said, regarding the imminent war with the United States, \\"Should hostilities once break out between Japan and the United States, it is not enough that we take Guam and the Philippines, nor even Hawaii and San Francisco. We would have to march into Washington and sign the treaty in the White House. I wonder if our politicians (who speak so lightly of a Japanese-American war) have confidence as to the outcome and are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices?\\"[37]\\r\\nThere are some revisionists in Japan who claim that the Attack on Pearl Harbor was a legitimate attack. These historical perspectives are often claimed by Japanese Shintoist and nationalists and have been criticized from both inside and outside Japan.\\r\\nWhile not specifically directed at revisionism, but more as a likely result of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's controversial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, where some 1,600 war criminals were enshrined after their executions, by February 2015 some concern within the Imperial House of Japan  which normally does not issue such statements  over the issue was voiced by Crown Prince Naruhito.[46] Naruhito stated on his 55th birthday (February 23, 2015) that it was \\"important to look back on the past humbly and correctly\\", in reference to Japan's role in World War II-era war crimes, and that he was concerned about the ongoing need to \\"correctly pass down tragic experiences and the history behind Japan to the generations who have no direct knowledge of the war, at the time memories of the war are about to fade\\".[47]\\r\\nThe attack was notable for its considerable destruction, as putting most of the U.S. battleships out of commission was regardedin both navies and by most military observers worldwideas a tremendous success for Japan. Influenced by the earlier Battle of Taranto, which pioneered the all-aircraft naval attack but resulted in far less damage and casualties, the Japanese struck against Pearl Harbor on a much larger scale than did the British at Taranto.[48]\\r\\nThe attack was a great shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater, and it was initially believed Pearl Harbor changed the balance of power, similar to how Taranto did the Mediterranean, both in the attackers' favor. Three days later, with the sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse off the coast of Malaya, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill exclaimed, \\"In all the war I never received a more direct shock. As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me. There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California. Over this vast expanse of waters Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked.\\"[49]\\r\\nHowever, Pearl Harbor did not have as crippling an effect on American operations as initially thought. Unlike the close confines of the Mediterranean, the vast expanses of the Pacific limited the tactical value of battleships as a fleet in being. Furthermore, unlike new fast battleships such as the Iowa?class, the slow battleships were incapable of operating with carrier task forces, so once repaired they were relegated to delivering pre-invasion bombardments during the island hopping offensive against Japanese-held islands. These Pearl Harbor veterans were later part of a force that defeated IJN battleships at the Battle of Surigao Strait, an engagement very lopsided in the USN's favor in any case.[50][51] A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be between battleships of both sides, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain Alfred Mahan. Seeing the decimation of battleships at the hands of aircraft, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded his battleships for a \\"decisive battle\\" that never happened, only committing a handful to the forefront of the Battles of Midway and Guadalcanal.\\r\\nOne of the main Japanese objectives was to destroy the three American aircraft carriers stationed in the Pacific, but they were not present: Enterprise was returning from Wake, Lexington from Midway, and Saratoga was under refit at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Had Japan sunk the American carriers, the U.S. would have sustained significant damage to the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations for a year or so (given no further diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to place its faith in aircraft carriers and submarinesparticularly the large numbers under construction of the U.S. Navy's Essex-class aircraft carriers, eleven of which had been ordered before the attackthe very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance.\\r\\nDespite the perception of this battle as a devastating blow to America, only three ships were permanently lost to the U.S. Navy. These were the battleships Arizona, Oklahoma, and the old battleship Utah (then used as a target ship); nevertheless, much usable material was salvaged from them, including the two aft main turrets from Arizona. The majority of each battleship's crews survived; there were exceptions as heavy casualties resulted from Arizona's magazine exploding and the Oklahoma capsizing. Four ships sunk during the attack were later raised and returned to duty, including the battleships California, West Virginia and Nevada. California and West Virginia had an effective torpedo-defense system which held up remarkably well, despite the weight of fire they had to endure, resulting in most of their crews being saved. Maryland and Tennessee suffered relatively light damage, as did Pennsylvania, which was in drydock at the time.\\r\\nChester Nimitz said later, \\"It was God's mercy that our fleet was in Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.\\" Nimitz believed if Kimmel had discovered the Japanese approach to Pearl Harbor, he would have sortied to meet them. With the American carriers absent and Kimmel's battleships at a severe disadvantage to the Japanese carriers, the likely result would have been the sinking of the American battleships at sea in deep water, where they would have been lost forever with tremendous casualties (up to twenty thousand dead), instead of in Pearl Harbor, where the crews could easily be rescued, and six battleships ultimately restored to duty.[52] This was also the reaction of Joseph Rochefort, head of HYPO, when he remarked the attack was cheap at the price.\\r\\nMany of the surviving battleships were extensively refitted, including the replacement of their outdated secondary battery of anti-surface 5\\"/51 caliber guns with more useful turreted dual-purpose 5\\"/38 caliber guns, allowing them to better cope with the new tactical reality.[53] Addition of modern radar to the salvaged vessels would give them a marked qualitative advantage over those of the IJN.[50][51]\\r\\nThe repaired U.S. battleships primarily provided fire support for amphibious landings. Their low speed was a liability to their deployment in the vast expanses of the Pacific, for instance they could not accompany the fleet carriers that had become the dominant combatants. Six of the Standard Type vessels participated in the last battleship versus battleship engagement in naval history, the Battle of Surigao Strait, where none of them were hit. During active duty, being well protected by escorts and air cover, none of the Pearl Harbor battleships suffered serious damage save for Pennsylvania which was permanently crippled by a torpedo in the closing stages of the war; on September 2, 1945, West Virginia was among the Allied fleet in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese officially surrendered.\\r\\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor failed to sight, or destroy, any of the Pacific Fleet's three aircraft carriers; they had been designated as primary targets along with the battleships.[54] The carriers Lexington and Enterprise were ferrying additional fighters to American bases on the islands of Wake and Midway while Saratoga was under refit at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.[55] At the time of the Japanese attack, the US was expecting imminent war with Japan, beginning in any of several places, such as the Philippines or Allied bases in Borneo.[56] Nagumo's hesitation, and failure to find and destroy the American carriers, may have been a product of his lack of faith in the attack plan, and of the fact he was a gunnery officer, not an aviator. In addition, Yamamoto's targeting priorities, placing battleships first in importance, reflected an out-of-date Mahanian doctrine, and an inability to extrapolate from history, given the damage German submarines did to British trade in World War I. In the end, Japan achieved surprisingly little for all her daring and apparent success.[57] This all happened at a time when the first thirteen examples, CV-9 through CV-21, of the pivotal Essex-class aircraft carriers had been ordered by the United States Congress and were under construction  not one of the thirteen Essex-class carriers built and commissioned during the war years to serve with the U.S. Navy before August 1945 was sunk by the Axis forces in World War II.\\r\\nCruisers, essential to carrier task forces later in the war, had been considered tertiary targets and only three suffered damage. Of 27 destroyers present, only two were lost: Cassin and Downes were total losses as ships, but their machinery was salvaged and fitted into new hulls, retaining their original names, while Shaw was raised and returned to service.\\r\\nTank farms, containing 140?million U.S. gallons (530?million liters) of bunker oil, were unscathed, providing a ready source of fuel for American fleets at the submarine base. About this missed opportunity, Admiral Chester Nimitz would later say, \\"Had the Japanese destroyed the oil, it would have prolonged the war another two years.\\"[58] These were vital to the initial phase of the war, and to commerce raiding throughout, and illustrate the deficiencies of Japanese planning for the attack. The Navy Yard, critical to ship maintenance, and repair of ships damaged in the attack was untouched. The engineering and initial repair shops, as well as the torpedo store, were intact. Other items of base infrastructure and operation, such as power generation, continued to operate normally. Also critical to the way the Pacific War was actually fought was the cryptanalysis unit, Station HYPO, located in the basement of the old Administration Building. It was undamaged and even benefited by gaining staff from unemployed ship's bands.[59]\\r\\nThe Army Air Force's loss of aircraft must be balanced against the fact that many of them were obsolete, such as the P-40's predecessor, the P-36. Japan might have achieved a good deal more with not much additional effort or loss.[60]\\r\\nCalifornia,West Virginia, Nevada\\r\\nUS ships lost:\\r\\nLexington, Yorktown, Wasp, Hornet\\r\\nUS ships gained:\\r\\nEssex, North Carolina, Washington, South Dakota, Indiana, Massachusetts, Alabama\\r\\nJapanese ships lost:\\r\\nShoho, Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu, Hiei, Kirishima\\r\\nJapanese ships gained: Yamato, Musashi, Junyo, Hiyo.\\r\\nOf the 22 Japanese ships that took part in the attack, only one survived the war. As of 2006, the only U.S. ships in Pearl Harbor during the attack still remaining afloat are the Coast Guard Cutter Taney and the yard tug Hoga. Both remained active over 50 years after the attack and have been designated museum ships.\\r\\nA common view is that the Japanese fell victim to victory disease because of the perceived ease of their first victories. It has also been stated by the Japanese military commanders and politicians who visited and lived in the United States, that their leadership (mostly military personnel) took the war with the United States relatively lightly, compared to them. For instance, Admiral Yamamoto and General Tadamichi Kuribayashi expressed concerns about the greater industrial power of the United States.\\r\\nThe politics of a \\"Europe First\\" strategy, loss of air cover over Pearl Harbor, and subsequent loss of the Philippines, meant the U.S. Army and Army Air Forces[62][unreliable source] were unable to play a significant role in the Pacific War for several months. Japan was temporarily free of worries about the major rival Pacific naval power, which was at least part of the intention for the attack. Because Australian, New Zealand, Dutch and most British forces were already in Europe, Japan conquered nearly all of Southeast Asia, the Southwest Pacific, and extended her reach far into the Indian Ocean, without significant interference. The various Japanese advances were a nearly complete tactical success.\\r\\nIn the long term, the attack on Pearl Harbor was a grand strategic blunder for Japan. Indeed, Admiral Yamamoto, who conceived it, predicted even success here could not win a war with the United States, because American productive capacity was too large. It spurred the United States into a determination to fight to complete victory. The war resulted in the destruction of the Japanese armed forces, the occupation of the home islands (a state never before achieved in Japan's history), and the occupation of Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands by the United States until 1972, while the Soviet Russian re-annexation of the Kurile Islands and Sakhalin Island's southern part, and the restoration of Formosa (Taiwan) to China, and the loss of Korea have not been reversed to this day.","input":"What was the us reaction to pearl harbor?"},{"output":"12 April 1961","context":"Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin (Russian: β?ҳ 쿹?־ ?ҷ[note 1], IPA:?[?j?r??j ?l???ks?ej?v??t? ??ar??n]; 9 March 1934 ÿ 27 March 1968) was a Soviet pilot and cosmonaut. He was the first human to journey into outer space when his Vostok spacecraft completed an orbit of the Earth on 12 April 1961.\\r\\nGagarin became an international celebrity and was awarded many medals and titles, including Hero of the Soviet Union, the nation's highest honour. Vostok 1 marked his only spaceflight, but he served as backup crew to the Soyuz 1 mission (which ended in a fatal crash). Gagarin later became deputy training director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow, which was later named after him. Gagarin died in 1968 when the MiG-15 training jet he was piloting crashed. The Fdration Aronautique Internationale awards the Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal in his honor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYuri Gagarin was born in the village of Klushino, near Gzhatsk (renamed Gagarin in 1968 after his death), on 9 March 1934.[1] His parents worked on a collective farm:[2] Alexey Ivanovich Gagarin as a carpenter and bricklayer, and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina as a milkmaid.[note 2][3] Yuri was the third of four children: older brother Valentin, older sister Zoya, and younger brother Boris.[4]\\r\\nLike millions of people in the Soviet Union, the Gagarin family suffered during Nazi occupation in World War II. Klushino was occupied in November 1941 during the German advance on Moscow, and an officer took over the Gagarin residence. The family was allowed to build a mud hut, approximately 3 by 3 metres (10 by 10?ft) inside, on the land behind their house, where they spent a year and nine months until the end of the occupation.[5] His two older siblings were deported by the Germans to Poland for slave labour in 1943, and did not return until after the war in 1945.[4][6] In 1946, the family moved to Gzhatsk, where Gagarin continued his secondary education.[5]\\r\\nIn 1950, Gagarin entered into an apprenticeship at age 16 as a foundryman at the Lyubertsy Steel Plant near Moscow,[4][6] and also enrolled at a local \\"young workers\\" school for seventh grade evening classes.[7] After graduating in 1951 from both the seventh grade and the vocational school with honours in moldmaking and foundry work,[7] he was selected for further training at the Saratov Industrial Technical School, where he studied tractors.[4][6][8] While in Saratov, Gagarin volunteered for weekend training as a Soviet air cadet at a local flying club, where he learned to fly  at first in a biplane and later in a Yak-18 trainer.[6][8] He also earned extra money as a part-time dock laborer on the Volga River.[5]\\r\\nAfter graduating from the technical school in 1955, the Soviet Army drafted Gagarin.[7] On a recommendation, Gagarin was sent to the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot's School in Orenburg, and soloed in a MiG-15 in 1957.[4][6][7] After graduation, he was assigned to the Luostari airbase in Murmansk Oblast, close to the Norwegian border, where terrible weather made flying risky. He became a Lieutenant in the Soviet Air Forces on 5 November 1957; on 6 November 1959 he received the rank of Senior Lieutenant.[9]\\r\\nIn 1960, after an extensive search and selection process, Gagarin was chosen with 19 other pilots for the Soviet space program. Gagarin was further selected for an elite training group known as the Sochi Six, from which the first cosmonauts of the Vostok programme would be chosen. Gagarin and other prospective candidates were subjected to experiments designed to test physical and psychological endurance; he also underwent training for the upcoming flight. Out of the twenty selected, the eventual choices for the first launch were Gagarin and Gherman Titov due to their performance during training sessions as well as their physical characteristics? space was limited in the small Vostok cockpit, and both men were rather short. Gagarin was 1.57 metres (5?ft 2?in) tall.[2]\\r\\nIn August 1960, when Gagarin was one of 20 possible candidates, a Soviet Air Force doctor evaluated his personality as follows:\\r\\nModest; embarrasses when his humor gets a little too racy; high degree of intellectual development evident in Yuriy; fantastic memory; distinguishes himself from his colleagues by his sharp and far-ranging sense of attention to his surroundings; a well-developed imagination; quick reactions; persevering, prepares himself painstakingly for his activities and training exercises, handles celestial mechanics and mathematical formulae with ease as well as excels in higher mathematics; does not feel constrained when he has to defend his point of view if he considers himself right; appears that he understands life better than a lot of his friends.[10]\\r\\nGagarin was also a favoured candidate by his peers. When the 20 candidates were asked to anonymously vote for which other candidate they would like to see as the first to fly, all but three chose Gagarin.[11] One of these candidates, Yevgeny Khrunov, believed that Gagarin was very focused, and was demanding of himself and others when necessary.[12]\\r\\nGagarin kept physically fit throughout his life, and was a keen sportsman. Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky wrote:\\r\\nService in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know that Yuri Gagarin was fond of ice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper... I don't think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.[13]\\r\\nIn addition to being a keen ice hockey player, Gagarin was also a basketball fan, and coached the Saratov Industrial Technical School team, as well as being a referee.[14]\\r\\nOn 12 April 1961, the Vostok 3KA-3 (Vostok 1) spacecraft with Gagarin aboard was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. Gagarin thus became both the first human to travel into space, and the first to orbit the Earth. His call sign was Kedr (Russian: 椿, Siberian pine or Cedar).[15]\\r\\nThe radio communication between the launch control room and Gagarin included the following dialogue at the moment of rocket launch:\\r\\nKorolev: \\"Preliminary stage..... intermediate..... main..... lift off! We wish you a good flight. Everything is all right.\\"\\r\\nGagarin: \\"楾!\\" (Poyekhali!Let's go!).[16]\\r\\nGagarin's informal poyekhali! became a historical phrase in the Eastern Bloc, used to refer to the beginning of the Space Age in human history.[17][18]\\r\\nIn his post-flight report, Gagarin recalled his experience of spaceflight, having been the first human in space:\\r\\nThe feeling of weightlessness was somewhat unfamiliar compared with Earth conditions. Here, you feel as if you were hanging in a horizontal position in straps. You feel as if you are suspended.[19]\\r\\nFollowing the flight, Gagarin told the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that during reentry he had whistled the tune \\"The Motherland Hears, The Motherland Knows\\" (Russian: \\"˾ҷ ְ, ˾ҷ \\").[20][21] The first two lines of the song are: \\"The Motherland hears, the Motherland knows/Where her son flies in the sky\\".[22] This patriotic song was written by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1951 (opus 86), with words by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky.\\r\\nSome sources have claimed that Gagarin commented during the flight, \\"I don't see any God up here.\\" However, no such words appear in the verbatim record of his conversations with Earth-based stations during the spaceflight.[23] In a 2006 interview, Gagarin's friend Colonel Valentin Petrov stated that the cosmonaut never said such words, and that the quote originated from Nikita Khrushchev's speech at the plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU about the state's anti-religion campaign, saying \\"Gagarin flew into space, but didn't see any god there.\\"[24] Petrov also said that Gagarin had been baptised into the Orthodox Church as a child, and a 2011 Foma magazine article quoted the rector of the Orthodox church in Star City saying, \\"Gagarin baptized his elder daughter Yelena shortly before his space flight; and his family used to celebrate Christmas and Easter and keep icons in the house.\\"[25]\\r\\nGagarin's flight was a triumph for the Soviet space program. The announcement on the Soviet radio was made by Yuri Levitan, the same speaker who announced all major events in the Great Patriotic War. Gagarin became a national hero of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, and a worldwide celebrity. Newspapers around the globe published his biography and details of his flight. Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations, the scale of which was second only to World War II Victory Parades. Gagarin was escorted in a long motorcade of high-ranking officials through the streets of Moscow to the Kremlin where, in a lavish ceremony, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, by Nikita Khrushchev.[26]\\r\\nLater on, Gagarin toured widely abroad. He visited Italy, Germany, Canada, Brazil, Japan, Egypt[27] and Finland to promote the Soviet Union's accomplishment of putting the first human in space. He visited the United Kingdom three months after the Vostok 1 mission, going to London and Manchester.[28][29]\\r\\nThe sudden rise to fame took its toll on Gagarin. While acquaintances say Gagarin had been a \\"sensible drinker\\", his touring schedule placed him in social situations where he was always expected to drink. Gagarin was also reportedly caught by his wife in a room with another woman, a nurse named Anna who had aided him after a boating incident earlier in the day, at a Black Sea resort in September 1961. He attempted to escape by leaving through a window and jumping off her second floor balcony, hitting his face on a kerbstone and leaving a permanent scar above his left eyebrow.[4][8]\\r\\nIn 1962, he began serving as a Deputy to the Soviet of the Union,[30] and was elected to the Central Committee of the Young Communist League. He later returned to Star City, the cosmonaut facility, where he spent several years working on designs for a reusable spacecraft. He became a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Forces on 12 June 1962, and received the rank of colonel on 6 November 1963.[9] Soviet officials tried to keep him away from any flights, being worried of losing their hero in an accident. Gagarin was backup pilot for his friend Vladimir Komarov in the Soyuz 1 flight, which was launched despite Gagarin's protests that additional safety precautions were necessary.[31] When Komarov's flight ended in a fatal crash, Gagarin was permanently banned from training for and participating in further spaceflights.\\r\\nOn 20 December 1963, Gagarin had become Deputy Training Director of the Star City cosmonaut training base.[32] Two years later he was re-elected as a deputy to the SSSU, but this time to the Soviet of Nationalities.[30] Next year he began to re-qualify as a fighter pilot.[33] On 17 February 1968 he successfully defended his aerospace engineering thesis on the subject of spaceplane aerodynamic configuration, passing with flying colors.[34][35]\\r\\nOn 27 March 1968, while on a routine training flight from Chkalovsky Air Base, he and flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin died in a MiG-15UTI crash near the town of Kirzhach. The bodies of Gagarin and Seryogin were cremated and the ashes were buried in the walls of the Kremlin on Red Square.\\r\\nGagarin is survived by his wife Valentina, and daughters Yelena and Galina.\\r\\nThe cause of the crash that killed Gagarin is not entirely certain, and has been subject to speculation about conspiracy theories over the ensuing decades.\\r\\nSoviet documents declassified in March 2003 showed that the KGB had conducted their own investigation of the accident, in addition to one government and two military investigations. The KGB's report dismissed various conspiracy theories, instead indicating that the actions of airbase personnel contributed to the crash. The report states that an air traffic controller provided Gagarin with outdated weather information, and that by the time of his flight, conditions had deteriorated significantly. Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin's planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation concluded that Gagarin's aircraft entered a spin, either due to a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not react properly to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin.[36]\\r\\nAnother theory, advanced by the original crash investigator in 2005, hypothesizes that a cabin air vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to oxygen deprivation and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft.[37] A similar theory, published in Air & Space magazine, is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude. This dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash.[38]\\r\\nOn 12 April 2007, the Kremlin vetoed a new investigation into the death of Gagarin. Government officials said that they saw no reason to begin a new investigation.[39]\\r\\nIn April 2011, documents from a 1968 commission set up by the Central Committee of the Communist Party to investigate the accident were declassified. Those documents revealed that the commission's original conclusion was that Gagarin or Seryogin had maneuvered sharply either to avoid a weather balloon, leading the jet into a \\"super-critical flight regime and to its stalling in complex meteorological conditions,\\" or to avoid \\"entry into the upper limit of the first layer of cloud cover\\".[40]\\r\\nIn his 2004 book Two Sides of the Moon, Alexey Leonov, who was part of a State Commission established to investigate the death in 1968, recounts that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard \\"two loud booms in the distance.\\" Corroborating other theories, his conclusion is that a Sukhoi jet (which he identifies as a Su-15 'Flagon') was flying below its minimum allowed altitude, and \\"without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions, he passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregin's plane while breaking the sound barrier.\\" The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin. Leonov believes the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin's plane crashing.[41] In a June 2013 interview with Russian television network RT, Leonov said that a declassified report on the incident revealed the presence of a second, \\"unauthorized\\" Su-15 flying in the area. Leonov states that this aircraft had descended to 450 metres (1,480?ft) and that, while running afterburners, \\"the aircraft reduced its echelon at a distance of 10ÿ15 meters in the clouds, passing close to Gagarin, turning his plane and thus sending it into a tailspin ÿ a deep spiral, to be precise ÿ at a speed of 750 kilometers per hour.\\" As a condition of being allowed to discuss the report, however, Leonov was required to not disclose the name of the other pilot, who was reported to be 80 years old (as of 2013) and in poor health.[42][43]\\r\\nIn 1957, while at the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot's School in Orenburg, Gagarin met Valentina Ivanovna Goryacheva,[3] a medical technician graduate of the Orenburg Medical School.[6][8] They were married on 7 November 1957, the same day Gagarin graduated from Orenburg, and they have two daughters.[3][6]\\r\\nYelena Yurievna Gagarina is an art historian who has worked as the Director-General of the Moscow Kremlin Museums since 2001.[44][45]\\r\\nGalina Yurievna Gagarina is a professor of economics and the department chair at Plekhanov Russian University of Economics in Moscow.[44][46]\\r\\nAside from his short stature at 1.57 metres (5?ft 2?in), one of Gagarin's most notable traits was his smile.[47] Many commented on how Gagarin's smile gained the attention of crowds on the frequent tours he did in the months after the Vostok 1 mission success.[29]\\r\\nGagarin also garnered a reputation as an adept public figure. When he visited Manchester in the United Kingdom, it was pouring rain. However, Gagarin insisted that the convertible top remain down so that the cheering crowds could catch a glimpse of him. Gagarin stated, \\"If all these people have turned out to welcome me and can stand in the rain, so can I.\\" Gagarin refused an umbrella and remained standing in his open-top Bentley so that the cheering crowds could still see him.[29]\\r\\nSergei Korolev, one of the masterminds behind the early years of the Soviet space program, later said that Gagarin possessed a smile \\"that lit up the Cold War\\".[48]\\r\\n12 April, the date of Gagarin's space flight, has been commemorated as a special date. Since 1962, it has been celebrated in the USSR and later in Russia and other post-Soviet states as the Cosmonautics Day. In 2011 it was declared the International Day of Human Space Flight by the United Nations.[49]\\r\\nSince 2001, Yuri's Night, an international celebration, is held every 12 April to commemorate milestones in space exploration.\\r\\nA number of buildings and other sites on Earth have been named for Gagarin. The Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City was named in 1969. The launch pad at Baikonur Cosmodrome from which Sputnik 1 and Vostok 1 were launched, is now known as Gagarin's Start. Gagarin Raion in the Sevastopol city (Ukraine) was named after him during the period of the Soviet Union. The Air Force Academy was renamed Gagarin Air Force Academy in 1968.\\r\\nGagarin has been honored on the Moon by both astronauts and astronomers. He was honored by the American space program during Apollo 11 in 1969 when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left a memorial satchel containing medals commemorating Gagarin and fellow cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov on the surface.[50][51] In 1971, Apollo 15 astronauts David Scott and James Irwin left the Fallen Astronaut at their landing site as a memorial to all the American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts who died in the Space Race, with Yuri Gagarin listed among 14 others.[52][53] He is memorialized by the official naming of a 265?km crater on the Far Side after him.\\r\\nSeveral statues have been erected in his honor.\\r\\nOn 4 June 1980, a monument to Gagarin was opened on Gagarin Square in Leninsky Avenue, Moscow. The monument is 42.4 m tall and constructed of titanium. Beside the column is a replica of the descent module used by Gagarin.\\r\\nIn 2011 a statue, Yuri Gagarin, was unveiled at the Admiralty Arch end of The Mall in London, opposite the permanent sculpture of James Cook. It is a copy of the statue outside Gagarin's former school in Lyubertsy.[54] In 2013 the statue was moved to a permanent location outside the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.[55]\\r\\nIn 2012, a statue was unveiled at the site of NASA's original spaceflight headquarters on South Wayside Drive in Houston. The sculpture, completed in 2011 by artist/cosmonaut Alexsei Leonov, was a gift to Houston by various Russian organisations. Houston Mayor Annise Parker, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were present for the dedication.[56]\\r\\nGagarin is memorialized in music, including a cycle of Soviet patriotic songs The Constellation Gagarin (Russian: Ѿ־^ ҷ, tr. Sozvezdie Gagarina) was written by Alexandra Pakhmutova and Nikolai Dobronravov in 1970ÿ1971.[57] The most famous of these songs referred to Gagarin's poyekhali!: He said \\"let's go!\\" He waved his hand.[17][57] He was the inspiration for the pieces \\"Hey Gagarin\\" by Jean Michel Jarre (on Mtamorphoses), \\"Gagarin\\" by Public Service Broadcasting, and \\"Gagarin, I loved you\\" by Undervud.\\r\\nVessels have been named for him. Soviet tracking ship Kosmonavt Yuri Gagarin was built in 1971. Armenian airline Armavia named their first Sukhoi Superjet 100 in Gagarin's honour in 2011.[58]\\r\\nThere were two commemorative coins issued in the Soviet Union to honour the 20th and 30th anniversaries of his flight: 1 ruble coin (1981, copper-nickel) and 3 ruble coin (1991, silver). In 2001, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Gagarin's flight, a series of four coins bearing his likeness was issued in Russia: 2 ruble coin (copper-nickel), 3 ruble coin (silver), 10 ruble coin (brass-copper, nickel), and 100 ruble coin (silver).[59] In 2011, Russia issued a 1,000 ruble coin (gold) and 3 ruble coin (silver) to mark the 50th anniversary of his flight.[60]\\r\\nIn 2008, the Kontinental Hockey League named their championship trophy the Gagarin Cup.[61] In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Gagarin was ranked as the #6 most popular space hero, tied with Star Trek's fictional Capt. James T. Kirk.[62] The Russian docudrama, Gagarin: First in Space, was released in 2013.\\r\\nThe 50th anniversary of Gagarin's journey into space was marked in 2011 by tributes around the world. A film titled First Orbit was shot from the International Space Station, combining the original flight audio with footage of the route taken by Gagarin.[63] The Russian, American, and Italian Expedition 27 crew aboard the ISS sent a special video message to wish the people of the world a \\"Happy Yuri's Night\\", wearing shirts with an image of Gagarin.[64]\\r\\nSwiss-based German watchmaker Bernhard Lederer created a limited edition of 50 Gagarin Tourbillons to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight.[65]\\r\\nThe launch of Soyuz TMA-21 on 4 April 2011 was devoted to the 50th anniversary of the first manned space mission.[66]\\r\\nand others.\\r\\nYuri Gagarin was elected an honorary citizen of the following cities:\\r\\nHe was also awarded the golden keys to the gates of the Egyptian cities Cairo and Alexandria.","input":"When was the first person sent to space?"},{"output":"making false statements that were critical of the federal government","context":"The Alien and Sedition Acts were four bills passed by the Federalist-dominated 5th United States Congress and signed into law by President John Adams in 1798.[1] They made it harder for an immigrant to become a citizen (Naturalization Act), allowed the president to imprison and deport non-citizens who were deemed dangerous (Alien Friends Act of 1798)[2] or who were from a hostile nation (Alien Enemy Act of 1798),[3] and criminalized making false statements that were critical of the federal government (Sedition Act of 1798).[4]\\r\\nThe Federalists argued that the bills strengthened national security during an undeclared naval war with France. Critics argued that they were primarily an attempt to suppress voters who disagreed with the Federalist party, and violated the right of freedom of speech in the First Amendment.[5] Three of the acts were repealed after the Democratic-Republican party of Thomas Jefferson came to power. But the Alien Enemies Act remained in effect, was revised and codified in 1918 for use in World War I, and was used by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to imprison Japanese, German, and Italian aliens during World War II. Following cessation of hostilities, the act was used by President Harry S. Truman to continue to imprison, then deport, aliens of the formerly hostile nations. In 1948 the Supreme Court determined that presidential powers under the acts continued after cessation of hostilities until there was a peace treaty with the hostile nation. The revised Alien Enemies Act remains in effect today.[when?]\\r\\nThe Naturalization Act increased the residency requirement for American citizenship from five to fourteen years. At the time, the majority of immigrants supported Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans, the political opponents of the Federalists.[1] The Alien Friends Act allowed the president to imprison or deport aliens considered \\"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States\\" at any time, while the Alien Enemies Act authorized the president to do the same to any male citizen of a hostile nation above the age of fourteen during times of war. Lastly, the controversial Sedition Act restricted speech that was critical of the federal government. Under the Sedition Act, the Federalists allowed people who were accused of violating the sedition laws to use truth as a defense.[6] The Sedition Act resulted in the prosecution and conviction of many Jeffersonian newspaper owners who disagreed with the government.[6]\\r\\nThe acts were denounced by Democratic-Republicans and ultimately helped them to victory in the 1800 election, when Thomas Jefferson defeated the incumbent, President Adams. The Sedition Act and the Alien Friends Act were allowed to expire in 1800 and 1801, respectively. The Alien Enemies Act, however, remains in effect as Chapter 3; Sections 21ÿ24 of Title 50 of the United States Code.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOpposition to the Federalists, spurred by Democratic-Republicans, reached new heights with the Democratic-Republicans' support of France, which was still in the midst of the French Revolution. Some appeared to desire in the United States an event similar to the French Revolution, in order to overthrow the government.[8] When Democratic-Republicans in some states refused to enforce federal laws such as the 1791 whiskey tax, the first tax levied by the national government, and threatened to rebel, Federalists warned that they would send in the army to force them to capitulate.[9] As the unrest sweeping Europe spread to the United States, calls for secession reached unparalleled heights, and the fledgling nation seemed ready to tear itself apart.[9] Some of this agitation was seen by Federalists as having been caused by French and French-sympathizing immigrants.[9] The Alien Act and the Sedition Act were meant to guard against this perceived threat of anarchy.\\r\\nThey were a major political issue in the elections of 1798 and 1800, controversial then, and remaining so today. Opposition to them resulted in the highly controversial Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, authored by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. Prominent prosecutions under the Sedition Act include:\\r\\nThe Democratic-Republicans made the Alien and Sedition Acts an important issue in the 1800 election campaign. Upon assuming the Presidency, Thomas Jefferson pardoned those still serving sentences under the Sedition Act,[10]:231 and Congress soon repaid their fines.[19] It has been said that the Alien Acts were aimed at Albert Gallatin, and the Sedition Act aimed at Benjamin Bache's Aurora.[20] While government authorities prepared lists of aliens for deportation, many aliens fled the country during the debate over the Alien and Sedition Acts, and Adams never signed a deportation order.[10]:187ÿ93\\r\\nThe Alien and Sedition Acts were never appealed to the Supreme Court, whose right of judicial review was not clearly established until Marbury v. Madison in 1803. Subsequent mentions in Supreme Court opinions beginning in the mid-20th century have assumed that the Sedition Act would today be found unconstitutional.[21][22]\\r\\nThomas Jefferson and James Madison also secretly drafted the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions denouncing the federal legislation, though many other state legislatures strongly opposed these resolutions.[23][24][25] Though the resolutions followed Madison's \\"interposition\\" approach, Jefferson advocated nullification and at one point drafted a threat for Kentucky to secede.[26] Jefferson's biographer Dumas Malone argued that this might have gotten Jefferson impeached for treason, had his actions become known at the time.[27] In writing the Kentucky Resolutions, Jefferson warned that, \\"unless arrested at the threshold,\\" the Alien and Sedition Acts would \\"necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood.\\" Historian Ron Chernow says of this \\"he wasn't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: he was calling for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government of which he was vice president.\\" Jefferson \\"thus set forth a radical doctrine of states' rights that effectively undermined the constitution.\\"[27] Chernow argues that neither Jefferson nor Madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the Alien and Sedition Acts themselves.[27] Historian Garry Wills argued, \\"Their nullification effort, if others had picked it up, would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided [alien and sedition] laws, which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure\\"[28] The theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions was \\"deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion\\".[27] George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if \\"systematically and pertinaciously pursued\\", they would \\"dissolve the union or produce coercion\\".[27] The influence of Jefferson's doctrine of states' rights reverberated right up to the Civil War and beyond.[9] At the close of the Civil War, future president James Garfield said that Jefferson's Kentucky Resolution \\"contained the germ of nullification and secession, and we are today reaping the fruits\\".[9]\\r\\nThe Alien Enemies Acts remained in effect at the outset of World War I.[29] It was recodified to be part of the US war and national defense statutes (50 USC 21ÿ24).[29]\\r\\nOn December 7, 1941, responding to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt used the authority of the revised Alien Enemies Act to issue presidential proclamations 2525 (Alien Enemies ÿ Japanese), 2526 (Alien Enemies ÿ German), and 2527 (Alien Enemies ÿ Italian), to apprehend, restrain, secure and remove Japanese, German, and Italian non-citizens.[29] On February 19, 1942, citing authority of the wartime powers of the president and commander in chief, Roosevelt made Executive Order 9066, authorizing the Secretary of War to prescribe military areas and giving him authority that superseded the authority of other executives under Proclamations 2525-7. EO 9066 led to the internment of Japanese Americans, whereby over 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry living on the Pacific coast were forcibly relocated and forced to live in camps in the interior of the country, 62% of whom were United States citizens, not aliens.[30][31]\\r\\nHostilities with Germany and Italy ended in May 1945, and with Japan in August. Alien enemies, and U.S. citizens, continued to be interned. On July 14, 1945, President Harry S. Truman issued Presidential Proclamation 2655, titled Removal of Alien Enemies. The proclamation gave the Attorney General authority regarding aliens enemies within the continental United States, to decide whether they are \\"dangerous to the public peace and safety of the United States\\", to order them removed, and to create regulations governing their removal. The proclamation cited the revised Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. 21ÿ24) as to powers of the President to make public proclamation regarding \\"subjects of the hostile nation\\" more than fourteen years old and living inside the United States but not naturalized, to remove them as alien enemies, and to determine the means of removal.\\r\\nOn September 8, 1945, Truman issued Presidential Proclamation 2662, titled \\"Removal of Alien Enemies\\". The revised Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. 21ÿ24) was cited as to removal of alien enemies in the interest of the public safety. The United States had agreed, at a conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1942, to assume responsibility for the restraint and repatriation of dangerous alien enemies to be sent to the United States from Latin American republics. In another inter-American conference in Mexico City on March 8, 1945, North and South American governments resolved to recommended adoption of measures to prevent aliens of hostile nations who were deemed to be security threats or threats to welfare from remaining in North or South America. Truman gave authority to the Secretary of State to determine if alien enemies in the United States who were sent to the United States from Latin America, or who were in the United States illegally, endangered the welfare or security of the country. The Secretary of State was given power to remove them \\"to destinations outside the limits of the Western Hemisphere\\", to the former enemy territory of the governments to whose \\"principles of which (the alien enemies) have adhered\\". The Department of Justice was directed to assist the Secretary of State in their prompt removal.\\r\\nOn April 10, 1946, Truman issued Presidential Proclamation 2685, titled Removal of Alien Enemies, citing the revised Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. 21ÿ24) as to its provision for the removal from the United States of alien enemies in the interest of the public safety. Truman proclaimed regulations that were in addition to and supplemented other \\"regulations affecting the restraint and removal of alien enemies\\". As to alien enemies who had been brought into the continental United States from Latin America after December 1941, the proclamation gave the Secretary of State authority to decide if their presence was \\"prejudicial to the future security or welfare of the Americas\\", and to make regulations for their removal. 30 days was set as the reasonable time for them to \\"effect the recovery, disposal, and removal of (their) goods and effects, and for (their) departure.\\"\\r\\nIn 1947 New York's Ellis Island continued to incarcerate hundreds of ethnic Germans. Fort Lincoln was a large internment camp still holding internees in North Dakota. North Dakota was represented by controversial Senator William \\"Wild Bill\\" Langer. Langer introduced a bill (S. 1749) \\"for the relief of all persons detained as enemy aliens\\", and directing the US Attorney General to cancel \\"outstanding warrants of arrest, removal, or deportation\\" for many German aliens still interned, listing many by name, and all of those detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which was under the Department of Justice (DOJ). It directed the INS not to issue any more warrants or orders, if their only basis was the original warrants of arrest. The bill never passed. The Attorney General gave up plenary jurisdiction over the last internee on Ellis Island late in 1948.\\r\\nIn Ludecke v. Watkins (1948), the Supreme Court interpreted the time of release under the Alien Enemies Act. German alien Kurt G. W. Ludecke was detained in 1941, under Proclamation 2526. and continued to be held after cessation of hostilities. In 1947, Ludecke petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to order his release, after the Attorney General ordered him deported. The court ruled 5ÿ4 to release Ludecke, but also found that the Alien Enemies Act allowed for detainment beyond the time hostilities ceased, until an actual treaty was signed with the hostile nation or government.\\r\\nIn 1988, President Reagan and the 100th Congress introduced the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, whose purpose amongst others was to acknowledge and apologize for actions of the US against individuals of Japanese ancestry during World War II.[32] The statement from Congress agreed with the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, that \\"a grave injustice was done to both citizens and permanent resident aliens of Japanese... without adequate security reasons and without any acts of espionage or sabotage documented by the Commission, and were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.\\"\\r\\nIn 2015, presidential candidate Donald Trump made a proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States (as part of the War on Terror); Roosevelt's application of the Alien Enemies Act was cited as a possible justification. The proposal created international controversy, drawing criticism from foreign heads of state that have historically remained uninvolved in United States presidential elections.[33][34][35][36] A former Reagan Administration aide noted that, despite criticism of Trump's proposal to invoke the law, \\"the Alien Enemies Act... is still on the books... (and people) in Congress for many decades (havent) repealed the law... (nor has) Barack Obama\\".[37] Other critics claimed that the proposal violated founding principles, and was unconstitutional for singling out a religion, and not a hostile nation. They included the Pentagon and others, who argued that the proposal (and its citation of the Alien Enemies proclamations as authority) played into the ISIL narrative that the United States was at war with the entire Muslim religion (not just with ISIL and other terrorist entities).[38]","input":"The sedition act of july 1798 criminalized what?"},{"output":"7 October 1949","context":"","input":"When was the federal republic of germany founded?"},{"output":"American porn actor John Holmes","context":"The Dirk Diggler Story is a 1988 mockumentary short film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. It follows the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler, a well-endowed male porn star. The character was modeled on American porn actor John Holmes. The film was later expanded into Anderson's successful 1997 breakout film Boogie Nights.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDirk Diggler (Michael Stein) was born as Steven Samuel Adams on April 15, 1961 outside of Saint Paul, Minnesota. His parents are a construction worker and a boutique shop owner who attend church every Sunday and believe in God. Looking for a career as a male model, Diggler drops out of school at age 16 and leaves home. Jack Horner (Robert Ridgely) discovers Diggler at a falafel stand. Diggler meets his friend, Reed Rothchild (Eddie Delcore), through Horner in 1979, while working on a film.\\r\\nHorner slowly introduces Diggler to the business until Diggler becomes noticeable within the industry. Diggler becomes a prominent model and begins appearing in pornographic films. Diggler has critical and box office hits which lead him to stardom. The hits and publicity lead to fame and money, which lead Diggler to the world of drugs. With the amount of money Diggler is making, he is able to support both his and Rothchild's addictions. The drugs eventually cause a breakup between Diggler and Horner since Diggler is having issues with his performance on set.\\r\\nAfter the breakup, Diggler tries to make a film himself, but it is never completed. He then attempts a music career, which is successful, but leads him deeper into drugs because of the amount of money he is making. He then stars in a TV show which is a failure, both critically and commercially. Having failed and with no work, Diggler returns to the porn industry, taking roles in low-budget homosexual films to help support his habit. On July 17, 1981, during a film shoot, Diggler dies of a drug overdose.\\r\\nThe film ends with a quotation from Diggler: \\"All I ever wanted was a cool '78 'Vette and a house in the country.\\"\\r\\nThe film was Anderson's first real production having experimented with what he called \\"standard fare\\".[1][2] Anderson conceived the film when he was 17 years old[3][4] and a senior at Montclair College Preparatory School.[1] Anderson called his friend Michael Stein, telling him to come over for a production meeting, and told Stein his idea: \\"John Holmes\\".[5] Stein loved the idea and was cast to play the role of Dirk Diggler; he selected his own wardrobe.[5] Stein showed Anderson some video of his friend Eddie Dalcour, who was a professional body builder, which Anderson loved and cast him in the role of Reed Rothchild.[5] Anderson's father, Ernie Anderson, narrated the film and Robert Ridgely, a friend of Anderson's father, played the role of Jack Horner.[5]\\r\\nThe film was shot in 1987[3] using a video camera and steadicam provided by Anderson's father (Ernie \\"Ghoulardi\\" Anderson).[5] Some scenes were shot at a motel.[1] Anderson raised money for the film by cleaning cages in a pet store.[1] Being influenced by This is Spinal Tap at the time, he decided to do a mockumentary[6] and used the John Holmes documentary, Exhausted, as a model for the film, even taking some dialogue almost word-for-word.[5] Anderson worked from a shot list and wanted the actors to be serious since the characters took their work seriously.[5] Anderson edited the film using two VCRs.[7] According to Anderson, the film drew admiring laughs when it was shown at a University of Southern California film festival.[2]\\r\\nThe Dirk Diggler Story was expanded into Anderson's 1997 breakout film Boogie Nights[3][8][9][10] with a number of scenes appearing almost verbatim in both films.[5] Two actors had roles in both films; in Boogie Nights, Robert Ridgely played The Colonel, a pornography financier, and Michael Stein had a cameo appearance as a stereo store customer.[9] The main differences between The Dirk Diggler Story and Boogie Nights are the mockumentary versus narratives styles in the former and latter films, respectively;[6] Diggler's stint in gay porn in the first film versus his prostitution in the second;[5] and Diggler's dying from an overdose in the first film versus his happy return to his former roles and lifestyle in the second.[7]","input":"Who is the character dirk diggler based on?"},{"output":"the mountains of Ifugao in the Philippines","context":"The Banaue Rice Terraces (Filipino: Hagdan-hagdang Palayan ng Banawe) are 2,000-year-old terraces that were carved into the mountains of Ifugao in the Philippines by ancestors of the indigenous people. They are frequently called the \\"Eighth Wonder of the World\\".[1][2][3] It is commonly thought that the terraces were built with minimal equipment, largely by hand. The terraces are located approximately 1500 metres (5000?ft) above sea level. They are fed by an ancient irrigation system from the rainforests above the terraces. It is said that if the steps were put end to end, it would encircle half the globe.[4]\\r\\nLocals to this day still plant rice and vegetables on the terraces, although more and more younger Ifugaos do not find farming appealing, often opting for the more lucrative hospitality industry generated by the terraces[citation needed].[5] The result is the gradual erosion of the characteristic \\"steps\\", which need constant reconstruction and care. In 2010, a further problem was drought, with the terraces drying up completely in March of that year.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe terraces are found in the province of Ifugao and the Ifugao people have been its caretakers. Ifugao culture revolves[7] around rice, and the culture engenders an elaborate array of celebrations linked with agricultural rites from rice cultivation to rice consumption. The harvest season generally calls for thanksgiving feasts, while the concluding harvest rites called tango or tungul (a day of rest) entail a strict taboo on any agricultural work. Partaking of the bayah (rice beer), rice cakes, and betel nut constitutes an indelible practice during the festivities.\\r\\nThe Ifugao people practice traditional farming spending most of their labour at their terraces and forest lands while occasionally tending to root crop cultivation. The Ifugaos have also been known to culture edible shells, fruit trees, and other vegetables which have been exhibited among Ifugaos for generations. The building of the rice terraces entails constructing retaining walls with stones and rammed earth which are designed to draw water from a main irrigation canal above the terrace clusters. Indigenous rice terracing technologies have been identified with the Ifugaos rice terraces such as their knowledge of water irrigation, stonework, earthwork and terrace maintenance. As their source of life and art, the rice terraces have sustained and shaped the lives of the community members. Ifugao previously belong to the Mountain Province as a municipality but on June 18, 1966 in effect of Republic Act No. 4695, Ifugao became an independent province.\\r\\nIn March 2009 the Ifugao rice terraces were declared[8] free from genetically modified organisms (GMO). An event was organized in Dianara Viewpoint for this announcement where it was graced by Gov. Teodoro Baguilat, Mayor Lino Madchiw, Greenpeace campaigner for Southeast Asia Daniel Ocampo, and Cathy Untalan who was executive director of the Miss Earth Foundation. Before the announcement ceremonies, three mumbaki (traditional priests) performed an Alim, a ritual to ask for blessings where an animal is offered to the gods.\\r\\nAnother thriving economy in the Banaue Rice Terraces is tourism.[9] The Tourism industry has developed a number of activities for visitors which may include the traditional sight seeing of the terraces and visits to the tribes at the foot of the terraces. A Mumbaki[10] (traditional Ifugao witch doctor) is also recommended[11] to visitors, these doctors can perform spiritual healing rituals.[12] Domestic tourism however has gone down[13] over the past few years. A contributing factor to this is the treatment of domestic tourists by the local guides in the area where it has been reported that local guides are more willing to entertain foreign visitors.[citation needed] The Batad Environmental Tour Guides Association (BETGA) in association with the Batad Baranguay authorities are currently laying a concrete track down from the Batad Saddle to the village proper.\\r\\nThe park is featured on the reverse side of the 1985 series of the Philippine one thousand peso bill as well as the reverse side of the 2010 series of the Philippine twenty peso bill.\\r\\nThe Banaue Rice Terraces refer to the cluster close to the Banaue poblacion as seen from the viewpoint. Contrary to popular belief perpetrated by its inclusion on the twenty peso banknote, the Banaue Rice Terraces are not a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They were not included in the UNESCO inscription Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras due to the presence of numerous modern structures, making it score low in the integrity criterion of UNESCO.[14]\\r\\nThe five clusters inscribed as part of the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are Batad, Bangaan, Hungduan, Mayoyao Central and Nagacadan.[15] Batad and Bangaan are under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Banaue but are not called the Banaue Rice Terraces.\\r\\nThe Banaue Rice Terraces were declared by the Philippine government as a National Cultural Treasure under Ifugao Rice Terraces by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 260 in 1973.[16]\\r\\nAside from the Banaue Rice terraces there are 4 other similar terraces,[17][18] Soil type here in this mountainous province are that ones like what they used to fabricate clay pot or a clay jar, (also used in the construction by burning or cooking the clay), the Batad Rice Terraces, Mayoyao Rice Terraces in Mayoyao, Hapao Rice Terraces and Kiangan Rice Terraces.

Later periods were defined by trends in exterior styling, size, and utility preferences.\\r\\nIn 1769 the first steam-powered automobile capable of human transportation was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot.[1]\\r\\nIn 1808, Fran?ois Isaac de Rivaz designed the first car powered by an internal combustion engine fueled by hydrogen.\\r\\nIn 1870 Siegfried Marcus built the first gasoline powered combustion engine, which he placed on a pushcart, building four progressively sophisticated combustion-engine cars over a 10-to-15-year span that influenced later cars. Marcus created the two-cycle combustion engine[citation needed]. The car's second incarnation in 1880 introduced a four-cycle, gasoline-powered engine, an ingenious carburetor design and magneto ignition. He created an additional two models further refining his design with steering, a clutch and brakes.\\r\\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that still constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion was patented by Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch?nbein in 1838. The battery electric car owes its beginnings to nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant, who invented the leadÿacid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1885, Karl Benz developed a petrol or gasoline powered automobile.[2] This is also considered to be the first \\"production\\" vehicle as Benz made several other identical copies. The automobile was powered by a single[citation needed] cylinder four-stroke engine.\\r\\nIn 1913, the Ford Model T, created by the Ford Motor Company five years prior, became the first automobile to be mass-produced on a moving assembly line. By 1927, Ford had produced over 15,000,000 Model T automobiles.\\r\\nAt the turn of the 20th century electrically powered automobiles were a popular method of automobile propulsion[citation needed], but their common use did not last long, and they diminished to a niche market until the turn of the 21st century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early history of the automobile was concentrated on the search for a reliable portable power unit to propel the vehicle.\\r\\nFerdinand Verbiest, a member of a Jesuit mission in China, built a steam-powered vehicle around 1672 as a toy for the Chinese Emperor. It was small scale and could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly, the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[3][4]\\r\\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier  vapeur (\\"steam dray\\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The center of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth [5] and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne. The first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\\r\\nDuring the 19th century attempts were made to introduce practical steam powered vehicles. Innovations such as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions and better steering developed. Some commercially successful vehicles provided mass transit until a backlash against these large vehicles resulted in the passage of legislation such as the United Kingdom Locomotive Act (1865), which required many self-propelled vehicles on public roads to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively halted road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.\\r\\nIn 1816, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[6]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a 2 seated car phaeton.[6]:p27\\r\\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \\"steam buggy\\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec and again the following year.[7] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[8]\\r\\nOne of the first \\"real\\" automobiles was produced by Frenchman Amde Bolle in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\\r\\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam-powered vehicle invented in 1871 by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin.[1][9][self-published source] It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875 to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than 5 miles per hour (8.0?km/h) over a 200-mile (320?km) course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on 16 July 1878 in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort Atkinson, and Janesville. While seven vehicles were registered, only two started to compete: the entries from Green Bay and Oshkosh. The vehicle from Green Bay was faster, but broke down before completing the race. The Oshkosh finished the 201-mile (323?km) course in 33 hours and 27 minutes, and posted an average speed of six miles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10][11][12]\\r\\nSteam-powered road vehicles, both cars and wagons, reached the peak of their development in the early 1930s with fast-steaming lightweight boilers and efficient engine designs. Internal combustion engines also developed greatly during WWI, becoming simpler to operate and more reliable. The development of the high-speed diesel engine from 1930 began to replace them for wagons, accelerated in the UK by tax changes making steam wagons uneconomic overnight. Although a few designers continued to advocate steam power, no significant developments in production steam cars took place after Doble in 1931.\\r\\nWhether steam cars will ever be reborn in later technological eras remains to be seen. Magazines such as Light Steam Power continued to describe them into the 1980s. The 1950s saw interest in steam-turbine cars powered by small nuclear reactors[citation needed] (this was also true of aircraft), but the dangers inherent in nuclear fission technology soon killed these ideas.\\r\\nIn 1828, nyos Jedlik, a Hungarian who invented an early type of electric motor, created a tiny model car powered by his new motor.[14] In 1834, Vermont blacksmith Thomas Davenport, the inventor of the first American DC electric motor, installed his motor in a small model car, which he operated on a short circular electrified track.[15] In 1835, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of Groningen, the Netherlands and his assistant Christopher Becker created a small-scale electrical car, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells.[16] In 1838, Scotsman Robert Davidson built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of 4 miles per hour (6?km/h). In England, a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of tracks as conductors of electric current, and similar American patents were issued to Lilley and Colten in 1847.\\r\\nSources point to different creations as the first electric car. Between 1832 and 1839 (the exact year is uncertain) Robert Anderson of Scotland invented a crude electric carriage, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells. In November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouv demonstrated a working three-wheeled car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris.[17] But others regard the Flocken Elektrowagen of 1888 by German inventor Andreas Flocken as the first true electric car.[13]\\r\\nElectric cars enjoyed popularity between the late 19th century and early 20th century, when electricity was among the preferred methods for automobile propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. Advances in internal combustion technology, especially the electric starter, soon rendered this advantage moot; the greater range of gasoline cars, quicker refueling times, and growing petroleum infrastructure, along with the mass production of gasoline vehicles by companies such as the Ford Motor Company, which reduced prices of gasoline cars to less than half that of equivalent electric cars, led to a decline in the use of electric propulsion, effectively removing it from important markets such as the United States by the 1930s. However, in recent years, increased concerns over the environmental impact of gasoline cars, higher gasoline prices, improvements in battery technology, and the prospect of peak oil, have brought about renewed interest in electric cars, which are perceived to be more environmentally friendly and cheaper to maintain and run, despite high initial costs, after a failed reappearance in the late-1990s.\\r\\nEarly attempts at making and using internal combustion engines were hampered by the lack of suitable fuels, particularly liquids, therefore the earliest engines used gas mixtures.\\r\\nEarly experimenters used gases. In 1806, Swiss engineer Fran?ois Isaac de Rivaz built an engine powered by internal combustion of a hydrogen and oxygen mixture.[18] In 1826, Englishman Samuel Brown tested his hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engine by using it to propel a vehicle up Shooter's Hill in south-east London. Belgian-born Etienne Lenoir's Hippomobile with a hydrogen-gas-fuelled one-cylinder internal combustion engine made a test drive from Paris to Joinville-le-Pont in 1860, covering some nine kilometres in about three hours.[19] A later version was propelled by coal gas. A Delamare-Deboutteville vehicle was patented and trialled in 1884.\\r\\nAbout 1870, in Vienna, Austria (then the Austro-Hungarian Empire), inventor Siegfried Marcus put a liquid-fuelled internal combustion engine on a simple handcart which made him the first man to propel a vehicle by means of gasoline. Today, this car is known as \\"the first Marcus car\\". In 1883, Marcus secured a German patent for a low-voltage ignition system of the magneto type; this was his only automotive patent. This design was used for all further engines, and the four-seat \\"second Marcus car\\" of 1888/89. This ignition, in conjunction with the \\"rotating-brush carburetor\\", made the second car's design very innovative. His second car is on display at the Technical Museum in Vienna. During his lifetime he was honored as the originator of the motorcar but his place in history was all but erased by the Nazis during World War II. Because Marcus was of Jewish descent, the Nazi propaganda office ordered his work to be destroyed, his name expunged from future textbooks, and his public memorials removed, giving credit instead to Karl Benz.[20]\\r\\nIt is generally acknowledged[according to whom?] that the first really practical automobiles with petrol/gasoline-powered internal combustion engines were completed almost simultaneously by several German inventors working independently: Karl Benz built his first automobile in 1885 in Mannheim. Benz was granted a patent for his automobile on 29 January 1886,[21] and began the first production of automobiles in 1888, after Bertha Benz, his wife, had proved ÿ with the first long-distance trip in August 1888, from Mannheim to Pforzheim and back ÿ that the horseless coach was absolutely suitable for daily use. Since 2008 a Bertha Benz Memorial Route commemorates this event.[22]\\r\\nSoon after, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Stuttgart in 1889 designed a vehicle from scratch to be an automobile, rather than a horse-drawn carriage fitted with an engine. They also are usually credited with invention of the first motorcycle in 1886, but Italy's Enrico Bernardi of the University of Padua, in 1882, patented a 0.024 horsepower (17.9?W) 122?cc (7.4?cu?in) one-cylinder petrol motor, fitting it into his son's tricycle, making it at least a candidate for the first automobile and first motorcycle;.[6]:p.26 Bernardi enlarged the tricycle in 1892 to carry two adults.[6]:p.26\\r\\nThe first four-wheeled petrol-driven automobile in Britain was built in Walthamstow by Frederick Bremer in 1892.[23] Another was made in Birmingham in 1895 by Frederick William Lanchester, who also patented the disc brake. The first electric starter was installed on an Arnold, an adaptation of the Benz Velo, built in Kent between 1895 and 1898.[6]:p.25\\r\\nGeorge F. Foss of Sherbrooke, Quebec built a single-cylinder gasoline car in 1896 which he drove for 4 years, ignoring city officials' warnings of arrest for his \\"mad antics.\\"[7]\\r\\nIn all the turmoil, many early pioneers are nearly forgotten. In 1891, John William Lambert built a three-wheeler in Ohio City, Ohio, which was destroyed in a fire the same year, while Henry Nadig constructed a four-wheeler in Allentown, Pennsylvania. It is likely they were not the only ones.[6]:p.25\\r\\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on 8 May 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the patent was granted on 5 November 1895.[24] This patent did more to hinder than encourage development of autos in the United States. Selden licensed his patent to most major American automakers, collecting a fee on every car they produced.\\r\\nThe first production of automobiles was by Karl Benz in 1888 in Germany and, under license from Benz, in France by Emile Roger. There were numerous others, including tricycle builders Rudolf Egg, Edward Butler, and Lon Bolle.[6]:p.20ÿ23 Bolle, using a 650?cc (40?cu?in) engine of his own design, enabled his driver, Jamin, to average 45 kilometres per hour (28.0?mph) in the 1897 Paris-Tourville rally.[6]:p.23 By 1900, mass production of automobiles had begun in France and the United States.\\r\\nThe first company formed exclusively to build automobiles was Panhard et Levassor in France, which also introduced the first four-cylinder engine.[6]:p.22 Formed in 1889, Panhard was quickly followed by Peugeot two years later. By the start of the 20th century, the automobile industry was beginning to take off in Western Europe, especially in France, where 30,204 were produced in 1903, representing 48.8% of world automobile production that year.[25]\\r\\nIn the United States, brothers Charles and Frank Duryea founded the Duryea Motor Wagon Company in 1893, becoming the first American automobile manufacturing company. The Autocar Company, founded in 1897, established a number of innovations still in use[26] and remains the oldest operating motor vehicle manufacturer in the United States. However, it was Ransom E. Olds and his Olds Motor Vehicle Company (later known as Oldsmobile) who would dominate this era with the introduction of the Oldsmobile Curved Dash. Its production line was running in 1901. The Thomas B. Jeffery Company developed the world's second mass-produced automobile, and 1,500 Ramblers were built and sold in its first year, representing one-sixth of all existing motorcars in the United States at the time.[27] Within a year, Cadillac (formed from the Henry Ford Company), Winton, and Ford were also producing cars in the thousands. The Studebaker brothers, having become the world's leading manufacturers of horse-drawn vehicles, made a transition to electric automobiles in 1902, and gasoline engines in 1904. They continued to build horse-drawn vehicles until 1919.[28]:p.90\\r\\nThe first motor car in Central Europe was produced by the Austro-Hungarian company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra in today's Czech Republic) in 1897, the Pr?sident automobile.[29] In 1898, Louis Renault had a De Dion-Bouton modified, with fixed drive shaft and differential, making \\"perhaps the first hot rod in history\\" and bringing Renault and his brothers into the car industry.[30] Innovation was rapid and rampant, with no clear standards for basic vehicle architectures, body styles, construction materials, or controls, for example many veteran cars use a tiller, rather than a wheel for steering. During 1903, Rambler standardized on the steering wheel[31] and moved the driver's position to the left-hand side of the vehicle.[32] Chain drive was dominant over the drive shaft, and closed bodies were extremely rare. Drum brakes were introduced by Renault in 1902.[33] The next year, Dutch designer Jacobus Spijker built the first four-wheel drive racing car;[34] it never competed and it would be 1965 and the Jensen FF before four-wheel drive was used on a production car.[35]\\r\\nWithin a few years, a dizzying assortment of technologies were being used by hundreds of producers all over the western world. Steam, electricity, and petrol/gasoline-powered automobiles competed for decades, with petrol/gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance by the 1910s. Dual- and even quad-engine cars were designed, and engine displacement ranged to more than a dozen litres. Many modern advances, including gas/electric hybrids, multi-valve engines, overhead camshafts, and four-wheel drive, were attempted, and discarded at this time.\\r\\nInnovation was not limited to the vehicles themselves. Increasing numbers of cars propelled the growth of the petroleum industry,[36] as well as the development of technology to produce gasoline (replacing kerosene and coal oil) and of improvements in heat-tolerant mineral oil lubricants (replacing vegetable and animal oils).[37]\\r\\nThere were social effects, also. Music would be made about cars, such as \\"In My Merry Oldsmobile\\" (a tradition that continues) while, in 1896, William Jennings Bryan would be the first presidential candidate to campaign in a car (a donated Mueller), in Decatur, Illinois.[38] Three years later, Jacob German would start a tradition for New York City cabdrivers when he sped down Lexington Avenue, at the \\"reckless\\" speed of 12?mph (19?km/h).[39] Also in 1899, Akron, Ohio, adopted the first self-propelled paddy wagon.[39]\\r\\nBy 1900, the early centers of national automotive industry developed in many countries, including Belgium (home to Vincke, which copied Benz; Germain, a pseudo-Panhard; and Linon and Nagant, both based on the Gobron-Brilli),[6]:p,25 Switzerland (led by Fritz Henriod, Rudolf Egg, Saurer, Johann Weber, and Lorenz Popp),[6]:p.25 Vagnfabrik AB in Sweden, Hammel (by A. F. Hammel and H. U. Johansen at Copenhagen, in Denmark, which only built one car, ca. 1886[6]:p.25), Irgens (starting in Bergen, Norway, in 1883, but without success),[6]:p.25ÿ26 Italy (where FIAT started in 1899), and as far afield as Australia (where Pioneer set up shop in 1898, with an already archaic paraffin-fuelled centre-pivot-steered wagon).[6] Meanwhile, the export trade had begun, with Koch exporting cars and trucks from Paris to Tunisia, Egypt, Iran, and the Dutch East Indies.[6]:p25 Motor cars were also exported very early to British colonies and the first motor car was exported to India in 1897.\\r\\nArthur Jerome Eddy, early automobile enthusiast, 1902[40]\\r\\nThroughout the veteran car era, the automobile was seen more as a novelty than as a genuinely useful device. Breakdowns were frequent, fuel was difficult to obtain, roads suitable for traveling were scarce, and rapid innovation meant that a year-old car was nearly worthless. Major breakthroughs in proving the usefulness of the automobile came with the historic long-distance drive of Bertha Benz in 1888, when she traveled more than 80 kilometres (50?mi) from Mannheim to Pforzheim, to make people aware of the potential of the vehicles her husband, Karl Benz, manufactured, and after Horatio Nelson Jackson's successful transcontinental drive across the United States in 1903.\\r\\nThis period lasted from roughly 1905 through to 1914 and the beginning of World War I. It is generally referred to as the Edwardian era, but in the United States is often known as the Brass era from the widespread use of brass in vehicles during this time.\\r\\nWithin the 15 years that make up this era, the various experimental designs and alternate power systems would be marginalised. Although the modern touring car had been invented earlier, it was not until Panhard et Levassor's Systme Panhard was widely licensed and adopted that recognisable and standardised automobiles were created. This system specified front-engined, rear-wheel drive internal combustion engined cars with a sliding gear transmission. Traditional coach-style vehicles were rapidly abandoned, and buckboard runabouts lost favour with the introduction of tonneaus and other less-expensive touring bodies.\\r\\nBy 1906, steam car development had advanced, and they were among the fastest road vehicles in that period.[citation needed]\\r\\nThroughout this era, development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included the electric ignition system (by dynamotor on the Arnold in 1898,[41] though Robert Bosch, 1903, tends to get the credit), independent suspension (actually conceived by Bolle in 1873),[41] and four-wheel brakes (by the Arrol-Johnston Company of Scotland in 1909).[6]:p27 Leaf springs were widely used for suspension, though many other systems were still in use, with angle steel taking over from armored wood as the frame material of choice. Transmissions and throttle controls were widely adopted, allowing a variety of cruising speeds, though vehicles generally still had discrete speed settings, rather than the infinitely variable system familiar in cars of later eras. Safety glass also made its debut, patented by John Wood in England in 1905.[33] (It would not become standard equipment until 1926, on a Rickenbacker.)[33]\\r\\nBetween 1907 and 1912 in the United States, the high-wheel motor buggy (resembling the horse buggy of before 1900) was in its heyday, with over seventy-five makers including Holsman (Chicago), IHC (Chicago), and Sears (which sold via catalog); the high-wheeler would be killed by the Model T.[6]:p.65 In 1912, Hupp (in the United States, supplied by Hale & Irwin) and BSA (in the UK) pioneered the use of all-steel bodies,[42] joined in 1914 by Dodge (who produced Model T bodies).[33] While it would be another two decades before all-steel bodies would be standard, the change would mean improved supplies of superior-quality wood for furniture makers.[6]\\r\\nThe 1908 New York to Paris Race was the first circumnavigation of the world by automobile. German, French, Italian and American teams began in New York City 12 February 1908 with three of the competitors ultimately reaching Paris. The US built Thomas Flyer with George Schuster (driver) won the race covering 22,000 miles in 169 days. Also in 1908, the first South American automobile was built in Peru, the Grieve.[43] In 1909, Rambler became the first car company to equip its cars with a spare tire that was mounted on a fifth wheel.[44]\\r\\nSome examples of cars of the period included:[citation needed]\\r\\nThe vintage era lasted from the end of World War I (1918), through to the Wall Street Crash at the end of 1929. During this period the front-engined car came to dominate with closed bodies and standardised controls becoming the norm. In 1919, 90% of cars sold were open; by 1929, 90% were closed.[6]:p.7 Development of the internal combustion engine continued at a rapid pace, with multi-valve and overhead camshaft engines produced at the high end, and V8, V12, and even V16 engines conceived for the ultra-rich. Also in 1919, hydraulic brakes were invented by Malcolm Loughead (co-founder of Lockheed); they were adopted by Duesenberg for their 1921 Model A.[33] Three years later, Hermann Rieseler of Vulcan Motor invented the first automatic transmission, which had two-speed planetary gearbox, torque converter, and lockup clutch; it never entered production.[33] (Its like would only become an available option in 1940.)[33] Just at the end of the vintage era, tempered glass (now standard equipment in side windows) was invented in France.[33] In this era the revolutionary ponton design of cars without fully articulated fenders, running boards and other non-compact ledge elements was introduced in small series but mass production of such cars was started much later (after WWII).\\r\\nAmerican auto companies in the 1920s expected they would soon sell six million cars a year, but did not do so until 1955. Numerous companies disappeared.[47] Between 1922 and 1925, the number of U.S. passenger car builders decreased from 175 to 70. H. A. Tarantous, managing editor of \\"MoToR Member Society of Automotive Engineers\\", in a New York Times article from 1925, suggested many were unable to raise production and cope with falling prices (due to assembly line production), especially for low-priced cars. The new pyroxylin-based paints, eight cylinder engine, four wheel brakes, and balloon tires as the biggest trends for 1925.[48]\\r\\nExamples of period vehicles:[citation needed]\\r\\nThe pre-war part of the classic era began with the Great Depression in 1930, and ended with the recovery after World War II, commonly placed at 1946. It was in this period that integrated fenders and fully closed bodies began to dominate sales, with the new saloon/sedan body style even incorporating a trunk or boot at the rear for storage. The old open-top runabouts, phaetons, and touring cars were largely phased out by the end of the classic era as wings, running boards, and headlights were gradually integrated with the body of the car.\\r\\nBy the 1930s, most of the mechanical technology used in today's automobiles had been invented, although some things were later \\"re-invented\\", and credited to someone else. For example, front-wheel drive was re-introduced by Andr Citro?n with the launch of the Traction Avant in 1934, though it had appeared several years earlier in road cars made by Alvis and Cord, and in racing cars by Miller (and may have appeared as early as 1897). In the same vein, independent suspension was originally conceived by Amde Bolle in 1873, but not put in production until appearing on the low-volume Mercedes-Benz 380 in 1933, which prodded American makers to use it more widely.[41] In 1930, the number of auto manufacturers declined sharply as the industry consolidated and matured, thanks in part to the effects of the Great Depression.\\r\\nExemplary pre-war automobiles:[citation needed]\\r\\nA major change in automobile design since World War II was the popularity of ponton style, in which running boards were eliminated and fenders were incorporated into the body. Among the first representatives of the style were the Soviet GAZ-M20 Pobeda (1946), British Standard Vanguard (1947), United States Studebaker Champion and Kaiser (1946), as well as the low-production Czech luxury Tatra T600 Tatraplan (1946) and the Italian Cisitalia 220 sports car (1947).\\r\\nAutomobile design and production finally emerged from the military orientation and other shadow of war in 1949, the year that in the United States saw the introduction of high-compression V8 engines and modern bodies from General Motors' Oldsmobile and Cadillac brands. Hudson introduced the \\"step-down\\" design with the 1948 Commodore, which placed the passenger compartment down inside the perimeter of the frame, that was one of the first new-design postwar cars made and featured trend-setting slab-side styling.[49] The unibody/strut-suspended 1951 Ford Consul joined the 1948 Morris Minor and 1949 Rover P4 in the automobile market in the United Kingdom. In Italy, Enzo Ferrari was beginning his 250 series, just as Lancia introduced the revolutionary V6-powered Aurelia.\\r\\nThroughout the 1950s, engine power and vehicle speeds rose, designs became more integrated and artful, and automobiles were marketed internationally. Alec Issigonis' Mini and Fiat's 500 diminutive cars were introduced in Europe, while the similar kei car class became popular in Japan. The Volkswagen Beetle continued production after Hitler and began exports to other nations, including the United States. At the same time, Nash introduced the Nash Rambler, the first successful modern compact car made in the United States,[50] while the standard models produced by the \\"Big Three\\" domestic automakers grew ever larger in size, featuring increasing amounts of chrome trim, and luxury was exemplified by the Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. The markets in Europe expanded with new small-sized automobiles, as well as expensive grand tourers (GT), like the Ferrari America.\\r\\nThe market changed in the 1960s, as the United States \\"Big Three\\" automakers began facing competition from imported cars, the European makers adopted advanced technologies and Japan emerged as a car-producing nation. Japanese companies began to export some of their more popular selling cars in Japan internationally, such as the Toyota Corolla, Toyota Corona, Nissan Sunny, and Nissan Bluebird in the mid-1960s. The success of American Motors' compact-sized Rambler models spurred GM and Ford to introduce their own downsized cars in 1960.[51] Performance engines became a focus of marketing by United States automakers, exemplified by the era's muscle cars. In 1964, the Ford Mustang developed a new market segment, the pony car. New models to compete with the Mustang included the Chevrolet Camaro, AMC Javelin, and Plymouth Barracuda. Captive imports and badge engineering increased in the United States and the UK as amalgamated groups such as the British Motor Corporation consolidated the market. BMC's space-saving and trend-setting transverse engined, front-wheel-drive, independent suspension and monocoque bodied Mini, which first appeared in 1959, was marketed under the Austin and Morris names, until Mini became a marque in its own right in 1969.[52] Competition increased, with Studebaker, a pioneering automaker, shutting down, and the trend for consolidation reached Italy where niche makers like Maserati, Ferrari, and Lancia were acquired by larger companies. By the end of the decade, the number of automobile marques had been greatly reduced.\\r\\nTechnology developments included the widespread use of independent suspensions, wider application of fuel injection, and an increasing focus on safety in automotive design. Innovations during the 1960s included NSU's Wankel engine, the gas turbine, and the turbocharger. Of these, only the last endured, pioneered by General Motors, and adopted by BMW and Saab, later seeing mass-market use during the 1980s by Chrysler. Mazda continued developing its Wankel engine, in spite of problems in longevity, emissions, and fuel economy. Other Wankel licensees, including Mercedes-Benz and GM, never put their designs into production because of engineering and manufacturing problems, as well as the lessons from the 1973 oil crisis.\\r\\nThe 1970s were turbulent years for automakers and buyers with major events reshaping the industry such as the 1973 oil crisis, stricter automobile emissions control and safety requirements, increasing exports by the Japanese and European automakers, as well as growth in inflation and the stagnant economic conditions in many nations. Smaller-sized grew in popularity. The United States saw the establishment of the subcompact segment with the introduction of the AMC Gremlin, followed by the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto. The station wagons (estate, break, kombi, universal) body design was popular, as well as increasing sales of non-commercial all-wheel drive off-road vehicles.\\r\\nTo the end of the 20th century, the United States Big Three (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) partially lost their leading position, Japan became for a while the world's leader of car production and cars began to be mass manufactured in new Asian, East European, and other countries.\\r\\nNotable exemplary post-war cars:[citation needed]\\r\\nThe modern era is normally defined as the 25 years preceding the current year.[citation needed] The modern era has been one of increasing standardisation, platform sharing, computer-aided design, to reduce costs and development time and increasing use of electronic for both engine management and entertainment systems.\\r\\nSome particular contemporary developments are the proliferation of front- and all-wheel drive, the adoption of the diesel engine, and the ubiquity of fuel injection. Most modern passenger cars are front-wheel-drive monocoque/unibody designs, with transversely mounted engines.\\r\\nBody styles have changed as well in the modern era. Three types, the hatchback, sedan, and sport utility vehicle, dominate today's market.[citation needed] All originally emphasised practicality, but have mutated into today's high-powered luxury crossover SUV, sports wagon[ and two-volume Large MPV. The rise of pickup trucks in the United States and SUVs worldwide has changed the face of motoring with these \\"trucks\\" coming to command more than half of the world automobile market.[citation needed] There was also the introduction of the MPV class (smaller non-commercial passenger minivans), among the first of which were the French Renault Espace and the Chrysler minivan versions in the United States\\r\\nThe modern era has also seen rapidly improving fuel efficiency and engine output. The automobile emissions concerns have been eased with computerised engine management systems.\\r\\nThe economic crisis of 2008 cut almost a third of light vehicle sales from Chrysler, Toyota, Ford, and Nissan. It also subtracted about a fourth of Honda's sales and about a seventh of sales from General Motors.[56]\\r\\nSince 2009, China has become the world's largest car manufacturer with production greater than Japan, the United States, and all of Europe. Besides large growth of car production in Asian and other countries, there has been growth in transnational corporate groups, with the production of transnational automobiles sharing the same platforms as well as badge engineering or re-badging to suit different markets and consumer segments.\\r\\nSince the end of the 20th century, several award competitions for cars and trucks have become widely known, such as European Car of the Year, Car of the Year Japan, North American Car of the Year, World Car of the Year, Truck of the Year, and International Car of the Year. Also, a Car of the Century award was held in which in the US the Ford Model T was named as most influential car of the 20th century.[citation needed]\\r\\nExemplary modern cars:[citation needed]","input":"Who built the first automobile in the world?"},{"output":"the 1960s","context":"Death education is education about death that focuses on the human and emotional aspects of death. Though it may include teaching on the biological aspects of death, teaching about coping with grief is a primary focus. Death education is formally known as thanatology. Thanatology stems from the Greek word thanatos, meaning death, and ology meaning a science or organized body of knowledge.[1] A specialist in this field is referred to as a thanatologist. Death education refers to the experiences and activities of death that one deals with. Death education also deals with being able to grasp the different processes of dying, talk about the main topics of attitudes and meanings toward death, and the after effects on how to learn to care for people that are affected by the death. The main focus in death education is teaching people how to cope with grief. Many people feel death education is a taboo and instead of talking about death and grieving, they hide it away and never bring it up to others. With the right education of death, the less of a taboo it will be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically death education in American society has been seen as a taboo topic, not worthy of scholarly research or for educational purposes. In the 1960s pioneering professionals like that of Herman Feifel (1959), Elisabeth Kbler-Ross (1969), and Cicely Saunders (1967) encouraged behavioral scientists, clinicians, and humanists to pay attention and to study death-related topics. This initiated the death-awareness movement and began the widespread study of death-related behavior, developing new programs of care for the dying and bereaved, as well as new research on death-related attitudes.[2]\\r\\n\\"Death is no enemy of life; it restores our sense of the value of living. Illness restores the sense of proportion that is lost when we take life for granted. To learn about value and proportion we need to honor illness, and ultimately to honor death.\\"[3] Death education honors death by educating about death, dying, and bereavement to enrich personal lives, inform and guide individuals in their transactions with society, prepare individuals for their public roles as citizens, help prepare and support individuals in their professional and vocational roles, and lastly to enhance the ability of individuals to communicate effectively about death-related matters.[4]\\r\\nOne of the major organizations that educates people on death is Hospice. Hospice[5] offers support for the caregiver, and Hospice also offers information on what to expect before death and what the family can expect after death. One of the major subjects that hospice addresses within death are the myths that come along with death. Hospice will also walk caretakers through the signs and symptoms to look for that signify death. Hospice is an important type of care that helps spread and explain death education to the people. When people have a loved one that is not able to get anymore help from medication or doctors, it would be a good recommendation for them to go to hospice. They would be able to receive great support and comfort during the end of their life journey. Not only does hospice give care to the terminally ill, they also give grief suggestions to family members and close friends. \\"With proper care, proper support, and love, we can share the miracle that is life\\". The end of a persons life should be centered on being alive instead of being dead.\\r\\nStudents of a death education course need to clearly understand the complex knowledge of the subject, learn the five key areas of knowledge, and to learn the physical, psycho-social, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of death. The five key areas are: understanding the dying process, decision making for end of life, loss, grief, and bereavement, assessment and intervention, and traumatic death. Death education should be taught in perspective and ones emotional response should be proportionate to the occasion. In addition death education can be taught formally or informally. Formally planned death education is associated with learning in organized educational settings including: schools, colleges, graduate education, professional workshops, and volunteer training programs.[6]\\r\\nThere are five stages of grief and loss that were proposed by Elisa Kubler-Ross in her book called, \\"On Death and Dying\\". Each stage is going to be different lengths of timespans, with different amounts of intensity depending on the person. The five stages of grief, which are: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, do not always come in order; in fact they usually never do. In the end of your grieving process the last stage is always going to be, achieving a more peaceful acceptance of death (Axelrod). With the knowledge of the five stages of grief, people will be able to understand better how the dying process goes for the ones who death affects. In order to help get you through your grieving process dont look at the stages as an order you have to follow, instead use the stages as more of guidelines for your grieving process. All people grieve differently so you should not judge someone for grieving differently than you. The first stage is denial and isolation. When you first hear about a loved one who has a deathly illness your first instinct is to deny the reality of the situation. This is known as a defense mechanism because we block out the words by not fully processing them and also hide from the facts. The second stage is anger. Once the blocking out subsides the reality of the situation becomes overwhelming and the pain from the news emerges. The third stage is bargaining. This stage you will feel more vulnerable and helpless. In order to gain control again youll start thinking of ways that would have made it better like: ? \\"If only we had sought medical attention sooner\\" ? \\"If only we got a second opinion from another doctor\\" ? \\"If only we had tried to be a better person toward them\\"\\r\\nAll of these are defense lines to try and protect us from the reality of pain in a lost one. The fourth stage is depression. In this stage there can be two different types of depression that you deal with. The first type of depression can be a more quiet and private feeling. The second type of depression is the kind where sadness and regret overtake your body and become the predominate factors in your life. The fifth and final stage is acceptance. This stage does not always reach everyone but for the people who actually get it should consider this stage as a gift. It does not mean that you will not be sad anymore but it does mean that there is going to be some kind of peace that you are able to reach with the loved one that died.\\r\\nEven though people are still conservative towards the idea of death and dying, with help and the education of death, people will come to know death as a natural part of life that everyone will someday have to go through. Instead of being timid and scared of death, people will become comfortable towards the topic and be able to prepare for what will come in the future. Death education is not just for medical professionals and those dealing with the terminally ill but rather death education is beneficial to everyone for it reveals the importance of quality in living and the human search for meaning. \\"Dying was what human life moved toward and therefore dying was what a human being constantly prepared for.\\"[7]","input":"When did the modern death awareness movement begin?"},{"output":"January 8, 2014","context":"Chicago P.D. is an American television drama on NBC spun off from Chicago Fire.

The bell was said to be twelve cubits (6.276 m) high and eight cubits (4.184 m) wide. Click here to see a drawing of the bell as it appeared while still at the Shwedagon Pagoda.\\r\\nThe Great Bell of Dhammazedi remained at the Shwedagon Pagoda as the heaviest functioning bell in the world until 1602. That year, Portuguese warlord and mercenary Philip de Brito removed it and attempted to carry it by a specially constructed raft down the Yangon River to his stronghold of Thanlyin (later known as Syriam). However, the ship carrying the bell sank at the confluence of the Yangon and Bago rivers. The Dhammazedi Bell remains buried to this day at that location, possibly well-preserved, beneath some 25 feet (7.6?m) of sediment. Numerous attempts have been made to locate and recover the bell, thus far without success.[2][3]\\r\\nSo while the Great Bell of Dhammazedi might indeed be the heaviest bell in the world, it must be disqualified from consideration as such, until it has been recovered and restored to a functional status.\\r\\nCast in 1633, the 74-ton Chion-in Temple Bell, located in Kyoto, Japan, held the title of heaviest functioning bell in the world until 1810.[4]\\r\\nFrom March 1839 until March 1896, the Mingun Bell was not functional due to the fact that it was not hanging freely from its shackles. During this period, the Chion-in Temple Bell regained its former title.[4]\\r\\nCast in 1808, the 90-ton Mingun Bell in Mingun, Sagaing Division, Burma became the heaviest functioning bell in the world from its suspension in 1810 until 23 March 1839. On that date, it was knocked off its supports by a large earthquake. Click here to see a photograph of the Mingun Bell as it appeared in the late 1800s.\\r\\nThe Mingun Bell was resuspended in March 1896 by a team of men from the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company.[5] The Mingun Bell was again the world's heaviest functioning bell from its resuspension in 1896 until 1902.\\r\\nThe Mingun Bell regained its status as the heaviest functioning bell in the world in 1942.\\r\\nIn 1902, the newly-cast 114-ton Shitenn-ji Temple Bell was hung in Osaka, Japan.[6] The Shitenn-ji Temple Bell reigned as the heaviest functioning bell in the world from that year until 1942, when it was melted down for its metal to assist with the then-ongoing World War II effort.[6]\\r\\nCast on New Year's Eve 2000, the Bell of Good Luck is located in the Foquan Temple in Pingdingshan, Henan, China.[7][8] The bell weighs 116 metric tons and it is 810.8?cm (318?in) in height and 511.8?cm (201?in) in diameter.[7][8] The Bell of Good Luck has therefore claimed the title of heaviest functioning bell in the world since its construction in 2000, up to the present date.\\r\\nThe 216-ton Russian Tsar Bell (also known as the Tsar Kolokol III) on display on the grounds of the Moscow Kremlin is the heaviest bell known to exist in the world today.[9] However, a very large piece broke off from the Tsar Bell during a fire which engulfed the tower the bell was intended to be hung in, so this irreparably damaged bell has never been suspended or rung.

The team competes in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference, having moved to the conference in 2002.\\r\\nThe franchise is named after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, and was founded on October 8, 1997, the event's 126th anniversary. The team began play in 1998 as one of the league's first expansion teams. The Fire won the MLS Cup as well as the U.S. Open Cup (the \\"double\\") on their first season. They also won U.S. Open Cups in 2000, 2003, and 2006, in addition to the 2003 MLS Supporters' Shield.\\r\\nThe Fire maintains an extensive development system, consisting of the Chicago Fire U-23 (Premier Development League and Super-20 League teams), the Chicago Fire Development Academy, and the Chicago Fire Juniors youth organization. They also operate the Chicago Fire Foundation, the team's community-based charitable division. Toyota Park is the Fire's home stadium.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded on October 8, 1997,[1] the Fire were originally based at Soldier Field. Since 2006, the club plays at their own stadium, Toyota Park at 71st and Harlem Avenue in Bridgeview. The owners of the Fire are Andell Holdings, who purchased the club in 2007. Andell Holdings chairman Andrew Hauptman acts as club chairman, while the general manager is Nelson Rodriguez and the chief operating officer is Atul Khosla. The Fire are historically most successful in the U.S. Open Cup; winning championships in 1998, 2000, 2003, and 2006. The Fire keep a close connection with the Chicago Sting, its predecessor team in the NASL, by holding frequent commemorative events and reunions, and wearing Sting-inspired shirts.\\r\\nMany notable players have worn the Fire shirt, including U.S. internationals Chris Armas, Carlos Bocanegra, Frank Klopas, DaMarcus Beasley, Brian McBride, Tony Sanneh, Cory Gibbs, Ante Razov, Josh Wolff and Eric Wynalda. Some of the club's other notable American professional players include C.J. Brown, Jesse Marsch, Chris Rolfe, and Zach Thornton. The Fire also have a reputation for importing international talent, from established veterans like Bastian Schweinsteiger, Pvel Pardo, Piotr Nowak, Cuauhtmoc Blanco, Tomasz Frankowski, Lubos Kubik and Hristo Stoichkov; in addition to younger players such as Patrick Nyarko, Marco Pappa, Damani Ralph, Bakary Soumar and Nery Castillo.\\r\\nThe Chicago Fire are named after the Great Chicago Fire that happened in 1871.\\r\\nFounded in 1997 at Navy Pier, on the anniversary of the Great Fire, the Fire immediately tapped into the diverse ethnic makeup of the city. The team brought in Polish players Piotr Nowak, Jerzy Podbrozny, and Roman Kosecki; the Mexican Jorge Campos; and the Czech Lubos Kubik. While all showed their talent while playing for Chicago that first year, American players (Zach Thornton, Chris Armas, C.J. Brown) proved most integral to the Fire's continued success. Under the club's first head coach, Bob Bradleyand against all expectationthe team completed the double in its first competitive year, beating D.C. United in the 1998 MLS Cup Final, and defeating the Columbus Crew in Chicago to win the 1998 U.S. Open Cup a week later.\\r\\nThe team's momentum continued, reaching the 2000 MLS Cup final (losing to Kansas City) and winning the 2000 U.S. Open Cup. Internationally experienced players such as Hristo Stoitchkov joined the Fire, while young American talents such as DaMarcus Beasley developed. The Fire quickly became cemented as one of the league's preeminent teams.\\r\\nWith Soldier Field undergoing massive renovations, the Fire moved to the western Chicago suburb of Naperville, Illinois in 2002. That same year, Bob Bradley abruptly departed the team to lead the MetroStars, from his home state of New Jersey. The Fire then selected the U.S. men's national team's top assistant, Dave Sarachan, to assume the vacant post.\\r\\nChicago qualified for the league final while also capturing the Supporters' Shield and 2003 U.S. Open Cup along the way. The team returned to Chicago and the renovated Soldier Field midway through the 2003 season.\\r\\nAfter that season, longtime captain Piotr Nowak retired to take a position in the front office. He departed a year later to become manager of D.C. United. In this period new talent emerged, including Jamaican striker Damani Ralph. Still, stagnating performances and the building strength of the Eastern Conference made Chicago's league position ever more tenuous. In 2004, the team missed the league playoffs for the first time in their history.\\r\\nThe 2005 season began with the unexpected dismissal of popular club president Peter Wilt by then-owners AEG, a move decried by fans, many players, and club staff.[2] This came as a shock, given his brokering of a $100m deal to build the Fire a stadium in the collar suburb of Bridgeview. He was immediately replaced by MetroStars executive John Guppy.\\r\\nCompetitively, the season was most notable for the blockbuster visit of Milan from Italy's Serie A, and the surprising 4ÿ0 away defeat of D.C. United in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals.\\r\\n2006 arrived, and the Fire moved from Soldier Field into its new stadium in Bridgeview, a southwest suburb of Chicago: Toyota Park, located at the corner of 71st Street and Harlem Avenue. In its first season, it played host to an unspectacular league campaign; but victory in the 2006 U.S. Open Cup marked a continuation of the club's successes and promise for the future.\\r\\nThe anxiety to win another league title continued to grow, however. Sarachan entered 2007 (his fifth season in charge) under intense pressure from fans and the administration to produce a league championship. Tension mounted further on April 3, 2007, when the Fire signed Mexico and Amrica star Cuauhtmoc Blanco to a Designated Player contract. After a perfect three matches to open the year, they won only one of their next eight, and Sarachan was dismissed. Following a brief search, Millonarios manager Juan Carlos Osorio was named the club's third head coach.\\r\\nMore change came soon afterward. On September 6, 2007, Andell Holdings, a Los Angeles-based private investment firm controlled by chairman Andrew Hauptman, acquired AEG's interest in the Chicago Fire Soccer Club. Reports estimated the purchase price to be upwards of $35 million.[3] The team has not won a major trophy since Hauptman bought the team.\\r\\nOn the field, behind Blanco and Wilman Conde, Osorio's central defender at Millionarios, the Fire went on an extended unbeaten run to close the season, easily qualifying for the playoffs but were defeated at New England in the Eastern Conference Final. On December 10, 2007, the Fire announced Osorio's resignation. He was named manager of the New York Red Bulls eight days later. Hauptman filed tampering charges with the league in protest, and the Fire were compensated by the Red Bulls with cash and draft picks.[4]\\r\\nChanges came quickly in Osorio's wake. On January 17, 2008, former Fire star Frank Klopas was named Technical Director in charge of player personnel, and longtime Fire assistant Denis Hamlett was appointed manager. While the Fire struggled at home in 2008 the team found unusual success on the road, gathering 22 out of a possible 45 away points. Momentum grew with the long-anticipated signing of Chicago native Brian McBride on a free transfer in July 2008. After disposing of the Red Bulls 5ÿ2 in the season's final game, they decisively conquered New England in the first round of the playoffs with a 3ÿ0 victory at home. This was Chicago's first playoff advancement over the Revolution in four consecutive seasons. But triumph only lasted for a week, as they again missed the league final with their 2ÿ1 Eastern Conference Final loss to eventual champion Columbus.\\r\\nThe 2009 season saw few alterations to the previous year's roster. The story of the season was much the same, as continued poor home form offset excellent performances away from Toyota Park. This led to a second place Eastern Conference finish behind Columbus. Despite this, Real Salt Lake managed to upset the Crew in the quarterfinals, meaning Chicago would host the semi-final for the first time in six years. Chicago's nearly flawless home playoff history meant little in the end, as they lost to Salt Lake, 5ÿ3, on penalties after 120 scoreless minutes. Shortly thereafter, manager Denis Hamlett was dismissed.[5]\\r\\nLeading up to 2010, Chicago hired Carlos de los Cobos as head coach, previously manager of El Salvador.[6] Cuauhtmoc Blanco, Chris Rolfe and Gonzalo Segares all departed. More changes came in the summer transfer window with the trade of Justin Mapp to Philadelphia, the acquisition of Mexican international striker Nery Castillo, and the trade for former Swedish international midfielder Fredrik Ljungberg. Defender Gonzalo Segares returned to the Fire, leaving Apollon Limassol after only six months away. Despite these reinforcements, the Fire failed to qualify for the playoffs for only the second time in club history. Former U.S. international Brian McBride and club original C.J. Brown retired at season's end, followed closely by the departures of Wilman Conde, Ljungberg, and Castillo.\\r\\n2011 began much in the way of 2010, with foundering performances both home and away. After nine winless matches, Carlos de los Cobos was let go on May 30, 2011.[7] Technical Director Frank Klopas was named interim head coach. Behind summer reinforcements Pvel Pardo and Sebastin Grazzini, as well as forward Dominic Oduro's 12 goals after being acquired in a trade from Houston and Dan Gargan's defensive addition, the Fire qualified for the U.S. Open Cup Final (lost at Seattle) and narrowly missed making the playoffs after gaining 24 points in their last 12 league matches. After the season's conclusion, Klopas was given the permanent manager job on November 3, 2011.[8]\\r\\nAlthough expectations were modest for 2012, Klopas' first full season as coach, the year saw a change in fortune for the Fire. The spring and summer months saw several new acquisitions for the club, starting with the reacquiring of Chris Rolfe from Aalborg BK.[9] Rolfe, who scored eight goals and 12 assists in the 21 games he played in 2012, would later be named the Fire's MVP.[10] Other signings included Brazilian midfielders Alex Monteiro de Lima from the Swiss side FC Wohlen, Alvaro Fernandez from Seattle Sounders FC, forward Sherjill MacDonald from Beerschot AC of Belgium and veteran defender Arne Friedrich from VfL Wolfsburg. Although they would fall out of the U.S. Open tournament early that season, the Fire eventually compiled a 17ÿ11ÿ6 record, their best since 2000, and ranked as high as second in the Eastern Conference before ending the year in fourth place.[11] On October 31, 2012, in their first playoff appearance since 2009, the Fire lost their first-round MLS Cup playoff match-up at home against the Houston Dynamo, 2ÿ1.[12]\\r\\nIn the 2012ÿ2013 offseason, the franchise made some moves to improve on 2012's success. The team acquired Joel Lindpere and Jeff Larentowicz and also traded Dominic Oduro for Dilly Duka and the rights to Robbie Rogers.[13] The beginning of the season saw the team struggling to score goals, resulting in a record of 2ÿ5ÿ1 through April. After two successive losses to the Union in May, and with veteran Arne Friedrich still on injured reserve, the Fire acquired their former centerback Bakary Soumar from Philadelphia.[14] Also in May, Robbie Rogers expressed an interest to play in Southern California, at which point a deal was brokered for Rogers' rights in exchange for Chicago native Mike Magee from the Los Angeles Galaxy.[15] On June 23, 2013, Friedrich, who had not played a 2012ÿ13 game due to recurring injuries, announced his retirement.[16] After starting the season 2ÿ7ÿ3, the additions of Soumare and Magee led to seven wins in the squad's last 10 games. The Fire were busy in the transfer window as well, adding veteran defensive midfielder Arvalo Ros and forward Juan Luis Anangon܇.[17] The Chicago Fire also advanced to host the semifinal of the 2013 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, but fell 2ÿ0 to eventual champions D.C. United. Alleged fan actions in the stadium that night led to a famous editorial piece, \\"What it means to be a part of the Fire family\\",[18] being penned by the club's Director of Communications, which was seen as an odd attack on the fan base and widely panned by local and national media. After a 12ÿ6ÿ6 finish to the season, the Fire narrowly missed the playoffs for the third time in the last four yearslosing out to the Montreal Impact on goal difference. On October 30, 2013, the club announced that the president of soccer operations Javier Leon and head coach Frank Klopas had stepped down,[19] but the Fire front office had a replacement one day later. On October 31, 2013 Chicago Fire named Frank Yallop as its new head coach and director of soccer.[20] On December 5, 2013, Fire MVP Mike Magee became the first Fire player to win the MLS MVP Awardbeating out Los Angeles Galaxy's Robbie Keane and Montreal Impact's Marco Di Vaio for the honor.[21][22][23]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Yallop was busy recruiting a new coaching staff which included \\"Ring of Fire\\" member and Chicago Fire veteran C. J. Brown and former U.S. International striker Clint Mathis as the team's assistant coaches, adding Columbus Crew's Brian Bliss as Technical Director. Former Fire forward Brian McBride was added as an assistant coach in May 2014 for a short-term assignment.[24][25][26][27] The shake-up extended to the roster, as Yallop moved team veterans and starters and brought in youth prospectsreforming the team while freeing up cap space. Major exits in early 2014 included Chris Rolfe,[28] Austin Berry,[29] Jalil Anibaba, Daniel Paladini, and Paolo Tornaghi. Filling that void was a handful of youth prospects including Harrison Shipp (homegrown player), Benji Joya (via MLS \\"weighted lottery\\"), and Grant Ward on loan from Tottenham Hotspur. Despite rarely looking like a team that could advance to the MLS Cup Playoffs, the team once again advanced to the semifinals of the 2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, but were routed 6ÿ0 by eventual champions Seattle Sounders FC on August 13. The result was the worst competitive defeat in club history and saw Frank Yallop issue an apology to Chicago Fire supporters on the club's official website.[30] As the Cup run had, the season ended in disappointment, with the Fire ending the season with a 6ÿ18ÿ10 record, with 18 draws, also setting a record for most draws in an MLS season in the process.\\r\\nThe club began 2015 with renewed hope, bringing three new Designated Player signings in David Accam, Shaun Maloney and Kennedy Igboananike to bolster an anemic attack. The club also signed products Michael Stephens and Eric Gehrig as well as Trinindad & Tobago international Joevin Jones. With so many new pieces needing to adjust, 2015 marked the first time in club history the side began the season with an 0ÿ3ÿ0 record, but they showed signs of recovery by winning their next three matches. Unfortunately, April was the last time the club would be anywhere near equal on wins and losses, but the side did still advance to another Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup semifinal. Playing in front of a sparse crowd at the Philadelphia Union's PPL Park, the Fire fell 1ÿ0 at the same hurdle for the third straight season. Less than two weeks later, Maloney, who was the club's center piece offseason signing, was transferred back to England with Hull City sighting personal reasons.[31]\\r\\nDespite no hope for a Cup final, widespread fan protests[32][33] and dim likelihood of a playoff berth, the club didn't part ways with Frank Yallop until September 20, 2015, one day after another listless 1ÿ0 home defeat to Orlando City SC.[34] Along with Yallop's departure, the club announced it had named long-time MLS executive Nelson Rodriguez as the club's new General Manager, with his first job being to commence a search for a new head coach. Technical director Brian Bliss was given the interim head coaching job, with former player and current club vice president Logan Pause assisting for the remaining five matches. The club has finished the 2015 season with an overall record of 8 wins, 20 losses and 6 ties. For the first time in the club's history Fire finished the season with zero road wins (0-12-5). Twenty losses in a season became the highest in the club's history.[35]\\r\\nOn November 18, 2015, Rodriguez made his first moves as GM, firing most of Yallop's remaining technical staff, including goalkeeping coach Aron Hyde, fitness coach Adrian Lamb and Director of Scouting Trevor James.[36] Rodriguez also parted ways with the club's long-time Director of First Team Operations Ron Stern, Equipment Manager Charles Raycroft and Assistant Equipment Manager Allan Araujo. On November 24, 2015, the club announced that Veljko Paunovic, former coach of the Serbian U-20 side that won the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup, had been named the new head coach of the Chicago Fire.[37] On January 5, 2016, technical director Brian Bliss also departed the Fire to join Sporting Kansas City as Director of Player Personnel, completing the total overhaul of the technical staff.[38]\\r\\nOn March 21, 2017 Manchester United allowed Bastian Schweinsteiger to join Chicago Fire, subject to a medical and a visa being secured.[39][40][41][42][43] The move from Manchester United was completed on March 29, 2017.[44]\\r\\nThe official club colors are red and white. Over its history, the Fire have also employed navy blue, sky blue, and black as alternate colors.\\r\\nThe Chicago Fire logo is derived from the standard shape of a fire department's crest (also shown by the Chicago Fire Department), also known as a Florian's cross. This style was chosen by the original general manager, Peter Wilt, to establish a timeless image evocative of both classic American sports (as in the logos of the NHL Original Six) and the traditions of European soccer.\\r\\nThe logo features a stylized 'C' at its heart (representing Chicago), similar to the logos of the Bears and Cubs. The six points in a ring around the center allude to the stars in the Municipal Flag of Chicago, specifically the one commemorating the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\\r\\nNike, the Fire's original equipment supplier, intended for the team to be named the Chicago Rhythm. The Rhythm identity featured a turquoise, black and green color scheme, and a logo adorned with a cobra. Team officials ignored Nike's work, and privately developed the Fire identity with the help of Adrenalin, Inc., a well-known sports-specific branding agency.[45][46]\\r\\nThe original Fire shirts were chosen because of their resemblance to a Chicago fireman's coat, featuring broad horizontal stripes across the torso and sleeves. In the first year, the home jersey was red and white with a silver \\"FIRE\\" on the stripe; while the away shirts were white and black in the same style. The jersey has remained remarkably constant ever since, continually maintaining the same format of an all-red shirt with a white horizontal chest stripe, even through changes in equipment sponsor (from Nike, to Puma, and currently adidas), until 2012 when the white stripe was exchanged for a blue stripe. Conversely, the Fire's secondary shirts have changed much over the years from white with black, to white with navy, to white with red, to all-white style and the all-blue currently used. Third shirts have often been yellow (originally to honor the Chicago Sting, later for the expired partnership with Morelia). A popular light blue third shirt was worn in 2005, based on the Municipal Flag of Chicago but was discontinued during the sponsorship change to Adidas the next year.\\r\\nThe club and their fans make frequent use of the symbols of Chicago, as a show of civic pride. Most prominent are the six-pointed Chicago stars, but the light blue color associated with the city, the municipal device, and the city skyline appear regularly on materials produced by the club and its fans. The municipal flag of Chicago is also favored by fans and often seen at the stadium, in a manner akin to the use of the flag of Catalonia by FC Barcelona fans but without a nationalist subtext.\\r\\nChicago plays its home games at Toyota Park, a soccer-specific stadium located at 71st Street and Harlem Avenue in the Chicago suburb of Bridgeview, Illinois, about 12 miles southwest from downtown Chicago. The stadium opened on June 11, 2006 and was developed at a cost of around $100 million. The Village of Bridgeview owns and operates Toyota Park.\\r\\nToyota Park will be renamed SeatGeek Stadium after the end of the 2018 season, with an estimated price between 2.5 million to 4 million per year.[48]\\r\\nFor its first years in the league the Fire played at Soldier Field, the 61,500-capacity home of the Chicago Bears of the NFL and one of the main venues of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. While that stadium was undergoing a $632 million renovation, the Fire played at Cardinal Stadium in Naperville, Illinois, on the outskirts of the Chicago metropolitan area. They returned to Soldier Field toward the end of 2003, remaining there through the end of 2005.\\r\\nThere is a noteworthy fan culture for the Fire, existing from the date the club was founded, and building on an enthusiasm throughout Chicago sports. At matches, supporters and ultras groups occupy a standing area directly behind the north goal, in the Harlem End of Toyota Park.[49] This area is referred to as Section 8, originating from the numbering of the corresponding section at Soldier Field and the American military designation of mentally unfit soldiers.[50] Section 8 Chicago, the Independent Supporters' Association (ISA) for the Fire, oversees the activities of these numerous groups.[51] While incorporating a worldwide variety of styles with a Chicago bent, groups as part of Section 8 generally fall under the ultras designation. Additionally, an associated spinoff group called \\"Sector Latino\\" congregates in the corner-kick Section 101 at the stadium's southwest end.[52] There are also several other affiliated ultras and supporters groups, including The Arsonists, Banter Buddies, Blitzer Mob, Husaria, Fire Ultras 98, Partisans, Red Scare, Second City North, The Western Front, Ultras Red-Side, and Whiskey Brothers Aught-Five. [53]The Section 8 Chicago ISA is a registered 501(c)7 non-profit organization run by volunteers through an elected board of directors.[54]\\r\\nMatch atmosphere is known for organized displays of stadium-wide support, particularly for matches of prime competitive importance. Call-and-response cheering amongst the crowd is commonplace.[55] Fans at Toyota Park for Fire matches periodically choreograph tifo presentations both to show their pride and inspire the players on the field.[56] Toyota Park remains one of the few American environments to conduct such fan-driven presentations on a large scale.\\r\\nTheir official mascot is Sparky, an anthropomorphic Dalmatian dog. Sparky is usually shown wearing the club's jersey but also arrives wearing firefighter attire.[57]\\r\\nWhile the Fire have heated rivalries with a number of different MLS teams, Fire supporters of different ages will likely give different responses as to who the club's main rival is. The earliest Fire supporters would list Brimstone Cup rival FC Dallas as the Fire's nemesis, or Los Angeles Galaxy following heated playoff and cup matches with Dallas and L.A. in the league's early years.\\r\\nAfter the Fire moved to the Eastern Conference, meetings with Dallas and LA became less frequent. Rivalries with D.C. United and New England Revolution were stoked following several thrilling playoff meetings. The Fire and Revolution are MLS' most frequent playoff matchup, meeting in the MLS Cup Playoffs 8 different times in 10 seasons from 2000 to 2009, splitting those encounters 4ÿ4, with the Fire winning in 2000, 2003, 2008, and 2009. New England ended the Fire's playoff runs in 2002, 2005, 2006, and 2007. Newer rivals include Columbus Crew, who are the closest MLS team geographically to the Fire, and New York Red Bulls following the departure of former Fire head coach Juan Carlos Osorio to New York in 2007.\\r\\nIn 2015, the Chicago Fire and NBC Sports Chicago (then Comcast SportsNet Chicago) agreed to a three-year deal, which includes 21 regular season and postseason matches for 2015.[58] Fire matches were televised locally on NBC Sports Chicago. Dan Kelly and former Fire coach Frank Klopas provided play-by-play and color commentary, respectively.[59] Matches were previously televised by NBC Chicago Nonstop and WPWR-TV.[60]\\r\\nIn 2016, the Chicago Fire and Tribune Broadcasting agreed to a three-year deal, which will see all regular season and postseason matches broadcast on WGN Radio and their internet-only sister station WGN Plus starting in the 2017 MLS season.\\r\\nOn March 9, 2018, the Chicago Fire announced that ESPN had acquired the regional television rights to the team through 2020, and that their regionally-televised matches will stream exclusively on ESPN's upcoming subscription service ESPN+. The team's matches would be streamed online for free until the launch of ESPN+ on April 12, 2018. Behind Los Angeles FC, the Fire are the second MLS franchise to sell their regional television rights exclusively to an over-the-top content provider (with the former having signed with YouTube TV).[61] ESPN+ also holds the out-of-market streaming rights for regional MLS matches as part of its overall service.[62][63][64]\\r\\nThe \\"Ring of Fire\\" was established in 2003 by Chicago Fire Soccer Club and the Chicago Fire Alumni Association as permanent tribute to honor those who have made the club proud and successful over its history.[66] Aside from the initial member Piotr Nowak, only \\"Ring of Fire\\" members can select new inductees, and no more than one can be selected any year. Names and numbers (if applicable) are prominently displayed inside Toyota Park.\\r\\nThere were no inductees in 2008, 2010, or 2011. In 2008, the members voted to honor two recently deceased fans (supporter leaders Dan Parry and Brandon Kitchens) but were overruled by the club chairman Andrew Hauptman.[67] Parry and Kitchens were later made members of the Wall of Honor, a special recognition for Fire fans. In addition to Parry and Kitchens, the late Fire fans Euan McLean and Al Hack have been inducted into the Wall of Honor as of 2011.[68] C.J. Brown was expected to be honored in 2011, but a new rule was established that inductees must have been away from the club for at least a calendar year.[69] Brown, at the time an assistant head coach at Real Salt Lake, was officially inducted at the halftime ceremony during the home game vs. Real Salt Lake in Toyota Park on May 9, 2012.[70][71]\\r\\nOn October 3, 2015, Ante Razov, the club's all-time leading scorer, became the eight individual to be inducted into the club's Ring of Fire Hall of Fame.[72] The ceremony took place on that day during the halftime of the regular season home match against New England Revolution.[73]\\r\\n?

Throughout history, political entities have expanded from basic systems of self-governance and monarchy to the complex democratic and totalitarian systems that exist today. In parallel, political systems have expanded from vaguely defined frontier-type boundaries, to the national definite boundaries existing today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn ancient history, civilizations did not have definite boundaries as states have today, and their borders could be more accurately described as frontiers. Early dynastic Sumer, and early dynastic Egypt were the first civilizations to define their borders. Moreover, for the past 200,000 years and up to the twentieth century, many people have lived in non-state societies. These range from relatively egalitarian bands and tribes to complex and highly stratified chiefdoms.\\r\\nThe first states of sorts were those of early dynastic Sumer and early dynastic Egypt, which arose from the Uruk period and Predynastic Egypt respectively at approximately 3000BCE.[1] Early dynastic Egypt was based around the Nile River in the north-east of Africa, the kingdom's boundaries being based around the Nile and stretching to areas where oases existed.[2] Early dynastic Sumer was located in southern Mesopotamia with its borders extending from the Persian Gulf to parts of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.[1]\\r\\nBy 2500 BCE the Indus Valley Civilization, located in modern-day India, Pakistan and Afghanistan had formed. The civilization's boundaries extended 600?km inland from the Arabian Sea.[3]\\r\\n336 BCE saw the rise of Alexander the Great, who forged an empire from various vassal states stretching from modern Greece to the Indian subcontinent, bringing Mediterranean nations into contact with those of central and southern Asia, much as the Persian Empire had before him. The boundaries of this empire extended hundreds of kilometers.[4]\\r\\nThe Roman Empire (27 BCE - 476 CE) was the first western civilization known to accurately define their borders, although these borders could be more accurately described as frontiers;[5] instead of the Empire defining its borders with precision, the borders were allowed to trail off and were, in many cases, part of territory indirectly ruled by others.[6]\\r\\nRoman and Greek ideals of nationhood can be seen to have strongly influenced Western views on the subject, with the basis of many governmental systems being on authority or ideas borrowed from Rome or the Greek city-states. Notably, the European states of the Dark Ages and Middle Ages gained their authority from the Roman Catholic religion, and modern democracies are based in part on the example of Ancient Athens.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen China entered the Sui Dynasty,[7] the government changed and expanded in its borders as the many separate bureaucracies unified under one banner.[8] This evolved into the Tang Dynasty when Li Yuan took control of China in 626.[9] By now, the Chinese borders had expanded from eastern China, up north into the Tang Empire.[10] The Tang Empire fell apart in 907 and split into ten regional kingdoms and five dynasties with vague borders.[11] Fifty-three years after the separation of the Tang Empire, China entered the Song Dynasty under the rule of Chao K'uang, although the borders of this country expanded, they were never as large as those of the Tang dynasty and were constantly being redefined due to attacks from the neighboring Tartar(Mongol) people known as the Khitan tribes.[12]\\r\\nAfter the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632, the Quran and the teachings of Islam inspired the genesis of a new civilization. In less than a century, the Islamic Caliphate rapidly extended its reach from the Atlantic Ocean and Andalusia in the west to Central Asia in the east. The subsequent Muslim empires of the Umayyads, Abbasids, Fatimids, Ghaznavids, Seljuqs, Safavids, Mughals, and Ottomans were among the most influential and distinguished powers in the world during Middle Ages. The period between the 8th and 13th century saw a flourishing of trade, as well as several advances in science, engineering, medecine and mathematics. In Western Europe, briefly mostly united into a single state under Charlemagne around 800CE, a few countries, including England, Scotland, Iceland and Norway, had already effectively become nation states by 1,000CE, with a kingdom (Commonwealth in Iceland's case) largely co-terminus with a people mostly sharing a language and culture.[citation needed]\\r\\nOver most of the continent, the peoples were emerging around ethnic, linguistic and geographical groups, but this was not reflected in political entities. In particular, France, Italy and Germany, though recognised by other nations as countries where the French, Italians and Germans lived, did not exist as states largely matching the countries for centuries, and struggles to form them, and define their borders, as states were a major cause of wars in Europe until the 20th century. In the course of this process, some countries, such as Poland under the Partitions and France in the High Middle Ages, almost ceased to exist as states for periods. The Low Countries, in the Middle Ages as distinct a country as France, became permanently divided, today into Belgium and the Netherlands. Spain was formed as a nation state by the dynastic union of small Christian kingdoms, augmented by the final campaigns of the Reconquista against Al-Andaluz, the vanished country of Islamic Iberia.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1299 CE,[13] the Aztec empire arose in lower Mexico, this empire lasted over 300 years and at their prime, held over 5,000[dubious ÿ discuss] square kilometers of land.[14][15]\\r\\n200 years after the Aztec and Toltec empires began, northern and central Asia saw the rise of the Mongol empire. By the late 13th century, the Empire extended across Europe and America, briefly creating a state capable of ruling and administrating immensely diverse cultures.[16] In 1299, the Ottomans entered the scene. These Turkish nomads took control of Asia Minor along with much of central Europe over a period of 370 years, providing what may be considered a long-lasting Islamic counterweight to Christendom.[17]\\r\\nExploiting opportunities left open by the Mongolian advance and recession as well as the spread of Islam, Russia took control of their homeland around 1613, after many years being dominated by the Tartars (Mongols). After gaining independence, the Russian princes began to expand their borders under the leadership of many tsars.[12] Notably, Catherine the Great seized the vast western part of Ukraine from the Poles, expanding Russia's size massively. Throughout the following centuries, Russia expanded rapidly, coming close to its modern size.[18]\\r\\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries three major Muslim empires formed: the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East, the Balkans and Northern Africa; the Safavid Empire in Greater Iran; and the Mughul Empire in South Asia. These imperial powers were made possible by the discovery and exploitation of gunpowder and more efficient administration. By the end of the 19th century, all three had declined, and by the early 20th century, with the Ottomans' defeat in World War I, the last Muslim empire collapsed.\\r\\nIn 1700, Charles II of Spain died, naming Phillip of Anjou, Louis XIV's grandson, his heir. Charles' decision was not well met by the British, who believed that Louis would use the opportunity to ally France and Spain and attempt to take over Europe. Britain formed the Grand Alliance with Holland, Austria and a majority of the German states and declared war against Spain in 1702. The War of the Spanish Succession lasted 11 years, and ended when the Treaty of Utrecht was signed in 1714.[19]\\r\\nLess than 50 years later, in 1740, war broke out again, sparked by the invasion of Silesia, part of Austria, by King Frederick II of Prussia. Britain, the Netherlands and Hungary supported Maria Theresa. Over the next eight years, these and other states participated in the War of the Austrian Succession, until a treaty was signed, allowing Prussia to keep Silesia.[20][21] The Seven Years' War began when Theresa dissolved her alliance with Britain and allied with France and Russia. In 1763, Britain won the war, claiming Canada and land east of the Mississippi. Prussia also kept Silesia.[22]\\r\\nInterest in the geography of the Southern Hemisphere began to increase in the 18th century.[23] In 1642, Dutch navigator Abel Tasman was commissioned to explore the Southern Hemisphere; during his voyages, Tasman discovered the island of Van Diemen's Land, which was later named Tasmania, the Australian coast, and New Zealand in 1644.[24] Captain James Cook was commissioned in 1768 to observe a solar eclipse in Tahiti and sailed into Stingray Harbor on Australia's east coast in 1770, claiming the land for the British Crown.[25] Settlements in Australia began in 1788 when Britain began to utilize the country for the deportation of convicts,[26] with the first free settles arriving in 1793.[27] Likewise New Zealand became a home for hunters seeking whales and seals in the 1790s with later non-commercial settlements by the Scottish in the 1820s and 30s.[28]\\r\\nIn Northern America, revolution was beginning when in 1770, British troops opened fire on a mob pelting them with stones, an event later known as the Boston Massacre.[29] British authorities were unable to determine if this event was a local one, or signs of something bigger[30] until, in 1775, Rebel forces confirmed their intentions by attacking British troops on Bunker Hill.[31] Shortly after, Massachusetts Second Continental Congress representative John Adams and his cousin Samuel Adams were part of a group calling for an American Declaration of Independence. The Congress ended without committing to a Declaration, but prepared for conflict by naming George Washington as the Continental Army Commander.[30] War broke out and lasted until 1783, when Britain signed the Treaty of Paris and recognized America's independence.[32] In 1788, the states ratified the United States Constitution, going from a confederation to a union[30] and in 1789, elected George Washington as the first President of the United States.[33]\\r\\nBy the late 1780s, France was falling into debt, with higher taxes introduced and famines ensuring.[34] As a measure of last resort, King Louis XVI called together the Estates-General in 1788 and reluctantly agreed to turn the Third Estate (which made up all of the non-noble and non-clergy French) into a National Assembly.[35] This assembly grew very popular in the public eye and on July 14, 1789, following evidence that the King planned to disband the Assembly,[34] an angry mob stormed the Bastille, taking gunpowder and lead shot.[35] Stories of the success of this raid spread all over the country and sparked multiple uprisings in which the lower-classes robbed granaries and manor houses.[34] In August of the same year, members of the National Assembly wrote the revolutionary document Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen which proclaimed freedom of speech, press and religion.[34] By 1792, other European states were attempting to quell the revolution. In the same year Austrian and German armies attempted to march on Paris, but the French repelled them. Building on fears of European invasion, a radical group known as the Jacobins abolished the monarchy and executed King Louis for treason in 1793. In response to this radical uprising, Britain, Spain and the Netherlands join in the fight with the Jacobins until the Reign of Terror was brought to an end in 1794 with the execution of a Jacobin leader, Maximilien Robespierre. A new constitution was adopted in 1795 with some calm returning, although the country was still at war. In 1799, a group of politicians led by Napoleon Bonaparte unseated leaders of the Directory.[35]","input":"When was the first form of government created?"},{"output":"AD 285","context":"In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing de facto independent entities; however, at no point did the Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court.\\r\\nThe Western Roman Empire existed intermittently in several periods between the 3rd and 5th centuries, after Diocletian's Tetrarchy and the reunifications associated with Constantine the Great and Julian the Apostate (331/2ÿ363). Theodosius I divided the Empire upon his death (in 395) between his two sons. Finally, eighty-five years later, Zeno of the Eastern Empire recognized the reality of the Western Empire's reduced domainRoman power ceased to exist even in the Italian Peninsulaafter the deposition of Romulus Augustus and the subsequent death of Julius Nepos, and therefore proclaimed himself the sole emperor of the Roman Empire.\\r\\nThe rise of Odoacer of the Foederati to rule over Italy in 476 was popularized by eighteenth-century historian Edward Gibbon as a demarcating event for the end of the Western Empire and is sometimes used to mark the transition from Antiquity to the Middle Ages. Imperial rule was reimposed in large parts of the West in the sixth century by the armies of the Eastern Roman Empire but political upheaval in the East Roman heartlands saw the Western provinces slip away once more, this time for good. Frankish king Charlemagne would be declared in AD 800 in an attempt to revive the Western Roman Empire; this new imperial line would evolve in time into the Holy Roman Empire, which revived the imperial title but was otherwise in no meaningful sense an extension of Roman traditions or institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Roman Republic expanded, it reached a point where the central government in Rome could not effectively rule the distant provinces. Communications and transportation were especially problematic given the vast extent of the Empire. News of invasion, revolt, natural disasters, or epidemic outbreak was carried by ship or mounted postal service, often requiring much time to reach Rome and for Rome's orders to be realized in the province of origin. For this reason, provincial governors had de facto rule in the name of the Roman Republic.\\r\\nPrior to the establishment of the Empire, the territories of the Roman Republic had been divided in 43 BC among the members of the Second Triumvirate: Mark Antony, Octavian and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Antony received the provinces in the East: Achaea, Macedonia and Epirus (roughly modern Greece, Albania and the coast of Croatia), Bithynia, Pontus and Asia (roughly modern Turkey), Syria, Cyprus, and Cyrenaica. These lands had previously been conquered by Alexander the Great; thus, much of the aristocracy was of Greek origin. The whole region, especially the major cities, had been largely assimilated into Greek culture, Greek often serving as the lingua franca.\\r\\nOctavian obtained the Roman provinces of the West: Italia (modern Italy), Gaul (modern France), Gallia Belgica (parts of modern Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg), and Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal). These lands also included Greek and Carthaginian colonies in the coastal areas, though Celtic tribes such as Gauls and Celtiberians were culturally dominant. Lepidus received the minor province of Africa (roughly modern Tunisia). Octavian soon took Africa from Lepidus, while adding Sicilia (modern Sicily) to his holdings.\\r\\nUpon the defeat of Mark Antony, a victorious Octavian controlled a united Roman Empire. While the Roman Empire featured many distinct cultures, all were often said to experience gradual Romanization. While the predominantly Greek culture of the East and the predominantly Latin culture of the West functioned effectively as an integrated whole, political and military developments would ultimately realign the Empire along those cultural and linguistic lines.\\r\\nMinor rebellions and uprisings were fairly common events throughout the Empire. Conquered tribes or cities would revolt, and the legions would be detached to crush the rebellion. While this process was simple in peacetime, it could be considerably more complicated in wartime, as for example in the Great Jewish Revolt.\\r\\nIn a full-blown military campaign, the legions, under generals such as Vespasian, were far more numerous. To ensure a commander's loyalty, a pragmatic emperor might hold some members of the general's family hostage. To this end, Nero effectively held Domitian and Quintus Petillius Cerialis, governor of Ostia, who were respectively the younger son and brother-in-law of Vespasian. The rule of Nero ended only with the revolt of the Praetorian Guard, who had been bribed in the name of Galba. The Praetorian Guard, a figurative \\"sword of Damocles\\", were often perceived as being of dubious loyalty. Following their example, the legions at the borders increased participation in the civil wars.\\r\\nThe main enemy in the West was arguably the Germanic tribes behind the rivers Rhine and Danube. Augustus had tried to conquer them but ultimately pulled back after the Teutoburg reversal.\\r\\nThe Parthian Empire, in the East, on the other hand, was too remote and powerful to be conquered. Any Parthian invasion was confronted and usually defeated; similarly, Parthians repelled some attempts of Roman invasion, however, even after successful wars of conquest, such as those implemented by Trajan and Septimius Severus. Those distant territories were forsaken to prevent unrest and also to ensure a more healthy and lasting peace with the Persians. The Parthians were followed by the Sasanian Empire, which continued hostilities with the Roman Empire.\\r\\nControlling the western border of Rome was reasonably easy because it was relatively close and also because of the disunity between the Germanic foes, however, controlling both frontiers altogether during wartime was difficult. If the emperor was near the border in the East, chances were high that an ambitious general would rebel in the West and vice versa. This wartime opportunism plagued many ruling emperors and indeed paved the road to power for several future emperors.\\r\\nRome and the Italian peninsula began to experience an economic slowdown as industries and money began to move outward. By the beginning of the 2nd century AD, the economic stagnation of Italia was seen in the provincial-born Emperors, such as Trajan and Hadrian. Economic problems increased in strength and frequency.[citation needed]\\r\\nStarting on 18 March 235, with the assassination of the Emperor Alexander Severus, the Roman Empire sank into a 50-year civil war, now known as the Crisis of the Third Century. The rise of the bellicose Sassanid dynasty in Parthia posed a major threat to Rome in the east. Demonstrating the increased danger, Emperor Valerian was captured by Shapur I in 259. His eldest son and heir-apparent, Gallienus, succeeded and took up the fight on the eastern frontier. Gallienus' son, Saloninus, and the Praetorian Prefect Silvanus were residing in Colonia Agrippina (modern Cologne) to solidify the loyalty of the local legions. Nevertheless, Marcus Cassianius Latinius Postumus - the local governor of the German provinces? rebelled; his assault on Colonia Agrippina resulted in the deaths of Saloninus and the prefect. In the confusion that followed, an independent state known as the Gallic Empire emerged.\\r\\nIts capital was Augusta Treverorum (modern Trier), and it quickly expanded its control over the German and Gaulish provinces and over all of Hispania and Britannia. It had its own senate, and a partial list of its consuls still survives. It maintained Roman religion, language, and culture, and was far more concerned with fighting the Germanic tribes than other Romans. However, in the reign of Claudius Gothicus (268 to 270), large expanses of the Gallic Empire were restored to Roman rule. At roughly the same time, several eastern provinces seceded under the Palmyrene Empire, under the rule of Queen Zenobia.\\r\\nIn 272, Emperor Aurelian finally managed to reclaim Palmyra and its territory for the empire. With the East secure, his attention was turned to the West, taking the Gallic Empire a year later. Because of a secret deal between Aurelian and Gallic Emperor Tetricus I and his son Tetricus II, the Gallic army was swiftly defeated. In exchange, Aurelian spared their lives and gave the two former rebels important positions in Italy.\\r\\nThe external borders were mostly stable for the remainder of the Crisis of the Third Century, although, between the death of Aurelian in 275 and the accession of Diocletian ten years later, at least eight emperors or would-be emperors were killed, many assassinated by their own troops.\\r\\nUnder Diocletian, the political division of the Roman Empire began. In 285, he promoted Maximian to the rank of Augustus (Emperor) and gave him control of the Western regions of the Empire. In 293, Galerius and Constantius Chlorus were appointed as their subordinates (Caesars), creating the First Tetrarchy. This system effectively divided the Empire into four major regions and created separate capitals besides Rome as a way to avoid the civil unrest that had marked the 3rd century. In the West, the capitals were Maximian's Mediolanum (now Milan) and Constantius' Trier. In the East, the capitals were Sirmium and Nicomedia. On 1 May 305, the two senior Augusti stepped down, and their respective Caesars were promoted to Augusti and appointed two new Caesars, thus creating the Second Tetrarchy.\\r\\nThe system of the Tetrarchy quickly ran aground when the Western Roman Empire's Constantius died unexpectedly in 306, and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed Augustus of the West by the legions in Britain. A crisis followed as several claimants attempted to rule the Western half. In 308, the Augustus of the East, Galerius, arranged a conference at Carnuntum which revived the Tetrarchy by dividing the West between Constantine and a newcomer named Licinius. Constantine was far more interested in conquering the whole empire. Through a series of battles in the East and the West, Licinius and Constantine stabilized their respective parts of the Roman Empire by 314, and began to compete for sole control of a reunified state. Constantine emerged victorious in 324 after the surrender and murder of Licinius following the Battle of Chrysopolis.\\r\\nThe Tetrarchy ended, but the idea of dividing the Roman Empire between two emperors had been validated. Very strong emperors would reunite it under their single rule, but with their death the Roman Empire would be divided again and again between the East and the West.\\r\\nConstantius was born in 317 at Sirmium, Pannonia. He was the third son of Constantine the Great, and second by his second wife Fausta, the daughter of Maximian. Constantius was made Caesar by his father on 13 November 324.[2] The Roman Empire was under the rule of a single Emperor, but, with the death of Constantine in 337, civil war erupted among his three sons, dividing the Empire into three parts. The West was unified in 340 under Constans, who was assassinated in 350 under the order of the usurper Magnentius; after Magnentius lost the Battle of Mursa Major and committed suicide, a complete reunification of the whole Empire occurred in 353, with Constantius II.\\r\\nConstantius II focused most of his power in the East and is regarded as the first emperor of the Byzantine Empire. Under his rule, the city of Byzantium - only recently re-founded as Constantinople - was fully developed as a capital. In 361, Constantius II became ill and died, and Constantius Chlorus' grandson Julian, who had served as Constantius II's Caesar, assumed power. Julian was killed in 363 in the Battle of Samarra against the Persian Empire and was succeeded by Jovian, who ruled only until 364.\\r\\nFollowing the death of Jovian, Valentinian I emerged as Emperor in 364. He immediately divided the Empire once again, giving the eastern half to his brother Valens. Stability was not achieved for long in either half, as the conflicts with outside forces (tribes) intensified. In 376, the Visigoths, fleeing before the Ostrogoths, who in turn were fleeing before the Huns, were allowed to cross the river Danube and settle into the Balkans by the Eastern government. Mistreatment caused a full-scale rebellion, and in 378 they inflicted a crippling defeat on the Eastern Roman field army in the Battle of Adrianople, in which Valens also died. The campaigns to subdue them were only partly successful, and they officially became semi-independent foederati under their own leaders.\\r\\nMore than in the East, there was also opposition to the Christianizing policy of the Emperors in the western half of the Empire. In 379, Valentinian I's son and successor Gratian declined to wear the mantle of Pontifex Maximus, and in 382 he rescinded the rights of pagan priests and removed the Altar of Victory from the Roman Curia, a decision which caused dissatisfaction among the traditionally pagan aristocracy of Rome. Theodosius I later decreed a ban on all religions except Christianity.\\r\\nThe political situation was unstable. In 383, a powerful and popular general named Magnus Maximus seized power in the West and forced Gratian's half-brother Valentinian II to flee to the East for aid; in a destructive civil war, the Eastern Emperor Theodosius I restored him to power. In 392, the Frankish and pagan magister militum Arbogast assassinated Valentinian II and proclaimed an obscure senator named Eugenius as Emperor. In 394 the forces of the two halves of the Empire again clashed with great loss of life. Again Theodosius I won, and he briefly ruled a united Empire until his death in 395. He was the last Emperor to rule both parts of the Roman Empire; his older son Arcadius inherited the eastern half while the younger Honorius got the western half. Both were still minors and neither was capable of ruling effectively. Honorius was placed under the tutelage of the half-Roman/half-barbarian magister militum Flavius Stilicho while Rufinus became the power behind the throne in the east. Rufinus and Stilicho were rivals, and their disagreements were exploited by the Gothic leader Alaric I who again rebelled following the death of Theodosius I. Neither half of the Empire could raise forces sufficient even to subdue Alaric's men, and both tried to use Alaric against the other half. Alaric himself tried to establish a long-term territorial and official base, but was never able to do so.\\r\\nStilicho tried to defend Italy and bring the invading Goths under control, but to do so he stripped the Rhine frontier of troops and the Vandals, Alans, and Suevi invaded Gaul in large numbers. Stilicho became a victim of court intrigues and was killed in 408. While the East began a slow recovery and consolidation, the West began to collapse entirely. Alaric's men sacked Rome in 410.\\r\\nThe West, less urbanized with a spread-out populace, may have experienced an economic decline throughout the Late Empire in some provinces. Southern Italy, northern Gaul (except for large towns and cities) to some extent Spain and the Danubian areas may have suffered. The East was not so destitute, especially as Emperors like Constantine the Great and Constantius II had invested heavily in the eastern economy. As a result, the Eastern Empire could afford large numbers of professional soldiers and augment them with mercenaries, while the Western Roman Empire could not afford this to the same extent. Even in major defeats, the East could, certainly not without difficulties, buy off its enemies with a ransom.\\r\\nThe political, economic and military control of the Eastern Empire's resources remained safe in Constantinople, which was well fortified and located at the crossroads of several major trade and military routes. In contrast, the Western Empire was more fragmented. Its capital was transferred to Ravenna in 402 largely for defensive reasons, and it had easy access to the imperial fleet of the Eastern Empire but was isolated in other aspects as it was surrounded by swamps and marshes. The economic power remained focused on Rome and its hyper-rich senatorial aristocracy which dominated much of Italy and Africa in particular. After Gallienus banned senators from army commands in the mid-3rd century, the senatorial elite lost all experience ofand interest inmilitary life. In the early 5th century the wealthy landowning elite of the Roman Senate largely barred its tenants from military service, but it also refused to approve sufficient funding for maintaining a sufficiently powerful mercenary army to defend the entire Western Empire. The West's most important military area had been northern Gaul and the Rhine frontier in the 4th century, when Trier frequently served as the capital of the Empire and many leading Western generals were Barbarians. After the civil war in 394 between Theodosius I and Eugenius, the new Western government installed by Theodosius I increasingly had to divert military resources from Britain and the Rhine to protect Italy. This, in turn, led to further rebellions and civil wars because the Western imperial government was not providing the military protection the northern provinces expected and needed against the barbarians.\\r\\nThe Western Empire's resources were much limited, and the lack of available manpower forced the government to rely ever more on confederate barbarian troops operating under their own commanders, where the Western Empire would often have difficulties paying. In certain cases deals were struck with the leaders of barbaric mercenaries rewarding them with land, which led to the Empire's decline as less land meant there would be less tax revenue to support the military.\\r\\nAs the central power weakened, the State gradually lost control of its borders and provinces, as well as control over the Mediterranean Sea. Roman Emperors tried to maintain control of the sea, but, once the Vandals conquered North Africa, imperial authorities had to cover too much ground with too few resources. The loss of the African provinces might have been the worse reversal on the West's fortunes, since they were among its wealthiest territories and supplied the essential grain imports to Italy. In many places, the Roman institutions collapsed along with the economic stability. In some regions, such as Gaul and Italy, the settlement of barbarians on former Roman lands seems to have caused relatively little disruption.\\r\\nRemaining as emperor after the death of Stilicho in 408, Honorius reigned until his own death in 423. His reign was filled with usurpations and invasions. In 410, Rome was sacked by Alaric's forces. This event made a great impression on contemporaries, as this was the first time since the Gallic invasions of the 4th century BC that the city had fallen to a foreign enemy. Under Alaric's successors, the Goths then settled in Gaul (412ÿ418), from where they operated as Roman allies against the Vandals, Alans, and Suevi in Spain, and against the usurper Jovinus (413). Meanwhile, another usurper, Constantine (406ÿ411), had stripped Roman Britain of its defenses when he crossed over to Gaul in 407, leaving the Romanized population subject to invasions, first by the Picts and then by the Saxons, Angli, and the Jutes who began to settle permanently from about 440 onwards.\\r\\nHonorius' death in 423 was followed by turmoil until the Eastern Roman government with the force of arms installed Valentinian III as Western Emperor in Ravenna, with Galla Placidia acting as regent during her son's minority. After a violent struggle with several rivals, and against Placidia's wish, Aetius rose to the rank of magister militum. Aetius was able to stabilize the Western Empire's military situation somewhat, relying heavily on his Hunnic allies. With their help, he defeated the Burgundians, who had occupied part of southern Gaul after 407, and settled them in Savoy as Roman allies (433). Later that century, as Roman power faded away, the Burgundians extended their rule to the Rhone valley.\\r\\nMeanwhile, pressure from the Visigoths and a rebellion by Bonifacius, the governor of Africa, induced the Vandals under their king Gaiseric to cross over from Spain in 429. They temporarily halted in Numidia (435) before moving eastward and capturing Carthage, from where they established an independent state with a powerful navy (439). The Vandal fleet became a constant danger to Roman sea trade and the coasts and islands of the western and central Mediterranean.\\r\\nIn 444, the Huns, who had been employed as Roman allies by Aetius, were united under their ambitious king Attila. Turning against their former ally, the Huns became a formidable threat to the Empire. Attila then received a plea for help and the ring of Honoria, the Emperor's sister. Threatening war, he claimed half of the Western Empire's territory as his dowry.\\r\\nFaced with refusal, he invaded Gaul and was only stopped in the battle of the Catalaunian Plains by a combined Roman-Germanic army led by Aetius. The next year, Attila invaded Italy and proceeded to march upon Rome, but an outbreak of disease in his army, Pope Leo's plea for peace, and reports of a campaign of Marcianus directed at his headquarters in Pannonia induced him to halt this campaign. Attila unexpectedly died a year later (453).\\r\\nAetius was slain in 454 by Valentinian, who was then himself murdered by the dead general's supporters a year later. With the end of the Theodosian dynasty, a new period of dynastic struggle ensued. The Vandals took advantage of the unrest and sailed up to Rome, which they plundered in 455.\\r\\nThe instability caused by usurpers throughout the Western Empire helped these tribes in their conquests, and by the 450s the Germanic tribes had become usurpers themselves. During the next twenty years, several Western Emperors were installed by Constantinople, but their authority relied upon barbarian commanders (Ricimer (456ÿ472), Gundobad (473ÿ475)). Majorian was the last emperor to campaign in Gaul and Spain in 458-460 before being deposed and murdered by Ricimer. From the 460s onwards, imperial control was effectively restricted to Italy and southern Gaul as the remaining Western provinces refused to accept Ricimer's appointment of Libius Severus in 461.\\r\\nIn 475, Orestes, a former secretary of Attila, drove Emperor Julius Nepos out of Ravenna and proclaimed his own son Romulus Augustus as emperor. In 476, Orestes refused to grant Odoacer and the Heruli federated status, prompting an invasion. Orestes was killed and Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustus, installed himself as ruler over Italy and sent the Imperial insignia to Constantinople. Although isolated pockets of Roman rule continued even after 476, the city of Rome itself was under the rule of the barbarians, and the control of Rome over the West had effectively ended.\\r\\nThree rump states continued under Roman rule in some form or another after 476: Julius Nepos controlled Dalmatia until his murder in 480. Syagrius ruled the Domain of Soissons until his murder in 487. Lastly, a Roman-Moor realm survived in north Africa, resisting Vandal incursions, and becoming a part of the Eastern Roman Empire c.533 when Belisarius defeated the Vandals.\\r\\nBy convention, the Western Roman Empire is deemed to have ended on 4 September 476, when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus, but the historical record calls this determination into question.\\r\\nJulius Nepos still claimed to be Emperor of the West, and ruled a rump state in Dalmatia. He was recognized as such by Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno and by Syagrius, who had managed to preserve Roman sovereignty in an exclave in northern Gaul, known today as the Domain of Soissons.\\r\\nOdoacer proclaimed himself ruler of Italy and began to negotiate with Zeno. Zeno eventually granted Odoacer patrician status as recognition of his authority and accepted him as his own viceroy of Italy. Zeno, however, insisted that Odoacer had to pay homage to Julius Nepos as the Emperor of the Western Empire. Odoacer accepted this condition and issued coins in the name of Julius Nepos throughout Italy. This, however, was mainly an empty political gesture, as Odoacer never returned any real power or territories to Julius Nepos. The murder of Julius Nepos in 480 prompted Odoacer to invade Dalmatia, annexing it to his Kingdom of Italy.\\r\\nRecognising that no direct roman control remained over the territories legally governed by the western emperor, Zeno did not appoint a new western emperor after the death of Julius Nepos. Instead Zeno abolished the juridical division of the position of emperor into two separate courts, declaring himself the sole emperor of a reunited roman empire. As such, the (eastern) roman emperors after 480 are the successors of the western ones, albeit only in a juridical sense.[3]\\r\\nIn the context of the Western Roman Empire, the term \\"barbarian kingdoms\\" most often refers to the germanic kingdoms that sprung from the formerly western roman territory. Their beginnings, together with the end of the Western Roman Empire, marks the transition from Late Antiquity to the Middle Ages. The barbarian kingdoms gradually replaced the old roman system, specifically in the praetorian prefectures of Gaul and Italy, during the sixth and seventh centuries.[4]\\r\\nAmong the more powerful and important kingdoms were the frankish kingdom (which would go on to develop into the Carolingian Empire and later France and the Holy Roman Empire), the visigothic kingdom, the ostrogothic kingdom of italy and the vandalic kingdom. The vandalic and ostrogothic kingdoms were reconquered by the Roman Empire under emperor Justinian in the sixth century and the visigothic kingdom was conquered during the spread of Islam in the eighth century.\\r\\nThese kingdoms were originally foederati, polities created to utilize germanic warriors in exchange for allowing them to settle within the borders of the empire, and were nominally vassals or client states to the western roman emperor. Even after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, they considered themselves vassals (at least nominally) to the roman emperor in Constantinople. Among other things, the barbarian kings continued to strike coins in the name of the roman emperor, rather than in their own names, as late as the sixth century.[5] The relations between the romans in the east and the barbarian kingdoms were not necessarily bad. For instance, the frankish king Clovis was granted the title of consul by emperor Anastasius after defeating the visigoths in the Battle of Vouill in 507.[6]\\r\\nThe relations between the barbarian kingdoms and the Byzantine Empire grew weaker over time and appear to have been gone by the seventh and eighth centuries when the kingdoms adopted the feudalism characteristic of the european middle ages.\\r\\nOdoacer was replaced by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, in 493. Theoderic had been ordered by emperor Zeno, as his subservient, to deal with Odoacer and was granted the title of \\"dux\\" of Italy after defeating Odoacer. While in principle Theodoric was a subordinate, a viceroy of the Emperor of the East, in fact he was his equal as a de facto independent monarch.\\r\\nFollowing Theodoric's death in 526, the Western half of the Empire was now fully controlled by Germanic tribes (though many of them continued to recognize Roman law and made claims to continuity), while the Eastern half had established itself under the Justinian dynasty. While the East would make some attempts to recapture the West, the territory once ruled by the western court was never fully recaptured.\\r\\nThroughout Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire, or the Byzantine Empire, laid claims on areas of the West which had been occupied by several tribes. In the 6th century, the Eastern Roman Empire managed to reconquer large areas of the former Western Roman Empire. The most successful were the campaigns of the generals Belisarius and Narses on behalf of the Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I from 533 to 554. The Vandal-occupied former Roman territory in North Africa was regained, particularly the territory centered around the city of Carthage. Less than a year later, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Dalmatia, and the Balearic Islands were easily captured by the invading Roman legions. The campaign eventually moved into Italy and the Byzantines reconquered it completely. Minor territories were taken as far west as the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Only three years after Justinian had died, the Lombards had invaded Italy, but the wealthiest parts of the province remained securely in Roman hands throughout the seventh century.[7]\\r\\nAlthough some eastern emperors occasionally attempted to campaign in the West, none were as successful as Justinian. After 600, events conspired to drive the Western provinces out of Constantinople's control, with imperial attention focused on the pressing issues of war with Sasanian Persia and then the rise of Arab power. For a while, the West remained important, with the Emperor Constans II ruling from Sicily a Roman Empire that still stretched from North Africa to the Caucasus in the 660s, but thereafter imperial attention declined rapidly, with Constantinople itself being besieged in the 670s, renewed war with the Arabs in the 680s, and then a period of chaos between 695 and 717, during which time Africa was finally lost to the Romans once and for all. The Emperor Leo III restored order, but his doctrinal reforms, known as the Iconoclastic Controversy, proved extremely unpopular in the West, and led to the final breakdown in imperial rule over Rome itself.\\r\\nByzantine rule continued in Sicily throughout the eighth century, with the island slowly being overrun by the Arabs over the course of the ninth century. In Italy, a few strongholds in Calabria ultimately provided a base for modest imperial expansion, which reached its peak in the early eleventh century, with most of southern Italy under \\"Roman\\" rule of a sort. This, however, was undone by further Byzantine civil war, and the slow conquest of the region by the Byzantines' former mercenaries, the Normans, who finally put an end to imperial rule in Western Europe in 1071.\\r\\nAs the Western Roman Empire crumbled, the new Germanic rulers who conquered the provinces upheld many Roman laws and traditions. Many of the invading Germanic tribes were already Christianized, although most were followers of Arianism. They quickly converted to official imperial Christianity, gaining more loyalty from the local Roman populations, as well as the recognition and support of the powerful Bishop of Rome. Although they initially continued to recognize indigenous tribal laws, they were more influenced by Roman Law and gradually incorporated it as well.\\r\\nRoman Law, particularly the Corpus Juris Civilis collected by order of Justinian I, is the ancient basis on which the modern Civil law stands. In contrast, Common law is based on the Germanic Anglo-Saxon law.\\r\\nLatin as a language never really disappeared. It combined with neighboring Germanic and Celtic languages, giving rise to many modern Romance languages such as Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian and a large number of minor languages and dialects. Today, more than 900 million people are native speakers worldwide.\\r\\nLatin also influenced Germanic languages such as English, German, and Dutch; all surviving Celtic languages, Albanian, and such Slavic languages as Polish and Czech, and even the non-Indo-European Hungarian. It survives in its \\"purer\\" form as the language of the Catholic Church (the Mass was spoken exclusively in Latin until 1969), and was used as a lingua franca between many nations. It remained the language of medicine, law, diplomacy (most treaties were written in Latin), of intellectuals and scholarship.\\r\\nThe Latin alphabet was expanded due to the splits of I into I and J and of U into U, V, and in places (especially Germanic languages and Polish) W; it is the most widely used alphabetic writing system in the world today. Roman numerals continue to be used, but were mostly replaced by Arabic numerals.\\r\\nA very visible legacy of the Western Roman Empire is the Roman Catholic Church. The Church slowly began to replace Roman institutions in the West, even helping to negotiate the safety of Rome during the late 5th century. In many cases the only source of law and civil administration was the local bishop, often himself a former governor like St. Ambrose of Milan and St. Germanus of Auxerre. As Rome was invaded by Germanic tribes, many assimilated, and by the middle of the medieval period (c. 9th and 10th centuries) the central, western, and northern parts of Europe had been largely converted to Roman Catholicism and acknowledged the Pope as the Vicar of Christ. The pope has consistently held the title of \\"Pontifex Maximus\\" since before the fall of the Western Roman Empire and retains it to this day, this title was formerly used by the high priest of the old roman polytheism.\\r\\nThough gone in modern times, the roman senate survived the intial collapse of the Western Roman Empire. Its authority even seems to have increased under the rule of Italy by Odoacer and later the Ostrogoths, evident by that the senate in 498 managed to install Symmachus as pope despite both Theoderic of Italy and emperor Anastasius supporting the other candidate, Laurentius.[8] When exactly the senate disappeared is unclear, it is known that the institution remained into the sixth century as gifts from the senate were received by emperor Tiberius II in 578 and 580 in hope of aid against the invading Lombards. The traditional senate building, Curia Julia, was rebuilt into a church under pope Honorius I in 630, probably with permission from the eastern emperor Heraclius.[9]\\r\\nThough abolished, the idea of splitting the imperial court into two to more effectively govern the territory of the empire remained as an idea in the east. The earliest attempt at crowning a new western emperor occurred during the gothic wars under emperor Justinian I. Belisarius, an accomplished general that had already successfully campaigned to restore roman control over North Africa and large parts of Italy (including Rome itself), was offered the position of Western Roman Emperor by the ostrogoths during his siege of Ravenna (the ostrogothic, and previously western roman, capital) in 540. The ostrogoths made the offer to avoid losing their control of Italy by offering the title and fealty to Belisarius. Belisarius feigned to accept to enter the city, whereupon he immediately relinquished the title. Despite Belisarius relinquishing the title, the offer had made Justinian suspicious and Belisarius was ordered to return east.[10]\\r\\nAt the end of emperor Tiberius II's reign in 582, the byzantine empire retained control over relatively large parts of the regions reconquered under Justinian. Tiberius chose two Caesares, the general Maurice and the governor Germanus, and married his two daughters to them. Germanus had clear connections to the western provinces, and Maurice to the eastern provinces. It is possible that Tiberius had planned to divide the empire into western and eastern administrative units once more[11], but if those plans existed they were never realized. At the death of Tiberius, Maurice inherited the entire empire as Germanus had refused the throne.[12]\\r\\nThe ideal of the Roman Empire as a mighty Christian Empire with a single ruler further continued to appeal to many powerful rulers in western Europe. Under the principle of translatio imperii, the Holy Roman Empire explicitly proclaimed itself as the continuation of the Western Roman Empire. The title of the Western Roman Emperor was revived when Charlemagne, King of the Franks and Lombards, was crowned as Emperor of the Romans of the West by Pope Leo III in 800. The emperors of the Carolingian and Holy Roman empires were never recognised as \\"Roman Emperors\\" by the Eastern Roman Emperors, who were in direct succession to the ancient Roman Emperors. Charlemagne's position as \\"Emperor\\" was recognised by the byzantine emperor Michael I in the early 800s, but he reserved the title of \\"Roman Emperor\\" for himself. The Holy Roman Empire continued to regard itself as the successor state of the Western Roman Empire until its downfall in 1806. The French King Louis XIV, as well as French Emperor Napoleon I, and the Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, among others, also tried to resurrect the Empire, albeit unsuccessfully.\\r\\nAugusti are shown with their Caesares and regents further indented\\r\\nFlavius Orestes was killed by revolting Germanic mercenaries.

They move into a restored mansion, unaware that the house is haunted by the ghosts of its former residents and their victims.\\r\\nThe first season of American Horror Story received generally positive reviews from critics. The series drew consistently high ratings for the FX network, ending its first season as the biggest new cable series of the year. The season was nominated for various industry awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series ÿ Drama, and received a total of seventeen Emmy Award nominations. In addition, Lange won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series, and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season follows the Harmon family: Ben (Dylan McDermott), Vivien (Connie Britton) and Violet (Taissa Farmiga), who move from Boston to Los Angeles to start a new life in a Victorian mansion, after Vivien has a miscarriage and Ben has an affair with Hayden (Kate Mara), one of his students. On arrival, they learn from Marcy (Christine Estabrook), the real estate agent, that the previous owners of their new mansion, a couple named Chad and Patrick (Zachary Quinto and Teddy Sears), died in an apparent murder/suicide. Their neighbor Constance (Jessica Lange) and her daughter Addie (Jamie Brewer) become frequent, and mostly unwelcome, guests. Addie seems to have a connection with the house's mysterious past. Larry Harvey (Denis O'Hare), a former resident of the house who has suffered from terrible burns, also begins inserting himself into the Harmons' lives, giving Ben a cryptic warning about the house. The house also \\"comes with\\" Moira O'Hara (Frances Conroy/Alexandra Breckenridge), a housekeeper who appears young and seductive to men, but old and matronly to women.\\r\\nBen begins seeing patients out of his home office. One in particular, a possibly psychotic teenage boy named Tate Langdon (Evan Peters), takes interest in kindred spirit Violet, who suffers from depression. Ben is unaware that Tate is both a ghost and the son of Constance. As the family settles into the home, bizarre events begin to occur with increasing regularity. It is soon revealed that there have been upwards of 20 violent deaths in the home over the course of its history, so much so that it has come to be known as \\"The Murder House\\". The family struggles with their own personal tribulations, oblivious to the reality that their home is haunted by ghosts. While exploring the attic, Vivien discovers a latex bondage suit. She later is raped by a man wearing it, who she believes is Ben, but is actually Tate. Vivien's rape results in the rare occurrence of becoming pregnant with twins by different fathers. It is later revealed that Tate's motive in having sex with Vivien was to conceive a baby for Nora (Lily Rabe), a ghost in the house who lost her own child. Hayden comes from Boston and tries to blackmail Ben into abandoning Vivien, so they can start their relationship over, threatening to tell Vivien that she's pregnant with Ben's baby. She is killed by Larry and buried by Ben in the house grounds, thus coming back as a ghost. Several ghosts in the house, including Hayden and Nora, conspire to drive Vivien mad so that they can raise the babies as their own.\\r\\nOn Halloween, the one day in which the dead can walk among the living, Violet learns that Tate is an infamous school shooter, who killed a library full of his classmates (as well as crippling a teacher and setting Larry Harvey on fire) to punish his mother Constance for having Tate's younger (and deformed) brother smothered to death. Addie is run over by a car, and Constance fails to get her corpse to the Harmon's property in time to imprison her spirit so that she can be reunited with her brother's ghost. Vivien, meanwhile, learns from the \\"Murder House Tour\\" that the house was the home of a back alley abortionist and that the still-living monster in the basement of the house is the creation of the doctor, whose son was killed by a patient's vengeful boyfriend, dismembered and resurrected as the monstrous \\"Infantata\\".\\r\\nFaced with the monster Tate is, and her own romantic feelings for him, Violet accidentally kills herself, something she doesn't realize was successful until weeks later when she discovers she cannot leave the house. After many ghosts, Vivien is committed to an insane asylum, while Ben is convinced that the second twin was fathered by Luke (Morris Chestnut), a neighbourhood security officer. Meanwhile, Constance enlists the help of a medium, Billie Dean Howard (Sarah Paulson), to help her talk to Addie. Constance discovers from Billie Dean to her horror, that Tate's child with Vivien will become the Antichrist. After Ben learns of Tate being the \\"Rubber Man\\", he has Vivien freed from the asylum.\\r\\nVivien gives birth to the twins in the house, with Moira recruiting the more benevolent ghosts of the house to help her deliver the children. Vivien and one of the newborn babies die, leaving Ben with the surviving twin. Violet breaks up with Tate after Chad reveals that Tate raped Violet's mother and murdered him and his boyfriend due to their deciding not to have a child. Ben tries to get into contact with his now dead wife and daughter, who refuse to show themselves. As he grieves, he contemplates suicide to be with them. Instead, Vivien shows herself and convinces Ben to leave the house immediately for the protection of the baby. As Ben is leaving the house, he is caught and murdered by Hayden, who hangs him to simulate a suicide. Hayden attempts to take the baby, but Constance, with the help of the ghost of a lover named Travis (Michael Graziadei), whom Hayden murdered, takes the child instead. Constance hides the baby and tells the police that Ben killed himself out of grief for his wife's death and that Violet (whose body is never found) ran off with the surviving child.\\r\\nNow trapped in the house, the Harmons team up with Moira and the other benevolent spirits to forbid other families from moving in by scaring them away.

He stated, \\"I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me.\\" Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. \\"You want people to be a little bit off balance afterwards,\\" he said.[15]\\r\\nThe dark tone of the series is modeled after the ABC soap opera Dark Shadows, which Murphy's grandmother forced him to watch when he was younger to toughen him up.[16] He also cited Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now, The Amityville Horror, and Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining as influences for the series.\\r\\nFrom the beginning, Murphy and Falchuk planned that each season of the series would tell a different story.[13] After the first-season finale aired, Murphy spoke of his plans to change the cast and location for the second season, while retaining some actors from the first,[17] \\"The people that are coming back will be playing completely different characters, creatures, monsters, etc. [The Harmons'] stories are done.\\"[13]\\r\\nIn February 2011, FX officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series from Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, with both Murphy and Falchuk writing and Murphy directing. Dante Di Loreto was announced as executive producer. Production on the series began in April 2011.[18] In July 2011, FX officially announced the project had been given a series order consisting of 13 episodes.[19] In August 2011, it was announced that Tim Minear, Jennifer Salt, James Wong and Jessica Sharzer had joined the series as writers.[20]\\r\\nOn October 30, 2016, Murphy announced that a future crossover season of the series will continue the Murder House and Coven stories, merging their characters and themes. He did not state which season it would be, but that he had already reached out to actors from both seasons to reprise their respective roles.[21] Murphy later confirmed one of the Murder House characters will be moved in the season finale of Coven. However, in January 5, 2018, it was announced that the crossover season will be take place in the ninth season.\\r\\nCasting announcements began in March 2011, with Connie Britton first to be cast, portraying female lead Vivien Harmon.[22] Britton stated that she took a risk in taking the role of Vivien. When Murphy presented the role to her, he said, \\"This is something we've never seen you do before. It will be turning what you've just been doing on its ear.\\" She was intrigued by what he had presented her and ultimately decided to take the part.[23] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, series co-creator Ryan Murphy stated that he had told Connie Britton, early on, that her character Vivien would die in the first season. \\"We've really had the whole season mapped out from the beginning,\\" he said. \\"In the meetings with the core actors, the three leads being Connie, Dylan [McDermott] and Jessica [Lange], as we tried to snare them we were able to say this is where you start, this is the middle, and this is where you end up. So, yes, I was able to tell Connie really the whole run of the series.\\"[24]\\r\\nDenis O'Hare joined the cast in late March 2011 as Larry Harvey.[25] Jessica Lange joined the cast in April 2011 as Constance, marking her first regular role on television.[26] Lange was attracted to the role because it didn't require a 22-episode commitment like a series on a broadcast network. \\"That was huge for me!\\" she said. \\"I wasn't about to commit to, you know, six months. It was cable, rather than network... I've been offered network [shows] before, and determined not to do it, just because I can't make that kind of time commitment.\\"[27]\\r\\nDylan McDermott was cast as the lead Ben Harmon in late April 2011. His character was initially described as \\"a handsome and masculine but sensitive therapist who loves his family but has hurt his wife.\\"[28] McDermott stated that he wanted to do the role to break away from his previous role as Bobby Donnell in the ABC series The Practice. \\"This was exactly why I wanted to do this show ÿ to change it up and do a different kind of character.

He performed poorly in school, but went on to be an early pioneer of steam-powered road and rail transport. His most significant contribution was the development of the first high-pressure steam engine. He also built the first full-scale working railway steam locomotive. The world's first locomotive-hauled railway journey took place on 21 February 1804, when Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway of the Penydarren Ironworks, in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales.[2][3]\\r\\nTurning his interests abroad, Trevithick also worked as a mining consultant in Peru and later explored parts of Costa Rica. Throughout his professional career, he went through many ups and downs, and at one point faced financial ruin, also suffering from the strong rivalry of many mining and steam engineers of the day. During the prime of his career, he was a well-respected and known figure in mining and engineering, but near the end of his life he fell out of the public eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Trevithick was born at Tregajorran (in the parish of Illogan), between Camborne and Redruth, in the heart of one of the rich mineral-mining areas of Cornwall. He was the youngest-but-one child and the only boy in a family of six children. He was very tall for the era at 6?ft 2in, as well as athletic and concentrated more on sport than schoolwork. Sent to the village school at Camborne, he did not take much advantage of the education provided; one of his school masters described him as \\"a disobedient, slow, obstinate, spoiled boy, frequently absent and very inattentive\\". An exception was arithmetic, for which he had an aptitude, though arriving at the correct answers by unconventional means.[4]\\r\\nTrevithick was the son of mine \\"captain\\" Richard Trevithick (1735ÿ1797) and of miner's daughter Ann Teague (died 1810). As a child he would watch steam engines pump water from the deep tin and copper mines in Cornwall. For a time he was a neighbour of William Murdoch, the steam carriage pioneer, and would have been influenced by his experiments with steam-powered road locomotion.[5]\\r\\nTrevithick first went to work at the age of 19 at the East Stray Park Mine. He was enthusiastic and quickly gained the status of a consultant, unusual for such a young person. He was popular with the miners because of the respect they had for his father.\\r\\nIn 1797, Trevithick married Jane Harvey of Hayle. They raised six children:[citation needed]\\r\\nJane's father, John Harvey, formerly a blacksmith from Carnhell Green, formed the local foundry, Harveys of Hayle. His company became famous worldwide for building huge stationary \\"beam\\" engines for pumping water, usually from mines. Up to this time such steam engines were of the condensing or atmospheric type, originally invented by Thomas Newcomen in 1712, which also became known as low-pressure engines. James Watt, on behalf of his partnership with Matthew Boulton, held a number of patents for improving the efficiency of Newcomen's engineincluding the \\"separate condenser patent\\", which proved the most contentious.\\r\\nTrevithick became engineer at the Ding Dong Mine in 1797, and there (in conjunction with Edward Bull) he pioneered the use of high-pressure steam. He worked on building and modifying steam engines to avoid the royalties due to Watt on the separate condenser patent. Boulton & Watt served an injunction on him at Ding Dong, and posted it \\"on the minestuffs\\" and \\"most likely on the door\\" of the Count (Account) House which, although now a ruin, is the only surviving building from Trevithick's time there.\\r\\nHe also experimented with the plunger-pole pump, a type of pumpwith a beam engineused widely in Cornwall's tin mines, in which he reversed the plunger to change it into a water-power engine.\\r\\nAs his experience grew, he realised that improvements in boiler technology now permitted the safe production of high-pressure steam, which could move a piston in a steam engine on its own account, instead of using pressure near to atmospheric, in a condensing engine.\\r\\nHe was not the first to think of so-called \\"strong steam\\". William Murdoch had developed and demonstrated a model steam carriage, initially in 1784, and demonstrated it to Trevithick at his request in 1794. In fact, Trevithick lived next door to Murdoch in Redruth in 1797 and 1798. Oliver Evans in the U.S. had also concerned himself with the concept, but there is no indication that his ideas had ever come to Trevithick's attention.[6]\\r\\nIndependently of this, Arthur Woolf was experimenting with higher pressures whilst working as the Chief Engineer of the Griffin Brewery (proprietors Meux and Reid). This was an Engine designed by Hornblower and Maberly, and the proprietors were keen to have the best steam engine in London. Around 1796, Woolf believed he could save substantial amounts of coal consumption.\\r\\nAccording to his son Francis, Trevithick was the first to make high-pressure steam work in England in 1799,[1] although other sources say he had invented his first high-pressure engine by 1797.[7][8] Not only would a high-pressure steam engine eliminate the condenser, but it would allow the use of a smaller cylinder, saving space and weight. He reasoned that his engine could now be more compact, lighter, and small enough to carry its own weight even with a carriage attached. (Note this did not use the expansion of the steam, so-called \\"expansive working\\" came later)\\r\\nTrevithick started building his first models of high-pressure (meaning a few atmospheres) steam engines, initially a stationary one and subsequently one attached to a road carriage. A double-acting cylinder was used, with steam distribution by means of a four-way valve. Exhaust steam was vented via a vertical pipe or chimney straight into the atmosphere, thus avoiding a condenser and any possible infringements of Watt's patent. The linear motion was directly converted into circular motion via a crank instead of using a more cumbersome beam.\\r\\nTrevithick built a full-size steam road locomotive in 1801, on a site near present-day Fore Street in Camborne.[9] (A steam wagon built in 1770 by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot may have an earlier claim.) Trevithick named his carriage Puffing Devil and on Christmas Eve that year, he demonstrated it by successfully carrying six passengers up Fore Street and then continuing on up Camborne Hill, from Camborne Cross, to the nearby village of Beacon. His cousin and associate, Andrew Vivian, steered the machine. This is widely recognised as the first demonstration of transportation powered by steam. It inspired the popular Cornish folk song \\"Camborne Hill\\".\\r\\nDuring further tests, Trevithick's locomotive broke down three days later after passing over a gully in the road. The vehicle was left under some shelter with the fire still burning whilst the operators retired to a nearby public house for a meal of roast goose and drinks. Meanwhile, the water boiled off, the engine overheated and the machine burned, destroying it. Trevithick did not consider this a serious setback, but rather operator error.\\r\\nIn 1802, Trevithick took out a patent for his high-pressure steam engine.[10][11] To prove his ideas, he built a stationary engine at the Coalbrookdale Company's works in Shropshire in 1802, forcing water to a measured height to measure the work done. The engine ran at forty piston strokes a minute, with an unprecedented boiler pressure of 145 psi.\\r\\nThe Coalbrookdale company then built a rail locomotive for him, but little is known about it, including whether or not it actually ran. To date, the only known information about it comes from a drawing preserved at the Science Museum, London, together with a letter written by Trevithick to his friend Davies Giddy. The design incorporated a single horizontal cylinder enclosed in a return-flue boiler. A flywheel drove the wheels on one side through spur gears, and the axles were mounted directly on the boiler, with no frame.[12] On the drawing, the piston-rod, guide-bars and cross-head are located directly above the firebox door, thus making the engine extremely dangerous to fire while moving.[13] Furthermore, the drawing indicates that the locomotive ran on a plateway with a track gauge of 3?ft (914?mm).\\r\\nThis is the drawing used as the basis of all images and replicas of the later \\"Pen-y-darren\\" locomotive, as no plans for that locomotive have survived.[14]\\r\\nThe Puffing Devil was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods, and would have been of little practical use. He built another steam-powered road vehicle in 1803, called the London Steam Carriage, which attracted much attention from the public and press when he drove it that year in London from Holborn to Paddington and back. It was uncomfortable for passengers and proved more expensive to run than a horse-drawn carriage, and was abandoned.\\r\\nAlso in 1803, one of Trevithick's stationary pumping engines in use at Greenwich exploded, killing four men. Although Trevithick considered the explosion was caused by another case of careless operation rather than design error, the incident was exploited relentlessly by Watt and Boulton (competitors and promoters of the low-pressure engine) who highlighted the perceived risks of using high-pressure steam.\\r\\nTrevithick's response was to incorporate two safety valves into future designs, only one of which could be adjusted by the operator.[15] The adjustable valve comprised a disc covering a small hole at the top of the boiler above the water level in the steam chest. The force exerted by the steam pressure was equalised by an opposite force created by a weight attached to a pivoted lever. The position of the weight on the lever was adjustable thus allowing the operator to set the maximum steam pressure. Trevithick also added a fusible plug of lead, positioned in the boiler just below the minimum safe water level. Under normal operation the water temperature could not exceed that of boiling water and kept the lead below its melting point. If the water ran low, it exposed the lead plug, and the cooling effect of the water was lost. The temperature would then rise sufficiently to melt the lead, releasing steam into the fire, reducing the boiler pressure and providing an audible alarm in sufficient time for the operator to damp the fire, and let the boiler cool before damage could occur. He also introduced the hydraulic testing of boilers, and the use of a mercury manometer to indicate the pressure.\\r\\nIn 1802, Trevithick built one of his high-pressure steam engines to drive a hammer at the Pen-y-Darren Ironworks in Merthyr Tydfil, Mid Glamorgan . With the assistance of Rees Jones, an employee of the iron works and under the supervision of Samuel Homfray, the proprietor, he mounted the engine on wheels and turned it into a locomotive. In 1803, Trevithick sold the patents for his locomotives to Samuel Homfray.\\r\\nHomfray was so impressed with Trevithick's locomotive that he made a bet with another ironmaster, Richard Crawshay, for 500 guineas that Trevithick's steam locomotive could haul ten tons of iron along the Merthyr Tydfil Tramroad from Penydarren (514503N 32233W? / ?51.750825N 3.375761W? / 51.750825; -3.375761) to Abercynon (513844N 31927W? / ?51.645567N 3.324233W? / 51.645567; -3.324233), a distance of 9.75 miles (15.69?km). Amid great interest from the public, on 21 February 1804 it successfully carried 10 tons of iron, 5 wagons and 70 men the full distance in 4 hours and 5 minutes, an average speed of approximately 2.4?mph (3.9?km/h).[16] As well as Homfray, Crawshay and the passengers, other witnesses included Mr. Giddy, a respected patron of Trevithick and an 'engineer from the Government'.[17] The engineer from the government was probably a safety inspector and particularly interested in the boiler's ability to withstand high steam pressures.\\r\\nThe configuration of the Pen-y-darren engine differed from the Coalbrookdale engine. The cylinder was moved to the other end of the boiler so that the fire door was out of the way of the moving parts. This obviously also involved putting the crankshaft at the chimney end. The locomotive comprised a boiler with a single return flue mounted on a four-wheel frame. At one end, a single cylinder with very long stroke was mounted partly in the boiler, and a piston rod crosshead ran out along a slidebar, an arrangement that looked like a giant trombone. As there was only one cylinder, this was coupled to a large flywheel mounted on one side. The rotational inertia of the flywheel would even out the movement that was transmitted to a central cog-wheel that was, in turn connected to the driving wheels. It used a high-pressure cylinder without a condenser; the exhaust steam was sent up the chimney assisting the draught through the fire, increasing efficiency even more.\\r\\nThe bet was won. Despite many people's doubts, it had been shown that, provided that the gradient was sufficiently gentle, it was possible to successfully haul heavy carriages along a smooth iron road using the adhesive weight alone of a suitably heavy and powerful steam locomotive. Trevithick's was probably the first to do so;[18] however some of the short cast iron plates of the tramroad broke under the locomotive as they were intended only to support the lighter axle load of horse-drawn wagons and so the tramroad returned to horse power after the initial test run.\\r\\nHomfray was pleased he won his bet. The engine was placed on blocks and reverted to its original stationary job of driving hammers.\\r\\nIn modern-day Merthyr Tydfil, behind the monument to Trevithick's locomotive lies a stone wall, the sole remainder of the former boundary wall of Homfray's Penydarren House.[19]\\r\\nA full-scale working reconstruction of the Pen-y-darren locomotive was commissioned in 1981 and delivered to the Welsh Industrial and Maritime Museum in Cardiff; when that closed, it was moved to the National Waterfront Museum in Swansea. Several times a year it is run on a 40m length of rail outside the museum.\\r\\nChristopher Blackett, proprietor of the Wylam colliery near Newcastle, heard of the success in Wales and wrote to Trevithick asking for locomotive designs. These were sent to John Whitfield at Gateshead, Trevithick's agent, who in 1804 built what was probably the first locomotive to have flanged wheels.[20] Blackett was using wooden rails for his tramway and, once again, Trevithick's machine was to prove too heavy for its track.[21][22]\\r\\nIn 1808, Trevithick publicised his steam railway locomotive expertise by building a new locomotive called Catch Me Who Can, built for him by John Hazledine and John Urpeth Rastrick at Bridgnorth in Shropshire, and named by Davies Giddy's daughter. The configuration differed from the previous locomotives in that the cylinder was mounted vertically and drove a pair of wheels directly with the connecting rods, without flywheel or gearing. This was probably Trevithick's fourth locomotive, after those used at Coalbrookdale, Pen-y-darren ironworks, and the Wylam colliery. He ran it on a circular track just south of the present-day Euston Square tube station in London. The site in Bloomsbury has recently been identified archaeologically as that occupied by the Chadwick Building, part of University College London.[23]\\r\\nAdmission to the \\"steam circus\\" was one shilling including a ride and it was intended to show that rail travel was faster than by horse. This venture also suffered from weak tracks and public interest was limited.\\r\\nTrevithick was disappointed by the response and designed no more railway locomotives. It was not until 1812 that twin-cylinder steam locomotives, built by Matthew Murray in Holbeck, successfully started replacing horses for hauling coal wagons on the edge railed, rack and pinion Middleton Railway from Middleton colliery to Leeds, West Yorkshire.\\r\\nRobert Vazie, another Cornish engineer, was selected by the Thames Archway Company in 1805 to drive a tunnel under the River Thames at Rotherhithe. Vazie encountered serious problems with water influx, and had got no further than sinking the end shafts when the directors called in Trevithick for consultation. The directors agreed to pay Trevithick S1000 (the equivalent of S73,038 in 2016[24]) if he could successfully complete the tunnel, a length of 1,220 feet (370?m). In August 1807, he began driving a small pilot tunnel or driftway 5 feet (1.5?m) high tapering from 2?feet 6?inches (0.76?m) at the top to 3 feet (0.91?m) at the bottom. By 23 December, after it had progressed 950 feet (290?m), progress was delayed after a sudden inrush of water; and only one month later on 26 January 1808, at 1,040 feet (320?m), a more serious inrush occurred. The tunnel was flooded; Trevithick, being the last to leave, was nearly drowned. Clay was dumped on the river bed to seal the hole, and the tunnel was drained, but mining was now more difficult. Progress stalled, and a few of the directors attempted to discredit Trevithick, but the quality of his work was eventually upheld by two colliery engineers from the North of England. Despite suggesting various building techniques to complete the project, including a submerged cast iron tube, Trevithick's links with the company ceased and the project was never actually completed.\\r\\nThe first successful tunnel under the Thames was started by Sir Marc Isambard Brunel in 1823, 0.75 miles (1,200?m) upstream, assisted by his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel (who also nearly died in a tunnel collapse). Marc Brunel finally completed it in 1843, the delays being due to problems with funding.\\r\\nTrevithick's suggestion of a submerged tube approach was successfully implemented for the first time across the Detroit River between Michigan in the United States and Ontario in Canada with the construction of the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel, under the engineering supervision of The New York Central Railway's engineering vice president, William J Wilgus. Construction began in 1903 and was completed in 1910. The DetroitÿWindsor Tunnelwhich was completed in 1930 for automotive traffic, and the tunnel under the Hong Kong Harbour were also submerged-tube designs.\\r\\nTrevithick went on to research other projects to exploit his high-pressure steam engines: boring brass for cannon manufacture, stone crushing, rolling mills, forge hammers, blast furnace blowers as well as the traditional mining applications. He also built a barge powered by paddle wheels and several dredgers.\\r\\nTrevithick saw opportunities in London and persuaded his wife and four children reluctantly to join him in 1808 for two and a half years lodging first in Rotherhithe and then in Limehouse.\\r\\nIn 1808, Trevithick entered a partnership with Robert Dickinson, a West India merchant. Dickinson supported several of Trevithick's patents. The first of these was the Nautical Labourer; a steam tug with a floating crane propelled by paddle wheels. However, it did not meet the fire regulations for the docks, and the Society of Coal Whippers, worried about losing their livelihood, even threatened the life of Trevithick.\\r\\nAnother patent was for the installation of iron tanks in ships for storage of cargo and water instead of in wooden casks. A small works was set up at Limehouse to manufacture them, employing three men. The tanks were also used to raise sunken wrecks by placing them under the wreck and creating buoyancy by pumping them full of air. In 1810 a wreck near Margate was raised in this way but there was a dispute over payment and Trevithick was driven to cut the lashings loose and let it sink again.\\r\\nIn 1809, Trevithick worked on various ideas on improvements for ships: iron floating docks, iron ships, telescopic iron masts, improved ship structures, iron buoys and using heat from the ships boilers for cooking.\\r\\nIn May 1810, Trevithick caught typhoid and nearly died. By September, he had recovered sufficiently to travel back to Cornwall by ship, and in February 1811 he and Dickinson were declared bankrupt. They were not discharged until 1814, Trevithick having paid off most of the partnership debts from his own funds.\\r\\nIn about 1812, Trevithick designed the Cornish boiler. These were horizontal, cylindrical boilers with a single internal fire tube or flue passing horizontally through the middle. Hot exhaust gases from the fire passed through the flue thus increasing the surface area heating the water and improving efficiency. These types were installed in the Boulton and Watt pumping engines at Dolcoath and more than doubled their efficiency.\\r\\nAgain in 1812, he installed a new 'high-pressure' experimental condensing steam engine at Wheal Prosper. This became known as the Cornish engine, and was the most efficient in the world at that time. Other Cornish engineers contributed to its development but Trevithick's work was predominant. In the same year he installed another high-pressure engine, though non-condensing, in a threshing machine on a farm at Probus, Cornwall. It was very successful and proved to be cheaper to run than the horses it replaced. It ran for 70 years and was then exhibited at the Science Museum.\\r\\nIn one of Trevithick's more unusual projects, he attempted to build a 'recoil engine' similar to the aeolipile described by Hero of Alexandria in about AD 50. Trevithick's engine comprised a boiler feeding a hollow axle to route the steam to a catherine wheel with two fine-bore steam jets on its circumference. The first wheel was 15 feet (4.6?m) in diameter and a later attempt was 24 feet (7.3?m) in diameter. To get any usable torque, steam had to issue from the nozzles at a very high velocity and in such large volume that it proved not to operate with adequate efficiency. Today this would be recognised as a reaction turbine.\\r\\nIn 1811 draining water from the rich silver mines of Cerro de Pasco in Peru at an altitude of 4,330 metres (14,210?ft) posed serious problems for the man in charge, Francisco Uville. The low-pressure condensing engines by Boulton and Watt developed so little power as to be useless at this altitude, and they could not be dismantled into sufficiently small pieces to be transported there along mule tracks. Uville was sent to England to investigate using Trevithick's high-pressure steam engine. He bought one for 20 guineas, transported it back and found it to work quite satisfactorily. In 1813 Uville set sail again for England and, having fallen ill on the way, broke his journey via Jamaica. When he had recovered he boarded the Falmouth packet ship 'Fox' coincidentally with one of Trevithick's cousins on board the same vessel. Trevithick's home was just a few miles from Falmouth so Uville was able to meet him and tell him about the project.\\r\\nOn 20 October 1816 Trevithick left Penzance on the whaler ship Asp accompanied by a lawyer named Page and a boilermaker bound for Peru. He was received by Uville with honour initially but relations soon broke down and Trevithick left in disgust at the accusations directed at him. He travelled widely in Peru acting as a consultant on mining methods. The government granted him certain mining rights and he found mining areas, but did not have the funds to develop them, with the exception of a copper and silver mine at Caxatambo. After a time serving in the army of Simon Bolivar he returned to Caxatambo but due to the unsettled state of the country and presence of the Spanish army he was forced to leave the area and abandon S5,000 worth of ore ready to ship. Uville died in 1818 and Trevithick soon returned to Cerro de Pasco to continue mining. However, the war of liberation denied him several objectives. Meanwhile, back in England, he was accused of neglecting his wife Jane and family in Cornwall.\\r\\nAfter leaving Cerro de Pasco, Trevithick passed through Ecuador on his way to Bogot in Colombia. He arrived in Costa Rica in 1822 hoping to develop mining machinery. He spent time looking for a practical route to transport ore and equipment, settling on using the San Juan River, the Sarapiqui River, and then a railway to cover the remaining distance. In a biography his son wrote that Trevithick had in mind a steam-driven railway and not mule-driven.\\r\\nThe initial party comprised Trevithick, Scottish mining projector James Gerard,[25] two schoolboys: Jos Maria Montealegre (a future president of Costa Rica) and his brother Mariano, whom Gerard intended to enrol in Highgate School, North London,[26] and seven natives, three of whom returned home after guiding them through the first part of their journey. The journey was treacherous ÿ one of the party was drowned in a raging torrent and Trevithick was nearly killed on at least two occasions. In the first he was saved from drowning by Gerard, and in the second he was nearly devoured by an alligator following a dispute with a local man whom he had in some way offended. Still in the company of Gerard, he made his way to Cartagena where he chanced to meet Robert Stephenson who was himself on his way home from Colombia, following a failed three-year mining venture. It had been many years since they last met (when Stephenson was just a baby), and the two men were judged by witnesses to their meeting to have little in common. Despite this Stephenson gave Trevithick S50 to help his passage home. Whilst Stephenson and Gerard booked passage via New York, Trevithick took ship direct to Falmouth, arriving there in October 1827 with few possessions other than the clothes he was wearing. He never returned to Costa Rica.\\r\\nTaking encouragement from earlier inventors who had achieved some successes with similar endeavours, Trevithick petitioned Parliament for a grant but he was unsuccessful in acquiring one.\\r\\nIn 1829 he built a closed cycle steam engine followed by a vertical tubular boiler.\\r\\nIn 1830 he invented an early form of storage room heater. It comprised a small fire tube boiler with a detachable flue which could be heated either outside or indoors with the flue connected to a chimney. Once hot the hot water container could be wheeled to where heat was required and the issuing heat could be altered using adjustable doors.\\r\\nTo commemorate the passing of the Reform Bill in 1832 he designed a massive column to be 1,000 feet (300?m) high, being 100 feet (30?m) in diameter at the base tapering to 12 feet (3.7?m) at the top where a statue of a horse would have been mounted. It was to be made of 1500 10-foot-square (3 m) pieces of cast iron and would have weighed 6000 tons. There was substantial public interest in the proposal, but it was never built.\\r\\nAbout the same time he was invited to do some development work on an engine of a new vessel at Dartford by John Hall, the founder of J & E Hall Limited. The work involved a reaction turbine for which Trevithick earned S1200. He lodged at The Bull hotel in the High Street, Dartford, Kent.\\r\\nAfter he had been working in Dartford for about a year, Trevithick was taken ill with pneumonia and had to retire to bed at The Bull hotel, where he was lodging at the time. Following a week's confinement in bed he died on the morning of 22 April 1833. He was penniless, and no relatives or friends had attended his bedside during his illness. His colleagues at Hall's works made a collection for his funeral expenses and acted as bearers. They also paid a night watchman to guard his grave at night to deter grave robbers, as body snatching was common at that time.\\r\\nTrevithick was buried in an unmarked grave in St Edmund's Burial Ground, East Hill, Dartford. The burial ground closed in 1857, with the gravestones being removed in the 1960s. A plaque marks the approximate spot believed to be the site of the grave.[27] The plaque lies on the side of the park, near the East Hill gate, and an unlinked path.\\r\\nIn Camborne, outside the public library, a statue by Leonard Stanford Merrifield depicting Trevithick holding one of his small-scale models[28] was unveiled in 1932 by Prince George, Duke of Kent, in front of a crowd of thousands of local people.[29]\\r\\nOn 17 March 2007, Dartford Borough Council invited the Chairman of the Trevithick Society, Phil Hosken, to unveil a Blue Plaque at the Royal Victoria and Bull hotel (formerly The Bull) marking Trevithick's last years in Dartford and the place of his death in 1833. The Blue Plaque is prominently displayed on the Hotel's front facade. There is also a plaque at Holy Trinity Church.[30]\\r\\nThe Cardiff University Engineering, Computer Science and Physics departments are based around the Trevithick Building which also holds the Trevithick Library, named after Richard Trevithick.[31]\\r\\nIn Gower Street in London, on the wall of the University College building, an elaborate wall plaque carries the legend: \\"Close to this place Richard Trevithick (Born 1771 ÿ Died 1833) Pioneer of High Pressure Steam ran in the year 1808 the first steam locomotive to draw passengers.\\" It was erected by \\"The Trevithick Centenary Memorial Committee\\".[32]\\r\\nOne of the oldest depictions of Saint Piran's Flag can be seen in a stained glass window at Westminster Abbey, 1888, commemorating Richard Trevithick. The window depicts St Michael at the top and nine Cornish saints, Piran, Petroc, Pinnock,[33] Germanus, Julian, Cyriacus, Constantine, Nonna and Geraint in tiers below. The head of St Piran appears to be a portrait of Trevithick himself and the figure carries the banner of Cornwall.[34]\\r\\nThere is a plaque and memorial situated in Abercynon, outside the fire station. It says \\"In commemoration of the achievements of Richard Trevithick who having constructed the first steam locomotive did on February 21st 1804 successfully hail 10 tons of iron and numerous passengers along a tramroad from Merthyr to this precinct where was situated the loading point of the Glamorgan Canal\\". There is also a building in Abercynon called Ty Trevithick, named in his honour.\\r\\nA replica of Trevithick's first full-size steam road locomotive was first displayed at Camborne Trevithick Day 2001, the day chosen for the celebration of Trevithicks public demonstration of the use of high-pressure steam. The team consisting of John Woodward, Mark Rivron and Sean Oliver, have continued to maintain and display the engine at various steam fairs across the country. The Puffing Devil has proudly led the parade of steam engines at every subsequent Trevithick day up to and including 2014.\\r\\nTrevithick Drive in Temple Hill, Dartford, was named after Richard Trevithick.\\r\\nThe Trevithick Society, a forerunner of Industrial Archaeology organizations that was initially formed to rescue the Levant winding engine from being scrapped was named for Richard Trevithick.[35] They publish a newsletters, a journal and many books on Cornish engines, the mining industry, engineers, and other industrial archaeological topics.[36][37] There is also a street named after him in Merthyr Tydfil.\\r\\nHarry Turtledove's alternate history short story The Iron Elephant has Richard Trevithick inventing his steam engine in 1782.

The song was originally written with Britney Spears in mind, but her label rejected it. \\"Umbrella\\" is a pop, hip hop and R&B song referring to a romantic and platonic relationship and the strength of that relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntertainment Weekly ranked the song number one on the 10 Best Singles of 2007, while Rolling Stone and Time listed the song at number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007. The song has earned Rihanna several awards and nominations. In 2007, the song won two awards at the MTV Video Music Awards, when it was nominated for four. At the 2008 Grammy Awards, \\"Umbrella\\" also earned Rihanna and Jay-Z a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in addition to receiving nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. The song is also listed on Rolling Stone's The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time at 412.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song serves as the lead single to the album, and was released worldwide on March 29, 2007 through Def Jam Recordings. \\"Umbrella\\" was a commercial success, topping the charts in Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In the United Kingdom, where the song's chart performance coincided with the excessive flooding and large amounts of rain, it was one of the most played songs on radio in the 2000s decade. It managed to stay at number one on the UK Singles Chart for 10 consecutive weeks, the longest run at number one for any single of that decade, and is also one of the few songs to top the chart for at least 10 weeks. The single was one of the highest digital debuts in the United States at the time and remained at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 for seven consecutive weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe single's accompanying music video was directed by Chris Applebaum and features, among all, Rihanna's nude body covered in silver paint. The video earned Rihanna a Video of the Year at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards and Most Watched Video on MuchMusic.com at MuchMusic Video Awards. Along with countless amateurs, \\"Umbrella\\" has been covered by several notable performers from a variety of musical genres, including All Time Low, the Baseballs, Biffy Clyro, Manic Street Preachers, McFly, Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park, OneRepublic, Taylor Swift, and Vanilla Sky. Rihanna performed the song at the 2007 MTV Movie Awards, 2008 BRIT Awards and was the closing song of the \\"Good Girl Gone Bad Tour\\" (2008), the \\"Last Girl on Earth\\" (2010), and the \\"Loud Tour\\" (2011). It was included in the \\"Diamonds World Tour\\" (2013), and the \\"Anti World Tour\\"  (2016). Umbrella is a playable track in 2012 video game Just Dance 4\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican songwriter and producer Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart convened with Terius \\"The-Dream\\" Nash and Kuk Harrell in January 2007 at the Atlanta-based Triangle Studios to create new material. In the studio, Stewart was \\"messing around with a walloping hi-hat sound\\", which he found in the free music software GarageBand, which is included in all Mac computers. With his attention caught by the sound, Nash asked Stewart what he was doing: \\"Oh, my Gosh, what is that beat?\\". When Stewart incorporated chords onto the hi-hat, \\"immediately the word popped into [Nash's] head\\"; he went to the vocal booth and started singing.[1] Nash wrote the first two verses and the chorus over Stewart's skeleton track.[2] They quickly wrote the lyrics, completing the first verse in 60 seconds. They continued into writing, adding the hook while \\"[Stewart] would put the next chord\\". In a matter of hours, they had recorded a demo of the track.[1] The song was written with American pop singer Britney Spears in mind, whom Stewart had previously worked with on her 2003 single \\"Me Against the Music\\". Stewart and Nash thought that Spears, who had \\"her personal life?... a little out of control\\" at the time, needed a hit as musical comeback.[1] Spears was working on her fifth album, Blackout, so they sent a copy of the demo to Spears' management. However, Spears did not hear of the song because her label rejected it, claiming they had enough songs for her to record.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the management's rejection of the track, Stewart and Nash dealt it out to other record labels. It was also given to English singer-songwriter Taio Cruz, who failed to convince his record company to release it.[4] It was then opted by Island Def Jam chairman Antonio \\"L.A.\\" Reid, a friend of Stewart who established his first studio. By early February 2007, the demo was sent to Reid's right-hand woman, A&R executive Karen Kwak, who passed it along to Reid with a message confirming that they had found a song suited for Rihanna, who was working on her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad, at the time. Reid immediately sent the demo to Rihanna, who was also positive of it: \\"When the demo first started playing, I was like, This is interesting, this is weird.?... But the song kept getting better. I listened to it over and over. I said, 'I need this record. I want to record it tomorrow.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nTricky Stewart, MTV News[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, since it was the Grammy season of 2007, Stewart and Nash eyed American R&B singer Mary J. Blige for the demo.[3] Upon calling them to set the record aside for Rihanna, Stewart had played it to an associate of Blige, subsequently promising the song to her. Having heard the move of the writers, Kwak began calling Stewart and his manager, Mark Stewart, incessantly. Meanwhile, considering Blige's nominations at the Grammys, Stewart and Nash agreed to wait for her response. However, Blige failed to hear the song in full due to her obligations to the Grammys at the time and \\"had to sign off on the record before her reps could accept it\\".[3][5] Finally, Reid \\"stepped in, trading on his power-broker status and longstanding relationship with Stewart\\", and admits, \\"I made the producers an offer they couldn't refuse.\\"[1] By the time Reid had successfully persuaded Stewart's camp, they \\"just couldn't say no\\".[3] On giving up the record to Reid's camp, Mark Stewart comments, \\"We knew Rihanna's album would be out in a few months. Mary wasn't even in an album cycle yet. We made the sensible business decision.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nRihanna recorded the song, with vocal production by Thaddis \\"Kuk\\" Harrell, in a Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Initially, Stewart admitted he was still reluctant as to whether Rihanna was the right artist to record the song, but following the recording of the \\"ella, ella\\" catch phrase, he felt they were onto \\"something\\".[3] Following Rihanna's recording, Def Jam CEO-rapper Jay-Z added his rap. However, Jay-Z rewrote his verse without the awareness of Stewart and Nash. Stewart could not understand it, but later realized it made \\"sense\\" instead of the first version. Stewart noted that \\"from a songwriter's standpoint, he just really made it more about the song, with the metaphors about umbrellas and about the weather versus what he had before\\".[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Umbrella\\" was released worldwide on March 29, 2007, debuting on Rihanna's Def Jam website.[6][7] The song was released digitally in the United Kingdom on May 14, 2007, along with its physical release following two weeks later.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Umbrella\\" is a pop, hip hop and R&B song with rock influences.[9][10][11][12][13][14] The song's musicscape is based on the hi-hat, synthesizers, and a distorted bassline. According to Entertainment Weekly magazine, the song's beat can be recreated through a drum loop from the Apple music-software program GarageBand (Vintage Funk Kit 03).[15] The song is written in the key of B ? minor. The song's lyrics are written in the traditional verse-chorus form. They open with a rap verse, and the hook \\"ella, ella\\" follows every chorus. A bridge follows the second hook, and the song ends in a fadeout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Umbrella\\" received critical acclaim from music critics. Andy Kellman of AllMusic commented: \\"'Umbrella' is [Rihanna's best song] to date, delivering mammoth if spacious drums, a towering backdrop during the chorus, and vocals that are somehow totally convincing without sounding all that impassioned ÿ an ideal spot between trying too hard and boredom, like she might've been on her 20th take.\\"[16] Alex Macpherson of British newspaper The Guardian, \\"Umbrella\\" is \\"evidence\\" that Rihanna's \\"strict work ethic is paying off\\", adding that she \\"delivers [in the song] an impassioned declaration of us-against-the-world devotion\\".[17] Tom Breihan of Pitchfork, though he complimented the production, dismissed Rihanna's voice which \\"takes on an unpleasant icepick edge when she tries to fill the space between the slow-tempo beats\\", adding that the song is \\"uncompelling as event-pop, particularly because of the disconnect between Rihanna's cold, clinical delivery and the comforting warmth of the lyrics\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nSal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote \\"That the song is just plain good, regardless of genre, proves that Jay and Rihanna, who's already scored hits across several formats with a string of singles that couldn't be more different from each other, are dedicated to producing quality hitshowever frivolous they may be.\\"[19] Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters.com said that \\"\\"Umbrella\\" is a monster, so much so that I'll even confess to spending a portion of a rainy afternoon practicing the hook.\\"[20] Jonah Weiner of Blender magazine called the song the album's highlight and stated that it \\"would be far less engrossing if it wasn't for the way Rihanna disassembles its ungainly title into 11 hypnotic, tongue-flicking syllables\\".[21] The New York Times' Kelefa Sanneh described the song as \\"a space-age hip-pop song\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Umbrella\\" entered the Australian Singles Chart at number one on June 10, 2007, becoming Rihanna's second number one in the country following \\"SOS\\" (2006). It spent six consecutive weeks at the top,[22] and has since earned earned a 5G Platinum certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association, denoting sales of 350,000 copies.[23] It spent a total of 32 weeks on the chart,[22] ending the year as the country's third best-selling single of 2007.[24] \\"Umbrella\\" debuted on the New Zealand Singles Chart at number 34 on May 14, 2007. Over the following two weeks, it dropped one place, then climbed to a new peak of number 33. In its fourth week on the chart, it leaped to the top of the chart, becoming Rihanna's second number one single following \\"Pon de Replay\\" (2005).[25] It remained atop the chart for six consecutive weeks and on the chart for a total of 24 weeks.[25] The song received a Platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand, denoting sales of 15,000 copies,[26]  subsequently becoming the country's best-selling single of 2007.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Umbrella\\" debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 on the chart issue dated April 28, 2007, at number 91.[28] The following week it climbed to number 72,[28] and to number 63 in its third week.[29] In its fourth, fifth and sixth week on the chart, it progressively ascended to numbers 52,[30] 44[31] and 41.[32] Prior to its physical release, \\"Umbrella\\" achieved the biggest debut in the six-year history of iTunes in the United States, breaking a record previously held by Shakira and Wyclef Jean's \\"Hips Don't Lie\\".[3] Following its digital release, \\"Umbrella\\" soared to number one for the issue dated June 9, 2007 on its seventh week on the chart.[33] It subsequently debuted atop the Hot Digital Songs chart, with first-week sales of over 277,000 units. The single became the highest digital debut in the United States since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking downloads in 2003, surpassing Justin Timberlake's \\"SexyBack\\" 250,000 sales record in 2006.[32] The single's rise to the top of the Hot 100 marked Rihanna's second number one single following \\"SOS\\" (2006),[33] which was also noted for its huge leap on the Hot 100 to the top spot based on digital sales alone.[34] Significantly sustained by the strong airplay of the single[35][36] and preventing American rap group Shop Boyz' \\"Party Like a Rockstar\\" from advancing on the chart, \\"Umbrella\\" spent seven consecutive weeks at the top of the chart.[37] \\"Umbrella\\" eventually became the second best-performing single of 2007 on the Hot 100, only behind Beyonc's hit single \\"Irreplaceable\\" which topped the chart for ten weeks total.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Umbrella\\" entered the top fifty of the US Radio Songs chart on the issue dated April 28, 2007, at number 42.[39] The following week it climbed to number 29,[28] and reached the top twenty in its fourth week on the chart, at number 17.[30] It entered the top five of the chart on the chart issue of June 2, 2007, at number three.[31][32] It eventually reached number one on the issue dated July 14, 2007,[40] and remained at the top for four consecutive weeks.[41] On the Pop Songs chart, \\"Umbrella\\" debuted at number 77 on the chart issue dated April 28, 2007.[39] The following week it rose to number 61,[39] and to 51 in its third week.[28] In its fourth week on the chart, it climbed to number 36.[42] On the chart issue of June 9, 2007, \\"Umbrella\\" soared from number 31 to number one in its eighth week on the chart.[32] It spent six consecutive weeks at the top.[40] \\"Umbrella\\" debuted at number 69 on the Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs chart on the issue dated April 21, 2007.[43] The following week it rose to number 52[39] and by the issue dated June 9, 2007, it had climbed into the top twenty at number 17.[32] It reached the top ten for the chart issue of June 16, 2007, and rose to number six the following week, earning the 'Greatest Gainer' in both sales and airplay for the week.[44] It made its peak of number four in the issue of July 14, 2007.[40] \\"Umbrella\\" entered the Hot Dance Club Songs chart as the 'Hot Shot Debut' at number 36, for the issue dated June 9, 2007.[32] The following week it leaped to number 25.[45] It ascended into the top ten of the chart the week after, landing at number nine,[44] and rose to number four in its fourth week on the chart.[46] It topped the chart on the issue dated July 7, 2007[47] and remained at number one for a second week.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of June 2015, \\"Umbrella\\" has sold 4,470,000 digital copies in the United States, and is Rihanna's sixth best-selling single in the country.[48] The song debuted at number one in Canada, becoming the first song to top the then recently launched Canadian Hot 100, a singles chart in Canada issued by Billboard magazine, similar to that of the Billboard Hot 100.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe single experienced major success in Europe, most notably in the United Kingdom.[50] The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number one based on digital sales alone,[51] becoming Rihanna's first chart-topper in the country.[52] During the single's fourth week on the chart, Rihanna earned her first 'Chart Double' with both the single and subsequent album (Good Girl Gone Bad) topping the UK Singles and Albums charts simultaneously.[53] Having reached nine straight weeks at number one on the chart, it broke the record of American group Gnarls Barkley's \\"Crazy\\" as the longest chart-topper of the decade.[54] \\"Umbrella\\" eventually reached a total of ten weeks at number one on the chart, becoming the country's longest-running number one single of the 21st century.[55] In addition, Rihanna become the seventh artist in history to top the chart for ten consecutive weeks.[56] By the end of 2008, \\"Umbrella\\" had sold over 600,000 copies, making it her biggest-selling single at the time, before being succeeded by \\"Love the Way You Lie\\", a collaboration with Eminem two years later in 2010.[57] It became Britain's second biggest-selling single of 2007, only behind Leona Lewis' \\"Bleeding Love\\".[58] On December 12, 2008, it was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry, for sales of 600,000 copies.[59] In total, \\"Umbrella\\" has amassed 51 weeks in the official Charts, making it the joint 20th longest runner of all time.

She asked American music video director Chris Applebaum to send her \\"something\\" to work on. Def Jam representatives were expecting Applebaum of the treatment.[76] In response, Applebaum hurriedly made a treatment for the video, one of his first ideas being the silver body paint that Rihanna is seen in. Applebaum was doubtful whether Rihanna would embrace the idea, but her \\"positive response\\" following a letter the director sent to the artist ensured its approval. Makeup artist Pamela Neal mixed a silver paint that would give Rihanna such a look. During the session, the paint was re-applied between takes to ensure she was completely covered. The set was closed to Rihanna, Applebaum and a camera assistant.[76] Rihanna also contributed her own ideas towards the video shoot, suggesting to Applebaum that she dance en pointe, an idea which he accepted.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nVisual effects at Kroma were supervised by Bert Yukich and produced by Amy Yukich.[77] A key part of the video is a 24-second visual effects sequence in which Rihanna is surrounded by silvery strands of liquid that crisscross the frame in graceful arcs in response to her movements. Water elements were recorded on a special effects stage using a high-speed 35mm camera. Bert Yukich then composited them into the scene with the singer. He then added lighting effects to the practical water elements to give them the mirror-like texture of mercury.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music video premiered on April 26, 2007 at her website. Downloads were made available for those in the U.S. only from the website for a limited time. The video was officially released on the iTunes Store on May 11, 2007, peaking at number one for a period of eight weeks. On May 1, 2007, \\"Umbrella\\" debuted on MTV's Total Request Live at number 10, before reaching number one on May 9 where it remained for fifteen days, making it the longest running number one of 2007. The video was well-played in MTV during the second half of 2007; it has reached over 8,000 plays, receiving a platinum recognition at the MTV Platinum and Gold Video Awards.[78] Such was the success of the promotional video that it received five nominations at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards, including \\"Female Artist of the Year\\", \\"Video of the Year\\" and \\"Monster Single of the Year\\", going on to win the latter two.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Umbrella\\" is widely acknowledged as the song that propelled Rihanna from rising pop act into superstardom and transformed her into a \\"fully fledged sex symbol\\" and a pop icon, with some music journalists considering it to be her signature song.[80][81][82][83][84][85][86] \\"Umbrella\\" marked the first time Rihanna transitioned from the \\"girl next door\\" persona of her first two albums for an \\"edgy, sexier\\" look, which triggered her image evolution for her subsequent albums.[87] In his book The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory, John Seabrook wrote: \\r\\n\\"Two albums into her career, it still wasnt clear who Rihanna was. To her detractors, and there were many, she was just another wannabe-yonc who sang through her nose and couldnt really dance. To prove them wrong, she needed a song that would define her as an artist. [...] Eleven rhythmic syllables, umbrella-ella-ella-eh-eh-eh, did what the two previous albums together had not done: they defined Rihanna as an artist. [...] Umbrella marked the arrival of something new in pop: a digital icon. In the rock era, when the album was the standard unit of recorded music, listeners had ten or twelve songs to get to know the artist, but in the singles-oriented world of today, the artist has only three or four minutes to put their personality across, and at that Rihanna would prove to be without peer.\\"[88][89]\\r\\n Rapper and featured act Jay-Z recognized the song's impact for Rihanna's artistic evolution, stating: \\"It shows such growth for her as an artist [...] If you listen to the lyrics to that song, you know the depth and how far she's come.\\"[90] The song's producer, Kuk Harrell reportedly commented on the song's impact on his career: \\"We knew it was special. [...] Nothing has been the same since we created that record. We had experience in record making but not hit making. All of a sudden you have major artists blowing up your phone. And we knew exactly how to service them; we reverted back to that jingle mentality  we were prepared for that pressure. So whether it was Beyonc calling or Bieber calling, we knew how to operate. [...] When she recorded the 'ellas', you knew your life was about to change.\\"[89] In January 2016, Billboard named \\"Umbrella\\" as Rihanna's best song.[82] In 2018, Rolling Stone identified \\"Umbrella\\" as Rihanna's second greatest song of her career, behind \\"We Found Love\\" (2011) and stated that \\"Umbrella\\" transformed Rihanna into a \\"full-fledged pop heavyweight\\".[91] In the same year, The Guardian named \\"Umbrella\\" as the best song to spend over 10 weeks at number one in the UK, writing that \\"Rihanna's Umbrella is a genuinely exceptional pop song. [...] it's perfect.\\"[92] Canadian duo Tegan and Sara stated that \\"Umbrella\\" inspired their 2013 single \\"I Was a Fool\\".[93][94]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Umbrella\\"'s reign at number one in the United Kingdom occurred as the country was hit by extreme rainfall and flooding, which led the British national newspaper The Sun to humorously suggest the two events were related, with the media referring to it as the \\"Rihanna Curse.\\" The tabloid also highlighted the date of the single's video shoot, which was Friday the 13th (April 13, 2007), adding further coincidence to the curse.[95] Before the single's release on May 14, the temperature in London was relatively high, reaching 20 C. However, just a day after the release, \\"severe weather warnings hit the headlines\\".[95] An article in The Sun urged readers to join the campaign to knock the song off the chart's top spot, suggesting to readers that they download more \\"positive\\" songs revolving around sun or summer such as Katrina and the Waves' \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" and DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince's \\"Summertime\\".[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nA similar situation occurred in New Zealand, where the song hit number one in the early winter of 2007 as the country was experiencing some of the worst storms in its history.[96] During the weather conditions, Taranaki, Tauranga, and Auckland had experienced tornadoes and flooding in the Far North of the country. Once the single was replaced on the top spot, weather conditions throughout New Zealand pacified, although Hawke's Bay was still stormy.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same happened in Romania where \\"Umbrella\\" hit the stations in the nation during the summer. That summer was in its first half the hottest and driest period of time in Romania since 1946.[97] As the song reached the top ten and then its number-one peak, the country experienced the worst storms and most pouring rains in its history.[98] As the song was losing positions in the charts, the storm ended and the temperatures lowered step-by-step.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the record-breaking success of the single and the reported coincidence with the weather, Def Jam's marketing team collaborated with British umbrella manufacturer Totes. The company produced five types of Rihanna umbrellas, one of which was a two-tone satin umbrella that Rihanna debuted in public during her performance of the song at the 2007 MTV Movie Awards.[99] Although manufactured by a UK-based company, the collection was made available only to US residents online through the company's website.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Umbrella\\" was performed by Rihanna during the 2007 MTV Movie Awards on June 3, 2007.[101] In the United Kingdom, she performed the song on the ITV morning show GMTV and at the Brit Awards in 2008.

They are the eastern part of the Canadian Cordillera, which is a system of multiple ranges of mountains which runs from the Canadian Prairies to the Pacific Coast. The Canadian Rockies mountain system comprises the southeastern part of this system, lying between the Interior Plains of Alberta and Northeastern British Columbia on the east to the Rocky Mountain Trench of BC on the west. The southern end borders Idaho and Montana of the USA. In geographic terms the boundary is at the Canada/US border, but in geological terms it might be considered to be at Marias Pass in northern Montana. The northern end is at the Liard River in northern British Columbia.\\r\\nThe Canadian Rockies have numerous high peaks and ranges, such as Mount Robson (3,954?m (12,972?ft)) and Mount Columbia (3,747?m (12,293?ft)). The Canadian Rockies are composed of shale and limestone. Much of the range is protected by national and provincial parks, several of which collectively comprise a World Heritage Site.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian Rockies are the easternmost part of the Canadian Cordillera, the collective name for the mountains of Western Canada. They form part of the American Cordillera, an essentially continuous sequence of mountain ranges that runs all the way from Alaska to the very tip of South America. The Cordillera in turn are the eastern part of the Pacific Ring of Fire that runs all the way around the Pacific Ocean.\\r\\nThe Canadian Rockies are bounded on the east by the Canadian Prairies, on the west by the Rocky Mountain Trench, and on the north by the Liard River. Contrary to popular misconception, the Rockies do not extend north into Yukon or Alaska, or west into central British Columbia. North of the Liard River, the Mackenzie Mountains, which are a distinct mountain range, form a portion of the border between the Yukon and the Northwest Territories. The mountain ranges to the west of the Rocky Mountain Trench in southern British Columbia are called the Columbia Mountains, and are not considered to be part of the Rockies by Canadian geologists.[2]\\r\\nMount Robson (3,954?m (12,972?ft)) is the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies, but not the highest in British Columbia, since there are some higher mountains in the Coast Mountains and Saint Elias Mountains. However, Mount Robson is particularly impressive because it stands out on the continental divide towering over Yellowhead Pass, one of the lowest passes in the Canadian Rockies, and is close to the Yellowhead Highway. Its base is only 985?m above sea level, meaning it has a total vertical relief of 2,969?m or nearly 10,000 feet. In addition, it rises the 3?km to its summit in a distance of only 4?km from its base at Kinney Lake. Climbing Mount Robson is a challenge suitable for experienced and well-prepared mountaineers, and usually requires a week on the mountain.\\r\\nMount Columbia (3,747?m (12,293?ft)) is the second-highest peak in the Canadian Rockies, and is the highest mountain in Alberta. There is a non-technical route to the top involving only kicking steps in the snow, but the approach is across the Columbia Icefield and requires glacier travel and crevasse rescue knowledge. It is normally done in two days, with a night at high camp, but some strong skiers have done it from the highway in a day. On the other hand, many others have been stuck in their tents for days waiting for the weather to clear. From the same high camp as for Mount Columbia, it is possible to ascend a number of other high peaks in the area, including North Twin, South Twin, Kitchener, Stutfield and Snow Dome.\\r\\nSnow Dome (3,456?m (11,339?ft)) is not an impressive peak by Rockies standards, but it has the distinction of being the hydrological apex of North America. Water flows off Snow Dome into three different watersheds, into the Pacific Ocean, Arctic Ocean, and Atlantic Ocean via Hudson Bay. It is the easiest and most popular ascent on the Columbia Icefield, a gentle ski to the top from Columbia high camp, but glacier travel is required\\r\\nOf the highest peaks, only Mount Temple (3,543?m (11,624?ft)) has an established scrambling route. All other mountains (including other routes up Mount Temple), require more mountaineering skills and experience. Despite the fact that it is only a moderate scramble, even Mount Temple should not be attempted by novices. According to the Alpine Club of Canada, more people have died on Mount Temple than any other Canadian mountain, including seven youths in an unsupervised American school group in 1955.[3] The upper slopes are usually covered with snow and there is a glacier on top. Scramblers on Mount Temple should carry an ice axe and enough clothing to survive a freezing night on the mountain if a storm hits and prevents them from descending.\\r\\nContrary to popular misconception, the Canadian Rockies are not the highest mountain ranges in Canada. Both the Saint Elias Mountains (highest point in Canada Mount Logan at 5,959?m (19,551?ft)) and the Coast Mountains (highest point Mount Waddington at 4,016?m (13,176?ft)) have higher summits.\\r\\nThe Canadian Rockies are subdivided into numerous mountain ranges, structured in two main groupings, the Continental Ranges, which has three main subdivisions, the Front Range, Park Ranges and Kootenay Ranges, and the Northern Rockies which comprise two main groupings, the Hart Ranges and the Muskwa Ranges. The division-point of the two main groupings is at Monkman Pass northwest of Mount Robson and to the southwest of Mount Ovington.\\r\\nThe Canadian Rockies are noted for being the source of several major river systems, and also for the many rivers within the range itself. The Rockies form the divide between the Pacific drainage on the west and that of Hudson Bay and the Arctic Ocean on the east. Of the range's rivers, only the Peace River penetrates the range. Notable rivers originating in the Canadian Rockies include the Fraser, Columbia, North Saskatchewan, Bow and Athabasca Rivers.\\r\\nThe Canadian Rockies are quite different in appearance and geology from the American Rockies to the south of them. The Canadian Rockies are composed of layered sedimentary rock such as limestone and shale, whereas the American Rockies are made mostly of metamorphic and igneous rock such as gneiss and granite.\\r\\nThe Canadian Rockies are overall more jagged than the American Rockies, because the Canadian Rockies have been more heavily glaciated, resulting in sharply pointed mountains separated by wide, U-shaped valleys gauged by glaciers, whereas the American Rockies are overall more rounded, with river-carved V-shaped valleys between them. The Canadian Rockies are cooler and wetter, giving them moister soil, bigger rivers, and more glaciers. The tree line is much lower in the Canadian Rockies than in the American Rockies.\\r\\nFive national parks are located within the Canadian Rockies, four of which are adjacent and make up the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks. These four parks are Banff, Jasper, Kootenay and Yoho. The fifth national park, Waterton is not adjacent to the others. Waterton lies farther south, straddling the CanadaÿUS border as the Canadian half of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. All five of these parks, combined with three British Columbia provincial parks, were declared a single UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984[4] for the unique mountain landscapes found there.\\r\\nNumerous provincial parks are located in the Canadian Rockies, including Hamber, Mount Assiniboine and Mount Robson parks.\\r\\nThroughout the Rockies, and especially in the national parks, the Alpine Club of Canada maintains a series of alpine huts for use by mountaineers and adventurers.[5]\\r\\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway was founded to provide a link from the province of British Columbia to the eastern provinces. The main difficulty in providing such a link were the Rockies themselves: treacherous mountain passes, fast rivers and sheer drops made for a difficult railway construction process. The following articles describe in detail the political and technical feats involved:","input":"What is the tallest mountain in the canadian rockies?"},{"output":"degraded the ability of the Confederacy to maintain its war effort","context":"GRANT'S OPERATIONS AGAINST VICKSBURG\\r\\n(March 29 - July 4, 1863):\\r\\nThe Siege of Vicksburg (May 18 ÿ July 4, 1863) was the final major military action in the Vicksburg Campaign of the American Civil War. In a series of maneuvers, Union Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and his Army of the Tennessee crossed the Mississippi River and drove the Confederate Army of Mississippi, led by Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton, into the defensive lines surrounding the fortress city of Vicksburg, Mississippi.\\r\\nVicksburg was the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River; therefore, capturing it completed the second part of the Northern strategy, the Anaconda Plan. When two major assaults (May 19 and 22, 1863) against the Confederate fortifications were repulsed with heavy casualties, Grant decided to besiege the city beginning on May 25. After holding out for more than forty days, with no reinforcement and supplies nearly gone, the garrison finally surrendered on July 4.\\r\\nThe successful ending of the Vicksburg Campaign significantly degraded the ability of the Confederacy to maintain its war effort, as described in the Aftermath section of the campaign article. Some historianse.g., Ballard, p.?308suggest that the decisive battle in the campaign was actually the Battle of Champion Hill, which, once won by Grant, made victory in the subsequent siege a foregone conclusion. This action (combined with the surrender of Port Hudson to Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks on July 9) yielded command of the Mississippi River to the Union forces, who would hold it for the rest of the conflict.\\r\\nThe Confederate surrender on July 4, 1863, is sometimes considered, when combined with Gen. Robert E. Lee's defeat at Gettysburg by Maj. Gen. George Meade and retreat beginning the same day, the turning point of the war. It cut off the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas from the rest of the Confederate States, effectively splitting the Confederacy in two for the duration of the war. The Union victory also permanently severed communication between the balance of the Confederacy and the Trans-Mississippi Department.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter crossing the Mississippi River south of Vicksburg at Bruinsburg and driving northeast, Grant won battles at Port Gibson and Raymond and captured Jackson, the Mississippi state capital, on May 14, 1863, forcing Pemberton to withdraw westward. Attempts to stop the Union advance at Champion Hill and Big Black River Bridge were unsuccessful. Pemberton knew that the corps under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman was preparing to flank him from the north; he had no choice but to withdraw or be outflanked. Pemberton burned the bridges over the Big Black River and took everything edible in his path, both animal and plant, as he retreated to the well-fortified city of Vicksburg.[5]\\r\\nThe Confederates evacuated Hayne's Bluff, which was occupied by Sherman's cavalry on May 19, and Union steamboats no longer had to run the guns of Vicksburg, now being able to dock by the dozens up the Yazoo River. Grant could now receive supplies more directly than by the previous route, which ran through Louisiana, over the river crossing at Grand Gulf and Bruinsburg, then back up north.[5]\\r\\nOver half of Pemberton's army had been lost in the two preceding battles[6] and many in Vicksburg expected General Joseph E. Johnston, in command of the Confederate Department of the West, to relieve the citywhich he never did. Large masses of Union troops were on the march to invest the city, repairing the burnt bridges over the Big Black River; which Grant's forces crossed on May 18. Johnston sent a note to his general, Pemberton, asking him to sacrifice the city and save his troops, something Pemberton would not do. (Pemberton, a Northerner by birth, was probably influenced by his fear of public condemnation if he abandoned Vicksburg.)[7]\\r\\nPemberton, trying to please Jefferson Davis, who insisted that Vicksburg and Port Hudson must be held, and to please Johnston, who thought both places worthless militarily, had been caught in the middle, a victim of a convoluted command system and his own indecisiveness. Too dispirited to think clearly, he chose to back his bedraggled army into Vicksburg rather than evacuate the city and head north where he might have escaped to campaign again. When he chose to take his army into Vicksburg, Pemberton sealed the fate of his troops and the city he had been determined to defend.\\r\\nAs the Confederate forces approached Vicksburg, Pemberton could put only 18,500 troops in his lines. Grant had over 35,000, with more on the way. However, Pemberton had the advantage of terrain and fortifications that made his defense nearly impregnable. The defensive line around Vicksburg ran approximately 6.5 miles, based on terrain of varying elevations that included hills and knobs with steep angles for an attacker to ascend under fire. The perimeter included many gun pits, forts, trenches, redoubts, and lunettes. The major fortifications of the line included Fort Hill, on a high bluff north of the city; the Stockade Redan, dominating the approach to the city on Graveyard Road from the northeast; the 3rd Louisiana Redan; the Great Redoubt; the Railroad Redoubt, protecting the gap for the railroad line entering the city; the Square Fort (Fort Garrott); a salient along the Hall's Ferry Road; and the South Fort.[9]\\r\\nMaj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Union Army of the Tennessee brought five corps to the siege:\\r\\nLt. Gen. John C. Pemberton's Confederate Army of Mississippi inside the Vicksburg line consisted of four divisions, under Maj. Gens.:\\r\\nGrant wanted to overwhelm the Confederates before they could fully organize their defenses and ordered an immediate assault against Stockade Redan for May 19. Troops from Sherman's corps had a difficult time approaching the position under rifle and artillery fire from the 36th Mississippi Infantry, Brig. Gen. Louis Hbert's brigadethey had to negotiate a steep ravine protected by abatis and cross a 6-foot-deep (1.8?m), 8-foot-wide (2.4?m) ditch before attacking the 17-foot-high (5.2?m) walls of the redan. This first attempt was easily repulsed. Grant ordered an artillery bombardment to soften the defenses and at about 2 p.m., Sherman's division under Maj. Gen. Francis P. Blair tried again, but only a small number of men were able to advance even as far as the ditch below the redan. The assault collapsed in a melee of rifle fire and hand grenades lobbing back and forth.[11]\\r\\nThe failed Federal assaults of May 19 damaged Union morale, deflating the confidence the soldiers felt after their string of victories across Mississippi. They were also costly, with casualties of 157 killed, 777 wounded, and 8 missing, versus Confederate casualties of 8 killed and 62 wounded. The Confederates, assumed to be demoralized, had regained their fighting edge.[12]\\r\\nGrant planned another assault for May 22, but this time with greater care; they would first reconnoiter thoroughly and soften up the defenses with artillery and naval gunfire. The lead units were supplied with ladders to ascend the fortification walls. Grant did not want a long siege, and this attack was to be by the entire army across a wide front.[13]\\r\\nDespite their bloody repulse on May 19, Union troops were in high spirits, now well-fed with provisions they had foraged. On seeing Grant pass by, a soldier commented, \\"Hardtack\\". Soon all Union troops in the vicinity were yelling, \\"Hardtack! Hardtack!\\" The Union served hardtack, beans, and coffee the night of May 21. Everyone expected that Vicksburg would fall the next day.[14]\\r\\nUnion forces bombarded the city all night, from 220 artillery pieces and naval gunfire from Rear Adm. David D. Porter's fleet in the river, and while causing little property damage, they damaged Confederate civilian morale. On the morning of May 22, the defenders were bombarded again for four hours before the Union attacked once more along a three-mile front at 10 a.m.[15]\\r\\nSherman attacked once again down the Graveyard Road, with 150 volunteers (nicknamed the Forlorn Hope detachment) leading the way with ladders and planks, followed by the divisions of Blair and Brig. Gen. James M. Tuttle, arranged in a long column of regiments, hoping to achieve a breakthrough by concentrating their mass on a narrow front. They were driven back in the face of heavy rifle fire. Blair's brigades under Cols. Giles A. Smith and T. Kilby Smith made it as far as a ridge 100 yards from Green's Redan, the southern edge of the Stockade Redan, from where they poured heavy fire into the Confederate position, but to no avail. Tuttle's division, waiting its turn to advance, did not have an opportunity to move forward. On Sherman's far right, the division of Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele spent the morning attempting to get into position through a ravine of the Mint Spring Bayou.[16]\\r\\nMcPherson's corps was assigned to attack the center along the Jackson Road. On their right flank, the brigade of Brig. Gen. Thomas E. G. Ransom advanced to within 100 yards of the Confederate line, but halted to avoid dangerous flanking fire from Green's Redan. On McPherson's left flank, the division of Maj. Gen. John A. Logan was assigned to assault the 3rd Louisiana Redan and the Great Redoubt. The brigade of Brig. Gen. John E. Smith made it as far as the slope of the redan, but huddled there, dodging grenades until dark before they were recalled. Brig. Gen. John D. Stevenson's brigade advanced well in two columns against the redoubt, but their attack also failed when they found their ladders were too short to scale the fortification. Brig. Gen. Isaac F. Quinby's division advanced a few hundred yards, but halted for hours while its generals engaged in confused discussions.[17]\\r\\nOn the Union left, McClernand's corps moved along the Baldwin Ferry Road and astride the Southern Railroad of Mississippi. The division of Brig. Gen. Eugene A. Carr was assigned to capture the Railroad Redoubt and the 2nd Texas Lunette; the division of Brig. Gen. Peter J. Osterhaus was assigned the Square Fort. Carr's men achieved a small breakthrough at the 2nd Texas Lunette and requested reinforcements.[18]\\r\\nBy 11 a.m., it was clear that a breakthrough was not forthcoming and the advances by Sherman and McPherson were failures. Just then, Grant received a message from McClernand, which stated that he was heavily engaged, the Confederates were being reinforced, and he requested a diversion on his right from McPherson's corps. Grant initially refused the request, telling McClernand to use his own reserve forces for assistance; Grant was mistakenly under the impression that McClernand had been lightly engaged and McPherson heavily, although the reverse was true. McClernand followed up with a message that was partially misleading, implying that he had captured two forts\\"The Stars and Stripes are flying over them.\\"and that another push along the line would achieve victory for the Union Army. Although Grant once again demurred, he showed the dispatch to Sherman, who ordered his own corps to advance again. Grant, reconsidering, then ordered McPherson to send Quinby's division to aid McClernand.[19]\\r\\nSherman ordered two more assaults. At 2:15?p.m., Giles Smith and Ransom moved out and were repulsed immediately. At 3 p.m., Tuttle's division suffered so many casualties in their aborted advance that Sherman told Tuttle, \\"This is murder; order those troops back.\\" By this time, Steele's division had finally maneuvered into position on Sherman's right, and at 4 p.m., Steele gave the order to charge against the 26th Louisiana Redoubt. They had no more success than any of Sherman's other assaults.[21]\\r\\nIn McPherson's sector, Logan's division made another thrust down the Jackson Road at about 2 p.m., but met with heavy losses and the attack was called off. McClernand attacked again, reinforced by Quinby's division, but with no success. Union casualties were 502 killed, 2,550 wounded, and 147 missing, about evenly divided across the three corps. Confederate casualties were not reported directly, but are estimated to be under 500. Grant blamed McClernand's misleading dispatches for part of the poor results of the day, storing up another grievance against the political general who had caused him so many aggravations during the campaign.[22]\\r\\nHistorian Shelby Foote wrote that Grant \\"did not regret having made the assaults; he only regretted that they had failed.\\"[23] Grant reluctantly settled into a siege. On May 25, Lt. Col. John A. Rawlins issued Special Orders No. 140 for Grant: \\"Corps Commanders will immediately commence the work of reducing the enemy by regular approaches. It is desirable that no more loss of life shall be sustained in the reduction of Vicksburg, and the capture of the Garrison. Every advantage will be taken of the natural inequalities of the ground to gain positions from which to start mines, trenches, or advance batteries. ...\\"[24] Grant wrote in his memoirs, \\"I now determined upon a regular siegeto 'out-camp the enemy,' as it were, and to incur no more losses.\\"[25]\\r\\nFederal troops began to dig in, constructing elaborate entrenchments (the soldiers of the time referred to them as \\"ditches\\") that surrounded the city and moved closer and closer to the Confederate fortifications. With their backs against the Mississippi and Union gunboats firing from the river, Confederate soldiers and citizens alike were trapped. Pemberton was determined to hold his few miles of the Mississippi as long as possible, hoping for relief from Johnston or elsewhere.[26]\\r\\nA new problem confronted the Confederates. The dead and wounded of Grant's army lay in the heat of Mississippi summer, the odor of the deceased men and horses fouling the air, the wounded crying for medical help and water. Grant first refused a request of truce, thinking it a show of weakness. Finally he relented, and the Confederates held their fire while the Union recovered the wounded and dead, soldiers from both sides mingling and trading as if no hostilities existed for the moment.[27]\\r\\nAfter this truce, Grant's army began to fill the 12-mile ring around Vicksburg. In short time it became clear that even 50,000 Union soldiers would not be able to effect a complete encirclement of the Confederate defenses. Pemberton's outlook on escape was pessimistic, but there were still roads leading south out of Vicksburg unguarded by Federal troops. Grant found help from Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, the Union general-in-chief. Halleck quickly began to shift Union troops in the West to meet Grant's needs. The first of these reinforcements to arrive along the siege lines was a 5,000 man division from the Department of the Missouri under Maj. Gen. Francis J. Herron on June 11. Herron's troops, remnants of the Army of the Frontier, were attached to McPherson's corps and took up position on the far south. Next came a three division detachment from the XVI Corps led by Brig. Gen. Cadwallader C. Washburn on June 12, assembled from troops at nearby posts of Corinth, Memphis, and LaGrange. The final significant group of reinforcements to join was the 8,000 man strong IX Corps from the Department of the Ohio, led by Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, arriving on June 14. With the arrival of Parke, Grant had 77,000 men around Vicksburg.[28]\\r\\nIn an effort to cut Grant's supply line, Confederates in Louisiana under Major General John G. Walker attacked Milliken's Bend up the Mississippi on June 7. This was mainly defended by untrained colored troops, who fought bravely with inferior weaponry and finally fought off the rebels with help from gunboats, although at horrible cost; the defenders lost 652 to the Confederate 185. The loss at Milliken's Bend left the Confederates with no hope for relief but from the cautious Johnston.[29]\\r\\nPemberton was boxed in with lots of inedible munitions and little food. The poor diet was showing on the Confederate soldiers. By the end of June, half were out sick or hospitalized. Scurvy, malaria, dysentery, diarrhea, and other diseases cut their ranks. At least one city resident had to stay up at night to keep starving soldiers out of his vegetable garden. The constant shelling did not bother him as much as the loss of his food. As the siege wore on, fewer and fewer horses, mules, and dogs were seen wandering about Vicksburg. Shoe leather became a last resort of sustenance for many adults.[31]\\r\\nDuring the siege, Union gunboats lobbed over 22,000 shells into the town and army artillery fire was even heavier. As the barrages continued, suitable housing in Vicksburg was reduced to a minimum. A ridge, located between the main town and the rebel defense line, provided a diverse citizenry with lodging for the duration. Over 500 caves, known locally as \\"bombproofs,\\" were dug into the yellow clay hills of Vicksburg. Whether houses were structurally sound or not, it was deemed safer to occupy these dugouts. People did their best to make them comfortable, with rugs, furniture, and pictures. They tried to time their movements and foraging with the rhythm of the cannonade, sometimes unsuccessfully. Because of the citizens' burrowing, the Union soldiers gave the town the nickname of \\"Prairie Dog Village.\\" Despite the ferocity of the Union fire against the town, fewer than a dozen civilians were known to have been killed during the entire siege.[32]\\r\\nOne of Grant's actions during the siege was to settle a lingering rivalry. On May 30, General McClernand wrote a self-adulatory note to his troops, claiming much of the credit for the soon-to-be victory. Grant had been waiting six months for him to slip, ever since they clashed early in the campaign, around the Battle of Arkansas Post. He had received permission to relieve McClernand in January 1863 but waited for an unequivocal provocation. Grant finally relieved McClernand on June 18. He so diligently prepared his action that McClernand was left without recourse. McClernand's XIII Corps was turned over to Maj. Gen. Edward Ord, recovered from a wound sustained at Hatchie's Bridge. In May 1864, McClernand was restored to a command in remote Texas.[33]\\r\\nAnother command change occurred on June 22. In addition to Pemberton at his front, Grant had to be concerned with Confederate forces in his rear under the command of Joseph E. Johnston. He stationed one division in the vicinity of the Big Black River Bridge and another reconnoitered as far north as Mechanicsburg, both to act as a covering force. By June 10, the IX Corps, under Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, was transferred to Grant's command. This corps became the nucleus of a special task force whose mission was to prevent Johnston, gathering his forces at Canton, from interfering with the siege. Sherman was given command of this task force and Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele replaced him at the XV Corps. Johnston eventually began moving to relieve Pemberton and reached the Big Black River on July 1, but he delayed a potentially difficult encounter with Sherman until it was too late for the Vicksburg garrison, and then fell back to Jackson.[34] Sherman would eventually pursue Johnston and (re)capture Jackson on July 17.\\r\\nThroughout the siege Union and Confederate forces kept busy in a supporting role on the Louisiana side of the Mississippi River. Lt. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, received a telegraph from Pemberton on May 9 requesting a movement against Grant's communication lines along the Mississippi River. Grant had established important supply depots at Milliken's Bend, Young's Point, and Lake Providence within Smith's jurisdiction, but Smith failed to recognize the importance of Pemberton's situation. It was not until June when Smith finally decided to take action on Pemberton's request, directing Maj. Gen. Richard Taylor to \\"do something\\" in favor of the Vicksburg garrison.[35] Taylor commanded the District of Western Louisiana and developed a three-pronged campaign against Grant's three supply depots. All three of Taylor's assaults were defeated (see Battle of Milliken's Bend, Battle of Young's Point and Battle of Lake Providence).\\r\\nIn response to the growing Confederate activity in the area, Grant decided to dispatch troops from the Vicksburg trenches across the river. The presence of Maj. Gen. John G. Walker's Confederate division on the Louisiana side was of particular concern; its presence could possibly aid a Confederate escape from Vicksburg. Therefore, Brig. Gen. Alfred W. Ellet's Mississippi Marine Brigade and Joseph A. Mower's brigade from Sherman's corps were ordered to the vicinity of Milliken's Bend. Mower and Ellet were to cooperate against Walker's division, which was stationed in the vicinity of Richmond, Louisiana. Richmond also happened to be an important supply line providing Vicksburg with food from Louisiana. On June 15, Ellet and Mower defeated Walker and destroyed Richmond, Louisiana.[36]\\r\\nEllet's men returned to De Soto Point and constructed an artillery battery targeting an iron foundry recasting spent Union artillery shells. Construction was begun on June 19, which placed a 20-pounder Parrott rifle in a casemate of railroad iron. The targeted foundry was destroyed on June 25 and the next day a second Parrott gun was added to the battery, which continued to harass the defenders until the garrison's surrender.[37]\\r\\nAdditional Confederate activity in Louisiana occurred on June 29 at Goodrich's Landing. Confederates attacked a plantation and army training center run by former slaves. The Confederates destroyed the plantations and captured over a hundred former slaves before disengaging in the face of Ellet's Marines. Confederate raids such as these were disruptive and caused damage, but they were only minor setbacks and showed the Confederates could cause only momentary disturbances in the area.[38]\\r\\nLate in the siege, Union troops tunneled under the 3rd Louisiana Redan and packed the mine with 2,200 pounds of gunpowder. The explosion blew apart the Confederate lines on June 25, while an infantry attack made by troops from Logan's XVII Corps division, followed the blast. The 45th Illinois Regiment (known as the \\"Lead Mine Regiment\\"), under Col. Jasper A. Maltby, charged into the 40-foot (12?m) diameter, 12-foot (3.7?m) deep crater with ease, but were stopped by recovering Confederate infantry. The Union soldiers became pinned down while the defenders also rolled artillery shells with short fuses into the pit with deadly results. Union engineers worked to set up a casemate in the crater in order to extricate the infantry, and soon the soldiers fell back to a new defensive line. From the crater left by the explosion on June 25, Union miners worked to dig a new mine to the south. On July 1, this mine was detonated but no infantry attack followed. Pioneers worked throughout July 2 and 3 to widen the initial crater large enough for an infantry column of four to pass through for future anticipated assaults. However, events the following day negated the need for any further assaults.[39]\\r\\nOn July 3, Pemberton sent a note to Grant regarding the possibility of negotiations for peace. Grant, as he had done at Fort Donelson, first demanded unconditional surrender. But Grant reconsidered, not wanting to feed 30,000 hungry Confederates in Union prison camps, and offered to parole all prisoners. Considering their destitute state, dejected and starving, he never expected them to fight again; he hoped they would carry home the stigma of defeat to the rest of the Confederacy. In any event, it would have occupied his army and taken months to ship that many prisoners north.[40] Pemberton officially surrendered his army on July 4.[41] Most of the men who were paroled on July 6 were exchanged and received back into the Confederate Army on August 4, 1863, at Mobile Harbor, Alabama. They were back in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by September and some fought in the Battles for Chattanooga in November and against Sherman's invasion of Georgia in May 1864. The Confederate government protested the validity of the paroles on technical grounds and the issue was referred to Grant who, in April 1864, was general in chief of the Army. The dispute effectively ended all further prisoner exchanges during the war except for hardship cases.[42]\\r\\nSurrender was formalized by an old oak tree, \\"made historical by the event.\\" In his Personal Memoirs, Grant described the fate of this luckless tree:\\r\\nIt was but a short time before the last vestige of its body, root and limb had disappeared, the fragments taken as trophies. Since then the same tree has furnished as many cords of wood, in the shape of trophies, as the 'True Cross'.[43]\\r\\nThe surrender was finalized on July 4, Independence Day, a day Pemberton had hoped would bring more sympathetic terms from the United States. Although the Vicksburg Campaign continued with some minor actions, the fortress city had fallen and, with the surrender of Port Hudson on July 9, the Mississippi River was firmly in Union hands and the Confederacy split in two. President Lincoln famously announced, \\"The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea.\\"[44]\\r\\nUnion casualties for the battle and siege of Vicksburg were 4,835; Confederate were 32,697 (29,495 surrendered).[4] The full campaign, since March 29, claimed 10,142 Union and 9,091 Confederate killed and wounded. In addition to his surrendered men, Pemberton turned over to Grant 172 cannons and 50,000 rifles.[45]\\r\\nFolk tradition holds that the Fourth of July (Independence Day) holiday was not celebrated by Vicksburg until World War II.[46] This claim is false, for large Independence Day celebrations were held as early as 1907.[47]\\r\\nThe works around Vicksburg are now maintained by the National Park Service as part of Vicksburg National Military Park. The park, located in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Delta, Louisiana (flanking the Mississippi River), also commemorates the greater Vicksburg Campaign which led up to the battle. Reconstructed forts and trenches evoke memories of the 47-day siege that ended in the surrender of the city. Victory here and at Port Hudson, farther south in Louisiana, gave the Union control of the Mississippi River. The park includes 1,325 historic monuments and markers, 20 miles (32?km) of historic trenches and earthworks, a 16-mile (26?km) tour road, a 12.5-mile (20.1?km) walking trail, two antebellum homes, 144 emplaced cannons, the restored gunboat USS Cairo (sunk on December 12, 1862, on the Yazoo River), and the Grant's Canal site, where the Union Army attempted to build a canal to let their ships bypass Confederate artillery fire.","input":"What was the result of the battle of vicksburg?"},{"output":"water","context":"The dihydrogen monoxide hoax involves calling water by the unfamiliar chemical name \\"dihydrogen monoxide\\" (DHMO), and listing some of water's effects in a particularly alarming manner, such as accelerating corrosion and causing suffocation. The hoax often calls for dihydrogen monoxide to be banned, regulated, and labeled as hazardous. It illustrates how a lack of scientific literacy and an exaggerated analysis can lead to misplaced fears.[1]\\r\\nThe hoax gained renewed popularity in the late 1990s when a 14-year-old student, Nathan Zohner,[2] collected anti-DHMO petitions for a science project about gullibility.[3] The story has since been used in science education to encourage critical thinking and discussion of the scientific method.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1983 April Fools' Day edition of the Durand Express, a weekly newspaper in Durand, Michigan, reported that \\"dihydrogen oxide\\" had been found in the city's water pipes, and warned that it was fatal if inhaled, and could produce blistering vapors.[6] The first appearance of the hoax on the Internet was attributed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette to the so-called \\"Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide\\",[7][8] a parody organization at UC Santa Cruz following on-campus postings and newsgroup discussions in 1990.[9]\\r\\nThis new version of the hoax was created by Eric Lechner, Lars Norpchen, and Matthew Kaufmanhousemates while attending the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1989ÿ1990,[7][9][better?source?needed] revised by Craig Jackson in 1994,[7] and brought to widespread public attention in 1997 when Nathan Zohner, a 14-year-old student, gathered petitions to ban \\"DHMO\\" as the basis of his science project, titled \\"How Gullible Are We?\\"[3]\\r\\nJackson's original site included the following warning:[10][11]\\r\\nDihydrogen monoxide:\\r\\nDespite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:\\r\\nA mock material safety data sheeta list of information about potentially dangerous materials used in research and industryhas also been created for H2O.[12][13]\\r\\nThe water molecule has the chemical formula H2O, meaning each molecule of water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Literally, the term \\"dihydrogen monoxide\\" means \\"two hydrogen, one oxygen\\", consistent with its molecular formula: the prefix di- in dihydrogen means \\"two\\", the prefix mon- in monoxide means \\"one\\", and an oxide is an oxygen atom attached to another atom in an ionic compound.[14]\\r\\nUsing chemical nomenclature, various names for water are in common use within the scientific community. Some such names include hydrogen oxide, as well as an alkali name of hydrogen hydroxide, and several acid names such as hydric acid, hydroxic acid, hydroxyl acid, and hydroxilic acid. The term \\"hydroxyl acid\\" used in the original text is a non-standard name.[15][not in citation given]\\r\\nUnder the 2005 revisions of IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry, there is no single correct name for every compound.[16] The primary function of chemical nomenclature is to ensure that each name refers, unambiguously, to a single substance. It is considered less important to ensure that each substance should have a single unambiguous name, although the number of acceptable names is limited.[16] Water is one acceptable name for this compound, even though it is neither a systematic nor an international name and is specific to just one phase of the compound (its liquid form). The other IUPAC recommendation is oxidane,[17] which is used by hoax industry groups promoting DHMO as a safe industrial chemical while hinting at dangers and government conspiracies.[18]","input":"What is the common name of dihydrogen monoxide?"},{"output":"misdemeanor","context":"Illegal entry is the act of foreign nationals arriving in or crossing the borders into a country in violation of its immigration law.\\r\\n\\r\\nMigrants from nations that do not have automatic visa agreements, or who would not otherwise qualify for a visa, often cross the borders illegally in some areas like the United StatesÿMexico border, the Mona Channel between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, the Strait of Gibraltar, Fuerteventura, and the Strait of Otranto. These methods are often dangerous: migrants have been known to suffocate in shipping containers,[1] boxcars[2] and trucks,[3] sink in shipwrecks caused by unseaworthy vessels[4] or die of dehydration[5] or exposure during long walks without water.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman smuggling is the practice of intermediaries aiding undocumented migrants in crossing international borders for financial gain, often in large groups. Human smuggling differs from, but is sometimes associated with, human trafficking. A human smuggler will facilitate illegal entry into a country for a fee, but on arrival at their destination, the smuggled person is usually free. Trafficking involves a process of using physical force, fraud, or deception to obtain and transport people, usually for the purpose of forced labor or prostitution at the destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently, India is constructing a fence along the border to restrict illegal traffic from Bangladesh.[7] The Indo-Bangladeshi barrier is 4,000 kilometers (2,500?mi) long.  The stated aim of the fence is to stop infiltration of terrorists, prevent smuggling, and to bring a close to illegal immigration from Bangladesh.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia, mandatory immigration detention was revived in 1992 for all foreigners who arrive in Australia without a visa. That only \\"border applicants\\" are subject to detention has sparked criticism, as it is claimed to unfairly discriminate against certain migrants.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuspected Irregular Entry Vessel was the name used by the Australian Defence Force or Australian Coastwatch for maritime vessels which were suspected to be attempting to reach Australia without authorisation. In practice, these boats were often carrying asylum seekers who had departed from Indonesia on the final leg of a journey which started in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan after paying people smugglers.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1933-1948, the British government limited Jewish immigration to Palestine with quotas, and following the rise of Nazism to power in Germany, illegal immigration to Palestine commenced. The illegal immigration was known as Aliyah Bet (\\"secondary immigration\\"), or Ha'apalah, and was organized by the Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, as well as by the Irgun. Immigration was done mainly by sea, and to a lesser extent overland through Iraq and Syria. Beginning in 1939 Jewish immigration was further restricted, limiting it to 75,000 individuals for a period of five years after which immigration was to end completely. During World War II and the years that followed until independence, Aliyah Bet became the main form of Jewish immigration to Palestine. Despite British efforts to curb the illegal immigration, during the 14 years of its operation, 110,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkey, which is a transit point for unauthorized migrants trying to reach Europe, has been accused of being unable to secure its borders with Greece. Since 1996, 40 unauthorized migrants have been killed by mines, after entering Greek territory in Evros.[11] In 2001, about 800 illegal immigrants were rescued by the Greek coastguards after a fire broke out on board the Turkish-flagged Brelner, believed to have set sail from the Turkish port of ?zmir, probably en route to Italy.[12]  Once in July 2004 and a second time in May 2006, Hellenic Coast Guard ships were caught on film cruising as near as a few hundred meters off the Turkish coast and abandoning clandestines to the sea. This practice resulted in the drowning of six people between Chios and Karaburun on 26 September 2006 while three others disappeared and 31 were saved by Turkish gendarmes and fishermen.  Three of the drowned were Tunisians, one was Algerian, one Palestinian and the other Iraqi. The three disappeared were also Tunisians.[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of bilateral negotiations, a readmission agreement was signed between Turkey and Greece in November 2001 and went into effect in April 2002. For third country nationals, this protocol gives the parties 14 days to inform each other of the number of persons to be returned after the date of illegal entry. For nationals of the two countries the authorities can make use of simplified procedures. But the strict application of the agreement is reported to have retrograded as of 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople's Republic of China is building a security barrier along its border with North Korea to prevent defectors or refugees from North Korea from entering the country illegally.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 13, 2004, the People's Republic of China sentenced Yang Jianli, a Chinese dissident with U.S. residency, to five years in prison for espionage and illegal entry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe illegal entry of Vietnamese refugees was a concern for the Hong Kong government for 25 years. The issue was first resolved in 2000. Between 1975 and 1999, 143,700 Vietnamese refugees were resettled in other countries and more than 67,000 Vietnamese migrants were repatriated.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 23 March 2007, 15 British Royal Navy personnel, from HMS Cornwall, were surrounded by the Navy of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and were subsequently detained off the Iraq-Iran coast. Iran's director general for Western European affairs, Ibrahim Rahimpour, said that the British boats had made \\"illegal entry\\" into Iranian territorial waters and that the personnel \\"were arrested by border guards for investigation and questioning\\".[18] On 24 March, the Iranian Fars News Agency said the navigational equipment seized on the British boats shows the sailors were aware that they were operating in Iranian waters. On the same day, General Ali Reza Afshar, a top military official, said the sailors had confessed to illegal entry into Iran's waters.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 25, 2008, Egyptian security forces blocked almost all illegal entry points along the border with Gaza to try to stem the flow of Palestinians wanting to leave.[20] Egyptian forces in riot gear erected barbed wire and chain-link fences along the border to prevent more Palestinians from crossing.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 5, 2006, 231 Hmong refugees fleeing Laos were detained by police in Amphoe Khao Kho, Phetchabun Province for illegal entry into Thailand.

The MalaysiaÿPhilippines border normally used by Mindanao people via Celebes Sea.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are an estimated half a million illegal entries into the United States each year.[23] Six to seven million people reside in the United States after having evaded the Immigration Inspectors or Border Patrol.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe illegal entry of non-nationals into the United States is a misdemeanor according to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which prohibits non-nationals from entering or attempting to enter the United States at any time or place which has not been designated by an immigration officer, and also prohibits non-nationals from eluding inspection by immigration officers.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection is responsible for apprehending individuals attempting to enter the United States illegally. The United States Border Patrol is its mobile uniformed law enforcement arm, responsible for deterrence, detection and apprehension of those who enter the United States without authorization from the government or outside the designated ports of entry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unfenced, rural mountainous and desert border between Arizona and Mexico has become a major entrance area for unlawful migration to the United States, due in part to the increased difficulty of crossing illegally into California. Each year \\r\\nthere are several hundred migrant deaths along the Mexico-U.S. border.[26] Often, migrants employ people smugglers (known as \\"coyotes\\") who promise a safe passage into the United States and are paid up to 3 to 4 thousand[clarification needed] for passages that include long walking distances or 7 to 14 thousand[clarification needed] for an easier travel per person they assist in crossing the border.[27] The difficulty and expense of the journey has prompted many migrant workers to stay in the United States longer or indefinitely.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the U.S. Border Patrol, there were 1,954 migrant deaths along the Mexico-U.S. border between 1998 and 2004.[29] In 1993, 283 Chinese migrants attempted illegal entry into the United \\r\\nStates via a sea vessel; ten of them arrived dead. Reference: Bill Ward[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nA recent study into irregular immigration to the United Kingdom states that \\"most irregular migrants have committed administrative offences rather than a serious crime\\".[32] In 2004, illegal entry action was initiated against 36,550 migrants; it was estimated that more migrants overstay their visa than enter clandestinely, hence considered unlikely that there are large numbers of people crossing UK borders without permission.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the routes for clandestine entry are very dangerous. There were 72 documented deaths that are thought to have occurred while entering UK between 1993 and 2002.[32] The most common cause of death while entering the UK (61 of the deaths recorded) was suffocation in a lorry while being smuggled into the UK by ferry; Others drowned in the English Channel, froze to death as stowaways on an aeroplane and were crushed by trains in the Channel Tunnel.[32]","input":"What is the charge for entering the u.s. illegally?"},{"output":"Stephen Curry","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest-paid NBA players by season over the past twelve seasons have received contracts with salaries noted in the twenty-million-dollar range. In this twelve-year span, Kevin Garnett received $28,000,000, which was the highest salary payment of any NBA player, during the 2003ÿ04 season. Garnett has been the highest-paid NBA player per year in seven of the past twelve NBA seasons. Michael Jordan was the first NBA player to sign a contract worth over thirty million dollars in a season. During the 1997ÿ98 season, Jordan earned $33,140,000, which still stands as the most any NBA player has earned on a 1 year contract, Jordan also holds the record for the second largest 1 year contract at $30,140,000 in the 1996-97 season. Kobe Bryant become just the second player to reach this milestone when the 2013ÿ14 season began.[1] LeBron James became the third in the 2016ÿ17 season. Stephen Curry became the first player to eclipse $40-Million per year when he signed a record 5-year contract worth $201-Million in 2017, starting with $34,682,550 in the 2017-18 season and ending with the largest earnings in the 2021-22 season with a record payout of $45,780,966.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in the 1984ÿ85 NBA season, the NBA's first salary cap was introduced. The NBA salary cap is the maximum dollar amount each NBA team can spend on its players for the season. However, the NBA uses a \\"soft\\" salary cap, which means that significant \\"salary exceptions\\" allow NBA teams to exceed their allotted amount in order to sign players. The salary cap is determined during the offseason, but as stated earlier, it is liable to change.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn exception is necessary to sign a player for a contract that would exceed the salary cap threshold of the \\"soft cap\\". The Larry Bird exception, more commonly known as Bird Rights, allows teams to re-sign a current player only if he has played for that particular team for a minimum of three years.[3] Another exception known as the mid-level exception allows for teams that are over the salary cap to sign one or more players as long as they do not exceed the total amount of the average NBA salary.[4] Next, the bi-annual exception can be used by teams every other year to sign a free agent(s) for up to two years at an amount set by the NBA.[5] Finally, the rookie player exception allows any NBA team to sign their first-round draft pick to a contract based upon a scale previously set forth by the NBA. Another option for teams would be to assign players to a league-assigned minimum salary contract for a maximum of two years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to 2010ÿ11 NBA season game performance, the league's best players were not its highest-paid players.

Similarly, a formal alliance does not necessarily mean that one country lies within another's sphere of influence. High levels of exclusivity have historically been associated with higher levels of conflict.\\r\\nIn more extreme cases, a country within the \\"sphere of influence\\" of another may become a subsidiary of that state and serve in effect as a satellite state or de facto colony. The system of spheres of influence by which powerful nations intervene in the affairs of others continues to the present. It is often analyzed in terms of superpowers, great powers, and/or middle powers.\\r\\nAn example of spheres of influence was China in the late 19th and early 20th Century, when Britain, France, Germany, and Russia (later replaced by Japan) had de facto control over large swaths of territory. These were taken by unequal treaties or as very long term \\"leases\\".[1] These powers (and the United States) might have their own courts, post offices, commercial institutions, railroads, and gunboats in what was on paper Chinese territory. However, the foreign powers and their influence in some cases could have been exaggerated.[2] The system ended with the Second World War.\\r\\nFor another example, during the height of its existence in World War?II, the Japanese Empire had quite a large sphere of influence. The Japanese government directly governed events in Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, and parts of China. The \\"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\\" could thus be quite easily drawn on a map of the Pacific Ocean as a large \\"bubble\\" surrounding the islands of Japan and the Asian and Pacific nations it controlled.\\r\\nSometimes portions of a single country can fall into two distinct spheres of influence. In the colonial era the buffer states of Iran and Thailand, lying between the empires of Britain/Russia and Britain/France respectively, were divided between the spheres of influence of the imperial powers. Likewise, after World War?II, Germany was divided into four occupation zones, which later consolidated into West Germany and East Germany, the former a member of NATO and the latter a member of the Warsaw Pact.\\r\\nThe term is also used to describe non-political situations, e.g., a shopping mall is said to have a sphere of influence which designates the geographical area where it dominates the retail trade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany areas of the world are considered to have inherited culture from a previous sphere of influence, that while perhaps today halted, continues to share the same culture. Examples include the Anglosphere, Arab World, Eurosphere, Francophonie, Fran?afrique, Germanosphere, Indosphere, Latin Europe/Latin America, Lusophonie, Turkosphere, Chinese cultural sphere, Slavisphere, Hispanophone, Malay World, as well as many others.\\r\\nAccording to a secret protocol attached to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939 (revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945), Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into Nazi and Soviet spheres of influence.[3] In the North, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia were assigned to the Soviet sphere.[3] Poland was to be partitioned in the event of its \\"political rearrangement\\"the areas east of the Narev, Vistula, and San Rivers going to the Soviet Union while Germany would occupy the west.[3] Lithuania, adjacent to East Prussia, would be in the German sphere of influence, although a second secret protocol agreed in September 1939 assigned Lithuania to the USSR.[4] Another clause of the treaty stipulated that Bessarabia, then part of Romania, would join the Moldovan ASSR and become the Moldovan SSR under the control of Moscow.[3] The Soviet invasion of Bukovina on 28 June 1940 violated the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, as it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence as agreed with the Axis.[5] The USSR continued to deny the existence of the Pact's protocols until after the dissolution of the USSR when the Russian government fully acknowledged the existence and authenticity of the secret protocols.[6]\\r\\nFrom 1941 and the German attack on the Soviet Union, the Allied Coalition operated on the unwritten assumption that the Western Powers and the Soviet Union had each its own sphere of influence. The presumption of the US-British and Soviet unrestricted rights in their respective spheres started causing difficulties as the Nazi-controlled territory shrank and the allied powers successively liberated other states. The wartime spheres lacked a practical definition and it had never been determined if a dominant allied power was entitled to unilateral decisions only in the area of military activity, or could also force its will regarding political, social and economic future of other states. This overly informal system backfired during the late stages of the war and afterwards, when it turned out that the Soviets and the Western Allies had very different ideas concerning the administration and future development of the liberated regions and of Germany itself.[7]\\r\\nDuring the Cold War the Baltic states, Central Europe, some countries in Eastern Europe, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, North Korea, and, until the Sino-Soviet split, the People's Republic of China, among other countries at various times, were said to lie under the Soviet sphere of influence. Western Europe, Oceania, Japan, and South Korea, among other places, were often said to lie under the sphere of influence of the United States. However, the level of control exerted in these spheres varied and was not absolute. For instance, France and Great Britain were able to act independently to invade (with Israel) the Suez Canal (they were later forced to withdraw by joint U.S. and Soviet pressure). Later, France was also able to withdraw from the military arm of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Cuba often took positions that put it at odds with its Soviet ally, including momentary alliances with the People's Republic of China, economic reorganizations, and providing support for insurgencies in Africa and the Americas without prior approval from the Soviet Union.[citation needed]\\r\\nWith the end of the Cold War, the Eastern Bloc fell apart, effectively ending the Soviet sphere of influence. Then in 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed, replaced by the Russian Federation and several other ex-Soviet Republics who became independent states.\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, the countries of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia that became independent were often portrayed as part of the Russian Federation's \\"sphere of influence\\". According to Ulrich Speck, writing for Carnegie Europe, \\"After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the West's focus was on Russia. Western nations implicitly treated the post-Soviet countries (besides the Baltic states) as Russia's sphere of influence.\\"[8]\\r\\nIn 1997, NATO and Russia signed the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security, stating the \\"aim of creating in Europe a common space of security and stability, without dividing lines or spheres of influence limiting the sovereignty of any state.\\"[9]\\r\\nIn 2009, Russia asserted that the European Union desires a sphere of influence and that the Eastern Partnership is \\"an attempt to extend\\" it.[10] In March 2009, Sweden's foreign minister Carl Bildt stated that \\"The Eastern Partnership is not about spheres of influence. The difference is that these countries themselves opted to join\\".[10]\\r\\nFollowing the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, Vclav Havel and other former central and eastern European leaders signed an open letter stating that Russia had \\"violated the core principles of the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris... -all in the name of defending a sphere of influence on its borders.\\"[11] In April 2014, NATO stated that \\"Contrary to [the Founding Act], Russia now appears to be attempting to recreate a sphere of influence by seizing a part of Ukraine, maintaining large numbers of forces on its borders, and demanding, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recently stated, that Ukraine cannot be part of any bloc.\\"[12] Criticising Russia in November 2014, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that \\"old thinking about spheres of influence, which runs roughshod over international law\\" put the \\"entire European peace order into question\\".[13] In January 2017, British Prime Minister Theresa May said, \\"We should not jeopardise the freedoms that President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher brought to Eastern Europe by accepting President Putin's claim that it is now in his sphere of influence.\\"[14]\\r\\nIn corporate terms, the sphere of influence of a business, organization or group can show its power and influence in the decisions of other businesses/organizations/groups. Influence shows in several ways, such as in size, frequency of visits, etc. In most cases, a company described as \\"bigger\\" has a larger sphere of influence.\\r\\nFor example, the software company Microsoft has a large sphere of influence in the market of operating systems; any entity wishing to sell a software product may weigh up compatibility with Microsoft's products as part of a marketing plan.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn another example, retailers wishing to make the most profits must ensure they open their stores in the correct location. This is also true for shopping centers that, to reap the most profits, must be able to attract customers to their vicinity.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere is no defined scale measuring such spheres of influence. However, one can evaluate the spheres of influence of two shopping centers by seeing how far people are prepared to travel to each shopping center, how much time they spend in its vicinity, how often they visit, the order of goods available, etc.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor historical and current examples of significant battles over spheres of influence see:","input":"When was china divided into spheres of influence?"},{"output":"1,089","context":"De Smet is a city in and the county seat of Kingsbury County, South Dakota, United States.[8] The population was 1,089 at the 2010 census.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLocated in the area of South Dakota known as East River (east of the Missouri River, which diagonally divides the state), De Smet was platted by European Americans in 1880.[9] It was named for Belgian Father Pierre De Smet,[10] a 19th-century Jesuit missionary who worked with Native Americans in the United States and its territories for most of his life. In the mid 1880s, prairie fires and failures of crops after a three-year period of drought caused many settlers to relocate their farms and homesteads to easier areas.[11] By 1917, De Smet was a cow town, with many trains passing through every day carrying cattle to market.[12]\\r\\nDe Smet is located at 44239N 97336W? / ?44.38583N 97.55167W? / 44.38583; -97.55167 (44.385871, -97.551703).[13]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.16 square miles (3.00?km2), all of it land.[3]\\r\\nDe Smet has been assigned the ZIP code 57231 and the FIPS place code 16260.\\r\\nAs of the census[4] of 2010, there were 1,089 people, 478 households, and 290 families residing in the city.

His long career mirrored changes in American entertainment tastes and technology.  He started in the age of minstrel shows and moved to vaudeville, Broadway, the recording industry, Hollywood, radio, and television. According to dance critic Marshall Stearns, \\"Robinson's contribution to tap dance is exact and specific. He brought it up on its toes, dancing upright and swinging\\", giving tap a \\"hitherto-unknown lightness and presence.\\"[1]:pp. 186ÿ187 His signature routine was the stair dance, in which Robinson would tap up and down a set of stairs in a rhythmically complex sequence of steps, a routine that he unsuccessfully attempted to patent. Robinson is also credited with having introduced a new word, copacetic, into popular culture, via his repeated use of it in vaudeville and radio appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\nA popular figure in both the black and white entertainment worlds of his era, he is best known today for his dancing with Shirley Temple in a series of films during the 1930s, and for starring in the musical Stormy Weather (1943), loosely based on Robinson's own life, and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Robinson used his popularity to challenge and overcome numerous racial barriers, including becoming the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his lifetime and afterwards, Robinson also came under heavy criticism for his participation in and tacit acceptance of racial stereotypes of the era, with critics calling him an Uncle Tom figure. Robinson resented such criticism, and his biographers suggested that critics were at best incomplete in making such a characterization, especially given his efforts to overcome the racial prejudice of his era. In his public life Robinson led efforts to:\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite being the highest-paid black performer of the era, Robinson died penniless in 1949, and his funeral was paid for by longtime friend Ed Sullivan. Robinson is remembered for the support he gave to fellow performers, including  Fred Astaire, Lena Horne, Jesse Owens, and the Nicholas brothers.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSammy Davis, Jr. and Ann Miller credited him as a teacher and mentor, Miller saying he \\"changed the course of my life.\\" Gregory Hines produced and starred in a biographical movie about Robinson for which he won the NAACP Best actor Award. In 1989, the U.S. Congress designated May 25, Robinson's birthday, as National Tap Dance Day.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nLuther Robinson was born in Richmond, Virginia, and raised in its Jackson Ward neighborhood. His parents were Maxwell, a machine-shop worker, and Maria Robinson, a choir singer. His grandmother raised him after both parents died in 1884 when he was six years oldhis father from chronic heart disease and his mother from natural causes. Details of Robinson's early life are known only through legend, much of it perpetuated by Robinson himself. He claimed he was christened \\"Luther\\"a name he did not like. He suggested to his younger brother Bill that they should exchange names. Eventually, the exchange between the names of both brothers was made.[5]\\r\\nThe brother subsequently adopted the name of \\"Percy\\" and under that name achieved recognition as a musician.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of five, Robinson began dancing for small change, appearing as a \\"hoofer\\" or busker in local beer gardens and in front of theaters for tossed pennies. A promoter saw him performing outside the Globe Theater in Richmond and offered him a job as a \\"pick\\" in a local minstrel show. At that time, minstrel shows were staged by white performers in blackface. Pickaninnies were cute black children at the edge of the stage singing, dancing, or telling jokes.[5]: p. 39ÿ40\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1890, at the age of 13, Robinson ran away to Washington, D.C., where he did odd jobs at Benning Race Track and worked briefly as a jockey.[7] He teamed up with a young Al Jolson, with Jolson singing while Robinson danced for pennies or to sell newspapers.[5]: p. 42 In 1891 he was hired by Whallen and Martel, touring with Mayme Remington's troupe in a show titled The South Before the War, performing again as a pickaninny, despite his age.[1] He travelled with the show for over a year before growing too mature to play the role credibly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1898, he returned to Richmond where he joined the United States Army as a rifleman when the SpanishÿAmerican War broke out. He received an accidental gunshot wound from a second lieutenant who was cleaning his gun.[5]:p. 45\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 30, 1900, Robinson entered a buck-and-wing dance contest at the Bijou Theater in Brooklyn, New York, winning a gold medal and defeating Harry Swinton, star of the show In Old Kentucky and considered the best dancer of his day.[8] The resulting publicity helped Robinson to get work in numerous traveling shows, sometimes in a troupe, more frequently with a partner, though not always as a dancer (Robinson also sang and performed two-man comedy routines).[5]:pp. 50, 53\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1912, Robinson was a full partner in the duo, which had become primarily a tap dancing act, booked on both the Keith and Orpheum Circuits. The team broke up in 1914, and vaudeville performer Rae Samuels, who had performed in shows with Robinson, convinced him to meet with her manager (and husband), Marty Forkins. Under Forkins' tutelage, Robinson matured and began working as a solo act, increasing his earnings to an estimated $3,500 per week. Forkins accomplished this by inventing an alternate history for Robinson, promoting him as already being a solo act. This technique succeeded, making Robinson one of the first performers to break vaudeville's two colored rule, which forbade solo black acts.[6]:pp. 943ÿ944\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the U.S. entered World War I, the War Department set up a series of Liberty Theaters in the training camps. The  Keith and Orpheum Circuits underwrote vaudeville acts at reduced fees,[9] but Robinson volunteered to perform gratis for thousands of troops, in both black and white units of the Expeditionary Forces, receiving a commendation from the War Department in 1918.[5]:p. 98\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the early 1920s, Robinson continued his career on the road as a solo vaudeville act, touring throughout the country and most frequently visiting Chicago, where Marty Forkins, his manager, lived. From 1919ÿ1923 he was fully booked on the Orpheum Circuit, and was signed full-time by the  Keith in 1924 and 1925. In addition to being booked for 50ÿ52 weeks (an avid baseball fan, he took a week off for the World Series), Robinson did multiple shows per night, frequently on two different stages.[5]:p. 166\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1928, a white impresario, Lew Leslie, produced Blackbirds of 1928 on Broadway, a black revue for white audiences starring Adelaide Hall and Bill Robinson along with Aida Ward, Tim Moore and other black stars. The show was a huge success on Broadway, where it ran for over one year to sell-out performances. On stage, Adelaide Hall and Robinson danced and sang a duet together, which captivated the audiences. From then on, Robinson's public role was that of a dapper, smiling, plaid-suited ambassador to the white world, maintaining a connection with the black show-business circles through his continuing patronage of the Hoofers Club, an entertainer's haven in Harlem. So successful was Adelaide Hall's collaboration with Bojangles, they even appeared together on stage at the prestigious Palace Theatre (Broadway)[10] before they were teamed up together again by Marty Forkins (Robinson's manager)[11] to star in another Broadway musical titled, \\"Brown Buddies\\",[12] that opened in 1930 at the Liberty Theatre, where it ran for four months before commencing a road tour of the States.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1939, Robinson returned to the stage in The Hot Mikado, a jazz version of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. The show opened at the Broadhurst Theatre, with Robinson cast in the role of the Emperor. His rendition of My Object All Sublime stopped the show and produced eight encores. After Broadway, the show moved to the 1939 New York World's Fair, and was one of the greatest hits of the fair. August 25, 1939, was named Bill Robinson Day at the fair.[5]:p. 260\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson's next Broadway show, All in Fun (1940), was with an all-white cast. Despite having Imogene Coca, Pert Kelton, and other stars, the show received poor reviews at out-of-town tryouts in New Haven and Boston. When the white stars and co-producers, Phil Baker and Leonard Sillman, withdrew, Robinson became the star, the first time an African-American headlined an otherwise all-white production. Although the reviewers were enthusiastic about Robinson, they panned the show, and it failed to attract audiences. All in Fun closed after four performances.[5]:pp. 273ÿ275\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 1932, black stage revues waned in popularity, but Robinson remained in vogue with white audiences for more than a decade in some fourteen motion pictures produced by such companies as RKO, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures. Most of them had musical settings, in which he played old-fashioned roles in nostalgic romances.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson's film debut was in the RKO Pictures 1930 musical Dixiana. RKO was formed in part by a merger of the Keith and Orpheum theater circuits, with whom Robinson had performed as a headliner for many years. He was cast as a specialty performer in a standalone scene. This practice, customary at the time, permitted Southern theaters to remove scenes containing black performers from their showings of the film. Dixiana was followed by Robinson's first starring role, in Harlem Is Heaven (1932), which is sometimes cited as the first film with an all-black cast, even though all-black silent films preceded it and the cast of Harlem Is Heaven includes a white actor with a speaking part, as well as a few white extras. The movie was produced in New York and did not perform well financially, leading Robinson to focus on Hollywood-produced movies after that.[5]:p. 206\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea for bringing a black dancer to Fox to star with Temple in The Little Colonel was actually first proposed by Fox head Winfield Sheehan after a discussion with D. W. Griffith. Sheehan set his sights on Robinson but, unsure of his ability as an actor, arranged for a contract that was void if Robinson failed the dramatic test. Robinson passed the test and was brought in to both star with Temple and to teach her tap dancing.[14] They quickly hit it off, as Temple recounted years later:\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson walked a step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he shortened his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide smile. When he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. \\"Can I call you Uncle Billy?\\" I asked. \\"Why sure you can\\", he replied... \\"But then I get to call you darlin.'\\" It was a deal. From then on, whenever we walked together it was hand in hand, and I was always his \\"darlin.'\\"[14]\\r\\nTemple had already appeared in five films released in 1934, and had performed a tap routine with James Dunn in Stand Up and Cheer![15] After Robinson was signed by 20th Century Fox, it was decided that he would perform his famous stair dance with Temple. While Robinson liked the idea, he quickly realized that he could not teach his complex stair dance to a seven-year-old in the few days permitted by the shooting schedule. Instead, he taught Temple to kick the riser (face) of each stairstep with her toe. After watching her practice his choreography, Robinson modified his routine to mimic her movements, so that it appeared on film that she was imitating his steps. The sequence was the highlight of the film.[5]:pp. 225ÿ226\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson and Temple became the first interracial dance partners in Hollywood history. The scene was controversial for its time, and was cut out in the south along with all other scenes showing the two making physical contact. Temple and Robinson appeared in four films together: The Little Colonel, The Littlest Rebel, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and Just Around the Corner.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson and Temple became close friends as a result of his dance coaching and acting with her. Robinson carried pictures of Temple with him wherever he traveled, and Temple considered him a lifelong friend, saying in an interview \\"Bill Robinson treated me as an equal, which was very important to me. He didn't talk down to me, like to a little girl. And I liked people like that. And Bill Robinson was the best of all.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn rare occasions, Robinson departed from the stereotypes of African-Americans imposed by Hollywood studios. In a small vignette in Hooray for Love (1935), he played a mayor of Harlem modeled after his own ceremonial honor; in One Mile from Heaven (1937), he played a romantic lead opposite African-American actress Fredi Washington after Hollywood had relaxed its taboo against such roles for blacks.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson appeared opposite  Will Rogers in In Old Kentucky (1935), the last movie Rogers made prior to his death in an airplane crash. Robinson and Rogers were good friends, and after Rogers' death, Robinson refused to fly, instead travelling by train to Hollywood for his film work.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson's final film appearance was a starring role in the 1943 Fox musical Stormy Weather. Lena Horne co-starred as Robinson's love interest, and the movie also featured Fats Waller in his final movie appearance before his death, playing with Cab Calloway and his orchestra,. The Nicholas Brothers are featured in the film's final dance sequence, performing to Calloway's \\"Jumpin' Jive\\", in what Fred Astaire called \\"the greatest movie musical number he had ever seen\\".[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, Stormy Weather was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1936 until his death in 1949, Robinson made numerous radio and occasional television appearances. The distinctive sound of Robinson's tap dancing was frequently featured, but Robinson also sang, made sound effects, and told jokes and stories from his vaudeville acts.[5]:pp. 266ÿ270 He also addressed the audience directly, something very rare for a black radio performer in that era.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson also made several recordings, including one in which he demonstrated each of his tap steps and their corresponding sounds. It was also on the radio and in his recordings that Robinson introduced and popularized a word of his own invention, copacetic, which he had used for years in his vaudeville shows, and which was added to Webster's Dictionary in 1934.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle is known of Robinson's first marriage to Lena Chase in 1907. They separated in 1916, and the marriage ended in 1922. His second wife was Fannie S. Clay whom he married shortly after his divorce from Chase. They divorced in 1943. His third marriage was in 1944 to Elaine Plaines in Columbus, Ohio, and they remained together until Robinson's death in 1949. There were no children from any of the marriages.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical figures and celebrities appointed Robinson an honorary mayor of Harlem, a lifetime member of policemen's associations and fraternal orders, and a mascot of the New York Giants major league baseball team. Robinson reciprocated with open-handed generosity and frequently credited the white dancer James Barton for his contribution to his dancing style.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last theatrical project for Robinson was to have been Two Gentlemen from the South, with James Barton as the master and Robinson as his servant, in which the black and white roles reverse and eventually the two come together as equals, but the show did not open.[1]:p. 188\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson's final public appearance in 1949, a few weeks before his death, was as a surprise guest on a TV show, Ted Mack's The Original Amateur Hour, in which he emotionally embraced a competitor on the show who had tap-danced for the audience. A friend remarked, \\"he was handing over his crown, like him saying, 'this is my good-bye. '\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite being the highest-paid black performer of the first half of the twentieth century, earning more than US$2?million during his lifetime, Robinson died penniless in 1949, at the age of 71 from heart failure. His funeral was arranged and paid for by longtime friend and television host Ed Sullivan. Robinson lay in repose at the 369th Infantry Regiment Armory in Harlem, where an estimated 32,000 people filed past his open casket to pay their last respects. The schools in Harlem were closed for a half-day so that children could attend or listen to the funeral, which was broadcast over the radio. Reverend Adam Clayton Powell, Sr. conducted the service at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, and New York Mayor William O'Dwyer gave the eulogy.[23][24] Robinson is buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens, Brooklyn, New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson was successful despite the obstacle of racism. A favorite Robinson anecdote is that he seated himself in a restaurant and a customer objected to his presence. When the manager suggested that it might be better if Robinson leave, he smiled and asked, \\"Have you got a ten-dollar bill?\\" Politely asking to borrow the manager's note for a moment, Robinson added six $10 bills from his own wallet and mixed them up, then extended the seven bills together, adding, \\"Here, let's see you pick out the colored one\\". The restaurant manager served Robinson without further delay.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite earning and spending a fortune, his memories of surviving the streets as a child never left him, prompting many acts of generosity. In 1933, while in his hometown of Richmond, he saw two children caught between the heat of traffic to retrieve their ball. There was no stoplight at the intersection: Robinson went to the city and provided the money to have one installed. In 1973, a statue of \\"Bojangles\\", sculpted by Jack Witt, at the intersection of Adams and West Leigh Streets was established in a small park at the intersection.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson co-founded the New York Black Yankees baseball team in Harlem in 1936 with financier James \\"Soldier Boy\\" Semler. The team was a successful member of the Negro National League until it disbanded in 1948, after Major League Baseball was desegregated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989, a joint U.S. Senate/House resolution declared \\"National Tap Dance Day\\" to be May 25, the anniversary of Bill Robinson's birth.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson was inducted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1987.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several commonly cited anecdotes about Robinson that are likely the result of conflicting stories put out by Robinson's second wife Fanny, or his manager, Marty Forkins, or by various show business associates of Robinson. There are also numerous documented instances in which Robinson gave conflicting stories to news reporters at different times.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been claimed that Robinson served as a rifleman in World War I with New York's 15th Infantry Regiment, National Guard. The Regiment was renamed the 369th Infantry while serving under France's Fourth Army and earned the nickname the \\"Harlem Hellfighters.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to his biographer, Robinson had previously served in the SpanishÿAmerican War, where he sustained an accidental gunshot wound, was 40 when the U.S entered World War I, and received a letter of commendation from the War Department for his work during the war in boosting morale at training camps in the United States, not overseas.[5]:p. 98\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has further been claimed that, along with serving in the trenches in World War I, Robinson was also the drum major for the 369th \\"Hellfighters Band\\" and led the regimental band up Fifth Avenue on the 369th's return from overseas.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile numerous sources repeat the claim of Bill Robinson's appointment as drum major in the 369th Regiment Band, this is not mentioned in either Mr. Bojangles, the Bill Robinson biography by Jim Haskins and N. R. Mitgang, or A Life in Ragtime, the biography of James Reese Europe, the leader of the 369th regimental band.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nTales about the origin of Robinson's nickname even varied across the color line, a consequence of differing opinions of him by blacks and whites. To whites, for example, his nickname \\"Bojangles\\" meant happy-go-lucky, while the black variety artist Tom Fletcher claimed it was slang for \\"squabbler.\\"[27] Robinson himself said he got the nickname as a child in Richmond; it is the most commonly accepted version.[5]: p. 37\\r\\n\\r\\nThe date and location of Robinson's second marriage, to Fanny Clay, or even the year they met, is uncertain because the couple gave different dates and locations in interviews, possibly because they were worried about unfavorable publicity about the marriage occurring so soon after Robinson's divorce. Robinson's biographer estimates that they met in late 1920 and were married in early 1922.[5]: p. 120\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson's meeting with the man who became his manager, Marty Forkins, is said to have occurred when Robinson, working as a waiter, spilled soup on Forkins. After Robinson's death, Forkins and his wife, Rae Samuels, admitted that Samuels made the introduction after having seen Robinson perform with his partner, George Cooper. Their explanation was that the story was made up in order to obscure Robinson's & Cooper's partnership, and to more effectively promote Robinson as a solo act. The ruse was successful, making Robinson one of the first solo acts to break vaudeville's two-colored rule, which required African-American performers to work in pairs.[5]:pp. 95ÿ96\\r\\n\\r\\nA dance contest between Robinson and three other dance legends (typically Ray Bolger, Fred Astaire, and James Martin) in which Robinson emerges the victor is recounted in many places, but no verifiable source can be found describing where and when the contest might have taken place.[1]:p. 186\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson is given credit for having popularized the word and claimed to have invented it while still living in Richmond.[20] The Oxford English Dictionary lists the origins of the word as unknown and documents the earliest written use of the word in 1919, by the newspaperman and author Irving Bacheller, in his serialized book, A Man for the Ages; this was followed by uses in 1926 by Carl Van Vechten in his novel Nigger Heaven, in 1934 in Webster's New International Dictionary, and by John O'Hara in his novel Appointment in Samarra.[21] Robinson's biographer credits him with having introduced the word into popular culture via his frequent use in vaudeville, radio, and recordings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Robinson's methods for generating publicity in cities where he wasnt the headliner was to engage in \\"freak sprinting\\" races, such as running backward. In 1922, Robinson set the world record for running backward (100 yards in 13.5 seconds).[28] The record stood until 1977, when Paul Wilson ran the distance in 13.3 seconds. \\r\\n[29] Although Robinson's speed running backwards is undisputed, the circumstances in which this feat was accepted as a world record are unclear, and were likely the result of a staged publicity event rather than a sanctioned athletic contest.\\r\\n\\r\\nJerry Jeff Walker's 1968 folk song \\"Mr. Bojangles\\" indirectly makes reference to Robinson. According to Walker, it was inspired by Walker's encounter with a white street performer in the New Orleans first precinct jail, a street performer who called himself \\"Bo Jangles\\", presumably taking his pseudonym from Robinson.[30] In the song, the street performer is a heavy drinker and has a dog that died. By Robinson's own account and those of his friends, he neither smoked nor drank (although he was a frequent and avid gambler),[8]:p. 121 and he never owned a dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson came under heavy criticism for playing stereotyped roles, and took offense at such claims. Once, after being named as an \\"Uncle Tom\\" in the New York newspaper The Age, Robinson went to its office in Harlem, pistol in hand, demanding to see the editor. In his eulogy at Robinson's funeral, Rev. Adam Clayton Powell argued against the claim that Robinson was an Uncle Tom figure, focusing on Robinson's ability as an entertainer and a person to transcend color lines.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1973, the film historian Donald Bogle, in his history of African Americans in American film, refers to Robinson's role in The Littlest Rebel and other Shirley Temple movies as the \\"quintessential Uncle Tom.\\"[31] Other critics noted that such criticism fails to account for the genuine affection and chemistry between Robinson and Temple that came through on the screen, and that the role represented a breakthrough for Hollywood stereotypes in that it was the first time a black man was made the guardian of a white life. Bogle later modulated his criticism by noting that the reliable, articulate Uncle Billy character in The Littlest Rebel was a cut above the characters portrayed by Lincoln \\"Stepin Fetchit\\" Perry.[5]:pp. 229ÿ230\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 21, 1908, as a result of a dispute with a tailor over a suit, Robinson was arrested in New York City for armed robbery. On September 30, he was convicted and sentenced to 11ÿ15 years hard labor at Sing Sing prison. Robinson had failed to take the charges and trial seriously and paid little attention to mounting a defense. After his conviction, Robinson's partner, George Cooper, organized his most influential friends to vouch for him, and hired a new attorney who produced evidence that Robinson had been falsely accused. Though he was exonerated at his second trial and his accusers indicted for perjury, the trial and time spent in the Tombs (Manhattan's prison complex) affected Robinson deeply. After he was released, he made a point of registering his pistol at the local police station of each town where he performed. Robinson's second wife, Fanny, also sent a letter of introduction with complimentary tickets and other gifts to the local police chief's wife in each town ahead of Robinson's engagements.[5]:p. 164\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Jesse Owens returned from the 1936 Olympics, Robinson befriended him. Despite his fame from his four Olympic track wins, undermining Adolf Hitler's claims of Aryan supremacy, Owens found most of the offers that had been made to employ him had been nothing more than publicity stunts that had no substance. Robinson was the one exception, finding work for Owens within a few months of his return to the U.S. Robinson also introduced Owens to his manager, Marty Forkins,[32] who secured a series of demonstration races for Owens which were viewed by many as degrading to the dignity of an Olympic athlete, most notably an event in Cuba in which Owens raced against a horse.[33] As a result, Forkins and Robinson were viewed as having taken advantage of Owens. According to Forkins son, Robinson had told Owens that he should start running demonstration races that would both earn money for him and keep him in the public eye. Robinson had done many such races (including a race in which he set the world record for running backwards) and did not view them as undignified. Moreover, the events paid Owens well and provided him with a source of funds when no one else was offering him employment or helping him financially.[5]:pp. 260ÿ262 Owens made a gift to Robinson of one of his four Olympic gold medals, as a gesture of gratitude for the help Robinson had given him.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1937, Robinson caused a stir in the Harlem community by choosing a white dancer, Geneva Sawyer, as his dance partner over Jeni Le Gon in the Twentieth Century Fox film Caf Metropole (1937).[35] Le Gon had danced with him in Hooray for Love (1935) and had received favorable reviews. Sawyer had been Shirley Temple's dance coach during the time Temple and Robinson made movies together, and Sawyer had taken tap lessons from Robinson while he was teaching Temple and choreographing her routines. Robinson suggested to the producers that Sawyer could be cast as his partner if she wore blackface.[8]:pp. 125ÿ126 Le Gon's career suffered as a result, and she never worked with Robinson again. Although the scene was shot with Sawyer in blackface, the studio became convinced that a mixed-race adult couple dancing together would be too controversial: both scenes with Robinson were cut from the final version of the movie and the deleted scenes were only released in 2008 as part of a Fox DVD boxed set of Tyrone Power movies.[36]","input":"What is the real name of mr bojangles?"},{"output":"1.85-2.10","context":"Goals Against Average (GAA) is a statistic used in field hockey, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer and water polo that is the mean of goals allowed per game by a goaltender. GAA is analogous to a baseball pitcher's earned run average (ERA). In Japanese, the same translation (L޷) is used for both GAA and ERA, because of this.\\r\\nFor ice hockey, it is calculated per game by dividing the number of goals against by the number of minutes played in the game then multiplied by 60. For a season, divide the total number of goals against by the result of the total number of minutes played (also known as time on ice) multiplied by 60. Alternatively, take the number of goals against, multiply that by 60 minutes and then divide by the number of minutes played.[1] When calculating GAA, overtime goals and time on ice are included, whereas empty net and shootout goals are not.[2] It is typically given to two decimal places.\\r\\nThe top goaltenders in the National Hockey League currently have a GAA of about 1.85-2.10, although the measure of a good GAA changes as different playing styles come and go. The top goaltenders in the National Lacrosse League however, currently have a GAA of about 10.00, and the top 2005 Western Lacrosse Association goaltenders had a GAA of about 9.00. At their best, elite NCAA water polo goalies have a GAA between 3.00 and 5.00.\\r\\nSince the statistic is highly dependent on the team playing in front of a goalie, save percentage is usually considered a more accurate measure of a goaltender's skill, especially in ice hockey and lacrosse, as it takes into account the number of shots the goaltender has faced. In soccer, since it is considered a part of the goalkeeper's job to coach defenders on proper positioning to prevent opponents' shots, GAA is more commonly used to evaluate goalkeepers than save percentage.","input":"What is the average gaa in the nhl?"},{"output":"The Martian Chronicles","context":"Ray Douglas Bradbury (August 22, 1920?ÿ June 5, 2012) was an American author and screenwriter. He worked in a variety of genres, including fantasy, science fiction, horror, and mystery fiction.\\r\\nWidely known for his dystopian novel Fahrenheit 451 (1953), and his science-fiction and horror-story collections, The Martian Chronicles (1950), The Illustrated Man (1951), and I Sing the Body Electric (1969), Bradbury was one of the most celebrated 20th- and 21st-century American writers. While most of his best known work is in speculative fiction, he also wrote in other genres, such as the coming-of-age novel Dandelion Wine (1957) and the fictionalized memoir Green Shadows, White Whale (1992).\\r\\nRecipient of numerous awards, including a 2007 Pulitzer Citation, Bradbury also wrote and consulted on screenplays and television scripts, including Moby Dick and It Came from Outer Space. Many of his works were adapted to comic book, television, and film formats.\\r\\nOn his death in 2012, The New York Times called Bradbury \\"the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream\\".[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBradbury was born on August 22, 1920[3] in Waukegan, Illinois[4] to Esther (ne Moberg) Bradbury (1888ÿ1966), a Swedish immigrant, and Leonard Spaulding Bradbury (1890ÿ1957),[5] a power and telephone lineman of English descent.[6] He was given the middle name \\"Douglas\\" after the actor Douglas Fairbanks. Bradbury was related to the American Shakespeare scholar Douglas Spaulding[7] and descended from Mary Bradbury, who was tried at one of the Salem witch trials in 1692.[8]\\r\\nBradbury was surrounded by an extended family during his early childhood and formative years in Waukegan. An aunt read him short stories when he was a child.[9] This period provided foundations for both the author and his stories. In Bradbury's works of fiction, 1920s Waukegan becomes \\"Green Town\\", Illinois.\\r\\nThe Bradbury family lived in Tucson, Arizona, during 1926ÿ1927 and 1932ÿ1933 while their father pursued employment, each time returning to Waukegan. They eventually settled in Los Angeles in 1934 when Bradbury was 14 years old. The family arrived with only US$40, which paid for rent and food until his father finally found a job making wire at a cable company for $14 a week. This meant that they could stay, and Bradburywho was in love with Hollywoodwas ecstatic.\\r\\nBradbury attended Los Angeles High School and was active in the drama club. He often roller-skated through Hollywood in hopes of meeting celebrities. Among the creative and talented people Bradbury met were special-effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen and radio star George Burns. Bradbury's first pay as a writer was at the age of 14, when Burns hired him to write for the Burns and Allen show.[10][11]\\r\\nThroughout his youth, Bradbury was an avid reader and writer[12] and knew at a young age that he was \\"going into one of the arts.\\"[13] Bradbury began writing his own stories at age 11 (1931), during the Great Depression  sometimes writing on the only available paper, butcher paper.\\r\\nIn his youth, he spent much time in the Carnegie library in Waukegan, reading such authors as H. G. Wells, Jules Verne, and Edgar Allan Poe. At 12, Bradbury began writing traditional horror stories and said he tried to imitate Poe until he was about 18.[14] In addition to comics, he loved Edgar Rice Burroughs, creator of Tarzan of the Apes,[15] especially Burroughs' John Carter of Mars series. The Warlord of Mars impressed him so much that at the age of 12, he wrote his own sequel.[16] The young Bradbury was also a cartoonist and loved to illustrate. He wrote about Tarzan and drew his own Sunday panels. He listened to the radio show Chandu the Magician, and every night when the show went off the air, he would sit and write the entire script from memory.\\r\\nAs a teen in Beverly Hills, he often visited his mentor and friend science-fiction writer Bob Olsen, sharing ideas and maintaining contact. In 1936, at a secondhand bookstore in Hollywood, Bradbury discovered a handbill promoting meetings of the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society.[17] Excited to find there were others sharing his interest, Bradbury joined a weekly Thursday-night conclave at age 16.[18]\\r\\nAt age 17, Bradbury read stories published in Astounding Science Fiction, and read everything by Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, and the early writings of Theodore Sturgeon and A. E. van Vogt. Bradbury cited H. G. Wells and Jules Verne as his primary science-fiction influences. Bradbury identified with Verne, saying, \\"He believes the human being is in a strange situation in a very strange world, and he believes that we can triumph by behaving morally\\". [19] Bradbury admitted that he stopped reading genre books in his 20s and embraced a broad field of literature that included Alexander Pope and poet John Donne.[20] Bradbury had just graduated from high school when he met Robert Heinlein, then 31 years old. Bradbury recalled, \\"He was well known, and he wrote humanistic science fiction, which influenced me to dare to be human instead of mechanical.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe family lived about four blocks from the Uptown Theater on Western Avenue in Los Angeles, the flagship theater for MGM and Fox. There, Bradbury learned how to sneak in and watched previews almost every week. He rollerskated there, as well as all over town, as he put it, \\"hell-bent on getting autographs from glamorous stars. It was glorious.\\" Among stars the young Bradbury was thrilled to encounter were Norma Shearer, Laurel and Hardy, and Ronald Colman. Sometimes, he spent all day in front of Paramount Pictures or Columbia Pictures and then skated to the Brown Derby to watch the stars who came and went for meals. He recounted seeing Cary Grant, Marlene Dietrich, and Mae West, whom he learned made a regular appearance every Friday night, bodyguard in tow.[20]\\r\\nBradbury relates the following meeting with Sergei Bondarchuk, director of Soviet epic film series War and Peace, at a Hollywood award ceremony in Bondarchuk's honor:\\r\\nThey formed a long queue and as Bondarchuk was walking along it he recognized several people: \\"Oh Mr. Ford, I like your film.\\" He recognized the director, Greta Garbo, and someone else. I was standing at the very end of the queue and silently watched this. Bondarchuk shouted to me; \\"Ray Bradbury, is that you?\\" He rushed up to me, embraced me, dragged me inside, grabbed a bottle of Stolichnaya, sat down at his table where his closest friends were sitting. All the famous Hollywood directors in the queue were bewildered. They stared at me and asked each other \\"Who is this Bradbury?\\" And, swearing, they left, leaving me alone with Bondarchuk...[21]\\r\\nBradbury's first published story was \\"Hollerbochen's Dilemma\\", which appeared in the January 1938 number of Forrest J. Ackerman's fanzine Imagination!.[1] In July 1939, Ackerman gave 19-year-old Bradbury the money to head to New York for the First World Science Fiction Convention in New York City, and funded Bradbury's fanzine, titled Futuria Fantasia.[22] Bradbury wrote most of its four issues, each limited to under 100 copies.[citation needed]Between 1940 and 1947, he was a contributor to Rob Wagner's film magazine, Script.[23]\\r\\nBradbury was free to start a career in writing, when owing to his bad eyesight, he was rejected admission into the military during World War II. Having been inspired by science-fiction heroes such as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, Bradbury began to publish science-fiction stories in fanzines in 1938. Bradbury was invited by Forrest J. Ackerman[citation needed] to attend the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society, which at the time met at Clifton's Cafeteria in downtown Los Angeles. This was where he met the writers Robert A. Heinlein, Emil Petaja, Fredric Brown, Henry Kuttner, Leigh Brackett, and Jack Williamson.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1939, Bradbury joined Laraine Day's Wilshire Players Guild, where for two years, he wrote and acted in several plays. They were, as Bradbury later described, \\"so incredibly bad\\" that he gave up playwriting for two decades.[24] Bradbury's first paid piece, \\"Pendulum\\", written with Henry Hasse, was published in the pulp magazine Super Science Stories in November 1941, for which he earned $15.[25]\\r\\nBradbury sold his first story, \\"The Lake\\", for $13.75 at 22, and became a full-time writer by 24.[20] His first collection of short stories, Dark Carnival, was published in 1947 by Arkham House, a small press in Sauk City, Wisconsin, owned by writer August Derleth. Reviewing Dark Carnival for the New York Herald Tribune, Will Cuppy proclaimed Bradbury \\"suitable for general consumption\\" and predicted that he would become a writer of the caliber of British fantasy author John Collier.[26]\\r\\nAfter a rejection notice from the pulp Weird Tales, Bradbury submitted \\"Homecoming\\" to Mademoiselle, which was spotted by a young editorial assistant named Truman Capote. Capote picked the Bradbury manuscript from a slush pile, which led to its publication. Homecoming won a place in the O. Henry Award Stories of 1947.[27]\\r\\nIn UCLA's Powell Library, in a study room with typewriters for rent, Bradbury wrote his classic story of a book burning future, The Fireman, which was about 25,000 words long. It was later published at about 50,000 words under the name Fahrenheit 451, for a total cost of $9.80, due to the library's typewriter-rental fees of ten cents per half-hour.[28]\\r\\nA chance encounter in a Los Angeles bookstore with the British expatriate writer Christopher Isherwood gave Bradbury the opportunity to put The Martian Chronicles into the hands of a respected critic. Isherwood's glowing review[29] followed.\\r\\nBradbury attributed to two incidents his lifelong habit of writing every day. The first of these, occurring when he was three years old, was his mother's taking him to see Lon Chaney's performance in The Hunchback of Notre Dame.[30] The second incident occurred in 1932, when a carnival entertainer, one Mr. Electrico, touched the young man on the nose with an electrified sword, made his hair stand on end, and shouted, \\"Live forever!\\"[31] Bradbury remarked, \\"I felt that something strange and wonderful had happened to me because of my encounter with Mr. Electrico...[he] gave me a future...I began to write, full-time. I have written every single day of my life since that day 69 years ago.\\"[31] At that age, Bradbury first started to do magic, which was his first great love. If he had not discovered writing, he would have become a magician.[32]\\r\\nBradbury claimed a wide variety of influences, and described discussions he might have with his favorite poets and writers Robert Frost, William Shakespeare, John Steinbeck, Aldous Huxley, and Thomas Wolfe. From Steinbeck, he said he learned \\"how to write objectively and yet insert all of the insights without too much extra comment\\". He studied Eudora Welty for her \\"remarkable ability to give you atmosphere, character, and motion in a single line\\". Bradbury's favorite writers growing up included Katherine Anne Porter, who wrote about the American South, Edith Wharton, and Jessamyn West.[33]\\r\\nBradbury was once described as a \\"Midwest surrealist\\" and is often labeled a science-fiction writer, which he described as \\"the art of the possible.\\" Bradbury resisted that categorization, however:\\r\\nFirst of all, I don't write science fiction. I've only done one science fiction book and that's Fahrenheit 451, based on reality. It was named so to represent the temperature at which paper ignites. Science fiction is a depiction of the real. Fantasy is a depiction of the unreal. So Martian Chronicles is not science fiction, it's fantasy. It couldn't happen, you see? That's the reason it's going to be around a long time?ÿ because it's a Greek myth, and myths have staying power.[34]\\r\\nBradbury recounted when he came into his own as a writer, the afternoon he wrote a short story about his first encounter with death. When he was a boy, he met a young girl at the beach and she went out into the water and never came back. Years later, as he wrote about it, tears flowed from him. He recognized he had taken the leap from emulating the many writers he admired to connecting with his voice as a writer.[35][36]\\r\\nWhen later asked about the lyrical power of his prose, Bradbury replied, \\"From reading so much poetry every day of my life. My favorite writers have been those whove said things well.\\" He is quoted, \\"If you're reluctant to weep, you won't live a full and complete life.\\"[37]\\r\\nIn high school, Bradbury was active in both the poetry club and the drama club, continuing plans to become an actor, but becoming serious about his writing as his high school years progressed. Bradbury graduated from Los Angeles High School, where he took poetry classes with Snow Longley Housh, and short-story writing courses taught by Jeannet Johnson.[38] The teachers recognized his talent and furthered his interest in writing,[39] but he did not attend college. Instead, he sold newspapers at the corner of South Norton Avenue and Olympic Boulevard. In regard to his education, Bradbury said:\\r\\nLibraries raised me. I don't believe in colleges and universities. I believe in libraries because most students don't have any money. When I graduated from high school, it was during the Depression and we had no money. I couldn't go to college, so I went to the library three days a week for 10 years.[40][41]\\r\\nHe told The Paris Review, \\"You can't learn to write in college. It's a very bad place for writers because the teachers always think they know more than you do ÿ and they dont.\\"[42]\\r\\nBradbury described his inspiration as, \\"My stories run up and bite me in the leg -- I respond by writing them down -- everything that goes on during the bite. When I finish, the idea lets go and runs off\\".[43]\\r\\nA reinvention of Waukegan, Green Town is a symbol of safety and home, which is often juxtaposed as a contrasting backdrop to tales of fantasy or menace. It serves as the setting of his semiautobiographical classics Dandelion Wine, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and Farewell Summer, as well as in many of his short stories. In Green Town, Bradbury's favorite uncle sprouts wings, traveling carnivals conceal supernatural powers, and his grandparents provide room and board to Charles Dickens.[44] Perhaps the most definitive usage of the pseudonym for his hometown, in Summer Morning, Summer Night, a collection of short stories and vignettes exclusively about Green Town, Bradbury returns to the signature locale as a look back at the rapidly disappearing small-town world of the American heartland, which was the foundation of his roots.[45]\\r\\nBradbury wrote many short essays on the arts and culture, attracting the attention of critics in this field, but he used his fiction to explore and criticize his culture and society. Bradbury observed, for example, that Fahrenheit 451 touches on the alienation of people by media:\\r\\nIn writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451 I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap opera cries, sleep walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.[46]\\r\\nIn a 1982 essay, he wrote, \\"People ask me to predict the Future, when all I want to do is prevent it\\". This intent had been expressed earlier by other authors,[47] who sometimes attributed it to him.\\r\\nOn May 24, 1956, Bradbury appeared on television in Hollywood on the popular quiz show You Bet Your Life hosted by Groucho Marx. During his introductory comments and on-air banter with Marx, Bradbury briefly discussed some of his books and other works, including giving an overview of \\"The Veldt\\", his short story published six years earlier in The Saturday Evening Post under the title \\"The World the Children Made\\".[48]\\r\\nBradbury was a consultant for the American Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair[49] and for the original exhibit housed in Epcot's Spaceship Earth geosphere at Walt Disney World.[50][51][52] Bradbury concentrated on detective fiction in the 1980s.[53] In the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s, he also hosted The Ray Bradbury Theater, a televised anthology series based on his short stories.\\r\\nBradbury was a strong supporter of public library systems, raising money to prevent the closure of several libraries in California facing budgetary cuts. He said \\"libraries raised me\\", and shunned colleges and universities, comparing his own lack of funds during the Depression with poor contemporary students.[54] His opinion varied on modern technology. In 1985 Bradbury wrote, \\"I see nothing but good coming from computers. When they first appeared on the scene, people were saying, 'Oh my God, I'm so afraid.' I hate people like that ÿ I call them the neo-Luddites\\", and \\"In a sense, [computers] are simply books. Books are all over the place, and computers will be, too\\".[55] He resisted the conversion of his work into e-books, saying in 2010, \\"We have too many cellphones. We've got too many internets. We have got to get rid of those machines. We have too many machines now\\".[56] When the publishing rights for Fahrenheit 451 came up for renewal in December 2011, Bradbury permitted its publication in electronic form provided that the publisher, Simon & Schuster, allowed the e-book to be digitally downloaded by any library patron. The title remains the only book in the Simon & Schuster catalog where this is possible.[57]\\r\\nSeveral comic-book writers have adapted Bradbury's stories. Particularly noted among these were EC Comics' line of horror and science-fiction comics. Initially, the writers plagiarized his stories, but a diplomatic letter from Bradbury about it led to the company paying him and negotiating properly licensed adaptations of his work. The comics featuring Bradbury's stories included Tales from the Crypt, Weird Science, Weird Fantasy, Crime Suspenstories, and Haunt of Fear.\\r\\nBradbury remained an enthusiastic playwright all his life, leaving a rich theatrical legacy, as well as literary. Bradbury headed the Pandemonium Theatre Company in Los Angeles for many years and had a five-year relationship with the Fremont Centre Theatre in South Pasadena.[58]\\r\\nBradbury is featured prominently in two documentaries related to his classic 1950s-1960s era: Jason V Brock's Charles Beaumont: The Life of Twilight Zone's Magic Man,[59] which details his troubles with Rod Serling, and his friendships with writers Charles Beaumont, George Clayton Johnson, and most especially his dear friend William F. Nolan, as well as Brock's The AckerMonster Chronicles!, which delves into the life of former Bradbury agent, close friend, mega-fan, and Famous Monsters of Filmland editor Forrest J Ackerman.\\r\\nBradbury's legacy was celebrated by the bookstore Fahrenheit 451 Books in Laguna Beach, California, in the 1970s and 1980s. The grand opening of an annex to the store was attended by Bradbury and his favorite illustrator, Joseph Mugnaini, in the mid-1980s. The shop closed its doors in 1987, but in 1990, another shop with the same name (with different owners) opened in Carlsbad, California.[60]\\r\\nBradbury was married to Marguerite McClure (January 16, 1922?ÿ November 24, 2003) from 1947 until her death; they had four daughters:[61] Susan, Ramona, Bettina, and Alexandra.[62] Bradbury never obtained a driver's license, but relied on public transportation or his bicycle.[63] He lived at home until he was 27 and married. His wife of 56 years, Maggie, as she was affectionately called, was the only woman Bradbury ever dated.[20]\\r\\nHe was raised Baptist by his parents, who were themselves infrequent churchgoers. As an adult, Bradbury considered himself a \\"delicatessen religionist\\" who resisted categorization of his beliefs and took guidance from both Eastern and Western faiths. He felt that his career was \\"a God-given thing, and I'm so grateful, so, so grateful. The best description of my career as a writer is, 'At play in the fields of the Lord.'\\"[64]\\r\\nBradbury was a close friend of Charles Addams, and Addams illustrated the first of Bradbury's stories about the Elliotts, a family that resembled Addams' own Addams Family placed in rural Illinois. Bradbury's first story about them was \\"Homecoming\\", published in the 1946 Halloween issue of Mademoiselle, with Addams' illustrations. Addams and he planned a larger collaborative work that would tell the family's complete history, but it never materialized, and according to a 2001 interview, they went their separate ways.[65] In October 2001, Bradbury published all the Family stories he had written in one book with a connecting narrative, From the Dust Returned, featuring a wraparound Addams cover of the original \\"Homecoming\\" illustration.[66]\\r\\nAnother close friend was animator Ray Harryhausen, who was best man at Bradbury's wedding.[67] During a BAFTA 2010 awards tribute in honor of Ray Harryhausen's 90th birthday, Bradbury spoke of his first meeting Harryhausen at Forrest J Ackerman's house when they were both 18 years old. Their shared love for science fiction, King Kong, and the King Vidor-directed film The Fountainhead, written by Ayn Rand, was the beginning of a lifelong friendship. These early influences inspired the pair to believe in themselves and affirm their career choices. After their first meeting, they kept in touch at least once a month, in a friendship that spanned over 70 years.[68]\\r\\nLate in life, Bradbury retained his dedication and passion despite what he described as the \\"devastation of illnesses and deaths of many good friends.\\" Among the losses that deeply grieved Bradbury was the death of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, who was an intimate friend for many years. They remained close friends for nearly three decades after Roddenberry asked him to write for Star Trek, which Bradbury never did, objecting that he \\"never had the ability to adapt other people's ideas into any sensible form.\\"[20]\\r\\nBradbury suffered a stroke in 1999[69] that left him partially dependent on a wheelchair for mobility.[70] Despite this, he continued to write, and had even written an essay for The New Yorker, about his inspiration for writing, published only a week prior to his death.[71] Bradbury made regular appearances at science-fiction conventions until 2009, when he retired from the circuit.\\r\\nBradbury chose a burial place at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, with a headstone that reads \\"Author of Fahrenheit 451\\".[72][73] On February 6, 2015, The New York Times reported that the house that Bradbury lived and wrote in for 50 years of his life, at 10265 Cheviot Drive in Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, California, had been demolished by the buyer, architect Thom Mayne.[74]\\r\\nBradbury died in Los Angeles, California, on June 5, 2012, at the age of 91, after a lengthy illness.[75] Bradbury's personal library was willed to the Waukegan Public Library, where he had many of his formative reading experiences.[76]\\r\\nThe New York Times called Bradbury \\"the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream.\\"[2] The Los Angeles Times credited Bradbury with the ability \\"to write lyrically and evocatively of lands an imagination away, worlds he anchored in the here and now with a sense of visual clarity and small-town familiarity\\".[77] Bradbury's grandson, Danny Karapetian, said Bradbury's works had \\"influenced so many artists, writers, teachers, scientists, and it's always really touching and comforting to hear their stories\\".[62] The Washington Post noted several modern day technologies that Bradbury had envisioned much earlier in his writing, such as the idea of banking ATMs and earbuds and Bluetooth headsets from Fahrenheit 451, and the concepts of artificial intelligence within I Sing the Body Electric.[78]\\r\\nOn June 6, 2012, in an official public statement from the White House Press Office, President Barack Obama said:\\r\\nFor many Americans, the news of Ray Bradbury's death immediately brought to mind images from his work, imprinted in our minds, often from a young age. His gift for storytelling reshaped our culture and expanded our world. But Ray also understood that our imaginations could be used as a tool for better understanding, a vehicle for change, and an expression of our most cherished values. There is no doubt that Ray will continue to inspire many more generations with his writing, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.[79]\\r\\nNumerous Bradbury fans paid tribute to the author, noting the influence of his works on their own careers and creations.[80][81] Filmmaker Steven Spielberg stated that Bradbury was \\"[his] muse for the better part of [his] sci-fi career.... On the world of science fiction and fantasy and imagination he is immortal\\".[82] Writer Neil Gaiman felt that \\"the landscape of the world we live in would have been diminished if we had not had him in our world\\".[81] Author Stephen King released a statement on his website saying, \\"Ray Bradbury wrote three great novels and three hundred great stories. One of the latter was called 'A Sound of Thunder'. The sound I hear today is the thunder of a giant's footsteps fading away. But the novels and stories remain, in all their resonance and strange beauty.\\"[83]\\r\\nBradbury is credited with writing 27 novels and over 600 short stories.[77] More than eight million copies of his works, published in over 36 languages, have been sold around the world.[2]\\r\\nIn 1949, Bradbury and his wife were expecting their first child. He took a Greyhound bus to New York and checked into a room at the YMCA for 50 cents a night. He took his short stories to a dozen publishers and no one wanted them. Just before getting ready to go home, Bradbury had dinner with an editor at Doubleday. When Bradbury recounted that everyone wanted a novel and he did not have one, the editor, coincidentally named Walter Bradbury, asked if the short stories might be tied together into a book-length collection. The title was the editor's idea; he suggested, \\"You could call it The Martian Chronicles.\\" Bradbury liked the idea and recalled making notes in 1944 to do a book set on Mars. That evening, he stayed up all night at the YMCA and typed out an outline. He took it to the Doubleday editor the next morning, who read it and wrote Bradbury a check for $750. When Bradbury returned to Los Angeles, he connected all the short stories that became The Martian Chronicles.[33]\\r\\nWhat was later issued as a collection of stories and vignettes, Summer Morning, Summer Night, started out to be Bradbury's first true novel. The core of the work was Bradbury's witnessing of the American small-town life in the American heartland.\\r\\nIn the winter of 1955ÿ56, after a consultation with his Doubleday editor, Bradbury deferred publication of a novel based on Green Town, the pseudonym for his hometown. Instead, he extracted 17 stories and, with three other Green Town tales, bridged them into his 1957 book Dandelion Wine. Later, in 2006, Bradbury published the original novel remaining after the extraction, and retitled it Farewell Summer. These two titles show what stories and episodes Bradbury decided to retain as he created the two books out of one.\\r\\nThe most significant of the remaining unpublished stories, scenes, and fragments were published under the originally intended name for the novel, Summer Morning, Summer Night, in 2007.[84]\\r\\nFrom 1950 to 1954, 31 of Bradbury's stories were adapted by Al Feldstein for EC Comics (seven of them uncredited in six stories, including \\"Kaleidoscope\\" and \\"Rocket Man\\" being combined as \\"Home To Stay\\" - for which Bradbury was retroactively paid - and EC's first version of \\"The Handler\\" under the title \\"A Strange Undertaking\\") and 16 of these were collected in the paperbacks, The Autumn People (1965) and Tomorrow Midnight (1966), both published by Ballantine Books with cover illustrations by Frank Frazetta.\\r\\nAlso in the early 1950s, adaptations of Bradbury's stories were televised in several anthology shows, including Tales of Tomorrow, Lights Out, Out There, Suspense, CBS Television Workshop, Jane Wyman's Fireside Theatre, Star Tonight, Windows and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. \\"The Merry-Go-Round\\", a half-hour film adaptation of Bradbury's \\"The Black Ferris\\", praised by Variety, was shown on Starlight Summer Theater in 1954 and NBC's Sneak Preview in 1956. During that same period, several stories were adapted for radio drama, notably on the science fiction anthologies Dimension X and its successor X Minus One.\\r\\nProducer William Alland first brought Bradbury to movie theaters in 1953 with It Came from Outer Space, a Harry Essex screenplay developed from Bradbury's screen treatment \\"Atomic Monster\\". Three weeks later came the release of Eugne Louri's The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953), which featured one scene based on Bradbury's \\"The Fog Horn\\", about a sea monster mistaking the sound of a fog horn for the mating cry of a female. Bradbury's close friend Ray Harryhausen produced the stop-motion animation of the creature. Bradbury later returned the favor by writing a short story, \\"Tyrannosaurus Rex\\", about a stop-motion animator who strongly resembled Harryhausen. Over the next 50 years, more than 35 features, shorts, and TV movies were based on Bradbury's stories or screenplays.\\r\\nBradbury was hired in 1953 by director John Huston to work on the screenplay for his film version of Melville's Moby Dick (1956), which stars Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab, Richard Basehart as Ishmael, and Orson Welles as Father Mapple. A significant result of the film was Bradbury's book Green Shadows, White Whale, a semifictionalized account of the making of the film, including Bradbury's dealings with Huston and his time in Ireland, where exterior scenes that were set in New Bedford, Massachusetts, were filmed.\\r\\nBradbury's short story I Sing the Body Electric (from the book of the same name) was adapted for the 100th episode of The Twilight Zone. The episode was first aired on May 18, 1962.\\r\\nIn 1965, three of Bradbury's stories were adapted for the stage. These included \\"The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit\\", \\"The Day It Rained Forever\\", and \\"Device Out of Time\\". The last was adapted from his 1957 novel Dandelion Wine. The plays debuted at the Coronet Theater in Hollywood and featured Booth Coleman, Joby Baker, Fredric Villani, Arnold Lessing, Eddie Sallia, Keith Taylor, Richard Bull, Gene Otis Shane, Henry T. Delgado, F. Murray Abraham, Anne Loos, and Len Lesser. The director was Charles Rome Smith and the production company was Pandemonium Productions.\\r\\nOskar Werner and Julie Christie starred in Fahrenheit 451 (1966), an adaptation of Bradbury's novel directed by Fran?ois Truffaut.\\r\\nIn 1966, Bradbury helped Lynn Garrison create AVIAN, a specialist aviation magazine. For the first issue, Bradbury wrote a poem, \\"Planes That Land on Grass\\".\\r\\nIn 1969, The Illustrated Man was brought to the big screen, starring Rod Steiger, Claire Bloom, and Robert Drivas. Containing the prologue and three short stories from the book, the film received mediocre reviews. The same year, Bradbury approached composer Jerry Goldsmith, who had worked with Bradbury in dramatic radio of the 1950s and later scored the film version, to compose a cantata Christus Apollo based on Bradbury's text.[85] The work premiered in late 1969, with the California Chamber Symphony performing with narrator Charlton Heston at UCLA.\\r\\nIn 1972, The Screaming Woman was adapted as an ABC Movie-of-the-Week starring Olivia de Havilland.\\r\\nThe Martian Chronicles became a three-part TV miniseries starring Rock Hudson, which was first broadcast by NBC in 1980. Bradbury found the miniseries \\"just boring\\".[88]\\r\\nThe 1982 television movie The Electric Grandmother was based on Bradbury's short story \\"I Sing the Body Electric\\".\\r\\nThe 1983 horror film Something Wicked This Way Comes, starring Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce, is based on the Bradbury novel of the same name.\\r\\nIn 1984, Michael McDonough of Brigham Young University produced \\"Bradbury 13\\", a series of 13 audio adaptations of famous stories from Bradbury, in conjunction with National Public Radio. The full-cast dramatizations featured adaptations of \\"The Ravine\\", \\"Night Call, Collect\\", \\"The Veldt\\", \\"There Was an Old Woman\\", \\"Kaleidoscope\\", \\"Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed\\", \\"The Screaming Woman\\", \\"A Sound of Thunder\\", \\"The Man\\", \\"The Wind\\", \\"The Fox and the Forest\\", \\"Here There Be Tygers\\", and \\"The Happiness Machine\\". Voiceover actor Paul Frees provided narration, while Bradbury was responsible for the opening voiceover; Greg Hansen and Roger Hoffman scored the episodes. The series won a Peabody Award and two Gold Cindy awards, and was released on CD on May 1, 2010. The series began airing on BBC Radio 4 Extra on June 12, 2011.\\r\\nFrom 1985 to 1992, Bradbury hosted a syndicated anthology television series, The Ray Bradbury Theater, for which he adapted 65 of his stories. Each episode began with a shot of Bradbury in his office, gazing over mementoes of his life, which he states (in narrative) are used to spark ideas for stories. During the first two seasons, Bradbury also provided additional voiceover narration specific to the featured story and appeared on screen.\\r\\nDeeply respected in the USSR, Bradbury's fiction has been adapted into five episodes of the Soviet science-fiction TV series This Fantastic World which adapted the stories film version of \\"I Sing The Body Electric\\", Fahrenheit 451, \\"A Piece of Wood\\", \\"To the Chicago Abyss\\", and \\"Forever and the Earth\\".[89] In 1984 a cartoon adaptation of There Will Come Soft Rains (? 󿹾־ֳ ^?) came out by Uzbek director Nazim Tyuhladziev.[90] He made a film adaptation of \\"The Veldt\\" (\\"춶^\\") in 1987.[91] In 1989, a cartoon adaptation of \\"Here There Be Tygers\\" (?y^  ־Ғ^ ̰?) by director Vladimir Samsonov came out.[92]\\r\\nBradbury wrote and narrated the 1993 animated television version of The Halloween Tree, based on his 1972 novel.\\r\\nThe 1998 film The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit, released by Touchstone Pictures, was written by Bradbury. It was based on his story \\"The Magic White Suit\\" originally published in The Saturday Evening Post in 1957. The story had also previously been adapted as a play, a musical, and a 1958 television version.\\r\\nIn 2002, Bradbury's own Pandemonium Theatre Company production of Fahrenheit 451 at Burbank's Falcon Theatre combined live acting with projected digital animation by the Pixel Pups. In 1984, Telarium released a game for Commodore 64 based on Fahrenheit 451.[93] Bradbury and director Charles Rome Smith co-founded Pandemonium in 1964, staging the New York production of The World of Ray Bradbury (1964), adaptations of \\"The Pedestrian\\", \\"The Veldt\\", and \\"To the Chicago Abyss\\".\\r\\nIn 2005, the film A Sound of Thunder was released, loosely based upon the short story of the same name. The film The Butterfly Effect revolves around the same theory as A Sound of Thunder and contains many references to its inspiration. Short film adaptations of A Piece of Wood and The Small Assassin were released in 2005 and 2007, respectively.\\r\\nIn 2005, it was reported that Bradbury was upset with filmmaker Michael Moore for using the title Fahrenheit 9/11, which is an allusion to Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, for his documentary about the George W. Bush administration. Bradbury expressed displeasure with Moore's use of the title, but stated that his resentment was not politically motivated, though Bradbury was conservative-leaning politically.[94] Bradbury asserted that he did not want any of the money made by the movie, nor did he believe that he deserved it. He pressured Moore to change the name, but to no avail. Moore called Bradbury two weeks before the film's release to apologize, saying that the film's marketing had been set in motion a long time ago and it was too late to change the title.[95]\\r\\nIn 2008, the film Ray Bradbury's Chrysalis was produced by Roger Lay Jr. for Urban Archipelago Films, based upon the short story of the same name. The film won the best feature award at the International Horror and Sci-Fi Film Festival in Phoenix. The film has international distribution by Arsenal Pictures and domestic distribution by Lightning Entertainment.\\r\\nIn 2010, The Martian Chronicles was adapted for radio by Colonial Radio Theatre on the Air.\\r\\nBradbury's works and approach to writing are documented in Terry Sanders' film Ray Bradbury: Story of a Writer (1963).\\r\\nBradbury's poem \\"Groon\\" was voiced as a tribute in 2012.[96]\\r\\nThe Ray Bradbury Award for excellency in screenwriting was occasionally presented by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America ÿ presented to six people on four occasions from 1992 to 2009.[97] Beginning 2010, the Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation is presented annually according to Nebula Awards rules and procedures, although it is not a Nebula Award.[98] The revamped Bradbury Award replaced the Nebula Award for Best Script.\\r\\nBradbury appeared in the documentary The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal (1985), produced and directed by Arnold Leibovit.","input":"What was the first book ray bradbury wrote?"},{"output":"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs","context":"This list of theatrical animated feature films consists of animated films produced or released by The Walt Disney Studios, the film division of The Walt Disney Company.\\r\\nThe Walt Disney Studios releases films from Disney-owned and non-Disney owned animation studios.

For balloons, helicopters and some specialized fixed-wing aircraft (VTOL aircraft such as the Harrier), no runway is needed. Takeoff is the opposite of landing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor light aircraft, usually full power is used during takeoff. Large transport category (airliner) aircraft may use a reduced power for takeoff, where less than full power is applied in order to prolong engine life, reduce maintenance costs and reduce noise emissions. In some emergency cases, the power used can then be increased to increase the aircraft's performance. Before takeoff, the engines, particularly piston engines, are routinely run up at high power to check for engine-related problems. The aircraft is permitted to accelerate to rotation speed (often referred to as Vr). The term rotation is used because the aircraft pivots around the axis of its main landing gear while still on the ground, usually because of manipulation of the flight controls to make this change in aircraft attitude.\\r\\nThe nose is raised to a nominal 5ÿ15 nose up pitch attitude to increase lift from the wings and effect liftoff. For most aircraft, attempting a takeoff without a pitch-up would require cruise speeds while still on the runway.\\r\\nFixed-wing aircraft designed for high-speed operation (such as commercial jet aircraft) have difficulty generating enough lift at the low speeds encountered during takeoff. These are therefore fitted with high-lift devices, often including slats and usually flaps, which increase the camber and often area of the wing, making it more effective at low speed, thus creating more lift. These are deployed from the wing before takeoff, and retracted during the climb. They can also be deployed at other times, such as before landing.\\r\\nThe speeds needed for takeoff are relative to the motion of the air (indicated airspeed). A headwind will reduce the ground speed needed for takeoff, as there is a greater flow of air over the wings. Typical takeoff air speeds for jetliners are in the 130ÿ155 knot range (150ÿ180?mph, 240ÿ285?km/h). Light aircraft, such as a Cessna 150, take off at around 55 knots (63?mph, 100?km/h). Ultralights have even lower takeoff speeds. For a given aircraft, the takeoff speed is usually dependent on the aircraft weight; the heavier the weight, the greater the speed needed.[1] Some aircraft are specifically designed for short takeoff and landing (STOL), which they achieve by becoming airborne at very low speeds.\\r\\nThe takeoff speed required varies with air density, aircraft gross weight, lift coefficient, and aircraft configuration (flap or slat position, as applicable). Air density is affected by factors such as field elevation and air temperature. This relationship between temperature, altitude, and air density can be expressed as a density altitude, or the altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere at which the air density would be equal to the actual air density.\\r\\nOperations with transport category aircraft employ the concept of the takeoff V-Speeds, V1, VR and V2. These speeds are determined not only by the above factors affecting takeoff performance, but also by the length and slope of the runway and any peculiar conditions, such as obstacles off the end of the runway. Below V1, in case of critical failures, the takeoff should be aborted; above V1 the pilot continues the takeoff and returns for landing. After the co-pilot calls V1, he/she will call VR or \\"rotate,\\" marking speed at which to rotate the aircraft. The VR for transport category aircraft is calculated such as to allow the aircraft to reach the regulatory screen height at V2 with one engine failed. Then, V2 (the safe takeoff speed) is called. This speed must be maintained after an engine failure to meet performance targets for rate of climb and angle of climb.\\r\\nIn a single-engine or light twin-engine aircraft, the pilot calculates the length of runway required to take off and clear any obstacles, to ensure sufficient runway to use for takeoff. A safety margin can be added to provide the option to stop on the runway in case of a rejected takeoff. In most such aircraft, any engine failure results in a rejected takeoff as a matter of course, since even overrunning the end of the runway is preferable to lifting off with insufficient power to maintain flight.\\r\\nIf an obstacle needs to be cleared, the pilot climbs at the speed for maximum climb angle (Vx), which results in the greatest altitude gain per unit of horizontal distance travelled. If no obstacle needs to be cleared, or after an obstacle is cleared, the pilot can accelerate to the best rate of climb speed (Vy), where the aircraft will gain the most altitude in the least amount of time. Generally speaking, Vx is a lower speed than Vy, and requires a higher pitch attitude to achieve. Normally ground speed for takeoff varies between 250 km/h to 475 km/h.\\r\\nAssisted takeoff is any system for helping aircraft into the air (as opposed to strictly under its own power). The reason it might be needed is due to the aircraft's weight exceeding the normal maximum takeoff weight, insufficient power, or the available runway length may be insufficient, or a hot and high airfield, or a combination of all four factors. Assisted takeoff is also required for gliders, which do not have an engine and so are unable to take off by themselves.\\r\\nVertical takeoff refers to aircraft or rockets that take off in a vertical trajectory. Vertical takeoff eliminates the need for airfields. Most vertical take off aircraft are also able to land horizontally, but there were certain rocket-powered aircraft of the Luftwaffe that only took off vertically, landing in other ways. The Bachem Ba 349 Natter landed under a parachute after having taken off vertically. Other late Third Reich projects, such as the Heinkel P.1077 Julia or the Focke-Wulf Volksj?ger 2 climbed to their ceiling at a nearly vertical angle and landed later on a skid.[2]\\r\\nVertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft include fixed-wing aircraft that can hover, take off and land vertically as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors, such as tiltrotors.[3][4][5][6] Some VTOL aircraft can operate in other modes as well, such as CTOL (conventional take-off and landing), STOL (short take-off and landing), and/or STOVL (short take-off and vertical landing). Others, such as some helicopters, can only operate by VTOL, due to the aircraft lacking landing gear that can handle horizontal motion. VTOL is a subset of V/STOL (vertical and/or short take-off and landing).\\r\\nBesides the helicopter, there are two types of VTOL aircraft in military service: craft using a tiltrotor, such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, and some aircraft using directed jet thrust such as the Harrier family.\\r\\nA rocket launch is the takeoff phase of the flight of a rocket. Launches for orbital spaceflights, or launches into interplanetary space, are usually from a fixed location on the ground, but may also be from a floating platform such as the San Marco platform, or the Sea Launch launch vessel.","input":"At what speed does a passenger plane take off?"},{"output":"allegedly planned by the organization led by Al Capone","context":"The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre is the name given to the 1929 murder of seven members and associates of Chicago's North Side Gang. The men were gathered at a Lincoln Park garage on the morning of Valentine's Day, where they were made to line up against a wall and shot by unknown assailants. The incident resulted from the struggle between the Irish North Siders and their Italian South Side rivals, led by Al Capone, to control organized crime in the city during Prohibition.[2] Though the perpetrators have not been conclusively identified, former members of the Egan's Rats gang, working for Capone, are suspected of a significant role.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 10:30?a.m. on Thursday, February 14, 1929, seven men were murdered at the garage at 2122 North Clark Street,[3][4] in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago's North Side. They were shot by four men using weapons that included two Thompson submachine guns. Two of the shooters were dressed as uniformed policemen, while the others wore suits, ties, overcoats and hats. Witnesses saw the \\"police\\" leading the other men at gunpoint out of the garage after the shooting.\\r\\nThe victims included five members of George \\"Bugs\\" Moran's North Side Gang. Moran's second-in-command and brother-in-law, Albert Kachellek (alias James Clark), was killed along with Adam Heyer, the gang's bookkeeper and business manager, Albert Weinshank, who managed several cleaning and dyeing operations for Moran, and gang enforcers Frank Gusenberg and Peter Gusenberg. Two collaborators were also shot: Reinhardt H. Schwimmer, a former optician turned gambler and gang associate, and John May, an occasional mechanic for the Moran gang.\\r\\nWhen real Chicago police officers arrived at the scene, one of the victims, Frank Gusenberg was still alive. He was taken to the hospital, where doctors stabilized him for a short time. Police tried to question Gusenberg. When asked who shot him, Gusenberg, who had sustained fourteen bullet wounds, replied \\"No one shot me.\\" He died three hours later.[5]\\r\\nThe massacre was allegedly planned by the organization led by Al Capone to eliminate George \\"Bugs\\" Moran, the boss of the long-established North Side Gang. The former boss of the North Side Gang, Dean O'Banion, had been murdered by four gunmen in his flower shop on North State Street in 1924.[6] After the murder of O'Banion, each successive leader of the North Siders was also killed, allegedly by various members or associates of the Capone organization.\\r\\nSeveral factors contributed to the timing of the plan to kill George \\"Bugs\\" Moran. Earlier in the year, North Sider Frank Gusenberg and his brother Peter unsuccessfully attempted to murder Jack McGurn. The North Side Gang was complicit in the murders of Pasqualino \\"Patsy\\" Lolordo and Antonio \\"The Scourge\\" Lombardo. Both had been presidents of the Unione Siciliana, the local Mafia, and close associates of Capone. Moran and Capone had been vying for control of the lucrative Chicago bootlegging trade, and Bugs Moran had been moving in on several of Capone's enterprises. Moran was muscling in on a Capone-run dog track in the Chicago suburbs and he had taken over several saloons that were run by Capone, insisting they were in his territory.\\r\\nThe plan was to lure Bugs Moran to the SMC Cartage warehouse on North Clark Street on February 14, 1929. The intent was to kill Moran, and perhaps two or three of his lieutenants. It is usually assumed that the North Siders were lured to the garage with the promise of a stolen, cut-rate shipment of whiskey, supplied by Detroit's Purple Gang, which was associated with Capone. The Gusenberg brothers were supposed to drive two empty trucks to Detroit that day to pick up two loads of stolen Canadian whiskey. All of the victims, with the exception of John May, were dressed in their best clothes, as was customary for the North Siders and other gangsters at the time.\\r\\nOn St. Valentine's Day, most of the Moran gang had already arrived at the warehouse by approximately 10:30?a.m. Moran was not there, having left his Parkway Hotel apartment late. As Moran and one of his men, Ted Newberry, approached the rear of the warehouse from a side street, they saw a police car approach the building. They immediately turned and retraced their steps, going to a nearby coffee shop. They encountered another gang member, Henry Gusenberg, on the street. Henry was warned and turned back. Willie Marks, also a North Side Gang member, spotted the police car on his way to the garage. He ducked into a doorway and jotted down the license number before leaving the neighborhood.\\r\\nCapone's lookouts likely mistook one of Moran's men for Moran himself ÿ probably Albert Weinshank, who was the same height and build. That morning the physical similarity between the two men was enhanced by their dress: both happened to be wearing the same color overcoats and hats. Witnesses outside the garage saw a Cadillac sedan pull to a stop in front of the garage. Four men, two dressed in police uniform, emerged and walked inside. The two fake police officers, carrying shotguns, entered the rear portion of the garage and found members of Moran's gang and two gang collaborators, Reinhart Schwimmer and John May, who was fixing one of the trucks. The \\"police officers\\" then ordered the men to line up against the wall.\\r\\nThe two \\"police officers\\" then signaled to the pair in civilian clothes who had accompanied them. Two of the killers opened fire with Thompson sub-machine guns, one with a 20-round box magazine and the other a 50-round drum. They were thorough, spraying their victims left and right, even continuing to fire after all seven had hit the floor. The seven men were ripped apart in the volley. Two shotgun blasts afterward all but obliterated the faces of John May and James Clark, according to the coroner's report.\\r\\nTo give the appearance that everything was under control, the men in street clothes came out with their hands up, prodded by the two uniformed police officers. Inside the garage, the only survivors in the warehouse were Highball (May's dog) and Frank Gusenberg. Despite fourteen bullet wounds, he was still conscious, but died three hours later, refusing to utter a word about the identities of the killers. The Valentine's Day Massacre set off a public outcry that posed a problem for all mob bosses.[7]\\r\\nSince it was common knowledge that Moran was hijacking Capone's Detroit-based liquor shipments, police focused their attention on Detroit's predominantly Jewish Purple Gang. Mug shots of Purple members George Lewis, Eddie Fletcher, Phil Keywell and his younger brother Harry, were picked out by landladies Mrs. Doody and Mrs. Orvidson, who had taken in three men as roomers ten days before the massacre; their rooming houses were directly across the street from the Clark Street garage. Later, these women wavered in their identification, and Fletcher, Lewis, and Harry Keywell were all questioned and cleared by Chicago Police. Nevertheless, the Keywell brothers (and by extension the Purple Gang) would remain ensnared in the massacre case for all time. Many also believed what the killers wanted them to believe ÿ that the police did it.\\r\\nFebruary 22, police were called to the scene of a garage fire on Wood Street where a 1927 Cadillac Sedan was found disassembled and partially burned. It was determined that the car had been used by the killers. The engine number was traced to a Michigan Avenue dealer, who had sold the car to a James Morton of Los Angeles. The garage had been rented by a man calling himself Frank Rogers, who gave his address as 1859 West North Avenue ÿ which happened to be the address of the Circus Caf, operated by Claude Maddox, a former St. Louis gangster with ties to the Capone organization, the Purple Gang, and a St. Louis gang called Egan's Rats. Police could not turn up any information about persons named James Morton or Frank Rogers. But they had a definite lead on one of the killers. Just minutes before the killings, a truck driver named Elmer Lewis had turned a corner only a block away from 2122 North Clark and sideswiped what he took to be a police car. He told police later that he stopped immediately but was waved away by the uniformed driver, whom he noticed was missing a front tooth. The same description of the car's driver was also given by the president of the Board of Education, H. Wallace Caldwell, who had also witnessed the accident. Police knew that this description could be none other than a former member of Egan's Rats, Fred 'Killer' Burke; Burke and a close companion, James Ray, were well known to wear police uniforms whenever on a robbery spree. Burke was also a fugitive, under indictment for robbery and murder in Ohio. Police also suggested that Joseph Lolordo could have been one of the killers, because of his brother Pasqualino's recent murder by the North Side Gang.\\r\\nPolice then announced that they suspected Capone gunmen John Scalise and Albert Anselmi, as well as Jack McGurn himself, and Frank Rio, a Capone bodyguard. Police eventually charged McGurn and Scalise with the massacre. John Scalise, along with Anselmi and Joseph 'Hop Toad' Giunta, were murdered by Capone in May 1929, after Capone learned about their plan to kill him, and before he went to trial. The murder charges against Jack McGurn were finally dropped because of a lack of evidence, and he was just charged with a violation of the Mann Act: he took his girlfriend, Louise Rolfe, who was also the main witness against him and became known as the \\"Blonde Alibi\\", across state lines to marry.\\r\\nThe case stagnated until December 14, 1929, when the Berrien County, Michigan Sheriff's Department raided the St. Joseph, Michigan bungalow of Frederick Dane, the registered owner of a vehicle driven by Fred \\"Killer\\" Burke. Burke had been drinking that night, rear-ended another vehicle and drove off. Patrolman Charles Skelly pursued, finally forcing Burke off the road. As Skelly hopped on the running board he was shot three times and died of his wounds later that night. The car was found wrecked and abandoned just outside St. Joseph and traced to Fred Dane. By this time police photos confirmed that Dane was in fact Fred Burke, wanted by the Chicago police for his participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.\\r\\nWhen police raided Burke's bungalow, they found a large trunk containing a bullet-proof vest, almost $320,000 in bonds recently stolen from a Wisconsin bank, two Thompson submachine guns, pistols, two shotguns, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. St. Joseph authorities immediately notified the Chicago police, who requested that both machine guns be brought there at once. Through the then relatively new science of forensic ballistics, both weapons were determined to have been used in the massacre ÿ and that one of Burke's Tommy guns had also been used to murder New York mobster Frankie Yale (who participated in O'Banion's murder) a year and a half earlier. Unfortunately, no further concrete evidence would surface in the massacre case. Burke would be captured over a year later on a Missouri farm. As the case against him in the murder of Officer Skelly was strongest, he was tried in Michigan and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment. Burke died in prison in 1940.\\r\\nOn January 8, 1935, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents surrounded a Chicago apartment building at 3920 North Pine Grove, looking for the remaining members of the Barker Gang. A brief shootout erupted, resulting in the death of bank robber Russell Gibson. Taken into custody were Doc Barker, Byron Bolton, and two women. While interrogating agents got nothing out of Barker, Bolton (a hitherto obscure criminal) proved to be a \\"geyser of information\\", as one crime historian called him. Bolton, a former Navy machine-gunner and associate of Egan's Rats, had been the valet of the Chicago hit man Fred Goetz. Bolton was privy to many of the Barker Gang's crimes and pinpointed the Florida hideout of Ma and Freddie Barker (both of whom were killed in a shootout with the FBI a week later). Bolton claimed to have taken part in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre with Goetz, Fred Burke, and several others.\\r\\nBecause the FBI had no jurisdiction in a state murder case, they kept Boltons revelations confidential, until the Chicago American newspaper reported a second-hand version of the bank robbers confession. The newspaper declared that the crime had been solved, despite being stonewalled by J. Edgar Hoover and the Bureau, who did not want any part of the massacre case. Garbled versions of Boltons story went out in the national media. Bolton, it was reported, claimed that the murder of Bugs Moran had been plotted in October or November 1928 at a Couderay, Wisconsin resort owned by Fred Goetz. Present at this meet were Goetz, Al Capone, Frank Nitti, Fred Burke, Gus Winkeler, Louis Campagna, Daniel Serritella, William Pacelli, and Bolton himself. The men stayed two or three weeks, hunting and fishing when they were not planning the murder of their enemies.\\r\\nByron Bolton claimed he and Jimmy Moran were charged with watching the S.M.C. Cartage garage and phoning the signal to the killers at the Circus Caf when Bugs Moran arrived at the meeting. Police had indeed found a letter addressed to Bolton in the lookout nest (and possibly a vial of prescription medicine). Bolton guessed that the actual killers had been Burke, Winkeler, Goetz, Bob Carey, Raymond \\"Crane Neck\\" Nugent,[13] and Claude Maddox (four shooters and two getaway drivers). Bolton gave an account of the massacre different from the one generally told by historians. He claimed that he saw only plainclothes men exit the Cadillac and go into the garage. This indicates that a second car was used by the killers. One witness, George Brichet, claimed to have seen at least two uniformed men exiting a car in the alley and entering the garage through its rear doors. A Peerless sedan had been found near a Maywood house owned by Claude Maddox in the days after the massacre, and in one of the pockets was an address book belonging to victim Albert Weinshank. Bolton further indicated he had mistaken one of Morans men to be Moran, after which he telephoned the signal to the Circus Caf. When the killers (who had expected to kill Moran and maybe two or three of his men) were unexpectedly confronted with seven men, they simply decided to kill them all and get out fast. Bolton claimed that Capone was furious with him for his mistake (and the resulting police pressure) and threatened to kill him, only to be dissuaded by Fred Goetz.[citation needed]\\r\\nHis claims were corroborated by Gus Winkeler's widow, Georgette, in both an official FBI statement and her memoirs, which were published in a four-part series in a true detective magazine during the winter of 1935ÿ36. Georgette Winkeler revealed that her husband and his friends had formed a special crew used by Capone for high-risk jobs. The mob boss was said to have trusted them implicitly and nicknamed them the American Boys. Byron Boltons statements were also backed up by William Drury, a maverick Chicago detective who had stayed on the massacre case long after everyone else had given up. Bank robber Alvin Karpis later claimed to have heard secondhand from Ray Nugent about the massacre and that the American Boys were paid a collective salary of $2,000 a week plus bonuses. Karpis also claimed that Capone himself had told him while they were in Alcatraz together that Goetz had been the actual planner of the massacre.[citation needed]\\r\\nDespite Byron Boltons statements, no action was taken by the FBI. All the men he named, with the exceptions of Burke and Maddox, were dead by 1935. Bank robber Harvey Bailey would later complain in his 1973 autobiography that he and Fred Burke had been drinking beer in Calumet City at the time of the massacre, and the resulting heat forced them to abandon their bank robbing ventures. Claude Maddox was questioned fruitlessly by Chicago Police, and there the matter lay. Crime historians are still divided on whether or not the American Boys committed the St. Valentines Day Massacre.[citation needed]\\r\\nOver the years, many mobsters, in and out of Chicago, would be named as part of the Valentine's Day hit team. Two prime suspects are Cosa Nostra hit men John Scalise and Albert Anselmi; both men were effective killers and are frequently mentioned as possibilities for two of the shooters. In the days after the massacre, Scalise was heard to brag, I am the most powerful man in Chicago. He had recently been elevated to the position of vice-president in the Unione Siciliana by its president, Joseph Guinta. Nevertheless, Scalise, Anselmi, and Guinta would be found dead on a lonely road near Hammond, Indiana on May 8, 1929. Gangland lore has it that Al Capone had discovered that the pair was planning to betray him. Legend states that at the climax of a dinner party thrown in their honor, Capone produced a baseball bat and beat the trio to death.[14]\\r\\nThe two Thompson submachine guns (serial numbers 2347 and 7580) found in Fred Danes (an alias for Fred Burke) Michigan bungalow were tested and it was determined that both had been used in the massacre. One of them had also been used in the murder of Brooklyn mob boss Frankie Yale, which confirmed the New York Police Departments long-held theory that Burke, and by extension Al Capone, had been responsible for Yale's death.\\r\\nGun No. 2347 had been originally purchased on November 12, 1924, by Les Farmer, a deputy sheriff in Marion, Illinois, which happened to be the seat of Williamson County. Marion and the surrounding area were then overrun by the warring bootleg factions of the Shelton Brothers and Charlie Birger. Deputy Farmer was documented as having ties with Egans Rats, based 100 miles (160?km) away in St. Louis. By the beginning of 1927 at the very latest, the weapon had wound up in Fred Burke's possession. It is possible he had used this same gun in Detroits Milaflores Massacre on March 28, 1927.\\r\\nGun No. 7580 had been sold by Chicago sporting goods owner Peter von Frantzius to a Victor Thompson (also known as Frank V. Thompson) in the care of the Fox Hotel of Elgin, Illinois. Some time after the purchase the machine gun wound up with James \\"Bozo\\" Shupe, a small-time hood from Chicagos West Side who had ties to various members of Capones outfit.\\r\\nBoth submachine guns are still in the possession of the Berrien County Sheriff's Department in St. Joseph, Michigan.\\r\\nThe garage, which stood at 2122 N. Clark Street, was demolished in 1967, and the site is now a parking lot for a nursing home.[15] The bricks of the north wall, against which the massacre's victims were lined up and shot, were purchased by a Canadian businessman. For many years they were displayed in various crime-related novelty displays. Many of the original bricks were later sold individually, and the remainder are now owned by the Mob Museum in Las Vegas.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Saint Valentine's Day Massacre has been portrayed, referenced, or emulated in the following works:","input":"Who ordered the st valentine's day massacre?"},{"output":"braising steak","context":"Chuck steak is a cut of beef and is part of the sub primal cut known as the chuck.[1]\\r\\nThe typical chuck steak is a rectangular cut, about 1\\" thick and containing parts of the shoulder bones, and is often known as a \\"7-bone steak,\\" as the shape of the shoulder bone in cross section resembles the numeral?'7'.

The living standards in the Dominican Republic are considerably higher than those in Haiti. The deep-set cultural differences have contributed to a long-standing conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStruggles began during colonial times and have developed into nearly constant conflict between the two governments.[1] The political division of the island of Hispaniola is due in part to the European struggle for control of the New World during the 17th century, when France and Spain began fighting for control of the island. They resolved their dispute in 1697 by splitting the island into two countries.[2] It was not until the 19th century that Haiti became independent from France on January 1, 1804. Spanish Haiti, the predecessor of the Dominican Republic, became independent from Spain on December 1, 1821, after more than 300 years of Spanish rule.\\r\\nIn February, 1805, Haitian forces, under Jean-Jacques Dessalines, invaded from the southern route in opposition of French-led approved slave raiding.[3] Unable to overpower the Spanish-French defense, and intimidated by the arrival of a French fleet in support of Borgella in Santo Domingo, the army of Dessalines along with Henri Christophe raided through the interior Dominican towns Santiago and Moca, while Alexandre Ption invaded Azua.[4][5] On his retreat from Santo Domingo, Dessalines arrived in Santiago on April 12, 1805. While in Santiago, Haitian forces set fire to the town, including churches and convents.[6] The army killed approximately 400 inhabitants including some priests and took prisoners to Haiti.[7] More people were killed on Dessalines's orders in the French-held portions of the island,[8] including the towns of Monte Plata, Cotu and La Vega and approximately 500 people of the northern town of Moca.[4][6][9] The barrister Gaspar de Arredondo y Pichardo wrote, \\"40 [Dominican] children had their throats cut at the Moca's church, and the bodies found at the presbytery, which is the space that encircles the church's altar...\\"[10] Survivors from the raids fled to western locations including Higey through Cotu as well as to other territories of the Spanish Antilles.[11]\\r\\nA 2012 opinion piece in the Dominican newspaper El?Caribe claims the events never happened or were exaggerated.[8] Despite claims[by whom?] that there were 1000?victims, the town of Moca had a population of about 500.[5][12]\\r\\nOn November 9, 1821 the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo was overthrown by a group of rebels at the command of Jos N~?ez de Cceres, the colony's former administrator,[1][13] as they proclaimed independence from the Spanish crown on December 1, 1821.[14] The new nation was known as Republic of Spanish Haiti (Spanish: Rep~blica del Hait Espa?ol), as Haiti had been the indigenous name of the island.[13][contradictory]\\r\\nA group of Dominican military officers favored uniting the newly independent nation with Haiti, as they sought for political stability under Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer. The Dominicans were unaware that Boyer made a concession with the French, and agreed to pay France for the lost territory of Haiti. Boyer agreed to pay a sum of 150 million Francs (more than twice what France had charged the United States for the much larger Louisiana territory in 1803) thus the Haitians would essentially be forced into paying to maintain their freedom from the French.\\r\\nDuring twenty-two years of Haitian occupation, the Haitians implemented what some Dominicans viewed as a brutal military regime.[citation needed] Use of the French language over Spanish was enforced, and the army closed La Universidad Santo Tomas de Aquino. In addition, the Haitian army confiscated all church land and property and imposed mandatory military service. This difficult time for the Dominicans created cultural conflicts in language, race, religion and national tradition between the Dominicans and Haitians. Many Dominicans developed a resentment of Haitians, who they saw as oppressors.\\r\\nIn order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, Haiti imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to redistribute land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (terrenos comuneros), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and newly emancipated slaves resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer's Code Rural.[15] In rural areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.[citation needed]\\r\\nHaiti's constitution also forbade white elites from owning land,[citation needed] and the major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. Most emigrated to Cuba, Puerto Rico (these two being Spanish possessions at the time) or Gran Colombia, usually with the encouragement of Haitian officials, who acquired their lands. The Haitians, who associated the Roman Catholic Church with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence, confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the Vatican. Santo Domingo's university, lacking both students and teachers had to close down, and thus the country suffered from a massive case of human capital flight.\\r\\nAlthough the occupation effectively eliminated colonial slavery and instated a constitution modeled after the United States Constitution throughout the island, several resolutions and written dispositions were expressly aimed at converting average Dominicans into second-class citizens: restrictions of movement, prohibition to run for public office, night curfews, inability to travel in groups, banning of civilian organizations, and the indefinite closure of the state university (on the alleged grounds of its being a subversive organization) all led to the creation of movements advocating a forceful separation from Haiti with no compromises.\\r\\nIn the Dominican War of Independence[16] Dominicans fought against the Haitian occupation.[17] On February 27, 1844 the Dominicans, led by Juan Pablo Duarte along with Francisco del Rosario Snchez and Matas Ram܇n Mella, gained freedom from Haitian rule, thus giving birth to the Dominican Republic, a self-sufficient nation established on the liberal ideals of a democratic government.\\r\\nAfter winning the war and ousting the Haitian occupying force from the country, Dominican nationalists had to fight against a series of attempted invasions at the command of Haitian \\"emperor\\" Faustin Soulouque from 1844 to 1856. Haitian soldiers would make incessant attacks to try to regain control of the territory, but these efforts were to no avail as the Dominicans would go on to decisively win every battle henceforth. Since then, DominicanÿHaitian relations have been unstable.[18]\\r\\nIn 1937, claiming that Haiti was harboring his former Dominican opponents, Rafael Trujillo ordered an attack on the border, slaughtering tens of thousands of Haitians as they tried to escape. The number of dead is still unknown, though it is now calculated between 20,000[19] and 30,000.[20]\\r\\nIn the mid-twentieth century, the economies of the two countries were comparable. Since that time, the Dominican economy has grown while the Haitian economy has diminished. The economic downturn in Haiti has been the result of factors such as internal power struggles, rapid population growth, environmental degradation, and trade embargoes. Today, Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. There is a lack of resources, and Haiti's population density exceeds its neighbor's by far. Despite the UN sending missions since the 1990s, in order to maintain peace, terrible conditions persist.[21]\\r\\nOne large contributor to cultural dissonance is the language barrier, as Spanish is the primary language spoken in the eastern part of Hispaniola (Dominican Republic) while French and Haitian Creole are spoken in the western part (Haiti). Race is another defining factor of DominicanÿHaitian relations. The ethnic composition of the Dominican population is 73%?mixed, 16%?white, and 11%?black;[22] 95% of the Haitian population is black.[23]\\r\\nThe development of social classes in the Dominican Republic is somewhat based on race. Since the Haitian invasion of 1822 skin color holds importance in Dominican society. Darker-colored Dominicans are usually found in the lower class, while lighter-skinned (mixed, whites and others) Dominicans are found in the middle and upper classes. Most Haitians are darker-skinned with little non-African admixture. In the Dominican Republic there is a stigma against dark-skinned residents. People with darker skin are usually associated with poor, uneducated Haitians because of their past connections with slavery.[24]\\r\\nThe Dominican economy is also over 600% larger than the Haitian economy. The estimated annual per capita income is US$1,300 in Haiti and US$8,200 in Dominican Republic.[25] The divergence between the level of economic development between Haiti and the Dominican Republic makes their border the one with the highest contrast of all Western world borders and it is evident that the Dominican Republic has one of the highest illegal migration issues in the Americas.[26]\\r\\nSome cross-border cooperation exists in areas such as health, business, and infrastructure. Many Haitians travel to the Dominican Republic to find seasonal or long-term work in order to send remittances to their families. Some of these Haitian workers, as well as Dominicans of Haitian descent have reported complaints of discrimination against them by the Dominican majority population. Other Haitians who would seek work, instead remain in Haiti, fearing discrimination on the other side of the border.[27]\\r\\nMigration has been taking place since the 1920s, when Haitian laborers were actively encouraged to come work in the thriving Dominican sugar industry. With modernization from the 1960s on, fewer workers were required, and other Dominican industries and services started employing more Haitian workers, often an inexpensive, less regulated labor source with fewer legal protections. Many Haitian women find work in Dominican households, and Haitian men at Dominican construction sites, often leading to the move of an entire family.[27]\\r\\nA large number of migrated Haitian workers have continued to live in the Dominican Republic over several generations. The two governments have been unable to agree upon a legal framework to address the nationality of these descendants, leaving around one million people of Haitian ancestry in the Dominican Republic effectively stateless, restricting their access to health care, education and employment opportunities.[27]\\r\\nThough migration from Haiti to the Dominican Republic is economically beneficial to both countries, it is one of the leading contributors to tension between the two countries as well; illegal immigration from Haiti resonates high dissonance with the Dominican people. It has led to anti-Haitian feelings and mistrust of the Haitian people. Another problem with Haitian migration into Dominican Republic is that it blurs the line of citizenship. This factor of migration affects not only Dominican economy but its culture as well.[28]\\r\\nMany have observed that there is a clear distinction between Dominicans and Haitians in the Dominican Republic. The two groups of people do not function as one entity and there are many factors that contribute to those tensions. Some Dominicans view Haitians in the Dominican Republic as an invasion of their own space that they have fought very long and hard to live in. Some Dominicans view Haitians as less than[clarification needed] and believe that their only function in the Dominican Republic is as labor. There is a strong sense of Dominican pride in the Dominican Republic, and oftentimes, Haitians cannot fit into their culture or way of life. Many of these current day beliefs have been influenced by the former Dominican dictator, Rafael Trujillo.\\r\\nRafael Trujillo strongly disliked the Haitian people and made it his mission to clearly distinguish the Dominican Republic from Haiti. Trujillo was not fond of dark skin, and targeted anyone of dark complexion that appeared to be Haitian. In 1937, Rafael Trujillo carried out the Parsley Massacre in which he sought to destroy anyone who looked dark enough to be Haitian and anyone who could not roll the \\"r\\" in \\"perejil,\\" Spanish word for parsley. This drastic occurrence made the Dominican Republic a very bloody and unpleasant place. Many still regard the Parsley Massacre as a devastating time of horror and despise towards dark skin people. Even without Trujillo in power, some still carry these negative connotations in their heads and approach Haitians with anger and scorn.\\r\\nAfter the devastating earthquake of 12 January 2010, countless Haitians fled across the border to escape the quake's effects. The Dominican government was one of the first to send teams to help distribute food and medicine to the victims and made it easier for Haitians to acquire visas to receive treatment in Dominican hospitals. Supplies were transported to Haiti through the Dominican Republic, and many injured Haitians have been treated in Dominican hospitals. Virtually, every level of the Dominican efforts assisted its neighboring country.[29]\\r\\nHaitian refugees were also taken in and supported by many Dominicans, though relations deteriorated as the refugees have remained in the Dominican Republic. This has led to reported concerns among some Dominicans that quake refugees contribute to rising crime, over-crowding, cholera and unemployment. More and more discrimination has been attributed to the massive numbers of Haitian refugees in the Dominican Republic. Over the past years tensions have risen, causing the International Organization for Migration to offer Haitians $50 each plus additional relocation assistance to return to Haiti. More than 1,500 have accepted that assistance and returned.[29]\\r\\nThe baseball federations of the Dominican Republic and Haiti have agreed to develop and promote baseball in Haiti (especially at the border), on the basis that sport is a developmental element to foster peace, as well as strengthening friendship and mutual respect between the two peoples. With the support of the Dominican ministry of Sports, the president of the Dominican Baseball Federation (FEDOBE) was thankful and quoted saying \\"it allows our federation to fulfill the dream of helping Haiti in baseball.\\" He has pledged to put the Haitian Baseball Federation in relation to the international organizations. Coaches will be sent to Haiti for technical courses, referees and scorers by the Dominican Baseball Federation, while the Haitian Federation will support the logistics in the training and training programs.[30]","input":"When did haiti and the dominican republic split?"},{"output":"Nova Scotia, Canada","context":"The Curse of Oak Island is an active reality television[1] series that first premiered in Canada on the History network on January 5, 2014.

The wood from borehole 10-X is carbon dated as being from 1670-1780. A new cipher is decoded leading the team to once again believe that there is a \\"hatch\\" somewhere on the island. The team wants to continue searching the swamp. The team proposes pumping borehole 10-X dry to enable yet another round of searches. The team wants to search more of the Island with metal detectors in the future.\\r\\nA history of the Knights Templar is presented along with speculative theories about how they might have been involved with Oak Island.\\r\\nThe episode includes accounts of activities on the Oak Island by the McGinnis family, descendants of Samuel Ball, William Chappell's family, the Restall Family and the family of Robert Dunfield. The Blankenship/Nolan disputes on Oak Island are discussed.

H&M and its associated companies operate in 62 countries with over 4,500 stores and as of 2015[update] employed around 132,000 people.[5] It is the second-largest global clothing retailer, just behind Spain-based Inditex (parent company of Zara). The company has a significant on-line presence, with on-line shopping available in 33 countries:[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company was founded by Erling Persson in 1947, when he opened his first shop in V?ster?s, Sweden.[8] The shop, called Hennes (Swedish for \\"hers\\"), exclusively sold women's clothing. A store was opened in Norway in 1964.[9] In 1968, Persson acquired the hunting apparel retailer Mauritz Widforss, which led to the inclusion of a menswear collection in the product range and the name change to Hennes & Mauritz.[8]\\r\\nThe company was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1974.[8] Shortly after, in 1976, the first store outside Scandinavia opened in London.[8][10] H&M continued to expand in Europe, and began to retail online in 1998, when it was able to buy the domain hm.com from a company called A1 in a non-published domain transaction.[citation needed] The two-letter domain was registered in the early 1990s, but data on the first registration is lost.[citation needed] The opening of the first U.S. store on March 31, 2000, on Fifth Avenue in New York marked the start of the expansion outside of Europe.[8]\\r\\nIn 2008, the company announced in a press release that it would begin selling home furnishings.[11] Initially distributed through the company's online catalogue, there are now H&M Home stores located internationally.\\r\\nFollowing expansion in Asia and the Middle East and the launch of concept stores including COS, Weekday, Monki, and Cheap Monday, in 2009 and 2010, branding consultancy Interbrand ranked the company as the twenty-first most-valuable global brand,[12] making it the highest-ranked retailer in the survey. Its worth was estimated at $12ÿ16?billion.[13][14]\\r\\nH&M operated 2,325 stores at the end of 2011, and 2,629 stores at the end of August 2012.[15] Its 3,000th store opened in September 2013 in Chengdu, China.[3]\\r\\nIn November 2004, selected company stores offered an exclusive collection by fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld. The press reported large crowds and that the initial inventories in the larger cities were sold out within an hour,[16] although the clothes were still available in less fashion-sensitive areas until the company redistributed them to meet with demand.[17]\\r\\nIn November 2006, the company launched a collection by Stella McCartney and, in November 2006, by avant-garde Dutch designers Viktor & Rolf.\\r\\nIn March 2007, it launched another collaboration designed by the pop star Madonna.[18] In June 2007 the company worked with game developers Maxis to create a stuff pack for the latter's The Sims 2 computer game, H&M Fashion Stuff.[19]\\r\\nIn November 2007, the company launched a collection by Italian designer Roberto Cavalli. It was reported that the clothing sold out very quickly. Also in 2007, another design with Kylie Minogue was launched in Shanghai, China.[20] In the spring of 2008 the Finnish company Marimekko was selected as guest designer and was followed by Japanese Comme des Gar?ons in the fall.\\r\\nIn 2008, H&M used the song \\"Hang On\\" by British singer-songwriter Lettie as background music to its UK website.\\r\\nFor spring and summer 2009, the British designer Matthew Williamson created two exclusive ranges for the company ÿ the first being a collection of women's clothes released in selected stores. The second collection saw Williamson branch into menswear for the first time, only in selected stores. The second collection also featured swimwear for men and women and was available in every company store worldwide.[21] On 14 November 2009, the company released a limited-edition diffusion collection by Jimmy Choo featuring shoes and handbags, ranging from S30 to S170 including a range of men's shoes. The collection also included clothing designed by Choo for the first time, many garments made from suede and leather, and was available in 200 stores worldwide, including London's Oxford Circus store.[22] Sonia Rykiel also collaborated with the company, by designing a ladies knitwear and lingerie range that was released in selected company stores on 5 December 2009.\\r\\nFor Fall 2010, the company collaborated with French fashion house Lanvin[23] as its 2010 guest designer.\\r\\nIn March 2011, the brand's clothing was featured in an interactive fashion art film by Imagine Fashion called \\"Decadent Control\\", starring Roberto Cavalli, Kirsty Hume, Eva Herzigov and Brad Kroenig. For Spring/Summer 2011, the company collaborated with fashion blogger Elin Kling, which was available at selected stores only. In June 2011, H&M announced a collaboration with Versace that was released on 19 November. Versace also planned a Spring collaboration with H&M that was only be available in countries with online sales. Similar to previous collaborations, Versace agreed to let H&M use the renowned name of the company for a previously agreed upon sum, without actually having a role in the design process.[24] In November 2011, H&M announced a collaboration plan with Marni, that launched in March 2012. The campaign was directed by award-winning director Sofia Coppola.[25]\\r\\nOn 4 October 2012, Japanese Vogue editor Anna Dello Russo launched an accessories collection at H&M as Paris Fashion Week drew to an end.

The collection was released in November 2015. The announcement came from Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing's Instagram page.\\r\\nIn November 2016, H&M released a designer line in collaboration with Kenzo. That year H&M released an annual holiday movie directed by Wes Anderson. Titled Come Together, the short film stars Adrien Brody as a train conductor who saves Christmas after a blizzard delays the trains arrival, making the few passengers on board miss part of the holiday.[27][28][29][30]\\r\\nIn addition to the H&M brand, the company consists of five individual brands with separate concepts.[31] Q4 2016 saw the hoarding of a new H&M concept in The Dubai Mall come up, labelled 'H&M Details'.\\r\\nCOS launched its flagship store on Londons Regent Street in March 2007 with a catwalk show at the Royal Academy.[32] Its concept is encompassed by minimalist style inspired by architecture, graphics, and design.[33][32] It specialises in modern clothing pieces for men and women that are less trend-oriented than other similarly priced labels.[34] COS makes clothing that can be worn beyond the season.[35] COS has 197 stores in 34 countries[36] in Europe, Asia, North America, Australia and the Middle East and currently retails online to 19 markets via cosstores.com.\\r\\n& Other Stories launched in Spring 2013, with seven stores opening throughout Europe.[37] Its Regent Street store opened on 8 March 2013,[38] with other locations in Barcelona, Berlin, Copenhagen, Dublin, Milan, Paris and Stockholm.[39] & Other Stories offers women's clothing, shoes, bags, accessories, and beauty products, with a focus on high quality throughout a wide price range.[39] In March 2016, it collaborated with the designer label Rodarte.[40] & Other Stories has 46 stores in 12 countries,[41] as well as e-commerce in 14 at stories.com (formerly at otherstories.com).[42]\\r\\nThe first ARKET store was opened in Regent Street in August 2017, having been in preparations since June 2015.[43][44] The brand is labeled \\"a modern-day market\\"[45] and houses a line known as the \\"archive\\", in which each item is known by a nine-digit code organised into department, category, product, and material.[46] ARKET also sells children's clothing and homewares, and has an in-store caf.[46]\\r\\nIn 2008, H&M purchased 60 percent of shares in the Swedish fashion company FaBric Scandinavien AB, and bought the remaining shares in 2010 with a price totalling SEK552 million. The company's three brands- Cheap Monday, Monki, and Weekday- continue to be run as separate concepts.[47]\\r\\nCheap Monday, known for its distinctive skull logo, is a full fashion brand launched in 2004.[48] The brand is available from many retailers worldwide as well as its own stores and e-commerce site cheapmonday.com.[31]\\r\\nMonki is \\"a wild and crazy international retail concept that believes that, it needs to fight ordinary and boost imagination with an experience out of the ordinary\\".[49] The brand sells fashion for young women in stores in 13 markets, and is available online in 18 markets at monki.com.\\r\\nWeekday, styled as WEEKDAY, 'carries in-house brands such as MTWTFSS WEEKDAY and Weekday Collection as well as external brands.[31] The brand has stores in 9 markets and is available online in 18 markets at weekday.com and in 140 markets at asos.com.\\r\\nIn August 2011, nearly 200 workers passed out in one week at a Cambodian factory supplying H&M. Fumes from chemicals, poor ventilation, malnutrition and even \\"mass hysteria\\" have all been blamed for making workers ill. The minimum wage in Cambodia is the equivalent of just $66 (S42) a month, a level that human rights groups say is not even half that required to meet basic needs.[50]\\r\\nBangladeshi and international labour groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including H&M, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.[51]\\r\\nThe Guardian wrote that in a conscious actions sustainability report for 2012, H&M published a list of factories supplying 95% of its garments. Most retailers and brands do not share this information, citing commercial confidentiality as a reason.[52]\\r\\nOn 2 January 2013, The Ecologist reported[53] allegations by Anti-Slavery International that H&M is continuing its association with the Uzbek government in exploiting child and adult forced labour as cotton harvesters in Uzbekistan.[54]\\r\\nAfter the April 2013 Savar building collapse H&M and other retailers signed on to the Accord on Factory and Building Safety in Bangladesh. On 19 May 2013, a textile factory that produced apparel for H&M in Phnom Penh, Cambodia collapsed injuring several people.[55] The incident has raised concerns regarding industrial safety regulations.\\r\\nOn 25 November 2013, H&M's global head of sustainability committed[56][57] that H&M, as the world's second-largest clothing retailer, will aim to pay all textile workers \\"living wage\\" by 2018, stating that governments are responding too slowly to poor working conditions in Bangladesh among other Asian countries where many clothing retailers source a majority if not all of their garments. Wages were increased in Bangladesh from 3,000 taka ($40) to 5,300 taka ($70) a month in late 2013.[58]\\r\\nIn September 2015, CleanClothes.org, an NGO involved in garment labour working conditions, reported on a lack of specific fire safety renovations in H&M suppliers' factories.[59]\\r\\nIn June 2016, SumOfUs launched a campaign to pressure H&M to honour the commitment to protect Bangladesh's garment workers which it had signed onto following the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh in 2013, which killed over 1100 people, mostly garment workers, in unsafe factories housed in an eight-storey building not designed for factories. SumOfUs alleged that \\"H&M is drastically behind schedule in fixing the safety hazards its workers have to face every day.\\"[60]\\r\\nIn February 2017 the Guardian reported children were employed to make H&M products in Myanmar and were paid as little as 13p (about 15cents US) an hour ÿ half the full legal minimum wage.[61]\\r\\nOn January 6, 2010, it was reported that unsold or refunded clothing and other items in one New York City store were cut up before being discarded, presumably to prevent resale or use.[62]\\r\\nOn January 24, 2012, H&M was reported to have stolen an artist's work, using it on multiple items without compensating the artist.[63]\\r\\nIn August 2013, the Swedish fashion chain withdrew faux-leather headdresses from Canadian stores after consumers complained the items, part of the company's summer music festival collection, were insulting to Canada's Aboriginal peoples.[64]\\r\\nOn November 6, 2015, the H&M South Africa division had been accused with racism for lack of black models in their photoshots,[65] later claiming that White models convey a more \\"Positive Image\\" than that of black models.[66]\\r\\nOn January 8, 2018, H&M showcased on their official United Kingdom website[67] a picture of a young Black child wearing a green hoodie reading, \\"Coolest Monkey in the Jungle,\\" which sparked a great deal of controversy,[68][69][70][71][72][73][74][75] notably in the United States due to the cognition of \\"monkey\\" being used to describe a Black person,[67] though the term \\"cheeky monkey\\" is used in the UK to refer to a little child regardless of race. In response, singers such as The Weeknd and G-Eazy boycotted the company by ending their partnerships with H&M over the racial controversy.[76][77][78] H&M later released an apology: This image has now been removed from all H&M channels and we apologise to anyone this may have offended.[79][80][81][82] The mother of the model urged people to \\"stop crying wolf,\\" deeming it \\"an unnecessary issue.\\"[83]\\r\\nAfter the allegation of racism, H&M stores have been vandalized and stolen from in South Africa. In response, H&M has temporarily closed stores in South Africa.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy 2012 H&M had raised over US$4.5?million through a 5-year partner program with UNICEF.[citation needed]\\r\\nStarting in February 2013, H&M will offer patrons a voucher in exchange for used garments. Donated garments will be processed by I:CO, a retailer that repurposes and recycles used clothing with the goal of creating a zero-waste economy. The initiative is similar to a clothes-collection voucher program launched in April 2012 by Marks & Spencer in partnership with Oxfam.[84][85][86]\\r\\nIn April 2014, H&M joined Zara and other apparel companies in changing their supply chain to avoid endangered forests. H&M teamed with Canopy, a non-profit, to remove endangered and ancient forests from their dissolvable pulp supply chain for their viscose and rayon fabrics.[87]\\r\\nIn August 2015, H&M announced that it will award a million-euro annual prize to advance recycling technology and techniques.[88]\\r\\nThe H&M Foundation is a non-profit foundation which was established in order to implement positive change and improve living standards, such as education for children, worldwide access to clean water, strengthening women on a global scale, and being environmentally aware. It is privately funded by the Persson Family, founders and owners of H&M. Since 2013, the Persson Family has made huge contributions to the foundation, donating SEK1.1 billion (US$154 million) to the H&M Foundation.","input":"What does h & m clothing stand for?"},{"output":"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs","context":"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a 1937 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and originally released by RKO Radio Pictures. Based on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, it is the first full-length cel animated feature film and the earliest Disney animated feature film. The story was adapted by storyboard artists Dorothy Ann Blank, Richard Creedon, Merrill De Maris, Otto Englander, Earl Hurd, Dick Rickard, Ted Sears and Webb Smith. David Hand was the supervising director, while William Cottrell, Wilfred Jackson, Larry Morey, Perce Pearce, and Ben Sharpsteen directed the film's individual sequences.\\r\\nSnow White premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre on December 21, 1937, followed by a nationwide release on February 4, 1938. It was a critical and commercial success, and with international earnings of $8 million during its initial release briefly assumed the record of highest-grossing sound film at the time. The popularity of the film has led to it being re-released theatrically many times, until its home video release in the 1990s. Adjusted for inflation, it is one of the top ten performers at the North American box office.\\r\\nAt the 11th Academy Awards, Walt Disney was awarded an honorary Oscar, and the film was nominated for Best Musical Score the year before. In 1989, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry and is ranked in the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American films, who also named the film as the greatest American animated film of all time in 2008. Disney's take on the fairy tale has had a significant cultural impact, resulting in popular theme park attractions, a video game, and a Broadway musical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow White is a lonely princess living with her stepmother, a vain Queen. The Queen worries that Snow White will look better than her, so she forces Snow White to work as a scullery maid and asks her Magic Mirror daily \\"who is the fairest one of all\\". For years the mirror always answered that the Queen was, pleasing her.\\r\\nOne day, the Magic Mirror informs the Queen that Snow White is now \\"the fairest\\" in the land. The jealous Queen orders her Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, revealing the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee into the woods and never look back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.\\r\\nIn reality, the cottage belongs to seven adult dwarfs, named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey, who work in a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home. The dwarfs find Snow White upstairs, asleep across three of their beds. Snow White awakes to find the dwarfs at her bedside and introduces herself, and all of the dwarfs eventually welcome her into their home after they she offers to clean and cook for them. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day, and at night they all sing, play music and dance.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Queen discovers that Snow White is still alive when the mirror again answers that Snow White is the fairest in the land and reveals that the heart in the jeweled box is actually that of a pig. Using a potion to disguise herself as an old hag, the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into the \\"Sleeping Death\\", a curse she learns can only be broken by \\"love's first kiss\\", but is certain Snow White will be buried alive. While the Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away, the animals are wary of her and rush off to find the dwarfs. Faking a potential heart attack, the Queen tricks Snow White into bringing her into the cottage to rest. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the poisoned apple under the pretense that it is a magic apple that grants wishes. As Snow White falls asleep the Queen proclaims that she is now the fairest of the land. The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder over them, but before she can do so, lightning strikes the cliff, causing her to fall to her death.\\r\\nThe dwarfs return to their cottage and find Snow White seemingly dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her out of sight in the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, a prince, who had previously met and fallen in love with Snow White, learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.\\r\\nDevelopment on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs began in early 1934, and in June 1934, Walt Disney announced the production of his first feature, to be released under Walt Disney Productions,[5] to The New York Times.[6] One evening that same year, Disney acted out the entire story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to his staff, announcing that the film would be produced as a feature-length film.[7]\\r\\nBefore Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been primarily involved in the production of animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Disney hoped to expand his studio's prestige and revenues by moving into features,[8] and estimated that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs could be produced for a budget of US$250,000; this was ten times the budget of an average Silly Symphony.[6]\\r\\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full-length cel animated feature in motion picture history,[5] and as such Walt Disney had to fight to get the film produced. Both his brother and business partner Roy Disney and his wife Lillian attempted to talk him out of it,[8] and the Hollywood movie industry referred to the film derisively as \\"Disney's Folly\\" while it was in production. He had to mortgage his house to help finance the film's production, which eventually ran up a total cost of $1,488,422.74, a massive sum for a feature film in 1937.[1]\\r\\nOn August 9, 1934, twenty-one pages of notesentitled \\"Snowwhite suggestions\\"were compiled by staff writer Richard Creedon, suggesting the principal characters, as well as situations and 'gags' for the story. As Disney had stated at the very beginning of the project, the main attraction of the story for him was the Seven Dwarfs, and their possibilities for \\"screwiness\\" and \\"gags\\"; the three story meetings held in October and attended by Disney, Creedon, Larry Morey, Albert Hurter, Ted Sears and Pinto Colvig were dominated by such subjects. At this point, Disney felt that the story should begin with Snow White's discovery of the Cottage of the Seven Dwarfs.[6] Walt Disney had suggested from the beginning that each of the dwarfs, whose names and personalities are not stated in the original fairy tale, could have individual personalities. The dwarfs names were chosen from a pool of about fifty potentials, including Jumpy, Deafy, Dizzey, Hickey, Wheezy, Baldy, Gabby, Nifty, Sniffy, Swift, Lazy, Puffy, Stuffy, Tubby, Shorty, and Burpy.[9] The seven finalists were chosen through a process of elimination. The leader of the dwarfs, required to be pompous, self-important and bumbling, was named Doc; others were named for their distinguishing character traits. At the end of the October story meetings, however, only Doc, Grumpy, Bashful, Sleepy and Happy of the final seven were named; at this point, Sneezy and Dopey were replaced by 'Jumpy' and an unnamed seventh dwarf.[1]\\r\\nAlong with a focus on the characterizations and comedic possibilities of the dwarfs, Creedon's eighteen-page outline of the story written from the October meetings, featured a continuous flow of gags as well as the Queen's attempt to kill Snow White with a poisoned comb, an element taken from the Grimms' original story. After persuading Snow White to use the comb, the disguised Queen would have escaped alive, but the dwarfs would have arrived in time to remove it. After the failure of the comb, the Queen was to have the Prince captured and taken to her dungeon, where she would have come to him (story sketches show this event both with the Queen and the Witch) and used magic to bring the dungeon's skeletons to life, making them dance for him and identifying one skeleton as \\"Prince Oswald\\", an example of the more humorous atmosphere of this original story treatment.[6] It is written in story notes that the Queen has such magical power only in her own domain, the castle. With the Prince refusing to marry her, the Queen leaves him to his death (one sketch shows the Prince trapped in a subterranean chamber filling with water)[10] as she makes her way to the dwarfs' cottage with the poisoned apple. The forest animals were to help the Prince escape the Queen's minions and find his horse. The Prince was to ride to the cottage to save Snow White but took the wrong road (despite warnings from the forest animals and his horse, whom he, unlike Snow White, could not understand). He, therefore, would not have arrived in time to save her from the Queen but would have been able to save her with love's first kiss. This plot was not used in the final film, though many sketches of the scene in the dungeon were made by Ferdinand Hovarth.\\r\\nOther examples of the more comical nature of the story at this point include suggestions for a \\"fat, batty, cartoon type, self-satisfied\\" Queen.[6] The Prince was also more of a clown, and was to serenade Snow White in a more comical fashion. Walt Disney encouraged all staff at the studio to contribute to the story, offering five dollars for every 'gag'; such gags included the dwarfs' noses popping over the foot of the bed when they first meet Snow White.[11]\\r\\nDisney became concerned that such a comical approach would lessen the plausibility of the characters and, sensing that more time was needed for the development of the Queen, advised in an outline circulated on November 6 that attention be paid exclusively to \\"scenes in which only Snow White, the Dwarfs, and their bird and animal friends appear\\". The names and personalities of the dwarfs, however, were still \\"open to change\\". A meeting of November 16 resulted in another outline entitled 'Dwarfs Discover Snowwhite', which introduced the character of Dopey,[6] who would ultimately prove to be the most successful and popular of the dwarf characterisations.[9] For the rest of 1934 Disney further developed the story by himself, finding a dilemma in the characterization of the Queen, who he felt could no longer be \\"fat\\" and \\"batty\\", but a \\"stately beautiful type\\", a possibility already brought up in previous story meetings. Disney did not focus on the project again until the autumn of 1935. It is thought that he may have doubted his, and his studio's ability, and that his trip to Europe that summer restored his confidence. At this point, Disney and his writers focused on the scenes in which Snow White and the dwarfs are introduced to the audience and each other. He laid out the likely assignments for everyone working on the film in a memorandum of November 25, 1935, and had decided on the personalities of the individual dwarfs.[6]\\r\\nIt had first been thought that the dwarfs would be the main focus of the story, and many sequences were written for the seven characters. However, at a certain point, it was decided that the main thrust of the story was provided by the relationship between the Queen and Snow White.[11] For this reason, several sequences featuring the dwarfs were cut from the film. The first, which was animated in its entirety before being cut, showed Doc and Grumpy arguing about whether Snow White should stay with them. Another, also completely animated, would have shown the dwarfs eating soup noisily and messily; Snow White unsuccessfully attempts to teach them how to eat 'like gentlemen'. A partially animated sequence involved the dwarfs holding a \\"lodge meeting\\" in which they try to think of a gift for Snow White; this was to be followed by the elaborate 'bed building sequence', in which the dwarfs and the forest animals construct and carve a bed for the princess. This also was cut, as it was thought to slow down the movement of the story.[11] The soup-eating and bed-building sequences were animated by Ward Kimball, who was sufficiently discouraged by their removal to consider leaving the studio, however Disney persuaded him to stay by promoting him to supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket in his next feature Pinocchio (1940).[12]\\r\\nThe primary authority on the design of the film was concept artist Albert Hurter. All designs used in the film, from characters' appearances to the look of the rocks in the background, had to meet Hurter's approval before being finalized.[10] Two other concept artists? Ferdinand Hovarth and Gustaf Tenggren? also contributed to the visual style of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Hovarth developed a number of dark concepts for the film, although many other designs he developed were ultimately rejected by the Disney team as less easily translated into animation than Hurter's. Tenggren was used as a color stylist and to determine the staging and atmosphere of many of the scenes in the film, as his style borrowed from the likes of Arthur Rackham and John Bauer and thus possessed the European illustration quality that Walt Disney sought. He also designed the posters for the film and illustrated the press book. However, Hovarth didn't receive a credit for the film. Other artists to work on the film included Joe Grant, whose most significant contribution was the design for the Queen's Witch form.[10]\\r\\nArt Babbit, an animator who joined the Disney studio in 1932, invited seven of his colleagues (who worked in the same room as him) to come with him to an art class that he himself had set up at his home in the Hollywood Hills. Though there was no teacher, Babbit had recruited a model to pose for him and his fellow animators as they drew. These \\"classes\\" were held weekly; each week, more animators would come. After three weeks, Walt Disney called Babbit to his office and offered to provide the supplies, working space and models required if the sessions were moved to the studio. Babbit ran the sessions for a month until animator Hardie Gramatky suggested that they recruit Don Graham; the art teacher from the Chouinard Institute taught his first class at the studio on November 15, 1932, and was joined by Phil Dike a few weeks later.[6] These classes were principally concerned with human anatomy and movement, though instruction later included action analysis, animal anatomy and acting.[13]\\r\\nThough the classes were originally described as a \\"brutal battle\\", with neither instructor nor students well-versed in the other's craft,[6] the enthusiasm and energy of both parties made the classes stimulating and beneficial for all involved. Graham often screened Disney shorts and, along with the animators, provided critique featuring both strengths and weaknesses. For example, Graham criticised Babbit's animation of Abner the mouse in The Country Cousin as \\"taking a few of the obvious actions of a drunk without coordinating the rest of the body\\", while praising it for maintaining its humour without getting \\"dirty or mean or vulgar. The country mouse is always having a good time\\".[13]\\r\\nVery few of the animators at the Disney studio had had artistic training (most had been newspaper cartoonists); among these few was Grim Natwick, who had trained in Europe. The animator's success in designing and animating Betty Boop for Fleischer Studios showed an understanding of human female anatomy, and when Walt Disney hired Natwick he was given female characters to animate almost exclusively. Attempts to animate Persephone, the female lead of The Goddess of Spring, had proved largely unsuccessful; Natwick's animation of the heroine in Cookie Carnival showed greater promise, and the animator was eventually given the task of animating Snow White herself. Though live action footage of Snow White, the Prince and the Queen was shot as reference for the animators, the artists' animators disapproved of rotoscoping, considering it to hinder the production of effective caricature. None of Babbit's animation of the Queen was rotoscoped;[15] despite Graham and Natwick's objections, however, some scenes of Snow White and the Prince were directly traced from the live-action footage.[13]\\r\\nThe studio's new multiplane camera gave a three-dimensional feeling in many sequences and was also used to give a rotating effect in the scene where the Queen transforms into a witch.\\r\\nThe songs in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs were composed by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey. Paul J. Smith and Leigh Harline composed the incidental music score. Well-known songs from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs include \\"Heigh-Ho\\", \\"Some Day My Prince Will Come\\", and \\"Whistle While You Work\\". Since Disney did not have its own music publishing company at the time, the publishing rights for the music and songs were administered through Bourne Co. Music Publishers, which continues to hold these rights. In later years, the studio was able to acquire back the rights to the music from many of the other films, but not Snow White. Snow White became the first American film to have a soundtrack album, released in conjunction with the feature film. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, a film soundtrack recording was unheard of and of little value to a movie studio.\\r\\nAt this time, Disney also encouraged his staff to see a variety of films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM's Romeo and Juliet (1936)? to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffin? to the more obscure, including European silent cinema. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, as well as the two Disney films to follow it, were also influenced by such German expressionist films as Nosferatu (1922) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919), both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff. This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen's transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings.[13]\\r\\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre on December 21, 1937, to a wildly receptive audience, many of whom were the same naysayers who dubbed the film \\"Disney's Folly\\".[1] The film received a standing ovation at its completion[16] from an audience that included Judy Garland and Marlene Dietrich.[17] Six days later, Walt Disney and the seven dwarfs appeared on the cover of Time magazine.[18] The New York Times said: \\"Thank you very much, Mr. Disney\\".[19] Variety suggested that \\"[so] perfect is the illusion, so tender the romance and fantasy, so emotional are certain portions when the acting of the characters strikes a depth comparable to the sincerity of human players, that the film approaches real greatness.\\"[20]\\r\\nFollowing successful exclusive runs at Radio City Music Hall in New York City and a theater in Miami in January 1938,[1] RKO Radio Pictures put the film into general release on February 4. It became a major box-office success, making four times more money than any other motion picture released in 1938.[21] In its original release, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs grossed $3.5 million in the United States and Canada,[22] and by May 1939 its total international gross of $6.5 million made it the most successful sound film of all time, displacing Al Jolson's The Singing Fool (1928) (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was soon displaced from this position by Gone with the Wind in 1940).[22][23] By the end of its original run, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs had earned $7,846,000 in international box office receipts.[24] This earned RKO a profit of $380,000.[25]\\r\\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs was first re-released in 1944, to raise revenue for the Disney studio during the World War II period. This re-release set a tradition of re-releasing Disney animated features every seven to ten years, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was re-released to theaters in 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 and 1993.[26] Coinciding with the fiftieth-anniversary release in 1987, Disney released an authorized novelization of the story, written by children's author Suzanne Weyn.[27][28]\\r\\nIn 1993, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs became the first film to be entirely scanned to digital files, manipulated, and recorded back to film. The restoration project was carried out entirely at 4K resolution and 10-bit color depth using the Cineon system to digitally remove dirt and scratches and restore faded colors.[29]\\r\\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs has had a lifetime gross of $418 million across its original release and several reissues.[2] Adjusted for inflation, and incorporating subsequent releases, the film still registers one of the top ten American film moneymakers of all time.[30]\\r\\nThe film was a tremendous critical success, with many reviewers hailing it as a genuine work of art, recommended for both children and adults.[31] Although film histories often state that the animation of the human characters was criticized, more recent scholarship finds that most reviewers praised the realistic style of the human animation, with several stating that audiences will forget that they are watching animated humans rather than real ones.[31] At the 11th Academy Awards, the film won an Academy Honorary Award for Walt Disney \\"as a significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field\\". Disney received a full-size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones, presented to him by 10-year-old child actress Shirley Temple. The film was also nominated for Best Musical Score.[32] \\"Some Day My Prince Will Come\\" has become a jazz standard that has been performed by numerous artists, including Buddy Rich, Lee Wiley, Oscar Peterson, Frank Churchill,[33] and Oliver Jones.[34] Albums by Miles Davis, by Wynton Kelly, and Alexis Cole.[35]\\r\\nNoted filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin praised Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as a notable achievement in cinema; Eisenstein went so far as to call it the greatest film ever made.[36] The film inspired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce its own fantasy film, The Wizard of Oz, in 1939.[37] Another animation pioneer, Max Fleischer, decided to produce his animated feature film Gulliver's Travels in order to compete with Snow White. The 1943 Merrie Melodies short Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs, directed by Bob Clampett, parodies Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by presenting the story with an all-black cast singing a jazz score.\\r\\nSnow White's success led to Disney moving ahead with more feature-film productions. Walt Disney used much of the profits from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to finance a new $4.5 million studio in Burbank?ÿ the location on which The Walt Disney Studios is located to this day.[21] Within two years, the studio completed Pinocchio and Fantasia and had begun production on features such as Dumbo, Bambi, Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan.[38]\\r\\nThe American Film Institute (AFI), an independent non-profit organization created in the United States by the National Endowment for the Arts,[39] releases a variety of annual awards and film lists recognizing excellence in filmmaking. The AFI 100 Years... series, which ran from 1998 to 2008, created categorized lists of America's best movies as selected by juries composed from among over 1,500 artists, scholars, critics, and historians. A film's inclusion in one of these lists was based on the film's popularity over time, historical significance and cultural impact.[40] Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was selected by juries for inclusion on many AFI lists, including the following:\\r\\nOn October 28, 1994, the film was released for the first time on home video on VHS and LaserDisc as the first release in the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection.[5]\\r\\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released on DVD on October 9, 2001, the first in Disney's Platinum Editions, and featured, across two discs, the digitally restored film, a making-of documentary narrated by Angela Lansbury, an audio commentary by John Canemaker and, via archived audio clips, Walt Disney.[49]. A VHS release followed on November 27, 2001. Both versions were returned to the Disney Vault on January 31, 2002[50].\\r\\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released on Blu-ray Disc on October 6, 2009, the first of Disney's Diamond Editions, and a new DVD edition was released on November 24, 2009. The Blu-ray includes a high-definition version of the movie sourced from a new restoration by Lowry Digital, a DVD copy of the film, and several bonus features not included on the 2001 DVD. This set returned to the Disney Vault on April 30, 2011.[51]\\r\\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment re-released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs on Blu-ray and DVD on February 2, 2016, as the first of the Walt Disney Signature Collection Line. It was released on Digital HD on January 19, 2016, with bonus material.[52]\\r\\nSnow White's Scary Adventures is a popular theme park ride at Disneyland (an opening day attraction dating from 1955),[53] Tokyo Disneyland,[54] and Disneyland Paris.[55] Fantasyland at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom[56] underwent an expansion from 2012 to 2014. The Snow White's Scary Adventures ride was replaced with Princess Fairytale Hall, where Snow White and other princesses are located for a meet and greet. Included in the 2013 expansion of Fantasyland is the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train roller coaster.[57] Snow White, her Prince, the Queen, and the Seven Dwarfs are also featured in parades and character appearances throughout the parks. Disneyland's Fantasyland Theater hosted Snow White: An Enchanting Musical from 2004 to 2006.\\r\\nUnknown Mary Jo Salerno played Snow White in the Disney-produced Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (also known as Snow White Live!) at the Radio City Music Hall.[65] Music and lyrics for four new songs were created by Jay Blackton and Joe Cook, respectively; titles included \\"Welcome to the Kingdom of Once Upon a Time\\" and \\"Will I Ever See Her Again?\\".[66] It ran from October 18 to November 18, 1979, and January 11 to March 9, 1980, a total of 106 performances.[67]\\r\\nIn the 2000s, DisneyToon Studios began development on a computer-animated prequel to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, titled The Seven Dwarfs. Director Mike Disa and screenwriter Evan Spiliotopoulos pitched a story explaining how the Dwarfs met, and how the Evil Queen killed Snow White's father and took the throne. According to Disa, DisneyToon management changed the prequel to center around how Dopey lost his voice upon witnessing the death of his mother. After Disney purchased Pixar in 2006, John Lasseter, DisneyToons' new Chief Creative Officer, canceled Dwarfs.[68]\\r\\nIn March 2016, the studio announced a new film in development titled Rose Red, a live-action spin-off film which will be told from the perspective of Snow White's sister, Red Rose.[69] In late October that year, a live-action feature-length Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was announced, with Erin Cressida Wilson in negotiations to write the script and Pasek and Paul writing new songs for the film.[70]\\r\\nThe Seven Dwarfs made rare appearances in shorts, despite their popularity; they simply were too numerous to animate efficiently. Commissioned shorts The Standard Parade (1939), The Seven Wise Dwarfs (1941, using mostly recycled footage), All Together (1942) and The Winged Scourge (1943) all include appearances.[71]\\r\\nThe animated television series House of Mouse, which included many Disney character animated cameos, included the characters in the special Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse. The Evil Queen appeared in a starring role in the film Once Upon a Halloween as well. In the arena of live action, the fantasy television series Once Upon a Time (produced by Disney-owned ABC Studios) regularly includes live-action interpretations of these characters including Snow White, the Evil Queen and Grumpy.\\r\\nAn animated television series featuring the seven dwarfs titled The 7D premiered on Disney XD on July 7, 2014, and ended its run on November 5, 2016. The show takes place 30 years before the events of the original film.\\r\\nA 1937ÿ1938 newspaper comic strip adaptation was republished repeatedly as a comic book, most recently in 1995.[72]\\r\\nStreaming audio","input":"What was the first full-length animated feature film made in the united states?"},{"output":"actor Erik Stocklin","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nColleen Ballinger (born November 21, 1986) is an American comedian, actress, singer and YouTube personality.[1]\\r\\nShe is best known for her Internet character Miranda Sings, posting videos of the character on YouTube and performing her one-woman comedy act on tour in theatres worldwide. She created the comically talentless, egotistical and eccentric character to satirize the many YouTube videos featuring people singing badly, but who appear unaware of their lack of talent. In her videos and stage act, the narcissistic character sings and dances badly, discusses current events that she misunderstands, gives inept \\"tutorials\\", collaborates with other YouTubers, and rants about her personal issues and her critics, whom she calls the \\"haters\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nBallinger also features comedy and lifestyle videos on her personal YouTube channel and a vlog channel, Colleen Vlogs. Her YouTube channels, combined, have surpassed 3 billion total views. The Miranda Sings channel has more than 9 million subscribers, and the character has more than 6 million Instagram followers.

Her Miranda Sings channel has surpassed 1.7 billion views and 9 million subscribers. A third channel, Colleen Vlogs, with more than 2 million subscribers, chronicles some of her experiences on tour and at home.[44] In 2014, Backstage magazine identified Ballinger as a performer who has \\"taken great advantage of producing their own content [online] and gathering large fan bases to promote their work.\\"[47] To promote her videos and shows, Ballinger is active on social media, with Instagram followings of more than 6 million for Miranda and 4 million for Ballinger, Twitter followings of more than 2.6 million for Miranda and 1.5 million for Ballinger, and more than 1.7 million page likes on the Miranda Sings Facebook page.[48] BuzzFeed called Miranda \\"The Queen of Twitter\\".[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nBallinger was able to turn the popularity of her videos into income from a percentage of advertising fees[40][50] or occasionally fixed sponsorship fees.[51] She told the Wall Street Journal: \\"I have to do things like torture myself to keep people watching\\" her YouTube videos.[50] To this end, she made a popular cinnamon challenge video in character as Miranda,[50][52] Until March 2013, Ballinger' YouTube audience was modest, but in that month, her Miranda Sings channel's audience reached 150,000 subscribers,[53] and both of her YouTube channels began to expand far more rapidly.[9][54] Ballinger offers merchandise on her mirandasings.com website, and some of the videos contain brand endorsements.[55][56] For example, a 2016 video, \\"Sexy Buttery Love Song\\" promoted Jack in the Box restaurants.[57] In 2016, Forbes magazine ranked Ballinger as the ninth highest-earning YouTuber.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nBallinger moved to New York City in 2010 to follow performing opportunities, but she returned to the West coast in 2012 when she realized that, to maximize her YouTube audience, she needed to collaborate with the community of YouTubers based in Los Angeles.[9] In July 2015, after several years of dating,[55] Ballinger and Joshua Evans wed in California.[59] In September 2016, the couple announced their divorce.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nBallinger then purchased a new home in Encino, California.[61] Ballinger met actor Erik Stocklin in 2016 when she cast him to play Miranda's love interest in Haters Back Off. The couple began dating by early 2018 and confirmed the relationship publicly in June 2018.[62] Later the same month, Ballinger announced that she and Stocklin are engaged and expecting their first child.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince January 2008, Ballinger has posted more than 400 videos as her comically talentless and quirky character, Miranda Sings, primarily on the YouTube channel Miranda Sings.[64][65] The character is a satire of the many YouTube videos featuring bad, but egotistical, performers who film themselves singing as a form of self-promotion, despite receiving the realistic or cruel comments of \\"haters\\".[66][67] \\"Miranda\\" is supposedly a home-schooled young woman who still lives with her mother and uncle; she is eccentric and infantilized, narcissistically believes that she was born famous, and is obsessed with show business fame.[68][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the videos, Miranda sings in a comically off-key, yet plausible, voice and covers mostly pop music hits, rants about internet haters, gives \\"tutorials\\", and sometimes discusses the character's backstory or current events, which she usually misunderstands.[56][70] She uses spoonerisms and malapropisms,[71] is irritable, ludicrously self-absorbed and self-righteous, socially awkward, and has a defiant, arrogant attitude.[72][73][74] She responds to viewers who take the videos seriously and offer criticism with the catchphrase, \\"Haters back off!\\",[71][75] telling these critics that \\"haters make me famous\\".[66][76] The character displays unusually active eyebrows and a crooked smile,[56][73] her head is cocked to one side, and she has pronunciation quirks.[68] She wears bright red lipstick drawn beyond the borders of her lips, dresses in mismatched out-of-style clothing, and often dances stiffly to the music she is performing.[38][77] Her views of society and morality are politically incorrect, and she displays a strong aversion to anything risque, which she calls \\"porn\\".[78][79] From 2010 to 2012, Ballinger posted 86 Miranda video blogs to a second Miranda YouTube channel, Mirandavlogz.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nBallinger based the character partly on young women that she knew in college.[68] She told The Times of London, \\"There were a lot of cocky girls who thought they were really talented, and they ... were so rude and snotty.... Then I saw all these girls trying to make a career out of putting videos on YouTube [of themselves singing in their bedrooms] ... clueless to the fact that they were terrible.\\"[8][81] At first, the \\"Miranda videos were meant to be an inside joke\\" among Ballinger's friends.[37][82] In March 2009, however, a Miranda video called \\"Free Voice Lesson\\" quickly became a sensation.[81][83] The video consists of bad advice about singing technique.[8][68] Miranda's videos drew predictably sharp criticism on YouTube, and as they became popular, Ballinger modified the character in response to the negative comments. She says: \\"I took what people hated and exaggerated it more in the next video.\\"[38][84] The online critics were so harsh that Miranda became a \\"hero of the anti-bullying movement\\".[75][85] Ballinger uses \\"humour and satire to challenge ideas of popular femininity. ... Miranda Sings ... puts on monstrous makeup to perform parody music videos [rejecting] being conventionally pretty.\\"[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Ballinger became pregnant in 2018, Miranda has begun a pregnancy storyline in which she claims to be the \\"virgin Miranda\\", expecting a virgin birth. Ballinger mentioned the story arc on a July 2018 appearance on Live with Kelly and Ryan.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince April 2009,[88] Ballinger has performed a one-woman comedy act, as Miranda Sings, at first in cabaret spaces and later in theatres in New York, London, and other cities in the US, UK, Australia, Europe, Canada and elsewhere.[89][90][91] BroadwayWorld.com called Miranda \\"the hottest, freshest and oddest breakout star in the musical theatre/cabaret scene\\".[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the live comedy acts, Miranda sings pop hits and some musical theatre songs in her signature off-key style.[93] At early performances, she gave \\"voice lessons\\" or \\"acting lessons\\" to Broadway or West End stars, such as Sutton Foster and Andrew Rannells, to assembled casts of Broadway shows,[68] and to pop stars such as Ariana Grande,[94] in which she was hypercritical of the stars' performances, telling them that they should leave show-business.[75][95][96] She reads hate mail that she has received; interacts with audience volunteers; uses projected presentations containing terrible spelling and includes a \\"magic trick\\" where she sings while appearing to be stabbed through the neck by a sword; the joke is that she sings better when the sword is inserted through her neck.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her 2014 \\"Selp Helf\\" tour, she instructed her (mostly young, female) audience on how to get a boyfriend by being more Miranda-like,[99][100] \\"improvising [with volunteers] and creating punchlines on the spot. ... Ballinger, the genius behind Miranda, is so convincing in the role, you ... will likely forget that there is a normal person behind the red lips\\".[93][101][102] One reviewer commented that the show \\"is no mere ... reproduction of her Internet channel. It is as theatrical as it is musical, comedic as it is inspirational.\\"[74] Another concurred: \\"Miranda [is] hilarious, and I was struck on several occasions by what an accomplished creation the character is. ... Bridging both personas, the moment she transforms into Miranda, on-stage and mid-song, is an absolute joy ÿ I'd struggle to recall hearing an audience erupt to such an extent, and I couldn't help but join in.\\"[36] Ballinger gave Miranda shows in 57 cities in 2014.[103] Her 2015 tours included a \\"Miranda 4 Precident\\"  [sic] themed tour[104] and a \\"Summer Camp\\" themed tour.[105]  Also in 2015, Miranda was a headliner at the Just for Laughs festival in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,[106][107] and released a film version of one of her stage shows on Vimeo, titled Miranda Sings: Selp Helf.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nReviewing Ballinger's second engagement as Miranda at the LaughFest festival in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 2016,[109] a critic noted that the material \\"resonated with parents as well as the younger set.\\"[110] Among other appearances, she performed as Miranda at the Kennedy Center in April 2016.[111] During the second half of 2016, she toured Miranda shows in the US, England, Ireland, Germany and Denmark, around her Haters Back Off production and promotion schedule.[112] A tour in early 2017, and later performances that year, were billed as \\"Miranda Sings Live ...

No Offense.[115] In September, during the tour, Ballinger plans to film a live Netflix Miranda comedy special at the Kennedy Center's Eisenhower Theater in Washington, D.C.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, Ballinger released a Christmas EP titled Christmas With Miranda Sings.[117] Miranda has been featured in radio, television and internet interviews.[72][118] Ballinger has also appeared or hosted as Miranda at award shows[119][120] and given benefit concerts[8][121] and workshops.[45] Miranda sings two tracks in character on Passey's album Self Taught, Still Learning.[16] In 2012, the character appeared in a comedy film, Varla Jean and the Mushroomheads,[122] and in an episode of the television show Victorious, titled \\"Tori Goes Platinum\\", on the Nickelodeon channel.[123][124] Miranda appeared in the first episode of Dance Chat, an Australian web show, in 2013.[125] She also appeared in a 2014 back-to-school video for Old Navy.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nBallinger guest-starred as Miranda Sings in the season 5 episode, \\"Happy Thanksgiving Miranda\\", of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee with Jerry Seinfeld, in November 2014.[127] Seinfeld called Miranda \\"a very well-developed character ... just as funny to me as ... to my daughter, who is 13. ... [The episode is] one of the best shows of Comedians in Cars weve ever done.\\"[128] Mediaite agreed, writing: \\"In its fifth season, Jerry Seinfeld's web series continued to be one of the most enjoyable weekly events on the internet. His experience with YouTube star Miranda Sings, which carried its way onto the Tonight Show, was a particular highlight.\\"[129] An Uproxx review compared Ballinger to Andy Kaufman.[130] In December 2014, Ballinger appeared as Miranda on The Tonight Show playing Pictionary with Jimmy Fallon, Martin Short and Jerry Seinfeld.[131] Us Weekly called the segment \\"the most hilarious game night ever\\",[132] Entertainment Weekly called it \\"riveting\\",[133] and People magazine wrote: \\"It's the most wonderful trainwrecked game of Pictionary you'll see this holiday season\\".[134]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Ballinger appeared as Miranda on The Grace Helbig Show, together with Jim Parsons,[135] and she released a book, Selp-Helf, published by Simon & Schuster, which calls it a \\"decidedly unhelpful, candid, hilarious 'how-to' guide\\". Written in Miranda's voice by Ballinger and her brother Christopher Ballinger,[136] it is presented in mock-scrapbook format, with silly advice, photos and comically bad artwork.[137] The book debuted at No. 1 on the Publishers Weekly Hardcover Non-Fiction best sellers list[5] and The New York Times Best Seller list for Advice, How-To & Miscellaneous.[138] It remained on the Times' Best Seller list for Advice & Misc. for 11 weeks[139] and was on their monthly Best Seller list for \\"Humor\\" for eleven months.[140] She released a second book, My Diarrhe, in 2018, in the form of a leaked diary.[141] It debuted at No. 8 on The New York Times Best Seller list for Advice, How-To & Miscellaneous.[142] Ballinger appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in July 2018 to promote the book.[143]\\r\\n\\r\\nBallinger appeared as a guest star, as Miranda, on the 2016 YouTube Red series Prank Academy.[144] She conceived, co-wrote, co-produced and starred as Miranda in the Netflix series, Haters Back Off. The series centered around Miranda's odd family life and her road to fame as a YouTuber.[145][146] Ballinger was featured as Miranda in a cover article in Variety about the show in June 2016.[1] The series ran for two seasons in 2016[145] and 2017.[147] Ballinger appeared on The Tonight Show[148] twice,[149] Chelsea,[150] Live with Kelly and Ryan three times,[151] and Total Request Live to promote it.[152] It was not picked up for a third season.[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2015, Ballinger has conducted an annual fundraiser to benefit childhood cancer, beginning on her birthday, November 21.[154] Using her YouTube channel and GoFundMe, she gives away personal items and Miranda merchandise and props, and draft scripts from Haters Back Off. In 2015, Ballinger donated all of the funds raised to St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital, while in 2016, she donated to individual families struggling with the costs and burdens of their children's cancer treatments.[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nBallinger's YouTube videos have received a total of more than 3 billion views.[44] In 2015, Miranda was ranked the 7th \\"most popular YouTube personality\\", by Daily American,[156] and one of the \\"Top 25 Digital Stars\\", by The Hollywood Reporter.[4] The Los Angeles Times wrote of her videos, \\"this footage is a major hoot\\".[64] Perez Hilton praised Miranda's parody of Sia's song \\"Chandelier\\" as \\"the crowning achievement of music video parodies ... utterly fantastic. ... [Ballinger] really has superb comedic timing.\\"[157] Initially, Miranda Sings enjoyed widespread popularity among musical theatre fans.[38][40][64] Later, her fan base expanded particularly among teenagers.[71][90][158] TV Guide commented: \\"Ironically, the character ... was created to satirize the very type of YouTube fame she's managed to cultivate.\\"[159]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Times of London commented that although Ballinger's videos have gained her character notice, it \\"is not online but on stage that Miranda truly comes to ghastly life.\\"[66] A reviewer from the Irish Independent wrote: \\"There is an endearing sweetness to her performance. ... This bizarre and bonkers show is somehow strangely compelling\\".[160] A 2013 reviewer concurred: \\"[O]nly a truly talented performer could make the Miranda character believable, let alone as endearing as she ends up being.\\"[73][161] AussieTheatre.com stated that Ballinger \\"creates the most successful parody of the world of YouTube ... she has created an international cult following\\".[162] As the popularity of the character increased, Ballinger was able to book longer runs of her live Miranda act, at larger and larger venues,[163][164] including the Best Buy Theater in New York City[99] and, among many others, London's Cadogan Hall.[93][165]\\r\\n\\r\\nBallinger's videos as herself have also gained attention: in 2015, her video \\"Reading Mean Comments\\" was praised by Cosmopolitan as \\"hilarious and pretty poignant\\".[166] She has been praised for the example that she sets for her young fans: \\"While being outgoing and authentic, [Ballinger] has seized the opportunity to present positive values.\\"[167] In each of 2014, 2015 and 2016, Ballinger was nominated for one or more Teen Choice Awards, winning the award for \\"Web Star: Comedy\\" in 2015.[2][168][169] She was nominated for three 2015 Streamy Awards, winning for best actress.[3][170] Miranda was nominated for a 2015 People's Choice Award,[171] a 2016 Shorty Award[172] and two 2016 Streamy Awards.[173] Ballinger was ranked No. 5 on Forbes magazine's 2017 list of top entertainment influencers.[174] She has been ranked No. 1 on several weekly Top Comedians Social Media Rankings by The Hollywood Reporter.[175]","input":"Who is the father of colleen ballengers baby?"},{"output":"Don Henley","context":"The Eagles are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1971. The founding members were Glenn Frey (guitars, vocals), Don Henley (drums, vocals), Bernie Leadon (guitars, vocals) and Randy Meisner (bass guitar, vocals). With five number-one singles, six Grammy Awards, five American Music Awards, and six number-one albums, the Eagles were one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s. At the end of the 20th century, two of their albums, Their Greatest Hits (1971ÿ1975) and Hotel California, were ranked among the 20 best-selling albums in the United States according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Hotel California is ranked 37th in Rolling Stone's list of \\"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" and the band was ranked number 75 on the magazine's 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[1]\\r\\nThe Eagles are one of the world's best-selling bands in history, having sold more than 150 million records[2]100 million in the U.S. aloneincluding 42 million copies of Their Greatest Hits (1971ÿ1975) and 32 million copies of Hotel California. Their Greatest Hits (1971ÿ1975) was the best selling album of the 20th century in the U.S.[3] They are the fifth-highest-selling music act and the highest-selling American band in U.S. history.\\r\\nThe band released their debut album, Eagles, in 1972, which spawned three top 40 singles: \\"Take It Easy,\\" \\"Witchy Woman,\\" and \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling.\\" Their next album, Desperado (1973), was less successful than the first, only reaching number 41 on the charts; neither of its singles reached the top 40. However, the album does contain what would go on to be two of the band's most popular tracks: \\"Desperado\\" and \\"Tequila Sunrise.\\" The band released On the Border in 1974, adding guitarist Don Felder as the fifth member midway through the recording of the album. The album generated two top 40 singles: \\"Already Gone\\" and their first number one, \\"Best of My Love.\\"\\r\\nTheir 1975 album One of These Nights included three top 10 singles: \\"One of These Nights,\\" \\"Lyin' Eyes,\\" and \\"Take It to the Limit,\\" the first hitting the top of the charts. Guitarist and vocalist Joe Walsh also joined the band in 1975 replacing Leadon. The Eagles continued that success and hit their commercial peak in late 1976 with the release of Hotel California, which would go on to sell more than 16 million copies in the U.S. alone and more than 32 million copies worldwide. The album yielded two number-one singles, \\"New Kid in Town\\" and \\"Hotel California.\\" Meisner left the band in 1977 and was replaced by Timothy B. Schmit. They released their last studio album for nearly 28 years in 1979 with The Long Run, which spawned three top 10 singles: \\"Heartache Tonight,\\" \\"The Long Run,\\" and \\"I Can't Tell You Why,\\" the lead single being another chart-topping hit.\\r\\nThe Eagles disbanded in July 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the album Hell Freezes Over, a mix of live and new studio tracks. They toured consistently and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2007, the Eagles released Long Road Out of Eden, their first full studio album in 28 years and their sixth number-one album. The next year they launched the Long Road Out of Eden Tour in support of the album. In 2013, they began the extended History of the Eagles Tour in conjunction with the band's documentary release, History of the Eagles.\\r\\nFollowing the death of Frey in January 2016, Henley stated in several interviews that he did not think the band would perform again. However, the Eagles continued performing in 2017 with guest musicians Deacon Frey (son of Glenn) and Vince Gill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eagles began in early 1971, when Linda Ronstadt and her then-manager John Boylan recruited local musicians Glenn Frey and Don Henley for her band.[4] Henley had moved to Los Angeles from Texas with his band Shiloh to record an album produced by Kenny Rogers,[5] and Frey had come from Michigan and formed Longbranch Pennywhistle; they had met in 1970 at The Troubadour in Los Angeles and became acquainted through their mutual record label, Amos Records.[6][7] Randy Meisner, who had been working with Ricky Nelson's backing band, the Stone Canyon Band, and Bernie Leadon, a veteran of the Flying Burrito Brothers, also later joined Ronstadt's group of performers for her summer tour promoting the Silk Purse album.[4][8]\\r\\nWhile on the tour, Frey and Henley decided to form a band together and informed Ronstadt of their intention. Frey later credited Ronstadt with suggesting Leadon for the band, and arranging for Leadon to play for her so Frey and Henley could approach him about forming a band together. They also pitched the idea to Meisner and brought him on board.[9] These four played live together behind Ronstadt only once for a July concert at Disneyland,[4] but all four appeared on her eponymous album.[10] It was later proposed that J. D. Souther should join the band, but Meisner objected.[11] The four were signed in September 1971 to Asylum Records, the new label started by David Geffen, who was introduced to Frey by Jackson Browne.[12] Geffen bought out Frey's and Henley's contracts with Amos Records, and sent the four to Aspen, Colorado to develop as a band.[13] Having not settled on a band name yet, they performed their first show in October 1971 under the name of Teen King and the Emergencies at a club called The Gallery in Aspen.[14][15] Don Felder credited Leadon with originating the name of Eagles for the band during a peyote and tequila-influenced group outing in the Mojave Desert, when he recalled reading about the Hopis' reverence for the eagle.[16] Accounts however vary, and J.D. Souther suggested that the idea came when Frey shouted out, \\"Eagles!\\" when they saw eagles flying above.[17] Steve Martin, a friend of the band from their early days at The Troubadour, recounts in his autobiography that he suggested that they should be referred to as \\"the Eagles,\\" but Frey insists that the group's name is simply \\"Eagles.\\"[18] Geffen and partner Elliot Roberts initially managed the band; they were later replaced by Irving Azoff while the Eagles were recording their third album.[19]\\r\\nThe group's eponymous debut album was recorded in England in February 1972 with producer Glyn Johns.[4] Johns was impressed by the harmony singing of the band,[20] and he has been credited with shaping the band into \\"the country-rock band with those high-flyin' harmonies.\\"[21] Released on June 1, 1972, Eagles was a breakthrough success, yielding three Top 40 singles. The first single and lead track, \\"Take It Easy,\\" was a song written by Frey with his then-neighbor and fellow country-folk rocker Jackson Browne. Browne had written the first verse of the song, but got stalled on the second verse after the line \\"I'm standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona.\\" Frey completed the verse with \\"It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford, slowin' down to take a look at me,\\" and Browne carried on to finish the song.[22] The song reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and propelled the Eagles to stardom. The single was followed by the bluesy \\"Witchy Woman\\" and the soft country rock ballad \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling,\\" charting at number 9 and number 22 respectively. The group supported the album with a US tour as the opening act for Yes.\\r\\nTheir second album, Desperado, took Old West outlaws for its theme, drawing comparisons between their lifestyles and modern rock stars. This album was the first to showcase the group's penchant for conceptual songwriting. It was during these recording sessions Henley and Frey first began writing together. They co-wrote eight of the album's eleven songs, including \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" and \\"Desperado,\\" two of the group's most popular songs. The bluegrass songs \\"Twenty-One,\\" \\"DoolinÿDalton,\\" and the ballad \\"Saturday Night\\" showcase guitarist Bernie Leadon's abilities on the banjo, guitar, and mandolin. The story of the notorious Wild West \\"DoolinÿDalton\\" gang is the main thematic focus of the album, as seen in the songs \\"DoolinÿDalton,\\" \\"Desperado,\\" \\"Certain Kind of Fool,\\" \\"Outlaw Man,\\" and \\"Bitter Creek.\\" The album was less successful than the group's first, reaching only number 41 on the US Billboard 200 and yielding two singles, \\"Tequila Sunrise,\\" which reached number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 and \\"Outlaw Man,\\" which peaked at number 59. With Henley and Frey co-writing the bulk of the albuma pattern that would continue for years to comethe album marked a significant change for the band. The pair also began to dominate in terms of leadership; the early assumption had been that Leadon and Meisner as veteran musicians would have a greater influence on the band.[23]\\r\\nFor their next album, On the Border, Henley and Frey wanted the band to break away from the country rock style and move more towards hard rock. The Eagles initially started with Glyn Johns as the producer for this album, but he tended to emphasize the lush side of their double-edged music. After completing only two usable songs, the band turned to Bill Szymczyk to produce the rest of the album.[24][25] Szymczyk wanted a harder-edged guitarist for the song \\"Good Day in Hell\\" and the band remembered Bernie Leadon's childhood friend Don Felder, a guitarist who had jammed backstage with the band in 1972 when they opened for Yes in Boston.[26] Felder had been nicknamed \\"Fingers\\" at the jam by Frey, a name that stuck due to his guitar proficiency.[27] In January 1974, Frey called Felder to add slide guitar to the song \\"Good Day in Hell\\" and the band was so impressed that they invited him to join the group as the fifth Eagle the next day.[28] He appeared on one other song on the album, the uptempo breakup song \\"Already Gone,\\" on which he performed a guitar duet with Frey. \\"Already Gone\\" was released as the first single from the album and it reached number 32 on the charts. On the Border yielded a number 1 Billboard single (\\"Best of My Love\\"), which hit the top of the charts on March 1, 1975. The song was the Eagles' first of five chart toppers.[29] The album included a cover version of the Tom Waits song \\"Ol' '55\\" and the single \\"James Dean,\\" which reached number 77 on the charts.\\r\\nThe band played at the California Jam festival in Ontario, California on April 6, 1974. Attracting more than 300,000 fans and billed as \\"the Woodstock of the West Coast,\\" the festival featured Black Sabbath, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Deep Purple, Earth, Wind & Fire, Seals & Crofts, Black Oak Arkansas, and Rare Earth.[30] Portions of the show were telecast on ABC television in the United States, exposing the Eagles to a wider audience. Felder missed the show when he was called away to attend the birth of his son; Jackson Browne filled in for him on piano and acoustic guitar.[31]\\r\\nThe Eagles released their fourth studio album, One of These Nights, on June 10, 1975. A breakthrough album for the Eagles, making them international superstars, it was the first in a string of four consecutive number 1 albums. The dominant songwriting partnership of Henley and Frey continued on this album. The first single was the title track, which became their second consecutive chart topper. Frey has said it is his all-time favorite Eagles tune.[32] The second single was \\"Lyin' Eyes,\\" which reached number 2 on the charts and won the band their first Grammy for \\"Best Pop Performance by a duo or group with vocal.\\" The final single, \\"Take It to the Limit,\\" was written by Meisner, Henley, and Frey, and it is the only Eagles single to feature Meisner on lead vocals. The song reached number 4 on the charts. The band launched a huge worldwide tour in support of the album, and the album was nominated for a Grammy award for Album of the Year. The group was featured on the cover of the September 25, 1975 issue of Rolling Stone magazine and on September 28, the band joined Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, and Toots and the Maytals for a show in front of 55,000 people at Anaheim Stadium.[33]\\r\\nOne of These Nights was their last album to feature founding member Bernie Leadon. Leadon wrote or co-wrote three songs for the album, including \\"I Wish You Peace,\\" written with girlfriend Patti Davis (daughter of California governor Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan); and the instrumental \\"Journey of the Sorcerer,\\" which would later be used as the theme music for the BBC's radio and television versions of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Leadon was disillusioned with the direction the band's music was taking and his loss of creative control as their sound was moving from his preferred country to rock and roll.[34] His dissatisfaction, principally with Frey, boiled over one night when Frey was talking animatedly about the direction they should take next, and Leadon poured a beer over Frey's head, and said: \\"You need to chill out, man!\\"[35][36] On December 20, 1975, after months of denials, it was announced that Leadon had left the band.[34]\\r\\nLeadon's replacement, officially announced on December 20, 1975, was guitarist, singer, and keyboardist Joe Walsh, who had been a friend of the band for some years. He had previously performed with James Gang, Barnstorm, and as a solo artist; he was also managed by Azoff and used Szymczyk as his record producer.[37] There was some initial concern as to Walsh's ability to fit in with the band, as he was considered too \\"wild\\" for the Eagles, especially by Henley.[37] After the departure of Leadon, the Eagles' early country sound almost completely disappeared, with the band employing a harder sound with the addition of Felder and Walsh; however, Felder also had to play banjo, pedal steel and mandolin on future tours, something that had previously been Leadon's domain.[38]\\r\\nIn early 1976, the band released their first compilation album, Their Greatest Hits (1971ÿ1975). The album became the highest-selling album of the 20th century in the United States,[39] and has since sold 29 million copies in the U.S. and 42 million copies worldwide.[40][41] It stayed the biggest seller of all time until it was taken over by Michael Jackson's Thriller following the artist's death in 2009.[41] The album cemented the group's status as the most successful American band of the decade.\\r\\nThe following album, Hotel California, released on December 8, 1976, was the band's fifth studio album and the first to feature Walsh. The album took a year and a half to complete, a process which, along with touring, drained the band. The album's first single, \\"New Kid in Town,\\" became the Eagles' third number-one single.\\r\\nThe second single was the title track, which topped the charts in May 1977 and became the Eagles' signature song. It features Henley on lead vocals, with a guitar duet performed by Felder and Walsh. The song was written by Felder, Henley, and Frey, with Felder writing all the music. The mysterious lyrics have been interpreted in many ways, some of them controversial. Rumors even started in certain quarters that the song was about Satanism. The rumor was dismissed by the band and later by Henley in the documentary film History of the Eagles. Henley told 60 Minutes in 2007 that \\"it's basically a song about the dark underbelly of the American Dream and about excess in America, which was something we knew about.\\"[42]\\r\\nWith its hard rock sound, \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" was also a major success that established Walsh's position in the band. The third and final single from Hotel California, it reached number 11 on the charts. The ballad \\"Wasted Time\\" closes the first side of the album, while an instrumental reprise of it opens the second side. The album concludes with \\"The Last Resort,\\" a song that Frey once referred to as \\"Henley's opus,\\" but which Henley described as \\"fairly pedestrian\\" and \\"never fully realized, musically speaking.\\"[22]\\r\\nThe run-out groove on side two has the words \\"V.O.L. Is Five-Piece Live\\" etched into the vinyl, which means that the instrumental track for the song \\"Victim of Love\\" was recorded live in the studio, with no overdubs. Henley confirms this in the liner notes of The Very Best Of. However, the song was a point of contention between Don Felder and the rest of the band. In the 2013 documentary, Felder claimed that he had been promised the lead vocal on \\"Victim of Love,\\" for which he had written most of the music. After many unproductive attempts to record Felder's vocal, band manager Irving Azoff was delegated to take Felder out for a meal, removing him from the mix while Don Henley overdubbed his lead vocal. Hotel California appeared at number 37 on Rolling Stone's list of the best albums of all time,[43] and is the band's best-selling studio album, with more than 17 million copies sold in the U.S. alone[44] and more than 32 million copies worldwide.[45]\\r\\nThe album won Grammys for \\"Record of the Year\\" (\\"Hotel California\\") and \\"Best Arrangement for Voices\\" (\\"New Kid in Town\\"). Hotel California topped the charts and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 1978 Grammy Awards, but lost to Fleetwood Mac's Rumours. The huge worldwide tour in support of the album further drained the band members and strained their personal and creative relationships.\\r\\nHotel California is the last album to feature founding member Randy Meisner, who abruptly left the band after the 1977 tour. The Eagles had been touring continuously for eleven months; the band was suffering from the strain of the tour, and Meisner's stomach ulcers had flared up by the time they arrived in Knoxville in June 1977.[46] Meisner had been struggling to hit the crucial high notes in his signature song, \\"Take It To the Limit,\\" and was unwilling to perform the song, Frey and Meisner then became engaged in arguments about Meisner's reluctance to perform.[47] Meisner decided to not sing the song as an encore at the Knoxville concert because he had been up late and caught the flu.[47][48] Frey and Meisner then got into an angry physical confrontation backstage, and Meisner left the venue. After the incident, Meisner was frozen out from the band,[46] and he decided to leave the group at the end of the tour and return to Nebraska to be with his family. His last performance was in East Troy, Wisconsin on September 3, 1977.[49] The band replaced Meisner with the same musician who had succeeded him in Poco, Timothy B. Schmit, after agreeing that Schmit was the only candidate.[50]\\r\\nIn 1977, the group, minus Don Felder, performed instrumental work and backing vocals for Randy Newman's album Little Criminals, including \\"Short People,\\" which has backup vocals by Frey and Schmit.\\r\\nThe Eagles went into the recording studio in 1977 to begin work on their next album, The Long Run. The album took two years to complete. It was originally intended to be a double album, but the band members were unable to write enough songs. The Long Run was released on September 24, 1979. Considered a disappointment by some critics for failing to live up to Hotel California, it proved a huge commercial hit nonetheless; the album topped the charts and sold seven million copies. In addition, it included three Top 10 singles. \\"Heartache Tonight\\" became their last single to top the Hot 100, on November 10, 1979. The title track and \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\" both reached number 8. The band won their fourth Grammy for \\"Heartache Tonight.\\" \\"In The City\\" by Walsh and \\"The Sad Cafe\\" became live staples. The band also recorded two Christmas songs during these sessions, \\"Funky New Year\\" and \\"Please Come Home for Christmas,\\" which was released as a single in 1978 and reached number 18 on the charts.\\r\\nFrey, Henley and Schmit contributed backup vocals for the single release of \\"Look What You've Done to Me\\" by Boz Scaggs. A different version with female backing vocals appears on the Urban Cowboy soundtrack, along with the Eagles' 1975 hit \\"Lyin' Eyes.\\"\\r\\nOn July 31, 1980, in Long Beach, California, tempers boiled over into what has been described as the \\"Long Night at Wrong Beach.\\"[51][52] The animosity between Felder and Frey boiled over before the show began, when Felder said, \\"You're welcome ÿ I guess\\" to California Senator Alan Cranston's wife as the politician was thanking the band backstage for performing a benefit for his reelection.[53] Frey and Felder spent the entire show telling each other about the beating each planned to administer backstage. \\"Only three more songs until I kick your ass, pal,\\" Frey recalled Felder telling him near the end of the band's set.[54] Felder recalls Frey telling him during \\"Best of My Love,\\" \\"I'm gonna kick your ass when we get off the stage.\\"[51][55]\\r\\nIt appeared to be the end of the Eagles, but the band still had a commitment with Elektra Records to make a live record from the tour. Eagles Live (released in November 1980) was mixed on opposite coasts. Frey had already left the band and would remain in Los Angeles, while the other band members each worked on their parts in Miami.[56] \\"We were fixing three-part harmonies courtesy of Federal Express,\\" said producer Bill Szymczyk.[5] Frey refused to speak to the other Eagles, and he fired Irving Azoff as his manager.[56] With credits that listed five attorneys, the album's liner notes simply said, \\"Thank you and goodnight.\\" A single released from the album ÿ \\"Seven Bridges Road\\" ÿ had been a live concert staple for the band. It was written by Steve Young in an arrangement created by Iain Matthews for his Valley Hi album in 1973. The song reached number 21 on the charts in 1980, becoming the Eagles' last Top 40 single until 1994.\\r\\nAfter the Eagles broke up, the former members pursued solo careers. Elektra, the band's long-time record label, owned the rights to solo albums created by members of the Eagles (though several of them moved to different labels in ensuing years). Walsh had established himself as a solo artist in the 1970s, before and during his time with the Eagles, but it was uncharted waters for the others. Walsh released a successful album in 1981, There Goes the Neighborhood, but subsequent albums throughout the 1980s, such as Got Any Gum? were less well received. During this period Walsh performed as a session musician for Dan Fogelberg, Steve Winwood, John Entwistle, Richard Marx and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, among others, and produced and co-wrote Ringo Starr's Old Wave album.\\r\\nHenley achieved arguably the greatest commercial solo success of any former Eagle. In 1981, he sang a duet with Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac fame, \\"Leather and Lace.\\" In 1982, he released I Can't Stand Still, featuring the hit \\"Dirty Laundry.\\" This album would pale in comparison to his next release, Building the Perfect Beast (1984), which features the classic rock radio staples \\"The Boys of Summer\\" (a Billboard number 5 hit), \\"All She Wants to Do Is Dance\\" (number 9), \\"Not Enough Love in the World\\" (number 34) and \\"Sunset Grill\\" (number 22). Henley's next album, The End of the Innocence (1989), was also a major success. It includes \\"The End of the Innocence,\\" \\"The Last Worthless Evening\\" and \\"The Heart of the Matter.\\" His solo career was cut short due to a contract dispute with his record company, which was finally resolved when the Eagles reunited in 1994.\\r\\nFrey also achieved solo success in the 1980s. In 1982, he released his first album, No Fun Aloud, which spawned the number 15 hit, \\"The One You Love.\\" The Allnighter (1984) featured the number 20 hit \\"Sexy Girl.\\" He reached number 2 on the charts with \\"The Heat Is On\\" from the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack. He had another number 2 single in 1985 with \\"You Belong to the City\\" from the Miami Vice soundtrack, which featured another Frey song, \\"Smuggler's Blues.\\" He appeared as \\"Jimmy\\" in the episode titled after the song and contributed riffs to the episode's soundtrack. He also contributed the songs \\"Flip City\\" to the Ghostbusters II soundtrack and \\"Part of Me, Part of You\\" to the soundtrack for Thelma & Louise.\\r\\nMusic writer turned filmmaker Cameron Crowe, an Eagles fan, had written articles about Poco and the Eagles during his journalism career. In 1982 his first screenplay was produced as the feature-length movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The film was co-produced by Eagles manager Azoff, who also co-produced the soundtrack album, released by Elektra. Henley, Walsh, Schmit and Felder all contributed solo songs to the film's soundtrack. The band playing at the dance toward the end of the movie covers the Eagles song \\"Life in the Fast Lane.\\"\\r\\nFelder also released a solo album and contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the movie Heavy Metal: \\"Heavy Metal (Takin' a Ride)\\" (with Henley and Schmit providing backing vocals) and \\"All of You.\\" He also had a minor hit called \\"Bad Girls\\" off his solo album Airborne.\\r\\nSchmit had a prolific solo career after the band's initial breakup. He had a hit song on the Fast Times at Ridgemont High soundtrack with \\"So Much in Love.\\" He contributed vocals to the Crosby, Stills & Nash album Daylight Again on the songs \\"Southern Cross\\" and \\"Wasted on the Way\\" when that band needed an extra vocalist due to David Crosby's drug overindulgence. Schmit sang backup vocals on Toto's Toto IV album, including the song \\"I Won't Hold You Back\\" and appeared with the group on their 1982 European tour. He spent three years (1983ÿ1985) as a member of Jimmy Buffett's Coral Reefer band and coined the term \\"Parrotheads\\" for Buffett's die-hard fans. He had a Top 40 solo hit in 1987 with \\"Boys' Night Out\\" and a top-30 Adult Contemporary hit with \\"Don't Give Up,\\" both from his album Timothy B. Schmit appeared with Meisner and Walsh on Richard Marx's debut single \\"Don't Mean Nothing.\\" In 1992, Schmit and Walsh toured as members of Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band and appeared on the live video from the Montreux Jazz Festival. Schmit released two solo albums, Playin' It Cool in 1984 and Tell Me the Truth in 1990. He was the only Eagle to appear on the 1993 Eagles tribute album Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles, singing backing vocals on Vince Gill's cover of \\"I Can't Tell You Why.\\"\\r\\nMeisner hit the top 40 three times, including the number 19 \\"Hearts on Fire\\" in 1981.\\r\\nAn Eagles country tribute album, titled Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles, was released in 1993, 13 years after the breakup. Travis Tritt insisted on having the Long Run-era Eagles in his video for \\"Take It Easy\\" and they agreed. Following years of public speculation, the band formally reunited the following year. The lineup comprised the five Long Run-era membersFrey, Henley, Walsh, Felder, and Schmitsupplemented by Scott Crago (drums), John Corey (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), Timothy Drury (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), and former Loggins and Messina sideman Al Garth (sax, violin) on stage.\\r\\n\\"For the record, we never broke up, we just took a 14-year vacation,\\" announced Frey at their first live performance in April 1994. The ensuing tour spawned a live album titled Hell Freezes Over (named for Henley's recurring statement that the group would get back together \\"when hell freezes over\\"), which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard album chart. It included four new studio songs, with \\"Get Over It\\" and \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\" both becoming Top 40 hits. The album proved as successful as the tour, selling six million copies in the U.S. The tour was interrupted in September 1994 because of Frey's serious recurrence of diverticulitis, but it resumed in 1995 and continued into 1996.[57] In 1998, the Eagles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. For the induction ceremony, all seven Eagles members (Frey, Henley, Felder, Walsh, Schmit, Leadon, and Meisner) played together for two songs, \\"Take It Easy\\" and \\"Hotel California.\\" Several subsequent reunion tours followed (without Leadon or Meisner), notable for their record-setting ticket prices.[58][59]\\r\\nThe Eagles performed at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas on December 28 and 29, 1999, followed by a concert at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on December 31. These concerts marked the last time Felder played with the band and the shows (including a planned video release) would later form a part of a lawsuit filed by Felder against his former band mates. The concert recordings were released on CD as part of the four-disc Selected Works: 1972ÿ1999 box set in November 2000. Along with the concert, this set included the band's hit singles, album tracks and outtakes from The Long Run sessions. Selected Works received platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2002.[60] The group resumed touring in 2001, with a line-up consisting of Frey, Henley, Walsh, and Schmit, along with Steuart Smith (guitars, mandolin, keyboards, backing vocals; essentially taking over Felder's role), Michael Thompson (keyboards, trombone), Will Hollis (keyboards, backing vocals), Scott Crago (drums, percussion), Bill Armstrong (Horns), Al Garth (sax, violin), Christian Mostert (sax), and Greg Smith (sax, percussion).\\r\\nOn February 6, 2001, Don Felder was fired from the Eagles. He responded by filing two lawsuits against \\"Eagles, Ltd.,\\" a California corporation; Don Henley, an individual; Glenn Frey, an individual; and \\"Does 1ÿ50,\\" alleging wrongful termination, breach of implied-in-fact contract and breach of fiduciary duty, reportedly seeking $50 million in damages.[61][62] Felder alleged that from the 1994 Hell Freezes Over tour onward, Henley and Frey had .\\".. insisted that they each receive a higher percentage of the band's profits ...,\\" whereas the money had previously been split in five equal portions. Felder accused them of coercing him into signing an agreement under which Henley and Frey would receive three times as much of the Selected Works: 1972ÿ1999 proceeds.\\r\\nOn behalf of Henley and Frey, attorney Daniel M. Petrocelli responded by saying \\"[Henley and Frey] feltcreatively, chemistry-wise and performance-wisethat he should no longer be part of the band ... They removed him, and they had every legal right to do so. This has been happening with rock 'n' roll bands since day one.[61] Henley and Frey then countersued Felder for breach of contract, alleging that Felder had written a \\"tell-all\\" book, Heaven and Hell: My Life in the Eagles (1974ÿ2001). The initial U.S. release was canceled after publisher Hyperion Books backed out in September 2001, when an entire print run of the book had to be recalled for cuts and changes. The American edition was published by John Wiley & Sons on April 28, 2008, with Felder embarking on a full publicity campaign surrounding its release. The book was published in the United Kingdom on November 1, 2007.[63]\\r\\nOn January 23, 2002, the Los Angeles County Court consolidated the two complaints, set a trial date for September 2006,[64] and the single case was dismissed on May 8, 2007, after being settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.[64]\\r\\nIn 2003, the Eagles released a greatest hits album, The Very Best Of.[65] The two-disc compilation was the first that encompassed their entire career from Eagles to Hell Freezes Over. It debuted at number 3 on the Billboard charts and eventually gained triple platinum status. The album included a new single, the September 11 attacks-themed \\"Hole in the World.\\" Also in 2003, Warren Zevon, a longtime Eagles friend, began work on his final album, The Wind, with the assistance of Henley, Walsh, and Schmit.\\r\\nOn June 14, 2005, the Eagles released a new 2-DVD set, Farewell 1 Tour-Live from Melbourne, featuring two new songs: Frey's \\"No More Cloudy Days\\" and Walsh's \\"One Day at a Time.\\" A special edition 2006 release, exclusive to Walmart and affiliated stores, includes a bonus audio CD with three new songs: a studio version of \\"No More Cloudy Days,\\" \\"Fast Company,\\" and \\"Do Something.\\"[66]\\r\\nIn 2007, the Eagles consisted of Frey, Henley, Walsh, and Schmit. On August 20, 2007, \\"How Long,\\" written by J. D. Souther, was released as a single to radio with an accompanying online video at Yahoo! Music. It debuted on television on Country Music Television during the Top 20 Countdown on August 23, 2007. The band had performed the song as part of their live sets in the early to mid-1970s, but did not record it at the time because Souther wanted to reserve it for use on his first solo album. Souther had previously worked with the Eagles, co-writing some of their biggest hits, including \\"Best of My Love,\\" \\"Victim of Love,\\" \\"Heartache Tonight,\\" and \\"New Kid in Town.\\"\\r\\nOn October 30, 2007, the Eagles released Long Road Out of Eden, their first album of all-new material since 1979. For the first year after the album's release, it was available in the U.S. only via the band's website, at Walmart, and at Sam's Club stores.[67] It was commercially available through traditional retail outlets in other countries. The album debuted at number 1 in the U.S.,[68] the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands, and Norway. It became their third studio album and seventh release overall to be certified at least seven times platinum by the RIAA.[69] Henley told CNN that \\"This is probably the last Eagles album that we'll ever make.\\"[70]\\r\\nThe Eagles made their awards show debut on November 7, 2007, when they performed \\"How Long\\" live at the Country Music Association Awards.\\r\\nOn January 28, 2008, the second single of Long Road Out of Eden was released. \\"Busy Being Fabulous\\" peaked at number 28 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart[71] and at number 12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.[71] The Eagles won their fifth Grammy in 2008, in the category Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for \\"How Long.\\"\\r\\nOn March 20, 2008, the Eagles launched their world tour in support of Long Road Out of Eden at The O2 Arena in London. The Long Road Out of Eden Tour concluded the American portion of the tour at Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy, Utah on May 9, 2009. It was the first concert ever held in the new soccer stadium. The tour travelled to Europe, with its final concert date on July 22, 2009, in Lisbon. The band spent the summer of 2010 touring North American stadiums with the Dixie Chicks and Keith Urban. The tour expanded to England as the headline act of the Hop Farm Festival on July 1, 2011.\\r\\nAsked in November 2010 whether the Eagles were planning a follow-up to Long Road Out of Eden, Schmit replied, \\"My first reaction would be: no way. But I said that before the last one, so you never really know. Bands are a fragile entity and you never know what's going to happen. It took a long time to do that last album, over a span of years, really, and it took a lot out of us. We took a year off at one point. I'm not sure if we're able to do that again. I wouldn't close the door on it, but I don't know.\\"[72] Walsh said in 2010 that there might be one more album before the band \\"wraps it up.\\"[73] Frey later stated in a 2012 interview that the band has had discussions about releasing an EP of potentially 4ÿ6 songs that may contain both original and cover material.[74]\\r\\nIn February 2013, the Eagles released a career-spanning documentary called History of the Eagles and began the supporting tour with 11 US arena concerts in July.[75] Henley said that the tour, which expanded internationally and continued until July 2015,[76] \\"could very well be our last...we're gonna include at least one former band member in this tour and kinda go back to the roots, and how we created some of these songs. We're gonna break it down to the fundamentals and then take it up to where it is now.\\"[77] Original Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon also appeared on the tour. Walsh stated, \\"Bernies brilliant, I never really got a chance to play with him, but we've been in contact. We see him from time to time, and I'm really glad he's coming because it's going to take the show up a notch, and I'm really looking forward to playing with him, finally.\\"[78] Former members Randy Meisner and Don Felder did not appear.[76] Meisner had been invited but could not participate for health reasons, while Felder was never asked. Though his lawsuits against the Eagles were settled in 2007, Henley claimed that Felder continued to \\"engage in legal action, of one kind or another\\" against the band, but did not state what those actions were.[76]\\r\\nThe Eagles (Frey, Henley, Walsh, and Schmit) were slated to receive Kennedy Center Honors in 2015, but this was deferred to 2016 due to Frey's health problems.[79]\\r\\nOn January 18, 2016, founding member Glenn Frey died at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York City at the age of 67. The causes of his death were rheumatoid arthritis, acute ulcerative colitis, and pneumonia while recovering from intestinal surgery.[80][81][82]\\r\\nAt the 58th Annual Grammy Awards in February, the Eagles, joined by Leadon, touring guitarist Steuart Smith, and co-writer Jackson Browne, performed \\"Take It Easy\\" in honor of Frey.[83] In subsequent interviews, Henley stated that he didn't think the band would perform again.[84][85]\\r\\nIn March 2017, it was announced that the band would be headlining the Classic West and Classic East concert events in July 2017, which were organized by their manager Irving Azoff.[86] Glenn Frey's son Deacon performed in Glenn's place, along with country musician Vince Gill.[87][88] At the Classic West concert on July 15, the band was joined by Bob Seger who sang \\"Heartache Tonight\\", which he co-wrote. Deacon Frey was noted for his composure and precision.[89]\\r\\nA North American tour, again with Frey and Gill, began in March 2018.[90] Henley's son Will joined the touring band as a guitarist.[91]\\r\\nInfluenced by 1960s rhythm and blues, soul, bluegrass, and rock bands such as the Byrds and Buffalo Springfield,[92] the Eagles' overall sound has been described as \\"California rock.\\"[93] In the words of Sal Manna, author of the CD liner notes of the band's 1994 album Hell Freezes Over, \\"no one knew quite what 'California rock' meant ÿ except perhaps that, because in California anything was possible, music that came from that promising land was more free-spirited and free-ranging.\\"[94] Rolling Stone described the Eagles' sound as \\"country-tinged vocal harmonies with hard rock guitars and lyrics.\\"\\r\\nThe group's sound has also been described as country rock,[78][95][96][97][98] soft rock[58][99][100][101][102] and folk rock,[103][104][105] and in later years the band became associated with the album rock and arena rock labels.[4][106]\\r\\nOn their early records, the group combined rock and roll, country, and folk music styles.[107] For their third album On the Border, the band widened their style to include a prominent hard rock sound,[108] a genre the band had only touched upon previously. The 1975 follow-up album One of These Nights saw the group explore a softer sound, notably exemplified on the hit singles \\"Take It to the Limit,\\" and \\"Lyin' Eyes.[94] Leadon, who was the principal country influence, left the band after the album was released, and the band moved away from country rock to a more rock direction in Hotel California.[109] The band's 2007 comeback album Long Road Out of Eden saw them explore country rock, blues rock, and funk.[110]\\r\\nCurrent members\\r\\nFormer members\\r\\nTouring musicians\\r\\nSources","input":"Who are the current members of the eagles rock band?"},{"output":"5 November 2013","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan (\\"Mars-craft\\", from Sanskrit: ???? mangala, \\"Mars\\" and ??? yna, \\"craft, vehicle\\"),[9][10] is a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).[11][12][13][14] It is India's first interplanetary mission[15] and ISRO has also become the fourth space agency to reach Mars, after the Soviet space program, NASA, and the European Space Agency.[16][17] It is the first Asian nation to reach Mars orbit, and the first nation in the world to do so in its first attempt.[18][19][20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08?UTC on 5 November 2013.[22] The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013.[5] The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC).[23] After a 298-day transit to Mars, it was inserted into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mission is a \\"technology demonstrator\\" project to develop the technologies for designing, planning, management, and operations of an interplanetary mission.[24] It carries five instruments that will help advance knowledge about Mars to achieve its secondary, scientific objective.[25] The spacecraft is currently being monitored from the Spacecraft Control Centre at ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bangalore with support from Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) antennae at Byalalu, Karnataka.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 23 November 2008, the first public acknowledgement of an unmanned mission to Mars was announced by then-ISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair.[27] The MOM mission concept began with a feasibility study in 2010 by the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology after the launch of lunar satellite Chandrayaan-1 in 2008. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh approved the project on 3 August 2012,[28][29] after the Indian Space Research Organisation completed ?125 crore (US$17?million) of required studies for the orbiter.[30] The total project cost may be up to ?454 crore (US$63?million).[11][31] The satellite costs ?153 crore (US$21?million) and the rest of the budget has been attributed to ground stations and relay upgrades that will be used for other ISRO projects.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe space agency had planned the launch on 28 October 2013 but was postponed to 5 November following the delay in ISRO's spacecraft tracking ships to take up pre-determined positions due to poor weather in the Pacific Ocean.[5] Launch opportunities for a fuel-saving Hohmann transfer orbit occur every 26 months, in this case the next two would be in 2016 and 2018.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAssembly of the PSLV-XL launch vehicle, designated C25, started on 5 August 2013.[34] The mounting of the five scientific instruments was completed at Indian Space Research Organisation Satellite Centre, Bangalore, and the finished spacecraft was shipped to Sriharikota on 2 October 2013 for integration to the PSLV-XL launch vehicle.[34] The satellite's development was fast-tracked and completed in a record 15 months.[35] Despite the US federal government shutdown, NASA reaffirmed on 5 October 2013 it would provide communications and navigation support to the mission.[36] During a meeting on 30 September 2014, NASA and ISRO officials signed an agreement to establish a pathway for future joint missions to explore Mars. One of the working group's objectives will be to explore potential coordinated observations and science analysis between the MAVEN orbiter and MOM, as well as other current and future Mars missions.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total cost of the mission was approximately ?450 Crore (US$73 million),[38][39] making it the least-expensive Mars mission to date.[40] The low cost of the mission was ascribed by K. Radhakrishnan, the chairman of ISRO, to various factors, including a \\"modular approach\\", few ground tests and long (18ÿ20 hour) working days for scientists.[41] BBC's Jonathan Amos mentioned lower worker costs, home-grown technologies, simpler design, and a significantly less complicated payload than NASA's MAVEN.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary objective of the mission is to develop the technologies required for designing, planning, management and operations of an interplanetary mission.[24] The secondary objective is to explore Mars' surface features, morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere using indigenous scientific instruments.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main objectives are to develop the technologies required for designing, planning, management and operations of an interplanetary mission comprising the following major tasks:[43]:42\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientific objectives deal with the following major aspects:[43]:43\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mission would also provide multiple opportunities to observe the Martian moon Phobos and also offer an opportunity to identify and re-estimate the orbits of asteroids seen during the Martian Transfer Trajectory.[43]:43\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 15?kg (33?lb) scientific payload consists of five instruments:[46][47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network performed navigation and tracking operations for the launch with ground stations at Sriharikota, Port Blair, Brunei and Biak in Indonesia,[50] and after the spacecraft's apogee became more than 100,000?km, an 18?m (59?ft) and a 32?m (105?ft) diameter antenna of the Indian Deep Space Network were utilised.[51] The 18?m (59?ft) dish antenna was used for communication with the craft until April 2014, after which the larger 32?m (105?ft) antenna was used.[52] NASA's Deep Space Network is providing position data through its three stations located in Canberra, Madrid and Goldstone on the US West Coast during the non-visible period of ISRO's network.[53] The South African National Space Agency's (SANSA) Hartebeesthoek (HBK) ground station is also providing satellite tracking, telemetry and command services.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunications are handled by two 230-watt TWTAs and two coherent transponders. The antenna array consists of a low-gain antenna, a medium-gain antenna and a high-gain antenna. The high-gain antenna system is based on a single 2.2-metre (7?ft 3?in) reflector illuminated by a feed at S-band. It is used to transmit and receive the telemetry, tracking, commanding and data to and from the Indian Deep Space Network.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs originally conceived, ISRO was to launch MOM on its Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV),[74] but as the GSLV failed twice in 2010 and ISRO was continuing to sort out issues with its cryogenic engine,[75] it was not advisable to wait for the new batch of rockets as that would have delayed the MOM project for at least three years.[76] ISRO opted to switch to the less-powerful Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). Since the PSLV was not powerful enough to place MOM on a direct-to-Mars trajectory, the spacecraft was launched into a highly elliptical Earth orbit and used its own thrusters over multiple perigee burns (to take advantage of the Oberth effect) to place itself on a trans-Mars trajectory.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 October 2013, ISRO chairman K. Radhakrishnan announced that the launch had to be postponed by a week as a result of a delay of a crucial telemetry ship reaching Fiji. The launch was rescheduled for 5 November 2013.[5] ISRO's PSLV-XL placed the satellite into Earth orbit at 09:50?UTC on 5 November 2013,[30] with a perigee of 264.1?km (164.1?mi), an apogee of 23,903.6?km (14,853.0?mi), and inclination of 19.20 degrees,[55] with both the antenna and all three sections of the solar panel arrays deployed.[77] During the first three orbit raising operations, ISRO progressively tested the spacecraft systems.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orbiter's dry mass is 500?kg (1,100?lb), and it carried 852?kg (1,878?lb) of fuel and oxidiser at launch. Its main engine, which is a derivative of the system used on India's communications satellites, uses the bipropellant combination monomethylhydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide to achieve the thrust necessary for escape velocity from Earth. It was also used to slow down the probe for Mars orbit insertion and, subsequently, for orbit corrections.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral orbit raising operations were conducted from the Spacecraft Control Centre (SCC) at the ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) at Peenya, Bangalore on 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 16 November by using the spacecraft's on-board propulsion system and a series of perigee burns. The first three of the five planned orbit raising manoeuvres were completed with nominal results, while the fourth was only partially successful. However, a subsequent supplementary manoeuvre raised the orbit to the intended altitude aimed for in the original fourth manoeuvre. A total of six burns were completed while the spacecraft remained in Earth orbit, with a seventh burn conducted on 30 November to insert MOM into a heliocentric orbit for its transit to Mars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first orbit-raising manoeuvre was performed on 6 November 2013 at 19:47?UTC when the spacecraft's 440-newton (99?lbf) liquid engine was fired for 416 seconds. With this engine firing, the spacecraft's apogee was raised to 28,825?km (17,911?mi), with a perigee of 252?km (157?mi).[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second orbit raising manoeuvre was performed on 7 November 2013 at 20:48?UTC, with a burn time of 570.6 seconds resulting in an apogee of 40,186?km (24,970?mi).[57][58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third orbit raising manoeuvre was performed on 8 November 2013 at 20:40?UTC, with a burn time of 707 seconds, resulting in an apogee of 71,636?km (44,513?mi).[57][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth orbit raising manoeuvre, starting at 20:36?UTC on 10 November 2013, imparted an incremental velocity of 35?m/s (110?ft/s) to the spacecraft instead of the planned 135?m/s (440?ft/s) as a result of underburn by the motor.[60][78] Because of this, the apogee was boosted to 78,276?km (48,638?mi) instead of the planned 100,000?km (62,000?mi).[60] When testing the redundancies built-in for the propulsion system, the flow to the liquid engine stopped, with consequent reduction in incremental velocity. During the fourth orbit burn, the primary and redundant coils of the solenoid flow control valve of 440 newton liquid engine and logic for thrust augmentation by the attitude control thrusters were being tested. When both primary and redundant coils were energised together during the planned modes, the flow to the liquid engine stopped. Operating both the coils simultaneously is not possible for future operations, however they could be operated independently of each other, in sequence.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the fourth planned burn coming up short, an additional unscheduled burn was performed on 12 November 2013 that increased the apogee to 118,642?km (73,721?mi),[57][61] a slightly higher altitude than originally intended in the fourth manoeuvre.[57][79] The apogee was raised to 192,874?km (119,846?mi) on 15 November 2013, 19:57?UTC in the final orbit raising manoeuvre.[57][79]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 November 2013 at 19:19?UTC, a 23-minute engine firing initiated the transfer of MOM away from Earth orbit and on heliocentric trajectory toward Mars.[23] The probe travelled a distance of 780,000,000 kilometres (480,000,000?mi) to reach Mars.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour trajectory corrections were originally planned, but only three were carried out.[64] The first trajectory correction manoeuvre (TCM) was carried out on 11 December 2013 at 01:00?UTC by firing the 22-newton (4.9?lbf) thrusters for a duration of 40.5 seconds.[57] After this event, MOM was following the designed trajectory so closely that the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned in April 2014 was not required. The second trajectory correction manoeuvre was performed on 11 June 2014 at 11:00?UTC by firing the spacecraft's 22 newton thrusters for a duration of 16 seconds.[81] The third planned trajectory correction manoeuvre was postponed, due to the orbiter's trajectory closely matching the planned trajectory.[82] The third trajectory correction was also a deceleration test 3.9 seconds long on 22 September 2014.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan was for an insertion into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014,[7][83] approximately 2 days after the arrival of NASA's MAVEN orbiter.[84] The 440-newton liquid apogee motor was test fired on 22 September at 09:00?UTC for 3.968 seconds, about 41 hours before actual orbit insertion.[83][85][86]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter these events, the spacecraft performed a reverse manoeuvre to reorient from its deceleration burn and entered Martian orbit.[8][87][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orbit insertion put MOM in a highly elliptical orbit around Mars, as planned, with a period of 72 hours 51 minutes 51 seconds, a periapsis of 421.7?km (262.0?mi) and apoapsis of 76,993.6?km (47,841.6?mi).[8] At the end of the orbit insertion, MOM was left with 40?kg (88?lb) of fuel on board, more than the 20?kg (44?lb) necessary for a six-month mission.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 28 September 2014, MOM controllers published the spacecraft's first global view of Mars. The image was captured by the Mars Colour Camera (MCC).[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 October 2014, the ISRO altered MOM's orbit so as to move it behind Mars for Comet Siding Spring's flyby of the planet on 19 October 2014. The spacecraft consumed 1.9?kg (4?lb) of fuel for the manoeuvre. As a result, MOM's apoapsis was reduced to 72,000?km (45,000?mi).[90] After the comet passed by Mars, ISRO reported that MOM remained healthy.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 March 2015, the ISRO reported that the MSM instrument was functioning normally and are studying Mars' albedo, the reflectivity of the planet's surface. The Mars Colour Camera was also returning new images of the Martian surface.[92][93]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 24 March 2015, MOM completed its initial six-month mission in orbit around Mars. ISRO extended the mission by an additional six months; the spacecraft has 37?kg (82?lb) of propellant remaining and all five of its scientific instruments are working properly.[94] The orbiter can reportedly continue orbiting Mars for several years with its remaining propellant.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 17-day communications blackout occurred from 6 to 22 June 2015 while Mars' orbit took it behind the Sun from Earth's view.[43]:52\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 24 September 2015, ISRO released its \\"Mars Atlas\\", a 120-page scientific atlas containing images and data from the Mars Orbiter Mission's first year in orbit.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2016, the first science results of the mission were published in Geophysical Research Letters, presenting measurements obtained by the spacecraft's MENCA instrument of the Martian exosphere.[97][98]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 January 2017, MOM's orbit was altered to avoid the impending eclipse season. With a burn of eight 22?N thrusters for 431 seconds, resulting in a velocity difference of 97.5 metres per second (351?km/h) using 20 kilograms (44?lb) of propellant (leaving 13?kg remaining), eclipses were be avoided until September 2017. The battery is able to handle eclipses of up to 100 minutes.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 May 2017, MOM reached 1,000 days (973 sols) in orbit around Mars. In that time, the spacecraft completed 388 orbits of the planet and relayed more than 715 images back to Earth. ISRO officials stated that it remains in good health.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 24, 2018, MOM completed 4 years in its orbit around Mars, although the designed mission life was only six months. Over these years, MOM's Mars Colour Camera has captured over 980 images that were released to the public.

Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays led four thousand rebels (called Shaysites) in an uprising against perceived economic and civil rights injustices. In 1787, the rebels marched on the United States' Armory at Springfield in an unsuccessful attempt to seize its weaponry and overthrow the government.\\r\\nThe rebellion took place in a political climate where reform of the country's governing document, the Articles of Confederation, was widely seen as necessary. The events of the rebellion served as a catalyst for the calling of the U.S. Constitutional Convention, and ultimately the shape of the new government.[1]\\r\\nThe shock of Shays' Rebellion drew retired General George Washington back into public life, leading to his two terms as the United States' first President.[1] The exact nature and consequence of the rebellion's influence on the content of the Constitution and the ratification debates continues to be a subject of historical discussion and debate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the rural parts of New England, particularly in the hill-towns of central and western Massachusetts, the economy during the American Revolutionary War had been one of little more than subsistence agriculture. Some residents in these areas had little in the way of assets beyond their land and bartered with one another for goods or services. In lean times, farmers might obtain goods on credit from suppliers in local market towns who would be paid when times were better.[2]\\r\\nIn the more economically developed coastal areas of Massachusetts Bay and in the fertile Connecticut River Valley, the economy was basically a market economy, driven by the activities of wholesale merchants dealing with Europe, the West Indies and elsewhere on the North American coast.[3] The state government was dominated by this merchant class.[4]\\r\\nWhen the Revolutionary War ended in 1783, the European business partners of Massachusetts merchants refused to extend lines of credit to them and insisted that they pay for goods with hard currency. Despite the continent-wide shortage of such currency, merchants began to demand the same from their local business partners, including those merchants operating in the market towns in the state's interior.[5] Many of these merchants passed on this demand to their customers, although the popular governor, John Hancock, did not impose hard currency demands on poorer borrowers and refused to actively prosecute the collection of delinquent taxes.[6]\\r\\nThe rural farming population was generally unable to meet the demands being made of them by merchants or the civil authorities, and individuals began to lose their land and other possessions when they were unable to fulfill their debt and tax obligations. This led to strong resentments against tax collectors and the courts, where creditors obtained and enforced judgments against debtors, and where tax collectors obtained judgments authorizing property seizures.[7]\\r\\nAt a meeting convened by aggrieved commoners, a farmer identified as \\"Plough Jogger\\", encapsulated the situation:[8][9][10]\\r\\n\\"I have been greatly abused, have been obliged to do more than my part in the war, been loaded with class rates, town rates, province rates, Continental rates and all rates?... been pulled and hauled by sheriffs, constables and collectors, and had my cattle sold for less than they were worth?... The great men are going to get all we have and I think it is time for us to rise and put a stop to it, and have no more courts, nor sheriffs, nor collectors nor lawyers.\\"\\r\\nOverlaid upon these financial issues was the fact that veterans of the war had received little pay during the war and faced difficulty collecting pay owed them from the State or the Congress of the Confederation.[8] Some of the soldiers, Daniel Shays among them, began to organize protests against these oppressive economic conditions. Shays was a farmhand from Massachusetts when the Revolution broke out; he joined the Continental Army, saw action at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Bunker Hill and Saratoga, and was eventually wounded in action. In 1780, he resigned from the army unpaid and went home to find himself in court for nonpayment of debts. He soon realized that he was not alone in his inability to pay his debts and began organizing for debt relief.[11]\\r\\nOne early protest against the government was led by Job Shattuck of Groton on the New Hampshire border, who in 1782 organized residents there to physically prevent tax collectors from doing their work.[12] A second, larger-scale protest took place in the Massachusetts town of Uxbridge, in Worcester County on the Rhode Island border. On Feb. 3, 1783, a mob seized property that had been confiscated by a local constable and returned it to its owners. Governor Hancock ordered the sheriff to suppress these actions.[13]\\r\\nMost rural communities attempted to use the legislative process to gain relief. Petitions and proposals were repeatedly submitted to the state legislature to issue paper currency. Such inflationary issues would depreciate the currency, making it possible to meet obligations made at high values with lower-valued paper. The merchants, among them James Bowdoin, were opposed to the idea, since they were generally lenders who stood to lose from such proposals. As a result, these proposals were repeatedly rejected.[14]\\r\\nGovernor Hancock, accused by some of anticipating trouble, resigned citing health reasons in early 1785.[15] When Bowdoin (a perennial loser to Hancock in earlier elections) was elected governor that year, matters became more severe. Bowdoin stepped up civil actions to collect back taxes, and the legislature exacerbated the situation by levying an additional property tax to raise funds for the state's portion of foreign debt payments.[16] Even comparatively conservative commentators such as John Adams observed that these levies were \\"heavier than the People could bear.\\"[17]\\r\\nProtests in rural Massachusetts turned into direct action in August 1786, after the state legislature adjourned without considering the many petitions that had been sent to Boston.[18][19] On August 29 a well-organized force of protestors formed in Northampton and successfully prevented the county court from sitting.[20] The leaders of this and later forces proclaimed that they were seeking relief from the burdensome judicial processes that were depriving the people of their land and possessions. They called themselves Regulators, a reference to the Regulator movement of North Carolina that sought to reform corrupt practices in the late 1760s.[21]\\r\\nOn September 2 Governor Bowdoin issued a proclamation denouncing such mob action, but took no military measures beyond planning militia response to future actions.[20][22] When the court in Worcester was shut down by similar action on September 5, the county militia (composed mainly of men sympathetic to the protestors) refused to turn out, much to Bowdoin's amazement.[23] Governors of the neighboring states where similar protests took place acted decisively, calling out the militia to hunt down the ringleaders after the first such protests.[24]\\r\\nIn Rhode Island, matters were resolved without violence because the \\"country party\\" gained control of the legislature in 1786 and enacted measures forcing its merchant elites to trade debt instruments for devalued currency. The impact of this was not lost on Boston's merchants, especially Bowdoin, who held more than S3,000 in Massachusetts notes.[25]\\r\\nDaniel Shays, who had participated in the Northampton action, began to take a more active role in the uprising in November, though he firmly denied that he was one of its leaders. On September 19, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts indicted eleven leaders of the rebellion as \\"disorderly, riotous, and seditious persons.\\"[11] When the supreme judicial court was next scheduled to meet in Springfield on September 26, Shays in Hampshire County and Luke Day in what is now Hampden County (but was then part of Hampshire County) organized an attempt to shut it down.[26]\\r\\nThey were anticipated by William Shepard, the local militia commander, who began gathering government-supporting militia the Saturday before the court was to sit. By the time the court was ready to open, Shepard had 300 men protecting the Springfield courthouse. Shays and Day were able to recruit a similar number, but chose only to demonstrate, exercising their troops outside Shepard's lines, rather than attempt to seize the building.[27] The judges first postponed the hearings, and then adjourned on the 28th without hearing any cases. Shepard withdrew his force, which had grown to some 800 men (to the Regulators' 1,200), to the federal armory, which was then only rumored to be the target of seizure by the activists.[28]\\r\\nProtests in Great Barrington, Concord, and Taunton were also successful in shutting courts down in those communities in September and October.[20] James Warren wrote to John Adams on October 22, \\"We are now in a state of Anarchy and Confusion bordering on Civil War.\\"[29] Courts in the larger towns and cities were able to meet, but required protection of the militia, which Bowdoin called out for the purpose.[20]\\r\\nThe Boston elites were mortified at this resistance. Governor Bowdoin commanded the legislature to \\"vindicate the insulted dignity of government.\\" Samuel Adams claimed that foreigners (\\"British emissaries\\") were instigating treason among the commoners, and he helped draw up a Riot Act, and a resolution suspending habeas corpus in order to permit the authorities to keep people in jail without trial. Adams proposed a new legal distinction: that rebellion in a republic, unlike in a monarchy, should be punished by execution.[11]\\r\\nThe legislature also moved to make some concessions to the upset farmers, saying certain old taxes could now be paid in goods instead of hard currency.[11] These measures were followed up by one prohibiting speech critical of the government, and offering pardons to protestors willing to take an oath of allegiance.[30] These legislative actions were unsuccessful in quelling the protests,[11] and the suspension of habeas corpus alarmed many.[31]\\r\\nIn late November warrants were issued for the arrest of several of the protest ringleaders. On November 28 a posse of some 300 men rode to Groton to arrest Job Shattuck and other rebel leaders in the area. Shattuck was chased down and arrested on the 30th, and was wounded by a sword slash in the process.[32] This action and the arrest of other protest leaders in the eastern parts of the state radicalized those in the west, and they began to organize an overthrow of the state government. \\"The seeds of war are now sown\\", wrote one correspondent in Shrewsbury,[33] and by mid-January rebel leaders spoke of smashing the \\"tyrannical government of Massachusetts.\\"[34]\\r\\nSince the federal government had been unable to recruit soldiers for the army (primarily because of a lack of funding), the Massachusetts elites determined to act independently. On January 4, 1787, Governor Bowdoin proposed creation of a privately funded militia army. Former Continental Army General Benjamin Lincoln solicited funds, and had by the end of January raised more than S6,000 from more than 125 merchants.[35] The 3,000 militia that were recruited into this army were almost entirely from the eastern counties of Massachusetts, and marched to Worcester on January 19.[36]\\r\\nWhile the government forces assembled, rebel leaders in the west ÿ including Shays and Day ÿ organized their forces establishing regional regimental organizations that were run by democratically-elected committees. Their first major target was the federal armory in Springfield.[37] General Shepard had taken possession of the armoury, pursuant to orders from Governor Bowdoin, and used its arsenal to arm a force of some 1,200 militia. He had done this despite the fact that the armory was federal, not state, property, and that he did not have permission from Secretary at War Henry Knox to do so.[38][39]\\r\\nThe insurgents were organized into three major groups, and intended to surround and simultaneously attack the armory. Shays had one group east of Springfield near Palmer, Luke Day had a second force across the Connecticut River in West Springfield, and the third force, under Eli Parsons, was to the north at Chicopee.[40] The rebels had planned their assault for January 25. Luke Day changed this at the last minute, sending Shays a message indicating he would not be ready to attack until the 26th.[41] Day's message was intercepted by Shepard's men, so the militia of Shays and Parsons, some 1,500 men, approached the armory on the 25th not knowing they would have no support from the west.[42]\\r\\nWhen Shays and his forces neared the armory, they found Shepard's militia waiting for them. Shepard first ordered warning shots fired over the approaching Shaysites' heads, and then ordered two cannons to fire grape shot at Shays' men. Four Shaysites were killed and twenty wounded. There was no musket fire from either side, and the rebel advance collapsed.[43] Most of the rebel force fled north, eventually regrouping at Amherst. On the opposite side of the river, Day's forces also fled north, also eventually reaching Amherst.[44]\\r\\nGeneral Lincoln, when he heard of the Springfield incident, immediately began marching west from Worcester with the 3,000 men that had been mustered. The rebels moved generally north and east to avoid Lincoln, eventually establishing a camp at Petersham; along the way they raided the shops of local merchants for supplies, taking some of them hostage. Lincoln pursued them, reaching Pelham, some 30 miles (48?km) from Petersham, on February 2.[45]\\r\\nOn the night of February 3ÿ4, he led his militia on a forced march to Petersham through a bitter snowstorm. Arriving early in the morning, they surprised the rebel camp so thoroughly that they scattered \\"without time to call in their out parties or even their guards.\\"[46] Although Lincoln claimed to capture 150 men, none of them were officers, leading historian Leonard Richards to suspect the veracity of the report. Most of the leadership escaped north into New Hampshire and Vermont, where they were sheltered despite repeated demands that they be returned to Massachusetts for trial.[47]\\r\\nLincoln's march marked the end of large-scale organized resistance. Ringleaders who eluded capture fled to neighboring states, and pockets of local resistance continued. Some rebel leaders approached Lord Dorchester, the British governor of Quebec for assistance, who was reported to promise assistance in the form of Mohawk warriors led by Joseph Brant.[48] (Dorchester's proposal was vetoed in London, and no assistance came to the rebels.)[49]\\r\\nThe same day that Lincoln arrived at Petersham, the state legislature passed bills authorizing a state of martial law, giving the governor broad powers to act against the rebels. The bills also authorized state payments to reimburse Lincoln and the merchants who had funded the army, and authorized the recruitment of additional militia.[50] On February 12 the legislature passed the Disqualification Act, seeking to prevent a legislative response by rebel sympathizers. This bill expressly forbade any acknowledged rebels from holding a variety of elected and appointed offices.[51]\\r\\nMost of Lincoln's army melted away in late February as enlistments expired; by the end of the month he commanded but thirty men at a base in Pittsfield.[52] In the meantime some 120 rebels had regrouped in New Lebanon, New York, and on February 27 they crossed the border. Marching first on Stockbridge, a major market town in the southwestern corner of the state, they raided the shops of merchants and the homes of merchants and local professionals. This came to the attention of Brigadier John Ashley, who mustered a force of some 80 men, and caught up with the rebels in nearby Sheffield late in the day. In the bloodiest encounter of the rebellion, 30 rebels were wounded (one mortally), at least one government soldier was killed, and many were wounded.[53] Ashley, who was further reinforced after the encounter, reported taking 150 prisoners.[54]\\r\\nFour thousand people signed confessions acknowledging participation in the events of the rebellion in exchange for amnesty. Several hundred participants were eventually indicted on charges relating to the rebellion. Most of these were pardoned under a general amnesty that only excluded a few ringleaders. Eighteen men were convicted and sentenced to death. Most of these were either overturned on appeal, pardoned, or had their sentences commuted. Two of the condemned men, John Bly and Charles Rose, were hanged on December 6, 1787.[55]\\r\\nBly and Rose were also accused of common-law crime as both were looters. Shays was pardoned in 1788 and he returned to Massachusetts from hiding in the Vermont woods.[56] He was vilified by the Boston press, who painted him as an archetypal anarchist opposed to the government.[57] He later moved to the Conesus, New York area, where he lived until he died poor and obscure in 1825.[56]\\r\\nThe crushing of the rebellion and the harsh terms of reconciliation imposed by the Disqualification Act all worked against Governor Bowdoin politically. In the gubernatorial election held in April 1787, Bowdoin received few votes from the rural parts of the state, and was trounced by John Hancock.[58] The military victory was tempered by tax changes in subsequent years. The legislature elected in 1787 cut taxes and placed a moratorium on debts. It also refocused state spending away from interest payments, resulting in a 30% decline in the value of Massachusetts securities as those payments fell in arrears.[59]\\r\\nVermont, then an unrecognized independent republic that had been seeking statehood independent from New York's claims to the territory, became an unexpected beneficiary of the rebellion due to its sheltering of the rebel ringleaders. Alexander Hamilton broke from other New Yorkers, including major landowners with claims on Vermont territory, calling for the state to recognize and support Vermont's bid for admission to the union. He cited Vermont's de facto independence and its ability to cause trouble by providing support to the discontented from neighboring states as reasons, and introduced legislation that broke the impasse between New York and Vermont. Vermonters responded favorably to the overture, publicly pushing Eli Parsons and Luke Day out of the state (but quietly continuing to support others). After negotiations with New York and the passage of the new constitution, Vermont became the fourteenth state.[60]\\r\\nThomas Jefferson, who was serving as ambassador to France at the time, refused to be alarmed by Shays' Rebellion. In a letter to James Madison on January 30, 1787, he argued that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing. \\"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.\\"[61]\\r\\nIn contrast to Jefferson's sentiments George Washington, who had been calling for constitutional reform for many years, wrote in a letter to Henry Lee, \\"You talk, my good sir, of employing influence to appease the present tumults in Massachusetts. I know not where that influence is to be found, or, if attainable, that it would be a proper remedy for the disorders. Influence is not government. Let us have a government by which our lives, liberties, and properties will be secured, or let us know the worst at once.\\"[62][63]\\r\\nAt the time of the rebellion, the weaknesses of the federal government as constituted under the Articles of Confederation were apparent to many. A vigorous debate was going on throughout the states on the need for a stronger central government, with Federalists arguing for the idea, and Anti-Federalists opposing them. Historical opinion is divided on what sort of role the rebellion played in the formation and later ratification of the United States Constitution, although most scholars agree it played some role, at least temporarily drawing some anti-Federalists to the strong government side.[64]\\r\\nBy early 1785 many influential merchants and political leaders were already agreed that a stronger central government was needed. A convention at Annapolis, Maryland, in September 1786 of delegates from five states concluded that vigorous steps needed to be taken to reform the federal government, but it disbanded because of a lack of full representation, calling for a convention of all the states to be held in Philadelphia in May 1787.[65] Historian Robert Feer notes that several prominent figures had hoped that convention would fail, requiring a larger-scale convention, and French diplomat Louis-Guillaume Otto thought the convention was intentionally broken off early to achieve this end.[66]\\r\\nIn early 1787 John Jay wrote that the rural disturbances and the inability of the central government to fund troops in response made \\"the inefficiency of the Federal government [become] more and more manifest.\\"[67] Henry Knox observed that the uprising in Massachusetts clearly influenced local leaders who had previously opposed a strong federal government. Historian David Szatmary writes that the timing of the rebellion \\"convinced the elites of sovereign states that the proposed gathering at Philadelphia must take place.\\"[68] Some states, Massachusetts among them, delayed choosing delegates to the proposed convention, in part because in some ways it resembled the \\"extra-legal\\" conventions organized by the protestors before the rebellion became violent.[69]\\r\\nThe convention that met in Philadelphia was dominated by strong-government advocates.[70] Delegate Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut argued that because the people could not be trusted (as exemplified by Shays' Rebellion), the members of the federal House of Representatives should be chosen by state legislatures, not by popular vote.[71] The example of Shays' Rebellion may also have been influential in the addition of language to the constitution concerning the ability of states to manage domestic violence, and their ability to demand the return of individuals from other states for trial.[72]\\r\\nThe rebellion also played a role in the discussion of a number of the executives. While mindful of tyranny, delegates of the Constitutional Convention thought that the single executive would be more effective in responding to national disturbances.[73]\\r\\nFederalists cited the rebellion as an example of the confederation government's weaknesses, while opponents such as Elbridge Gerry thought that a federal response to the rebellion would have been even worse than that of the state. (Gerry, a merchant speculator and Massachusetts delegate from Essex County, was one of the few convention delegates who refused to sign the new constitution, although his reasons for doing so did not stem from the rebellion.)[74]\\r\\nWhen the constitution had been drafted, Massachusetts was viewed by Federalists as a state that might not ratify it, because of widespread anti-Federalist sentiment in the rural parts of the state. Massachusetts Federalists, including Henry Knox, were active in courting swing votes in the debates leading up to the state's ratifying convention in 1788. When the vote was taken on February 6, 1788, representatives of rural communities involved in the rebellion voted against ratification by a wide margin, but the day was carried by a coalition of merchants, urban elites, and market town leaders. The state ratified the constitution by a vote of 187 to 168.[75]\\r\\nHistorians are divided on the impact the rebellion had on the ratification debates. Robert Feer notes that major Federalist pamphleteers rarely mentioned it, and that some anti-Federalists used the fact that Massachusetts survived the rebellion as evidence that a new constitution was unnecessary.[76] Leonard Richards counters that publications like the Pennsylvania Gazette explicitly tied anti-Federalist opinion to the rebel cause, calling opponents of the new constitution \\"Shaysites\\" and the Federalists \\"Washingtonians\\".[77]\\r\\nDavid Szatmary argues that debate in some states was affected, particularly in Massachusetts, where the rebellion had a polarizing effect.[78] Richards records Henry Jackson's observation that opposition to ratification in Massachusetts was motivated by \\"that cursed spirit of insurgency\\", but that broader opposition in other states originated in other constitutional concerns expressed by Elbridge Gerry, who published a widely distributed pamphlet outlining his concerns about the vagueness of some of the powers granted in the constitution and its lack of a Bill of Rights.[79]\\r\\nThe military powers enshrined in the constitution were soon put to use by President George Washington. After the passage by the United States Congress of the Whiskey Act, protest against the taxes it imposed began in western Pennsylvania. The protests escalated and Washington led federal and state militia to put down what is now known as the Whiskey Rebellion.[80]\\r\\nThe events and people of the uprising are commemorated in the towns where they lived and those where events took place. Sheffield erected a memorial (pictured above) marking the site of the \\"last battle\\", and Pelham memorialized Daniel Shays. US Route 202, which runs through Pelham, is called the Daniel Shays Highway. A statue of General Shepard was erected in his hometown of Westfield.[81]\\r\\nIn the town of Petersham, Massachusetts, a memorial was erected in 1927 by the New England Society of Brooklyn, New York. The memorial commemorates General Benjamin Lincoln, who raised 3,000 troops and routed the rebellion on February 4, 1787. It ends with the line, \\"Obedience to the law is true liberty.\\"[82]","input":"What impact did shays rebellion have on the country?"},{"output":"Holloman Air Force Base (IATA: HMN, ICAO: KHMN, FAA LID: HMN)","context":"Holloman Air Force Base (IATA: HMN, ICAO: KHMN, FAA LID: HMN) is a United States Air Force base located six miles (10?km) southwest of the central business district of Alamogordo, and a census-designated place in Otero County, New Mexico, United States.

The Wing's F-22s were transferred to other F-22 wings to bolster their available aircraft.\\r\\nAs of 18 July 2012, the 46th Test Group was 'reflagged' as the 96th Test Group, under the new 96 TW, stationed at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.[2] The 96th Test Group is an Air Force Materiel Command unit responsible for operational testing and evaluation of new equipment and systems proposed for use by these forces. Current initiatives include advanced self-protection systems for combat aircraft, aircrew life support systems, aerial reconnaissance improvements, new armament and weapons delivery systems, and improved maintenance equipment and logistics support.\\r\\nSquadrons of the group are:\\r\\nAircraft of the 96th Test Group carry the tail code \\"HT\\".\\r\\nIn March 2014 the 54th Fighter Group was reactivated at Holloman AFB, NM with a mission to train F-16 aircrew members and aircraft maintenance personnel. The 54th Fighter Group is a geographically separated unit of the 56th Fighter Wing, out of Luke AFB, Arizona.\\r\\nComponents:\\r\\nOn 1 May 1996, the German Luftwaffe established the German Air Force Tactical Training Center at Holloman.\\r\\nThe German Air Force Tactical Training Center activated at Holloman 1 May 1996. With the activation, 300 German military personnel and 12 Panavia Tornado aircraft joined Team Holloman. German aircrews come to Holloman for approximately three weeks for advanced tactical training and then return to Germany. The German Air Force also conducts a Fighter Weapons Instructor Course for the Tornado. Aircrews for this course come to Holloman for about six months.\\r\\nAs of November 2006 there are 650 German military personnel and 25 Tornado aircraft assigned to Holloman AFB.\\r\\nThere are numerous reasons the German Air Force trains at Holloman. The area offers great flying weather and has suitable air space. Other reasons are the proximity of Holloman to the German Air Force Air Defense Center at Fort Bliss, Texas and the centralizing of German aircrew training at a single location. To facilitate this, there is a memorandum of understanding between the two governments.\\r\\nBy offering NATO allies the benefits of available space at Holloman as well as the use of the Southwest's excellent flying weather, the U.S. can help maintain the strength of NATO's forces without the expense of forward-basing U.S. forces in great numbers overseas.\\r\\nOn 29 September 1999, two Luftwaffe Tornados crashed near Marathon Indian Basin, about 15 miles northwest of Carlsbad, New Mexico. The crash details were kept quiet from the American public, as the crash was investigated under Luftwaffe jurisdiction.\\r\\nIn September 2004, Luftwaffe chief of staff, Klaus-Peter Stieglitz announced a reduction in its training program of roughly 20%.\\r\\nIn March 2013, it was announced that German Air Force units at Fort Bliss will transfer to Holloman later that same year; this will end the German Air Force presence at Fort Bliss dating back to 1956.[4] In 2015, due to funding constraints on the planned new facilities in Europe, the German Air Force Air Defense school will stay open at Fort Bliss until 2020.[5]\\r\\nPlanned for the British Overseas Training program which they[who?] did not pursue, construction for the USAAF base 6?mi (9.7?km) west of Alamogordo, New Mexico, began on 6 February 1942. After the nearby Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range was established by Executive Order No. 9029[6] (range designation on 14 May), the neighboring military installation was designated Alamogordo Field Training Station (27 May) and Alamogordo Army Air Base (operated by the 359th Base Heasdquarters beginning on 10 June 1942.)[7]\\r\\nAlamogordo Army Air Field (Alamogordo AAFld, Alamogordo AAF) was named on 21 November[7] as a Second Air Force installation equipped with aprons, runways, taxiways and hangars. From 1942ÿ1945 the AAF had more than 20 different groups for overseas training, initially flying Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses then Consolidated B-24 Liberators. Training began in 1943 and in addition to the range, a detached installation operated by the base was the Alamogordo Gasoline Storage and Pumping Station Annex.[7]\\r\\nIn 1944 the \\"base operating unit\\" changed to the 231st Army Air Force Base Unit (25 March) and 4145 AAFBU (24 August),[7] and on 16 April 1945 Alamogordo AAF was relieved of its training mission and assigned to Continental Air Forces to become a permanent B-29 base. Instead, by January 30, 1946, the base was planned to \\"be manned by a skeleton crew merely as a plane refuelling station, [for] emergency landings, etc.\\",[6] and it was temporarily inactivated on 28 February 1946.[citation needed] Post-war the AAF was used to support the Alamogordo Guided Missile Test Base which had its first Boeing Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft launch on 14 November 1947.[8]\\r\\nWith the September 1947 formation of the USAF, in late 1947 the Holloman range and the White Sands Proving Ground merged to become the New Mexico Joint Guided Missile Test Range (later renamed White Sands Missile Range),[7]:248 and the renamed Holloman Air Force Base (13 January 1948) supported WSMR launch complex(es) (Launch Complex 33, etc.) firing of Tiny Tim (the first Army rocket), Rascal, V-2 rocket, Ryan XQ-2 Drone, Falcon, MGM-13 Mace, MGM-1 Matador, and AGM-45 Shrike.[when?] The 2754th Experimental Wing was activated on 20 September 1949 to oversee all research and development projects.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Holloman Air Development Center became the base operating unit on 10 October 1952, and the 3,500?ft (1,100?m) rocket-powered sled was first run on 19 March 1954. On 10 December 1954, Lt Colonel (Dr.) John P. Stapp rode a Holloman rocket propelled test sled, Sonic Wind No. 1, to a speed of 632 miles per hour. The center was renamed the Air Force Missile Development Center on 1 September 1957 and inactivated on 1 August 1970.\\r\\nAdditionally, Captain Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr., stepped out of an open balloon gondola at 102,800 feet on 16 August 1960, in an attempt to evaluate techniques of high altitude bailout. Capt Kittingers jump lasted 13 minutes, reaching a velocity of 614 miles per hour. That jump broke four world records: highest open gondola manned balloon flight, highest balloon flight of any kind, highest bailout, and longest free fall.[9]\\r\\nThe Aero-Medical Field Laboratory at Holloman \\"conducted space flight training with chimpanzees [in] 1961-1962\\", including Ham the Chimp launched 31 January 1961 and ENOS on an orbital flight.\\r\\nThe 366th Tactical Fighter Wing[10] arrived on 15 July 1963 \\"making Holloman a TAC operating base\\"[7] and on 8 April 1966, the 4758th Defense Systems Evaluation Squadron (DSES) arrived from Biggs AFB Texas. The squadron evaluated aircraft weapons systems and to provide training for air defense units. Aircraft flown by the 4758th DSES were the B-57 Canberra and F-100 Super Sabre. On 31 October 1970 the squadron was merged with the 4677th DSES at Tyndall AFB Florida.\\r\\nOn 1 August 1970, per Air Force Systems Command Special Order G-94, the AFMDC was inactivated and Tactical Air Command assumed host responsibilities for Holloman Air Force Base. Associate units and programs transferred to other locations within Air Force Systems Command. The Test & Evaluation activities that remained were the Central Inertial Guidance Test Facility (CIGTF), the High Speed Test Track, the Radar Target Scatter Facility (RATSCAT), and the Target Drone Facility.\\r\\nThese organizations were combined to form the nucleus of a Holloman AFB tenant organization, the 6585th Test Group, with the Air Force Special Weapons Center (AFSWC) at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, designated as the headquarters for the Test Group.\\r\\nIn 1975, AFSWC was disestablished, and the 6585th Test Group at Holloman became part of the Armament Development and Test Center (ADTC) at Eglin AFB Florida.\\r\\nHolloman was designated a Tactical Training Center on 1 August 1977 and on 1 October 1993, the Air Force Development Test Center at Eglin AFB was redesignated as the Air Armament Center (AAC).[11]\\r\\nIn 1986, a contract was awarded to Flight Systems Inc. (later Honeywell) to modify 194 surplus Convair F-106 Delta Dart aircraft stored at Davis-Monthan AFB Arizona to the QF-106A target drone configuration. This program came to be known as Pacer Six, and the first flight of a converted drone took place in July 1987. Following the completion of an initial batch of ten QF-106s in 1990, most of the work was transferred to the USAF itself. Much of the conversion work was done before the aircraft were removed from storage at AMARC, with further work being carried out at East St Louis, Illinois.\\r\\nThe QF-106s began operating as a Full-Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) in late 1991 at White Sands Missile Range New Mexico, and later at the Eglin Gulf Test Range in Florida (based at Holloman and Tyndall). A typical mission would employ the QF-106 as a target for an infrared homing missile. The aircraft had burners placed on pylons underneath the wings to act as IR sources for heat-seeking missiles. The intention of the program was for the QF-106 to survive repeated engagements with air-to-air missiles, to make it possible for each QF-106 to last as long as possible before it was destroyed. The last shootdown of a QF-106 (57ÿ2524) took place at Holloman AFB on 20 February 1997. The QF-106 was replaced by the QF-4 Phantom drone.\\r\\nToday, the 96th Test Group from Eglin Air Force Base Florida is responsible for operational testing and evaluation of new equipment and systems proposed for use by these forces. Current initiatives include advanced self-protection systems for combat aircraft, aircrew life support systems, aerial reconnaissance improvements, new armament and weapons delivery systems, and improved maintenance equipment and logistics support.\\r\\nOn 15 July 1963, after serving at Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base, France as a conventional strike force in Europe, the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing moved to Holloman. The move was a result of French president Charles DeGaulles deep suspicion of supranational organizations and his countrys shift away from the NATO orbit in the early 1960s that ultimately led to the closure of American air bases in France.[10]\\r\\n366th TFW was organized as follows:\\r\\nAt the time of the wing's arrival at Holloman, they flew the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak, which were former Air National Guard aircraft transferred to France during the 1961 Berlin Crisis as part of Operation Tack Hammer. At Holloman, the wing began converting to the new McDonnell Douglas F-4C Phantom II in February 1965.\\r\\nLater that year, the wing sent its first squadron to the Republic of Vietnam. The 390th Fighter Squadron was assigned to Da Nang AB, and the 391st went to Cam Ranh Bay AB in early 1966.\\r\\nOn 20 March 1966 the rest of the wing entered the conflict and moved to Phan Rang AB, Republic of Vietnam in support of combat operations in Vietnam. With the transfer of the 366th to Vietnam, the 6583d Air Base Group became the host unit at Holloman.\\r\\nOn 1 July 1968, the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing arrived at Holloman Air Force Base from Spangdahlem AB, West Germany, becoming the first dual-based tactical fighter wing. The 6583d Air Base Group was inactivated in place.\\r\\nUnder the dual-basing concept, the 49th, stationed at Holloman, deployed individual squadrons periodically to Europe, fulfilling their NATO commitment. The operational squadrons of the 49th TFW upon its arrival were:\\r\\nAll three squadrons flew the McDonnell Douglas F-4D Phantom II. In 1972 squadron aircraft tail codes were standardized on \\"HO\\".\\r\\nIn 1969, the wing participated in its first dual-basing exercise, Crested Cap I, deploying 2,000 personnel and 72 aircraft to NATO bases in Europe. Also in 1969, the 49th earned the coveted MacKay Trophy for the \\"most meritorious flight of the year\\", for the redeployment from Germany to Holloman after Crested Cap II. The MacKay Trophy recognized the 49th for the fastest non-stop deployment of jet aircraft accomplished by a wing's entire fleet.\\r\\nIn May 1972 the 49th deployed their F-4 aircraft and 2,600 personnel to Takhli RTAFB Thailand. During this deployment the 49th flew more than 21,000 combat hours over just about every battle zone from An Loc to vital installations in the Hanoi vicinity. During five months of combat, the wing did not lose any aircraft or personnela testament to the outstanding training and proficiency of all members of the 49th. The unit received an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with Combat \\"V\\" Device for its participation. The 49th TFW officially closed out its Southeast Asia duty on 9 October 1972, turning over Takhli to a former host unit at Holloman, the 366th TFW which was transferred from Da Nang Air Base South Vietnam.\\r\\nF-15 Eagle era\\r\\nOn 20 December 1977, the wing began converting from the F-4D to F-15A/Bs. The transition was completed on 4 June 1978.\\r\\nHistory was made during February 1980, when two pilots from the 49th each flew their F-15s 6,200 miles in just over 14 hours, establishing a record for the longest flight of a single-seat fighter aircraft. The flights required six aerial refuelings, proving the global power of the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing.\\r\\nIn July 1980, the wing acquired the commitment of a primary Rapid Deployment Force unit. This tasking, which lasted for a year, required the wing to be ready to deploy its aircraft, crews, and support personnel on short notice. The wing served with the Rapid Deployment Force until July 1981, when the tasking was transferred to the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing, Langley Air Force Base Virginia.\\r\\nThe 49th demonstrated its capabilities in the fall of 1988, winning top honors at the William Tell air-to-air weapons competition. The wing outdistanced the nearest competitor by more than 2,000 points. The 49th won a variety of awards, including the coveted \\"Top Gun\\" for best fighter pilot.\\r\\nF-117 Nighthawk era\\r\\nFrom 1991 to 1993, the 49th underwent a number of transitions. On 1 October 1991, the 49th was redesignated the 49th Fighter Wing as part of an Air Force wide redesignation of units.\\r\\nOn 1 November 1991, the 7th Fighter Squadron ceased F-15 operations, performing a Lead-In Fighter Training (LIFT) mission with Northrup AT-38B Talons, preparing for the transition to the Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk. during most of 1992.\\r\\nOn 1 June 1992 the 8th Fighter Squadron ceased F-15 operations and started flying AT-38B LIFT missions.\\r\\nThe 9th Fighter Squadron ceased F-15 operations on 5 June 1992 and received F-4E aircraft from the 20th Fighter Squadron from the closing George AFB California as the Fighter Training Unit for the German Air Force.\\r\\nThe last F-15 departed Holloman 5 June 1992, ending 14 years of Eagle operations.\\r\\nOn 9 May 1992, four Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighters from the Tonopah Test Range Airport Nevada, arrived at Holloman. The 37th Tactical Fighter Wing at Tonopah was inactivated with the transfer of the last F-117s to Holloman on 8 July 1992.\\r\\nF-117s were initially assigned to the following squadrons:\\r\\nThese squadrons were PCS (moved Permanent Change Of Station) to Holloman as part of the 37th Operations Group on 15 June 1992. The formal transfer to the 49th Operations group occurred on 8 July 1992 when the 37th OG was inactivated. In 1993 these squadrons were inactivated with assets transferred to the 7th, 8th and 9th Fighter Squadrons. The 7th was designated a combat training squadron, the 8th and 9th being deployable operational fighter squadrons.\\r\\nOn 1 July 1993, the 20th Fighter Squadron was activated as part of the 49th Operations Group, taking over the F-4Es of the 9th FS. The mission of the 20th FS was to conduct training with the German Air Force. The F-4Es which the 20th FS flew initially were USAF-owned aircraft, however in 1997 the squadron began flying German-owned F-4F aircraft. The F-4Fs, however flew in USAF markings. The 20th Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 20 December 2004 and the F-4Fs sent to Germany.\\r\\nThe 48th Rescue Squadron was activated at Holloman AFB on 1 May 1993 with its six Sikorsky HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters. The personnel of the 48th deployed six times in support of Operations Northern and Southern Watch. Additionally, the 48th saved 33 lives in real-world rescues in the American Southwest. The unit was inactivated on 1 February 1999.\\r\\nThe 8th and 9th Fighter Squadrons deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy and Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany from 21 Februaryÿ1 July 1999, in support of Operation Allied Force. Flying more than 1,000 total sorties, pilots flew into heavily defended skies, littered with surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft fire. In particular, F-117A pilots bravely trusting in their aircraft's low observable technology struck some of the most valuable, and highly guarded targets in Serbia. The F-117s penetrated the heavily defended areas, which conventional aircraft could not reach, and at least two aircraft were lost.\\r\\nGlobal War On Terror\\r\\nPeople, airplanes, and equipment of the 49th Fighter Wing played a key role in the continued global war against terrorism and particularly[citation needed] in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The wing's F-117s played a major role, dropping the first bombs against an Iraqi leadership target in Baghdad on 19 March 2003. In all, F-117 pilots flew more than 80 missions and dropped nearly 100 enhanced guided bomb units against key targets.\\r\\nApproximately 300 people deployed with the air package and provided direct support to the F-117 mission. Additionally, hundreds of other 49th FW personnel were deployed on other missions.\\r\\nThe 479th TTW was activated at Holloman on 1 January 1977 to provide Lead-In Fighter Training (LIFT) training for pilots assigned to fly tactical fighter or attack aircraft. The 479th Flew AT-38B Talons with the following squadrons:\\r\\nAll 479th TTW aircraft carried the \\"HM\\" tail code. The LIFT program was sharply cut back in 1991, and the wing replaced by the 479th Fighter Group at Holloman, with the aircraft being consolidated under the 586th Flight Training Squadron.\\r\\nThe 479th was inactivated on 31 July 2000, with squadron resources absorbed by the 49th FW, later being transferred to the 46th Test Group as the 586th Flight Test Squadron.\\r\\nHolloman is home to the world's longest and fastest high speed test track. The 846th Test Squadron set the world land speed record for a railed vehicle with a run of 6,453?mph (2885?m/s or 10430?km/h), or Mach 8.5 on 30 April 2003.[13]\\r\\nMissile testing at Holloman began in 1948. Holloman is known to have been used for 147 major launches from 1948 to 1959, reaching up to 235 kilometers altitude.\\r\\nThe base hosts a primary school and a middle school, which is named after the base and houses grades 6ÿ8. The mascot of the middle school is the falcon.[14][15][16]\\r\\nThe base is also a census-designated place (CDP), which had a population of 2,076 at the 2000 census.[17]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 12.7 square miles (33?km2), of which, 12.5 square miles (32?km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52?km2) of it (1.18%) is water. The area of the airforce base is 59,639 acres (241.35?km2)\\r\\nSupported population: Holloman AFB supports about 21,000 Active Duty, Guard, Reserve, retirees, DoD civilians and their family members.\\r\\nAs of the census[17] of 2000, there were 2,076 people, 393 households, and 380 families residing on the base. The population density was 165.7 people per square mile (64.0/km2). There were 427 housing units at an average density of 34.1/sq?mi (13.2/km2). The racial makeup of the base was 73.3% White, 13.2% African American, 0.6% Native American, 2.8% Asian, 0.6% Pacific Islander, 6.4% from other races, and 3.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 12.4% of the population.\\r\\nThere were 393 households out of which 67.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 88.8% were married couples living together, 4.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 3.3% were non-families. 2.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 0.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.29 and the average family size was 3.34.\\r\\nOn the base the population was spread out with 25.0% under the age of 18, 37.0% from 18 to 24, 33.9% from 25 to 44, 3.7% from 45 to 64, and 0.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females there were 152.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 180.4 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household on the base was $37,206, and the median income for a family was $37,941. Males had a median income of $20,359 versus $15,425 for females. The per capita income for the town was $13,568. About 8.3% of families and 11.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 16.8% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency website http://www.afhra.af.mil/.\\r\\nThis article includes content from Holloman Air Force Base Website, which as a work of the U.S. Government is presumed to be a public domain resource. That information was supplemented by:","input":"What is the air force base in new mexico?"},{"output":"anaphase I of meiosis I","context":"A couple of homologous chromosomes, or homologs, are a set of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during meiosis. Homologs have the same genes in the same loci where they provide points along each chromosome which enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly with each other before separating during meiosis.[1] This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance which characterizes inheritance patterns of genetic material from an organism to its offspring parent developmental cell at the given time and area.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChromosomes are linear arrangements of condensed deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and histone proteins, which form a complex called chromatin.[2] Homologous chromosomes are made up of chromosome pairs of approximately the same length, centromere position, and staining pattern, for genes with the same corresponding loci. One homologous chromosome is inherited from the organism's mother; the other is inherited from the organism's father. After mitosis occurs within the daughter cells, they have the correct number of genes which are a mix of the two parents' genes. In diploid (2n) organisms, the genome is composed of one set of each homologous chromosome pair, as compared to tetraploid organisms which may have two sets of each homologous chromosome pair. The alleles on the homologous chromosomes may be different, resulting in different phenotypes of the same genes. This mixing of maternal and paternal traits is enhanced by crossing over during meiosis, wherein lengths of chromosomal arms and the DNA they contain within a homologous chromosome pair are exchanged with one another.[3]\\r\\nEarly in the 1900s William Bateson and Reginald Punnett were studying genetic inheritance and they noted that some combinations of alleles appeared more frequently than others. That data and information was further explored by Thomas Morgan. Using test cross experiments, he revealed that, for a single parent, the alleles of genes near to one another along the length of the chromosome move together. Using this logic he concluded that the two genes he was studying were located on homologous chromosomes. Later on during the 1930s Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock were studying meiosis in corn cells and examining gene loci on corn chromosomes.[2] Creighton and McClintock discovered that the new allele combinations present in the offspring and the event of crossing over were directly related.[2] This proved interchromosomal genetic recombination.[2]\\r\\nHomologous chromosomes are chromosomes which contain the same genes in the same order along their chromosomal arms. There are two main properties of homologous chromosomes: the length of chromosomal arms and the placement of the centromere [4]\\r\\nThe actual length of the arm, in accordance with the gene locations, is critically important for proper alignment. Centromere placement can be characterized by four main arrangements, consisting of being either metacentric, submetacentric, telocentric, or acrocentric. Both of these properties are the main factors for creating structural homology between chromosomes. Therefore, when two chromosomes of the exact structure exist, they are able to pair together to form homologous chromosomes.[5]\\r\\nSince homologous chromosomes are not identical and do not originate from the same organism, they are different from sister chromatids. Sister chromatids result after DNA replication has occurred, and thus are identical, side-by-side duplicates of each other.[6]\\r\\nHumans have a total of 46 chromosomes, but there are only 22 pairs of homologous autosomal chromosomes. The additional 23rd pair is the sex chromosomes, X and Y. If this pair is made up of an X and Y chromosome, then the pair of chromosomes is not homologous because their size and gene content differ greatly. The 22 pairs of homologous chromosomes contain the same genes but code for different traits in their allelic forms since one was inherited from the mother and one from the father.[7] So humans have two homologous chromosome sets in each cell, meaning humans are diploid organisms.[2]\\r\\nHomologous chromosomes are important in the processes of meiosis and mitosis. They allow for the recombination and random segregation of genetic material from the mother and father into new cells.[8]\\r\\nMeiosis is a round of two cell divisions that results in four haploid daughter cells that each contain half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.[9] It reduces the chromosome number in a germ cell by half by first separating the homologous chromosomes in meiosis I and then the sister chromatids in meiosis II. The process of meiosis I is generally longer than meiosis II because it takes more time for the chromatin to replicate and for the homologous chromosomes to be properly oriented and segregated by the processes of pairing and synapsis in meiosis I.[6] During meiosis, genetic recombination (by random segregation) and crossing over produces daughter cells that each contain different combinations of maternally and paternally coded genes.[9] This recombination of genes allows for the introduction of new allele pairings and genetic variation.[2] Genetic variation among organisms helps make a population more stable by providing a wider range of genetic traits for natural selection to act on.[2]\\r\\nIn prophase I of meiosis I, each chromosome is aligned with its homologous partner and pairs completely. In prophase I, the DNA has already undergone replication so each chromosome consists of two identical chromatids connected by a common centromere.[9] During the zygotene stage of prophase I, the homologous chromosomes pair up with each other.[9] This pairing occurs by a synapsis process where the synaptonemal complex - a protein scaffold - is assembled and joins the homologous chromosomes along their lengths.[6] Cohesin crosslinking occurs between the homologous chromosomes and helps them resist being pulled apart until anaphase.[7] Genetic crossing-over, a type of recombination, occurs during the pachytene stage of prophase I.[9] In addition, another type of recombination referred to as synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) frequently occurs. SDSA recombination involves information exchange between paired homologous chromatids, but not physical exchange. SDSA recombination does not cause crossing-over.\\r\\nIn the process of crossing-over, genes are exchanged by the breaking and union of homologous portions of the chromosomes lengths.[6] Structures called chiasmata are the site of the exchange. Chiasmata physically link the homologous chromosomes once crossing over occurs and throughout the process of chromosomal segregation during meiosis.[6] Both the non-crossover and crossover types of recombination function as processes for repairing DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks. At the diplotene stage of prophase I the synaptonemal complex disassembles before which will allow the homologous chromosomes to separate, while the sister chromatids stay associated by their centromeres.[6]\\r\\nIn metaphase I of meiosis I, the pairs of homologous chromosomes, also known as bivalents or tetrads, line up in a random order along the metaphase plate.[9] The random orientation is another way for cells to introduce genetic variation. Meiotic spindles emanating from opposite spindle poles attach to each of the homologs (each pair of sister chromatids) at the kinetochore.[7]\\r\\nIn anaphase I of meiosis I the homologous chromosomes are pulled apart from each other. The homologs are cleaved by the enzyme separase to release the cohesin that held the homologous chromosome arms together.[7] This allows the chiasmata to release and the homologs to move to opposite poles of the cell.[7] The homologous chromosomes are now randomly segregated into two daughter cells that will undergo meiosis II to produce four haploid daughter germ cells.[2]\\r\\nAfter the tetrads of homologous chromosomes are separated in meiosis I, the sister chromatids from each pair are separated. The two haploid(because the chromosome no. has reduced to half. Earlier two sets of chromosomes were present, but now each set exists in two different daughter cells that have arisen from the single diploid parent cell by meiosis I) daughter cells resulting from meiosis I undergo another cell division in meiosis II but without another round of chromosomal replication. The sister chromatids in the two daughter cells are pulled apart during anaphase II by nuclear spindle fibers, resulting in four haploid daughter cells.[2]\\r\\nHomologous chromosomes do not function the same in mitosis as they do in meiosis. Prior to every single mitotic division a cell undergoes, the chromosomes in the parent cell replicate themselves. The homologous chromosomes within the cell will ordinarily not pair up and undergo genetic recombination with each other.[9] Instead, the replicants, or sister chromatids, will line up along the metaphase plate and then separate in the same way as meiosis II - by being pulled apart at their centromeres by nuclear mitotic spindles.[10] If any crossing over does occur between sister chromatids during mitosis, it does not produce any new recombinant genotypes.[2]\\r\\nHomologous pairing in most contexts will refer to germline cells, however also takes place in somatic cells. For example, in humans, somatic cells have very tightly regulated homologous pairing (separated into chromosomal territories, and pairing at specific loci under control of developmental signalling). Other species however (notably Drosophila) exhibit homologous pairing much more frequently. Various functions of homologous pairing in somatic cells have been elucidated through high-throughput screens in the early 21st century.\\r\\nThere are severe repercussions when chromosomes do not segregate properly. Faulty segregation can lead to fertility problems, embryo death, birth defects, and cancer.[11] Though the mechanisms for pairing and adhering homologous chromosomes vary among organisms, proper functioning of those mechanisms is imperative in order for the final genetic material to be sorted correctly.[11]\\r\\nProper homologous chromosome separation in meiosis I is crucial for sister chromatid separation in meiosis II.[11] A failure to separate properly is known as nondisjunction. There are two main types of nondisjunction that occur: trisomy and monosomy. Trisomy is caused by the presence of one additional chromosomes in the zygote as compared to the normal number, and monosomy is characterized by the presence of one fewer chromosome in the zygote as compared to the normal number. If this uneven division occurs in meiosis I, then none of the daughter cells will have proper chromosomal distribution and severe effects can ensue, including Downs syndrome.[12] Unequal division can also occur during the second meiotic division. Nondisjunction which occurs at this stage can result in normal daughter cells and deformed cells.[4]\\r\\nWhile the main function of homologous chromosomes is their use in nuclear division, they are also used in repairing double-strand breaks of DNA.[13] These double-stranded breaks may occur in replicating DNA and are most often the result of interaction of DNA with naturally occurring damaging molecules such as reactive oxygen species. Homologous chromosomes can repair this damage by aligning themselves with chromosomes of the same genetic sequence.[13] Once the base pairs have been matched and oriented correctly between the two strands, the homologous chromosomes perform a process that is very similar to recombination, or crossing over as seen in meiosis. Part of the intact DNA sequence overlaps with that of the damaged chromosome's sequence. Replication proteins and complexes are then recruited to the site of damage, allowing for repair and proper replication to occur. Through this functioning, double-strand breaks can be repaired and DNA can function normally.[13]\\r\\nCurrent and future research on the subject of homologous chromosome is heavily focused on the roles of various proteins during recombination or during DNA repair. In a recently published article by Pezza et al. the protein known as HOP2 is responsible for both homologous chromosome synapsis as well as double-strand break repair via homologous recombination. The deletion of HOP2 in mice has large repercussions in meiosis.[14] Other current studies focus on specific proteins involved in homologous recombination as well.\\r\\nThere is ongoing research concerning the ability of homologous chromosomes to repair double-strand DNA breaks. Researchers are investigating the possibility of exploiting this capability for regenerative medicine.[15] This medicine could be very prevalent in relation to cancer, as DNA damage is thought to be contributor to carcinogenesis. Manipulating the repair function of homologous chromosomes might allow for bettering a cells damage response system. While research has not yet confirmed the effectiveness of such treatment, it may become a useful therapy for cancer.[16]","input":"When do homologous chromosomes separate from each other during meiosis?"},{"output":"between 1837 and 1841","context":"Lever action is a type of firearm action which uses a lever located around the trigger guard area (often including the trigger guard itself) to load fresh cartridges into the chamber of the barrel when the lever is worked. This contrasts to bolt-action, semi-automatic, or selective-fire weapons. Most lever-action firearms are rifles, but some lever-action shotguns and a few pistols have also been made. One of the most famous lever-action firearms is the Winchester Model 1873 rifle, but many manufacturersnotably Marlin and Savagealso produce lever-action rifles. Even Colt's Mfg. Co. produced 1883 until 1885 6403 lever-action Colt-Burgess rifles. Mossberg produces the 464 in centerfire .30-30 and rimfire .22. While the term lever-action generally implies a repeating firearm, it is also sometimes and incorrectly applied to a variety of single-shot or falling-block actions that use a lever for cycling, such as the MartiniÿHenry or the Ruger No. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably the first lever-action rifles on the market were Colt's 1st and 2nd Model Ring Lever rifles, both cap and ball rifles, produced by the Patent Arms Mfg. Co. Paterson, N.J.-Colt's Patent between 1837 and 1841. The ring-lever was located in front of the trigger. This loading-lever, when pulled, would index the cylinder to the next position and cock the internal hidden hammer.\\r\\nThe first significant lever-action design was the Spencer repeating rifle, a magazine-fed lever-operated breech-loading rifle designed by Christopher Spencer in 1860. It was fed from a removable seven-round tube magazine, enabling the rounds to be fired one after another, and which, when emptied, could be exchanged for another. Over 20,000 were made, and it was adopted by the United States and used during the American Civil War, marking the first adoption of a removable-magazine-fed infantry-and-cavalry rifle by any country.[citation needed]\\r\\nUnlike later designs, the early Spencer's lever only served to unlock the falling-block action and load a new cartridge from the magazine; it did not cock the hammer, and thus the hammer had to be cocked after the lever was operated to prepare the rifle to fire. The Henry rifle, invented by Benjamin Tyler Henry, a gunsmith employed by Oliver Winchester in 1860, used a centrally located hammer, rather than the offset hammer typical of muzzleloading rifles, and this hammer was cocked by the rearward movement of the Henry's bolt. The Henry also placed the magazine under the barrel, rather than in the butt-stock, a trend followed by most tubular magazines since.\\r\\nThe MartiniÿHenry rifle was the main rifle of British and Empire forces from the early 1870s to the turn of the 20th century and remained in use to the end of World War I. It was used in some areas, either by civilians or by the local military, much longer. Variants copying the MartiniÿHenry mechanism but using more modern cartridges were also produced; as late as the 1970s a version taking the common Enfield .303 ammunition was common in Afghanistan.\\r\\nJohn Marlin, founder of Marlin Firearms Company, New Haven, Connecticut, introduced Marlin's first lever-action repeating rifle as the Model 1881. This was chambered in rounds such as the 45/70 and 38/55. Its successor was the 1895 solid top design, which we know as the model 336 today. It also gave rise to the Marlin Model 1894, which is still in production today.\\r\\nBy the 1890s, lever-actions had evolved into a form that would last for over a century. Both Marlin and Winchester released new model lever-action rifles in 1894. The Marlin rifle is still in production, whereas production of the Winchester 94 ceased in 2006. While externally similar, the Marlin and Winchester rifles are quite different internally; the Marlin has a single-stage lever action, while the Winchester has a double-stage lever. The double-stage action is easily seen when the Winchester's lever is operated, as first the entire trigger group drops down, unlocking the bolt, and then the bolt is moved rearward to eject the fired cartridge.\\r\\nThe fledgling Savage Arms Company became well known after the development of its popular hammerless Models 1895 and 1899 (which became named the Model 99) lever-action sporting rifles. The Models 1899/99 were produced from introduction in 1899 until the expense of producing the rifle, and declining interest in lever-action rifles from the 1950s on, resulted in dropping the Model 99 from production in 2000. Unlike most Winchester and the Marlin lever-action rifles, which used a tubular magazine requiring round-nose or flat-nose bullets, Arthur Savage designed his rifle using a rotary magazine. This allowed the 99 to use cartridges with spitzer pointed bullets for increased ballistic performance. The 99 was produced in many different cartridges and several different model variations. The final models eliminated the very expensive-to-produce rotary magazine, using a detachable box magazine instead. But the 99 was still very expensive to produce when compared to the other lever-action rifles, and the Savage bolt-action rifles and economics determined the fate of the rifle.\\r\\nMore recently, Sturm Ruger and Company introduced a number of new lever-action designs in the 1990s, unusual because most lever action designs date from before World War II, in the period before reliable semi-automatic rifles became widely available.\\r\\nThe Henry Lever Action was used in the US Civil War. Henry Lever Action firearms were used in the US until the Winchester Model 1866 rifle replaced it. The Spencer repeating rifle was also used in the US Civil War. Additionally, rifles using the lever-action design were used extensively during the 1930s by irregular forces in the Spanish Civil War. Typically, these were Winchesters or Winchester copies of Spanish manufacture. At least 9,000 Model 1895 rifles are known to have been provided by the Soviet Union in 1936 to the Spanish Republicans for use in the Spanish Civil War.[1] Both the Russian Empire and the United States adopted the Winchester Model 1895 as a military weapon.[2]\\r\\nEarly attempts at repeating shotguns invariably centered around either bolt-action or lever-action designs, drawing obvious inspiration from the repeating rifles of the time. The earliest successful repeating shotgun was the lever-action Winchester Model 1887, designed by John Browning in 1885 at the behest of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, who wanted to market a repeating shotgun. The lever-action design was chosen for reasons of brand recognition, Winchester being best known for manufacturing lever-action firearms at the time, despite the protestations of Browning, who pointed out that a slide-action design would be much better for a shotgun. Initially chambered for black powder shotgun shells (as was standard at the time), the Model 1887 gave rise to the Winchester Model 1901, a strengthened version chambered for 10ga smokeless powder shells. Their popularity waned after the introduction of slide-action shotguns such as the Winchester Model 1897, and production was discontinued in 1920. Modern reproductions are (or have been), however, manufactured by Armi Chiappa in Italy, Norinco in China and ADI Ltd. in Australia, while Winchester continued to manufacture the .410-bore Model 9410, effectively a Winchester Model 94 chambered for .410-bore shotgun shells, until 2006.\\r\\nFrench Firearm Manufacturer Verny-Carron has released its Stop and Go Lever action shotgun called the Veloce. It is a unique action which self unloads a fired cartridge but requires a side mounted lever to allow the shotgun to reload and reset the trigger.\\r\\nIn more recent times lever action shotguns have seen a resurgence in some markets with the Turkish made Adler A110 Lever action shotgun selling extremely well in the Australian marketplace with over 7000 ordered in under 2 week they are also being imported into North America as well. The success of the Adler in these markets has sparked several other manufactures in Turkey to begin development of and production of their own lever action shotguns. Australian firearm laws strictly control pump and semi-automatic actions while lever-operation falls into a more lenient category, hence the recent popularity of the action in that country.\\r\\nA one-off example of lever-action reloading on automatic firearms is the M1895 ColtÿBrowning machine gun. This weapon had a swinging lever beneath its barrel that was actuated by a gas bleed in the barrel, unlocking the breech to reload. This unique operation gave the nickname \\"potato digger,\\" as the lever swung each time the weapon fired and would dig into the ground if the weapon was not situated high enough on its mount.\\r\\nThe Kn?tgen automatic rifle is another example.\\r\\nWhile lever-action rifles were (and are) popular with hunters and sporting shooters, they were not widely accepted by the military. One significant reason for this was that it is harder to fire a lever-action from the prone position (compared to a straight-pull or rotating-bolt bolt-action rifle), and while possessing a greater rate of fire (contemporary Winchester advertisements claimed their rifles could fire 2 shots a second) than bolt-action rifles, lever-action firearms are also generally fed from a tubular magazine as did most of the bolt actions of that time which limits the type of ammunition that can be used in them. Pointed centerfire spitzer bullets, for example, can cause explosions in a tubular magazine, as the point of each cartridge's projectile rests on the primer of the next cartridge in the magazine (elastomer-tipped Hornady LEVERevolution ammunition overcomes this problem).[3] The tubular magazine may also have a negative impact on the harmonics of the barrel, which limits the theoretical accuracy of the rifle. A tubular magazine under the barrel also pushes the center of gravity forward, which alters the balance of the rifle in ways that are desirable for shooting off hand from a standing position to some shooters. However, there are some lever riflessuch as the Winchester Model 1895, which saw service with the Russian Army in World War Ithat use a box magazine. Furthermore, many of the newer lever-action rifles are capable of shooting groups smaller than 1 minute of angle, making them equal to the accuracy of most modern bolt-action rifles as than in the past.\\r\\nAnother explanation for the lack of widespread use of lever action designs stems from the initial inability to fire high-pressure cartridges. Safe operation could only be carried out by using low-pressure cartridges in the toggle-lock lever action rifles such as the Henry rifle and the following Winchester Model 1866, Model 73 and Model 76 (which was used by the mounted police of Canada). The new lever action designs, notably the Winchester Model 1886, Model 92 Model 94 and the Model 1895 (in 7.62x54R, a Russian military cartridge), with a strong locking-block action designed by John Moses Browning, were capable of firing higher pressure cartridges. These rifles became available in the late 19th century, too expensive to manufacture, militaries worldwide had put cheap bolt action rifles into service and were unwilling to invest into producing a lever action rifle after having done with an inexpensive bolt action design.\\r\\nDue to the higher rate of fire and shorter overall length than most bolt-action rifles, lever-actions have remained popular to this day for sporting use, especially short- and medium-range hunting in forests, scrub, or bushland. Lever-action firearms have also been used in some quantity by prison guards in the United States, as well as by wildlife authorities/game wardens in many parts of the world.\\r\\nAn additional advantage over typical bolt-action rifles is the lack of handedness: lever-actions like pump-actions are frequently recommended as ambidextrous in sporting guidebooks.\\r\\nThe cartridges for lever action rifles have a wide variety of calibres, bullet shapes and powder loads, but they fall into two basic categories: Low-pressure cartridges with rounded bullets, and high-pressure cartridges with aerodynamic pointed (\\"spitzer\\") bullets.\\r\\nSome lever actions are not as strong as bolt-action or semi-automatic rifle actions. The weaker actions utilize low- and medium-pressure cartridges, somewhat similar to high-powered pistol ammunition. To increase the bullet's energy at the relatively low velocities, these often have larger, heavier bullets than other types of rifles. The most common cartridge is the .30-30, introduced by Winchester with the Model 1894. Other common cartridges include: .38 Special/.357 Magnum, .44 Special/.44 Magnum, .41 Magnum, .444 Marlin, .45-70, .45 Colt, .32-20 Winchester, .35 Remington, .308 Marlin Express, .22 calibre rimfire, and .300 Savage. There is dispute about which of these cartridges can safely be used to hunt large game or large predators. Even in the largest calibres, the low velocities give these cartridges much lower energies than Elephant gun cartridges with comparable calibres. However, even the smallest cartridges fit lightweight, handy rifles that can be excellent for hunting small herbivores, pest control and personal defense.\\r\\nSome stronger, larger pistols (usually revolvers) also accept some of these cartridges, permitting use of the same ammunition in both a pistol and rifle. The rifle's longer barrel and better accuracy permits higher velocities, longer ranges and a wider selection of game. A pistol provides extra security.\\r\\nSome of these cartridges (e.g. the .45-70) are developmental descendants of very early black-powder metallic cartridges. When metallic cartridges and lever-actions were first invented, very small, portable kits were developed for hand-reloading and bullet-molding (so called \\"cowboy reloading kits\\"). These kits are still available for most low-pressure lever-action cartridges.[4]\\r\\nStronger lever actions, such as the action of the Marlin Model 1894 can utilize high-pressure cartridges. Lever-action designs with strong, rotary locking bolts (such as the Browning BLR with seven locking lugs) safely use very high-powered cartridges like the 300 Winchester mag, 300 WSM and 7 MM Remington magnum. Tilting block designs such as the Savage Model 99 are also strong enough to handle high pressures.\\r\\nMany lever actions have a tubular magazine under the barrel. To operate safely, cartridges for these have bullets with rounded tips, and some use rim-fire primers rather than center-fire primers. The safety problem is that long-range aerodynamic supersonic bullets are pointed. In a tubular magazine the points can accidentally fire center-fire cartridges. A related problem is that some pointed bullets have fragile tips, and can be damaged in a tubular magazine. So, some lever actions such as the Savage Model 99 can be fed from either box or rotary magazines. The Winchester Model 1895 also uses a box magazine, and is chambered for .30-06 and other powerful military cartridges. More recently, spitzer bullets with elastomeric tips have been developed.[5]\\r\\nLever-action shotguns such as the Winchester Model 1887 were chambered in 10 or 12-gauge black powder shotgun shells, whereas the Model 1901 was chambered for 10 gauge smokeless shotshells. Modern reproductions are chambered for 12 gauge smokeless shells, while the Winchester Model 9410 shotgun is available in .410 bore.","input":"When was the first lever action rifle invented?"},{"output":"a standard incandescent or halogen lamp","context":"A lava lamp (or Astro lamp) is a decorative novelty item, invented in 1963 by British accountant Edward Craven Walker, the founder of the British lighting company Mathmos. The lamp consists of a bolus of a special coloured wax mixture inside a glass vessel the remainder of which contains clear or translucent liquid; the vessel is then placed on a box containing an incandescent light bulb whose heat causes temporary reductions in the density and viscosity of the wax. The warmed wax rises through the surrounding liquid, cools, loses its buoyancy, and falls back to the bottom of the vessel in a cycle that is visually suggestive of phoehoe lava, hence the name. The lamps are designed in a variety of styles and colours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA classic lava lamp contains a standard incandescent or halogen lamp which heats a tall (often tapered) glass bottle. A formula from 1968 US patent consisted of water and a transparent, translucent, or opaque mix of mineral oil, paraffin wax, and carbon tetrachloride.[1]p.?2, line 30 The clear water or mineral oil can optionally be coloured with transparent dyes.\\r\\nCommon wax has a density much lower than that of water, and would float on top under any temperature. However, carbon tetrachloride is heavier than water (also nonflammable and miscible with wax) and is added to the wax to make its density at room temperature slightly higher than that of the water. When heated, the wax mixture becomes less dense than the water, because the wax expands more than water when both are heated.[1]p.?1, lines 40 & 45 It also becomes fluid, and blobs of wax ascend to the top of the device where they cool (which increases their density relative to that of the water) and then they descend.[1]p.?1, line 47 A metallic wire coil in the base of the bottle acts as a surface tension breaker to recombine the cooled blobs of wax after they descend.\\r\\nHowever, lava lamps made in China for the US market since 1970 do not use carbon tetrachloride, because its use was banned that year due to toxicity.[2] The manufacturer (Haggerty) stated that their current formulation is a trade secret.[3]\\r\\nThe underlying fluid mechanics phenomenon is a form of RayleighÿTaylor instability.\\r\\nThe bulb is normally 25 to 40 watts. Generally, it will take 45ÿ60 minutes for the wax to warm up enough to form freely rising blobs, when operating the lamp at standard room temperature. It may take as long as 2 to 3 hours if the room is below standard room temperature.\\r\\nOnce the wax is molten, the lamp should not be shaken or knocked over or the two fluids may emulsify, and the fluid surrounding the wax blobs will remain cloudy rather than clear. Some recombination will occur as part of the normal cycle of the wax in the container, but the only means to recombine all of the wax is to turn off the lamp and wait a few hours. The wax will settle back down at the bottom, forming one blob once again. Severe cases can require many heat-cool cycles to clear.\\r\\nIn 2015, a new design was introduced into the market that uses ferrofluid in place of wax.[4]\\r\\nBritish accountant Edward Craven-Walker invented the lava lamp in 1963 after watching a homemade egg timer, which was made from a cocktail shaker filled with liquids, as it was bubbling on a stove top in a pub.[5] His U.S. Patent 3,387,396 for \\"Display Device\\" was filed in 1965 and issued in 1968.[1] Craven-Walker's company was named Crestworth and was based in Poole, Dorset, in the United Kingdom. Craven-Walker named the lamp \\"Astro\\" and had variations such as the \\"Astro Mini\\" and the \\"Astro Coach\\" lantern.\\r\\nIn 1965, two men named Adolph Wertheimer and Hy Spector were intrigued by Walkers invention when they saw it at a German trade show. They bought the American rights and began the Lava Manufacturing Corporation in Chicago, IL to sell what they called the Lava Lite Lamp. In the late 1970s, the US rights were sold to Larry Haggerty, who created a subsidiary of his company, Haggerty Enterprises, called Lava World International, which produced American lava lamps for over 30 years.[6]\\r\\nCraven-Walker retained the rights for the rest of the world, and took on two business partners in the late 1980s named Cressida Granger and David Mulley. Eventually Granger and Mulley took over the company and they changed the name to Mathmos in 1992. Edward Craven-Walker remained a consultant until his death in 2000. Mathmos continues to make Lava Lamps and related products. Mathmos won two Queens Awards for Export, as well as Best Multi-Media prize at the Design Week awards.[7] Astro lava lamp was launched in 1963 and celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013.[8] Mathmos lava lamps are still made in the original factory in Poole, Dorset.\\r\\nIn 2008, American lava lamp maker, Lava World International, was acquired by Talon Merchant Capital and the name was again changed to Lava Lite LLC. As of 2016, lava lamps are sold under Lifespan brands in North America.[9]\\r\\nIn 2004, 24-year-old Philip Quinn from Kent, Washington was killed by a lava lamp on a kitchen stove. Heat from the stove built up pressure in the lamp until it exploded and a shard of glass pierced his heart, causing fatal injuries. Quinn was found dead in his home.[10]\\r\\nThe circumstances of his death were later reenacted in a 2006 episode of the popular science TV series MythBusters. The show found that even if shards of glass are not thrown with lethal velocity during such an attempt, the resulting spray of hot liquid from the lamp could easily cause severe burns to anyone nearby. The show noted that the safety instructions clearly state that lava lamps should not be heated by any source other than the specifically rated bulbs and purpose-designed bases that are provided.[11]","input":"What kind of light does a lava lamp use?"},{"output":"Plato","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe division of labor is the separation of tasks in any  system so that participants may specialize.  Individuals, organizations, and nations are endowed with or acquire specialized capabilities and either form combinations or trade to take advantage of the capabilities of others in addition to their own. Specialized capabilities may include equipment or natural resources in addition to skills and training and complex combinations of such assets are often important, as when multiple items of specialized equipment and skilled operators are used to produce a single product. The division of labour is the motive for trade and the source of economic interdependence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Neolithic Revolution, pastoralism and agriculture led to more reliable and abundant food supplies, which increased the population and led to specialization of labor, including new classes of artisans, warriors, and the development of elites.  This specialization was furthered by the process of industrialisation, and Industrial Revolution-era factories.  Accordingly many classical economists as well as some mechanical engineers such as Charles Babbage were proponents of division of labour. Also, having workers perform single or limited tasks eliminated the long training period required to train craftsmen, who were replaced with lesser paid but more productive unskilled workers.[1] Historically, an increasing division of labour is associated with the growth of total output and trade, the rise of capitalism, and the increasing complexity of industrialised processes. The concept and implementation of division of labour has been observed in ancient Sumerian (Mesopotamian) culture, where assignment of jobs in some cities coincided with an increase in trade and economic interdependence. Division of labour generally also increases both producer and individual worker productivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast to division of labour, division of work refers to the division of a large task, contract, or project into smaller taskseach with a separate schedule within the overall project schedule. Division of labour, instead, refers to the allocation of tasks to individuals or organizations according to the skills and/or equipment those people or organizations possess. Often division of labour and division of work are both part of the economic activity within an industrial nation or organization.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Plato's Republic, the origin of the state lies in the natural inequality of humanity, which is embodied in the division of labour.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell then, how will our state supply these needs? It will need a farmer, a builder, and a weaver, and also, I think, a shoemaker and one or two others to provide for our bodily needs. So that the minimum state would consist of four or five men.... (The Republic, p. 103, Penguin Classics edition.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSilvermintz notes that, \\"Historians of economic thought credit Plato, primarily on account of arguments advanced in his Republic, as an early proponent of the division of labour.\\" Notwithstanding this, Silvermintz argues that, \\"While Plato recognizes both the economic and political benefits of the division of labour, he ultimately critiques this form of economic arrangement insofar as it hinders the individual from ordering his own soul by cultivating acquisitive motives over prudence and reason.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nXenophon, in the fourth century BC, makes a passing reference to division of labour in his 'Cyropaedia' (a.k.a. Education of Cyrus).\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as the various trades are most highly developed in large cities, in the same way food at the palace is prepared in a far superior manner. In small towns the same man makes couches, doors, ploughs and tables, and often he even builds houses, and still he is thankful if only he can find enough work to support himself. And it is impossible for a man of many trades to do all of them well. In large cities, however, because many make demands on each trade, one alone is enough to support a man, and often less than one: for instance one man makes shoes for men, another for women, there are places even where one man earns a living just by mending shoes, another by cutting them out, another just by sewing the uppers together, while there is another who performs none of these operations but assembles the parts, Of necessity, he who pursues a very specialized task will do it best.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 14th-century scholar Ibn Khaldun emphasised the importance of the division of labour in the production process. In his Muqaddimah, he states:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe power of the individual human being is not sufficient for him to obtain (the food) he needs, and does not provide him with as much as he requires to live. Even if we assume an absolute minimum of food...that amount of food could be obtained only after much preparation...Thus, he cannot do without a combination of many powers from among his fellow beings, if he is to obtain food for himself and for them. Through cooperation, the needs of a number of persons, many times greater than their own number, can be satisfied.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William Petty was the first modern writer to take note of division of labour, showing its existence and usefulness in Dutch shipyards. Classically the workers in a shipyard would build ships as units, finishing one before starting another. But the Dutch had it organized with several teams each doing the same tasks for successive ships. People with a particular task to do must have discovered new methods that were only later observed and justified by writers on political economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nPetty also applied the principle to his survey of Ireland. His breakthrough was to divide up the work so that large parts of it could be done by people with no extensive training.\\r\\n\\r\\nBernard de Mandeville discusses the matter in the second volume of The Fable of the Bees (1714).  This elaborates many matters raised by the original poem about a 'Grumbling Hive'. He says:\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if one will wholly apply himself to the making of Bows and Arrows, whilst another provides Food, a third builds Huts, a fourth makes Garments, and a fifth Utensils, they not only become useful to one another, but the Callings and Employments themselves will in the same Number of Years receive much greater Improvements, than if all had been promiscuously followed by every one of the Five.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen every individual person labors apart, and only for himself, his force is too small to execute any considerable work; his labor being employed in supplying all his different necessities, he never attains a perfection in any particular art; and as his force and success are not at all times equal, the least failure in either of these particulars must be attended with inevitable ruin and misery. Society provides a remedy for these three inconveniences. By the conjunction of forces, our power is augmented: By the partition of employments, our ability increases: And by mutual succor we are less exposed to fortune and accidents. Tis by this additional force, ability, and security, that society becomes advantageous.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his introduction to Art de l'pinglier [The Art of the Pin-Maker] (1761),[5] Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau writes about the \\"division of this work\\":[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nobody who is not surprised of the small price of pins; but we shall be even more surprised, when we know how many different operations, most of them very delicate, are mandatory to make a good pin. We are going to go through these operations in a few words to stimulate the curiosity to know their detail; this enumeration will supply as many articles which will make the division of this work. [...] The first operation is to have brass go through the drawing plate to calibrate it. [...]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy \\"division of this work\\", Duhamel du Monceau is referring to the subdivisions of the text describing the various trades involved in the pin making activity; this can also be described as division of labour.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first sentence of An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776), Adam Smith foresaw the essence of industrialism by determining that division of labour represents a substantial increase in productivity. Like du Monceau, his example was the making of pins. Unlike Plato, Smith famously argued that the difference between a street porter and a philosopher was as much a consequence of the division of labour as its cause. Therefore, while for Plato the level of specialization determined by the division of labour was externally determined, for Smith it was the dynamic engine of economic progress.  However, in a further chapter of the same book Smith criticizes the division of labour saying it can lead to \\"the almost entire corruption and degeneracy of the great body of the people.  unless government takes some pains to prevent it.\\"[7] The contradiction has led to some debate over Smith's opinion of the division of labour.[8] Alexis de Tocqueville agreed with Smith: \\"Nothing tends to materialize man, and to deprive his work of the faintest trace of mind, more than extreme division of labor.\\"[9] Adam Ferguson shared similar views to Smith, though was generally more negative.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe specialization and concentration of the workers on their single subtasks often leads to greater skill and greater productivity on their particular subtasks than would be achieved by the same number of workers each carrying out the original broad task.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith saw the importance of matching skills with equipment ÿ usually in the context of an organization.  For example, pin makers were organized with one making the head, another the body, each using different equipment.  Similarly he emphasised a large number of skills, used in cooperation and with suitable equipment, were required to build a ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn modern economic discussion, the term human capital would be used.  Smith's insight suggests that the huge increases in productivity obtainable from technology or technological progress are possible because human and physical capital are matched, usually in an organization. See also a short discussion of Adam Smith's theory in the context of business processes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBabbage wrote a seminal work \\"On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures\\" analyzing perhaps for the first time the division of labour in factories.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of morals 1785, Kant notes the value of the division of labour:\\r\\nAll crafts, trades and arts have profited from the division of labour; for when each worker sticks to one particular kind of work that needs to be handled differently from all the others, he can do it better and more easily than when one person does everything. Where work is not thus differentiated and divided, where everyone is a jack-of-all-trades, the crafts remain at an utterly primitive level.[12]\\r\\nMarx argued that increasing the specialization may also lead to workers with poorer overall skills and a lack of enthusiasm for their work. He described the process as alienation: workers become more and more specialized and work becomes repetitive, eventually leading to complete alienation from the process of production. The worker then becomes \\"depressed spiritually and physically to the condition of a machine\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, Marx argued that division of labour creates less-skilled workers. As the work becomes more specialized, less training is needed for each specific job, and the workforce, overall, is less skilled than if one worker did one job entirely.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong Marx's theoretical contributions is his sharp distinction between the economic and the social division of labor.[15] That is, some forms of labour co-operation are purely due to \\"technical necessity\\", but others are a result of a \\"social control\\" function related to a class and status hierarchy. If these two divisions are conflated, it might appear as though the existing division of labour is technically inevitable and immutable, rather than (in good part) socially constructed and influenced by power relationships. He also argues that in a communist society, the division of labour is transcended, meaning that balanced human development occurs where people fully express their nature in the variety of creative work that they do.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry David Thoreau criticized the division of labour in Walden (published in 1854), on the basis that it removes people from a sense of connectedness with society and with the world at large, including nature. He claimed that the average man in a civilized society is less wealthy, in practice, than one in a \\"savage\\" society. The answer he gave was that self-sufficiency was enough to cover one's basic needs.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThoreau's friend and mentor, Ralph Waldo Emerson, criticized the division of labour in \\"The American Scholar\\"; a widely informed, holistic citizenry is vital for the spiritual and physical health of the country.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his seminal work, The Division of Labor in Society, mile Durkheim[17] observes that the division of labour appears in all societies and positively correlates with societal advancement because it increases as a society progresses. Durkheim arrived at the same conclusion regarding the positive effects of the division of labour as his theoretical predecessor, Adam Smith.  In The Wealth of the Nations, Smith observes the division of labour results in \\"a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labor.\\"[18]  While they shared this belief, Durkheim believed the division of labour applied to all \\"biological organisms generally\\" while Smith believed this law applied \\"only to human societies.\\"[19]  This difference may result from the influence of Charles Darwins On the Origin of Species on Durkheims writings.[19]  For example, Durkheim observed an apparent relationship between \\"the functional specialization of the parts of an organism\\" and \\"the extent of that organism's evolutionary development,\\" which he believed \\"extended the scope of the division of labour so as to make its origins contemporaneous with the origins of life itselfimplying that its conditions must be found in the essential properties of all organized matter.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Durkheims division of labour applied to all organisms, he considered it a \\"natural law\\"[19] and worked to determine whether it should be embraced or resisted by first analysing its functions.  Durkheim hypothesized that the division of labour fosters social solidarity, yielding \\"a wholly moral phenomenon\\" that ensures \\"mutual relationships\\" among individuals.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs social solidarity cannot be directly quantified, Durkheim indirectly studies solidarity by \\"classify[ing] the different types of law to find...the different types of social solidarity which correspond to it.\\"[20] Durkheim categorizes: criminal laws and their respective punishments as promoting mechanical solidarity, a sense of unity resulting from individuals engaging in similar work who hold shared backgrounds, traditions, and values;[21] and civil laws as promoting organic solidarity, a society in which individuals engage in different kinds of work that benefit society and other individuals.[21]  Durkheim believes that organic solidarity prevails in more advanced societies, while mechanical solidarity typifies less developed societies.[22]  He explains that, in societies with more mechanical solidarity, the diversity and division of labour is much less, so individuals have a similar worldview.[23]  Similarly, Durkheim opines that in societies with more organic solidarity, the diversity of occupations is greater, and individuals depend on each other more, resulting in greater benefits to society as a whole.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nDurkheims work enabled social science to progress more efficiently \\"in  the understanding of human social behavior.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarx's theories, including the negative claims regarding the division of labour have been criticized by the Austrian economists such as Ludwig von Mises.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main argument here is the economic gains accruing from the division of labour far outweigh the costs. It is argued that it is fully possible to achieve balanced human development within capitalism, and alienation is downplayed as mere romantic fiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn The Use of Knowledge in Society, Friedrich A. Hayek states:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe price system is just one of those formations which man has learned to use (though he is still very far from having learned to make the best use of it) after he had stumbled upon it without understanding it. Through it not only a division of labour but also a coordinated utilization of resources based on an equally divided knowledge has become possible. The people who like to deride any suggestion that this may be so usually distort the argument by insinuating that it asserts that by some miracle just that sort of system has spontaneously grown up which is best suited to modern civilization. It is the other way round: man has been able to develop that division of labour on which our civilization is based because he happened to stumble upon a method which made it possible. Had he not done so, he might still have developed some other, altogether different, type of civilization, something like the \\"state\\" of the termite ants, or some other altogether unimaginable type.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue reaches its broadest scope in the controversies about globalization, which is often interpreted as a euphemism for the expansion of world trade based on comparative advantage.\\r\\nThis would mean that countries specialize in the work they can do at the lowest relative cost measured in terms of the opportunity cost of not using resources for other work, compared to the opportunity costs experienced countries. Critics, however, allege that international specialization cannot be explained sufficiently in terms of \\"the work nations do best\\", rather this specialization is guided more by commercial criteria, which favour some countries over others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe OECD recently advised (28 June 2005) that:\\r\\n\\r\\nEfficient policies to encourage employment and combat unemployment are essential if countries are to reap the full benefits of globalization and avoid a backlash against open trade... Job losses in some sectors, along with new job opportunities in other sectors, are an inevitable accompaniment of the process of globalization... The challenge is to ensure that the adjustment process involved in matching available workers with new job openings works as smoothly as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew studies have taken place regarding the global division of labour.  Information can be drawn from ILO and national statistical offices.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one study, Deon Filmer estimated that 2.474 billion people participated in the global non-domestic labour force in the mid-1990s. Of these,\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of workers in industry and services were wage and salary earners ÿ 58 percent of the industrial workforce and 65 percent of the services workforce. But a big portion were self-employed or involved in family labour. Filmer suggests the total of employees worldwide in the 1990s was about 880 million, compared with around a billion working on own account on the land (mainly peasants), and some 480 million working on own account in industry and services. The 2007 ILO Global Employment Trends Report indicated that services have surpassed agriculture for the first time in human history: \\"In 2006 the service sectors share of global employment overtook agriculture for the first time, increasing from 39.5 per cent to 40 per cent. Agriculture decreased from 39.7 per cent to 38.7 per cent. The industry sector accounted for 21.3 per cent of total employment.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the modern world, those specialists most preoccupied in their work with theorizing about the division of labour are those involved in management and organization. In view of the global extremities of the division of labour, the question is often raised about what division of labour would be most ideal, beautiful, efficient and just.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo styles of management that are seen in modern organizations are control and commitment, control being the division of labour style of the past and commitment being the style of the future. Control management is based on the principles of job specialization and the division of labour. This is the assembly line style of job specialization where employees are given a very narrow set of tasks or one specific task. Commitment division of labour is oriented on including the employee and building a level of internal commitment towards accomplishing tasks. Tasks include more responsibility and are coordinated based on expertise rather than formal position.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nJob specialization is advantageous in developing employee expertise in a field and boosting organizational production. However, disadvantages of job specialization included limited employee skill, a dependence on entire department fluency, and employee discontent with repetitious tasks.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is widely accepted that the division of labour is to a great extent inevitable, simply because no one can do all tasks at once. Labour hierarchy is a very common feature of the modern workplace structure, but of course the way these hierarchies are structured can be influenced by a variety of different factors.\\r\\n\\r\\nSize, cost, and the development of new technology are factors that have influenced job specialization structures in the modern workplace. The cost of job specialization is what limits small organizations from dividing their labour responsibilities, but as organizations increase in size there is a correlation in the rise of division of labour. Technological developments have led to a decrease in the amount of job specialization in organizations as new technology makes it easier for fewer employees to accomplish a variety of tasks and still enhance production. New technology has also been supportive in the flow of information between departments helping to reduce the feeling of department isolation.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is often agreed[citation needed] that the most equitable principle in allocating people within hierarchies is that of true (or proven) competency or ability. This important concept of meritocracy could be read as an explanation or as a justification of why a division of labour is the way it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, in capitalist economies, such things are not decided consciously.[citation needed]  Different people try different things, and that which is most effective cost-wise (produces the most and best output with the least input) will generally be adopted.[citation needed]  Often techniques that work in one place or time do not work as well in another.  This does not present a problem,[citation needed] as the only requirement of a capitalist system is that you turn a profit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdam Smith famously said in The Wealth of Nations that the division of labour is limited by the extent of the market. This is because it is by exchange that each person can be specialized in their work and yet still have access to a wide range of goods and services. Hence, reductions in barriers to exchange lead to increases in the division of labour and so help to drive economic growth. Limitations to the division of labour have also been related to coordination and transportation costs.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can be motivational advantages to a reduced division of labour (which has been termed job enlargement and 'job enrichment').[29] Jobs that are too specialized in a narrow range of tasks are said to result in demotivation due to boredom and alienation. Hence, a Taylorist approach to work design contributed to worsened industrial relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also limitations to the division of labour (and the division of work) that result from work-flow variations and uncertainties.[30][31] These help to explain issues in modern work organization, such as task consolidations in business process reengineering and the use of multi-skilled work teams. For instance, one stage of a production process may temporarily work at a slower pace, forcing other stages to slow down. One answer to this is to make some portion of resources mobile between stages, so that those resources must be capable of undertaking a wider range of tasks. Another is to consolidate tasks so that they are undertaken one after another by the same workers and other resources. Stocks between stages can also help to reduce the problem to some extent but are costly and can hamper quality control. Note also that modern flexible manufacturing systems require both flexible machines and flexible workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn project-based work, the coordination of resources is a difficult issue for the project manager as project schedules and resulting resource bookings are based on estimates of task durations and so are subject to subsequent revisions. Again, consolidating tasks so that they are undertaken consecutively by the same resources and having resources available that can be called on at short-notice from other tasks can help to reduce such problems, though at the cost of reduced specialisation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also advantages in a reduced division of labour where knowledge would otherwise have to be transferred between stages.[32] For example, having a single person deal with a customer query means that only that one person has to be familiarised with the customers details. It is also likely to result in the query being handled faster due to the elimination of delays in passing the query between different people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clearest exposition of the principles of sexual division of labour across the full range of human societies can be summarized by a large number of logically complementary implicational constraints of the following form: if women of childbearing ages in a given community tend to do X (e.g., preparing soil for planting) they will also do Y (e.g., the planting) while for men the logical reversal in this example would be that if men plant they will prepare the soil. \\"Entailment Theory and Method: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Sexual Division of Labor\\"[33] by White, Brudner and Burton (1977, public domain), using statistical entailment analysis, shows that tasks more frequently chosen by women in these order relations are those more convenient in relation to childrearing. This type of finding has been replicated in a variety of studies, including modern industrial economies. These entailments do not restrict how much work for any given task could be done by men (e.g., in cooking) or by women (e.g., in clearing forests) but are only least-effort or role-consistent tendencies. To the extent that women clear forests for agriculture, for example, they tend to do the entire agricultural sequence of tasks on those clearings. In theory, these types of constraints could be removed by provisions of child care, but ethnographic examples are lacking.\\r\\n\\r\\nJob satisfaction has been shown to improve as an employee is given the task of a specific job. Students who have received PhDs in a chosen field later report increased satisfaction compared to their previous jobs. This can be attributed to their high levels of specialization.[34] The higher the training needed for the specialized job position, the higher is the level of job satisfaction as well, although many highly specialized jobs can be monotonous and produce high rates of burn out periodically.[35]","input":"Who propounded the theory of division of labour?"},{"output":"Helena Blavatsky","context":"Traditional and Christian Theosophy contributors\\r\\nRelated topics\\r\\nTheosophists\\r\\nTheosophical philosophical concepts\\r\\nTheosophical organizations\\r\\nTheosophical texts\\r\\nTheosophical Masters\\r\\nRelated topics\\r\\nTheosophy is a collection of mystical and occultist philosophies[1] concerning, or seeking direct knowledge of the presumed mysteries of life and nature, particularly of the nature of divinity and the origin and purpose of the universe.[2] Theosophy is considered part of Western esotericism, which believes that hidden knowledge or wisdom from the ancient past offers a path to enlightenment and salvation.\\r\\nFrom the late 19th century onwards, the term theosophy has generally been used to refer to the religio-philosophic doctrines of the Theosophical Society, founded in New York City in 1875 by Helena Blavatsky, William Quan Judge, and Henry Steel Olcott. Blavatsky's major work, The Secret Doctrine (1888), was one of the foundational works of modern theosophy.[3] As of 2015[update], members of organizations descended from, or related to, the Theosophical Society were active in more than 52 countries around the world.[a] Modern theosophy has also given rise to, or influenced, the development of other mystical, philosophical, and religious movements.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTheosophy comes from the Greek theosophia (Ĳ?ϫ), which combines theos (Ĳ??), \\"God\\"[5] and sophia (?ϫ), \\"wisdom\\", meaning \\"divine wisdom\\".\\r\\nThe term theosophia appeared (in both Greek and Latin) in the works of early church fathers, as a synonym for theology:[6] the theosophoi are \\"those who know divine matters.\\"[7] The derived term theosophy was originally also a synonym for theology;[8] however, it acquired various other meanings throughout its history.[9] The adjective \\"theosophos\\" (Ĳ??) \\"wise in divine things\\" was applied by Iamblichus to the gymnosophists (æ򿼶ϫ?), i.e. the Indian yogis or sadhus.[10]\\r\\nAccording to Blavatsky:\\r\\nIt comes to us from the Alexandrian philosophers, called lovers of truth, Philaletheians, from phil \\"loving,\\" and aletheia \\"truth.\\" The name Theosophy dates from the third century of our era, and began with Ammonius Saccas and his disciples, who started the Eclectic Theosophical system.\\r\\nThe term theosophy was used as a synonym for theology as early as the 3rd century C.E.[6] The 13th century work Summa philosophiae attributed to Robert Grosseteste made a distinction between theosophers and theologians. In Summa, theosophers were described as authors only inspired by the holy books, while theologians like Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Origen were described as persons whose task was to explain theosophy. Therefore, the terms were the opposite of the present-day meaning.[8]\\r\\nIn Jewish mysticism, the theosophical[11] doctrinal system of Kabbalah (Hebrew: \\"received tradition\\") emerged in late 12th-century southern France (the book Bahir), spreading to 13th-century Spain (culminating in the late 13th-century book Zohar). Kabbalah became the basis of later Jewish mystical development. The theosophical Kabbalah in Judaism was recast into its second version, Lurianic Kabbalah, in 16th-century Ottoman Palestine. From the Renaissance onwards, syncretic non-Jewish traditions of theological Christian Cabala and magical Hermetic Qabalah studied the Judaic texts, incorporating its system into their different philosophies, where it remains a central component of Western esotericism. Gershom Scholem, the founder of Jewish mysticism academia, saw Medieval and Lurianic Kabbalah as the incorporation into Judaism of Gnostic motifs,[12] though interpreted strictly monotheistically. At the centre of Kabbalah are the 10 Sephirot powers in the divine realm, their unification being the task of man. In Lurianism, man redeems the sparks of holiness in materiality, rectifying the divine persona from its primordial exile.\\r\\nDuring the Renaissance, use of the term diverged to refer to gnostic knowledge that offers the individual enlightenment and salvation through a knowledge of the bonds that are believed to unite her or him to the world of divine or intermediary spirits.[7] Christian theosophy arose in Germany in the 16th century. Inspired to a considerable extent by the works of Paracelsus (1493ÿ1541).[13]. The term had not yet reached a settled meaning, however, as the mid-16th century Theosophia by Johannes Arboreus provided a lengthy exposition that included no mention of esotericism.[14]\\r\\nThe work of the 17th-century German Christian mystic Jakob Boehme (1575ÿ1624) strongly contributed to spread the use of the word \\"theosophy\\", even though Boehme rarely used the word in his writings. It is on account of the title of some of his works, but these titles appear to have been chosen more by the editors than by Boehme himself.[15] Moreover, Boehme gave the word \\"theosophy\\" a limited meaning, making it clear that he was not conflating nature with God.[16] There were relatively few theosophers in the 17th century, but many of them were prolific.[17] Outside of Germany, there were also theosophers from Holland, England, and France. This group is represented by Jan Baptist van Helmont (1618ÿ1699), Robert Fludd (1574ÿ1637), John Pordage (1608ÿ1681), Jane Leade (1623ÿ1704), Henry More (1614ÿ1687), Pierre Poiret (1646ÿ1719), and Antoinette Bourignon (1616ÿ1680).[18] Theosophers of this period often inquired into nature using a method of interpretation founded upon a specific myth or revelation, applying active imagination in order to draw forth symbolic meanings and further their pursuit of knowledge toward a complete understanding of these mysteries.[7][19] In Athanasius Kircher's Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1652), Kircher assigned the word theosophy to the metaphysics adhered to in ancient Egypt, and to Neo-Platonism, and thus he gave once again the word one of its most generally accepted meanings, that of divine metaphysics.[20]\\r\\nIn the 18th century, the word theosophy came into more widespread use among some philosophers. However, the term \\"theosophy\\" was still \\"practically absent\\" throughout the entire eighteenth century in dictionaries and encyclopedias, where it only appeared more and more frequently beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century.[21] Theosophers themselves used the word theosophy sparingly, at least up until the middle of the nineteenth century.[22] Johann Jakob Brucker (1696ÿ1770) included a long chapter on theosophy in his monumental work Historia critica philosophia.? (1741). He included theosophers alongside other currents in esotericism in what was then a standard reference in the history of philosophy. By the 18th century, the word theosophy was often used in conjunction with panosophy, i.e., a knowledge of divine things that is acquired by deciphering the supposed hieroglyphics of the concrete universe.[clarify] The term theosophy is more properly reserved for the reverse process of contemplating the divine in order to discover the content of the concrete universe.[23]\\r\\nIn England, Robert Hindmarsh, a printer with a Methodist background, formed a \\"Theosophical Society\\" in 1783, for translating, printing and distributing the writings of Swedenborg.[24] This society was renamed in 1785 as \\"The British Society for the Propagation of the Doctrines of the New Church\\", consisting of Swedenborgian based beliefs.[25][26][b] In France, Denis Diderot gave the word theosophie more attention than other encyclopedias of this period by including an article on it in his Encyclopdie, published during the French Enlightenment.[27] The article dealt mostly with Paracelsus and essentially plagiarized Brucker's \\"Historia\\".[28]\\r\\nGroups such as the Martinist Order founded by Papus in 1891, followed the theosophical current closely linked to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition and Western esotericism. Theosophers outside of the initiate societies included people such as Vladimir Solovyov (1853ÿ1900), whose views have been described as follows: \\"although empiricism and rationalism rest on false principles, their respective objective contents, external experience, qua the foundation of natural science, and logical thought, qua the foundation of pure philosophy, are to be synthesized or encompassed along with mystical knowledge in 'integral knowledge,' what Solovyov terms 'theosophy.'\\"[29]\\r\\nTheosophy actually designates a specific flow of thought or tradition within the modern study of esotericism. Thus, it follows the path starting from the more modern period of the 15th century onward. Faivre describes the \\"theosophic current\\" or theosophy as a single esoteric current among seven other esoteric currents in early modern Western thought (i.e., alchemy, astrology, Neo-Alexandrian Hermeticism, Christian Kabbalah, Paracelsism (i.e., the studying of the \\"prognostications\\" of Paracelsus), philosophia occulta and Rosicrucianism).[30] Christian theosophy is an under-researched area; a general history of it has never been written.[31]\\r\\nFaivre noted that there are \\"obvious similarities\\" between earlier theosophy and modern Theosophy as both play an important part in Western esotericism and both claim to deal with wisdom from a gnostic perspective. But he says there are also differences, since they do not actually rely on the same reference works; and their style is different. The referential corpus of earlier theosophy \\"belongs essentially to the Judeo-Christian type\\", while that of modern Theosophy \\"reveals a more universal aspect\\".[32] Although there are many differences between Christian theosophy and the Theosophical movement begun by Helena Blavatsky, the differences \\"are not important enough to cause an insurmountable barrier.\\"[33] When referring to the ideas related to Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society, the word \\"Theosophy\\" is capitalized; otherwise it is not. Theosophy and theosophists refer to Blavatsky's philosophy while theosophy and theosophers refer to Christian theosophy. Some Theosophists were also theosophers.[8] Blavatsky linked her use of the word theosophy to the Neoplatonists and Ammonius Saccas, rather than to the later Christian theosophers.[34]\\r\\nTheosophers engage in analysis of the universe, humanity, divinity, and the reciprocal effects of each on the other. The starting point for theosophers may be knowledge of external things in the world or inner experiences and the aim of the theosopher is to discover deeper meanings in the natural or divine realm. Antoine Faivre notes, \\"the theosophist dedicates his energy to inventing (in the word's original sense of 'discovering') the articulation of all things visible and invisible, by examining both divinity and nature in the smallest detail.\\"[7] The knowledge that is acquired through meditation is believed to change the being of the meditator.[35]\\r\\nFaivre identified three characteristics of theosophy.[36] The three characteristics of theosophy are listed below.\\r\\nTheosophy:\\r\\nThe Theosophical Society was founded in New York City in 1875 with the motto, \\"There is no Religion higher than Truth\\".[37] Its principal founding members were Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831ÿ1891), Henry Steel Olcott (1832ÿ1907), and William Quan Judge (1851ÿ1896).\\r\\nAfter several changes and iterations its declared objectives became the following:[38]\\r\\nThe emblem of the Theosophical Society includes seven symbols of particular importance to the Society's symbology: 1) the motto of the Society; 2) a serpent biting its tail (ouroboros); 3) the swastika; 4) the hexagram; 5) the cruxansata (Ankh); 6) the pin of the Society, composed of crux ansata and serpent entwined, forming together \\"T.S.\\", and 7) Om (or aum). The seal of the Society contains all of these symbols, except aum, and thus contains, in symbolic form, the doctrines its members follow.[39]\\r\\nThe Society was organized as a non-proselytizing, non-sectarian entity.[40][41] Blavatsky and Olcott (the first President of the Society) moved from New York to Bombay, India, in 1878. The International Headquarters of the Society was eventually established in Adyar, a suburb of Madras. The original organization, after splits and realignments, has (as of 2011[update]) several offshoots; all of them accept the three objectives above, and the precepts put forth by Blavatsky. Blavatsky was influential on spiritualism and related subcultures: \\"The western esoteric tradition has no more important figure in modern times.\\"[42]\\r\\nHelena Blavatsky was a charismatic, unconventional and controversial woman of mixed Russian and German descent, who had travelled extensively; she became the major proponent of both theoretical and practical Theosophy.[43] Since its inception, and through doctrinal assimilation or divergence, Theosophy has also given rise to or influenced the development of other mystical, philosophical, and religious movements.[4] Following Blavatsky's death, disagreements among prominent Theosophists caused a series of splits and several Theosophical organizations emerged.[c] One successor of the original Society is as of 2011[update] known as the Theosophical Society Adyar. After a split in 1895, William Quan Judge established a Theosophical organization in New York City which later eventually moved to Pasadena, California. It is known as of 2011[update] as the Theosophical Society Pasadena. The latter split yet again; another Theosophical organization, the United Lodge of Theosophists was the result, formed by Robert Crosbie in 1909.\\r\\nContemporaries of Blavatsky, including William Quan Judge and Alfred Percy Sinnett, and later exponents have contributed to the development of this Theosophy, producing works that at times expanded on the original concepts.[d] Through the various Theosophical Societies and Organizations, Theosophy remains an active philosophical school with presences in more than 50 countries around the world.\\r\\nDuring the 1890s and 1900s, the international leadership of the Adyar Society and their circle became increasingly convinced that the appearance of an \\"emissary\\" from the Spiritual Hierarchy was imminent; the expected emissary was further identified as the so-called World Teacher or Maitreya, originally by Leadbeater, who \\"discovered\\" fourteen-year-old Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895ÿ1986) as the entity's probable \\"vehicle\\".[44] Krishnamurti was groomed extensively for his expected messianic role, and a new organization, the Order of the Star in the East (OSE), was formed in 1911 to support him in this mission. The project received widespread publicity and enjoyed worldwide following, chiefly among Adyar Theosophists. It also encountered opposition within and without the Theosophical Society, and contributed or led to years of upheaval, power struggles and doctrinal schism within Theosophy.[45] Additional negative repercussions occurred in 1929, when Krishnamurti repudiated the messianic status claimed on his behalf and dissolved the OSE; soon after he severed ties with the Society and Theosophy in general. The adverse reactions and mixed publicity generated by the entire World Teacher Project, and especially by its demise and aftermath, damaged the standing of Theosophy and of its institutions. However, Krishnamurti eventually established a worldwide reputation as an original and respected independent speaker and thinker on spiritual and philosophical issues.[46]\\r\\nContemporaries of Blavatsky, as well as later theosophists, contributed to the development of this school of theosophical thought, producing works that at times sought to elucidate the ideas she presented (see Gottfried de Purucker), and at times to expand upon them.[e] Since its inception, and through doctrinal assimilation or divergence, Theosophy has also given rise to or influenced the development of other mystical, philosophical, and religious movements.[47]\\r\\nDuring the two decades that followed the death of Blavatsky, a number of leading Theosophists expanded or reinterpreted her own and other theosophical works. Prominent among them were Charles Webster Leadbeater (1854ÿ1934), then considered the Society's main occult investigator, and Annie Besant (1847ÿ1933), who became the International President of the Society in 1907, following the death of Olcott. Some of their (and others') prolific commentaries and newly introduced concepts became subjects of doctrinal debate and dispute; dissidents charged them with straying from Theosophical orthodoxy and derisively labeled such works Neo-Theosophy.[48] However, in later usage the term came to signify presumed theosophical or quasi-theosophical thought advanced by people not directly connected to the Theosophical movement or its institutions, especially former Theosophist Alice Bailey and groups associated with her; and also the people and organizations mentioned below under the heading New Age Movement.\\r\\nG.R.S. Mead was an early Theosophist. In 1909 he resigned from the Theosophical Society which was Orientalist. Prior to his break from the Society Mead had already begun emphasizing sources from the Western esoteric tradition in his writing. Mead was among the first Theosophists to explicate a \\"'Western' theosophy deriving from Alexandrian and Hellenistic sources in the early centuries A.D.\\"[49]\\r\\nDuring the 1920s the Theosophical Society Adyar had around 7,000 members in the United States.[50] According to a Theosophical source, the Indian section in 2008 was said to have around 13,000 members while in the US the 2008 membership was reported at around 3,900.[51]\\r\\nThe Theosophical Society Adyar was closely linked to the Indian independence movement: the Indian National Congress was founded across the street in 1885 during a Theosophical conference, and many of its leaders, including M. K. Gandhi were associated with Theosophy.[52] However, Hindu spiritual teacher and leader Swami Vivekananda has criticized Theosophy and Theosophists.[53]\\r\\nSome early members of the Theosophical Society were closely linked to the Indian independence movement, including Allan Octavian Hume, Annie Besant and others. Hume was particularly involved in the founding of the Indian National Congress.[54]\\r\\nThe Theosophical Society had a major influence on Buddhist modernism[55] and Hindu reform movements, and the spread of those modernised versions in the west.[55]\\r\\nBlavatsky and Olcott took part in Anagarika Dharmapala's revival of Theravada Buddhism in Ceylon.[56][57]\\r\\nRudolf Steiner, head of the German branch of the Theosophical Society in the early part of the 20th century, disagreed with the Adyar-based international leadership of the Society over several doctrinal matters including the so-called World Teacher Project (see above). Steiner left the Theosophical Society in 1913 to promote his own theosophy-influenced philosophy,[58][59] which he called Anthroposophy, through a new organization, the Anthroposophical Society; the great majority of German-speaking members of the Theosophical Society joined the newly formed Anthroposophical Society.\\r\\nThe present-day New Age movement is said to be based to a considerable extent on original Theosophical tenets and ideas. \\"No single organization or movement has contributed so many components to the New Age Movement as the Theosophical Society. ... It has been the major force in the dissemination of occult literature in the West in the twentieth century.\\"[60]\\r\\nOther organizations loosely based on Theosophical texts and doctrines include the Agni Yoga, and a group of religions based on Theosophy called the Ascended Master Teachings: the \\"I AM\\" Activity, The Bridge to Freedom and The Summit Lighthouse, which evolved into the Church Universal and Triumphant. These various offshoots dispute the authenticity of their rivals.\\r\\nScholar Alvin Boyd Kuhn wrote his thesis, Theosophy: A Modern Revival of Ancient Wisdom, on the subject ÿ the first instance in which an individual obtained his doctorate with a thesis on Theosophy.[61] It can called also Olav Hammer's and Arnold Kalnitsky's doctoral dissertations (in 2000 and in 2003 respectively).[62][63]\\r\\nArtists and authors who investigated Theosophy include Talbot Mundy, Charles Howard Hinton, Geoffrey Hodson, James Jones,[64] H. P. Lovecraft, and L. Frank Baum. Composer Alexander Scriabin was a Theosophist whose beliefs influenced his music, especially by providing a justification or rationale for his chromatic language. Scriabin devised a quartal synthetic chord, often called his \\"mystic\\" chord, and before his death Scriabin planned a multimedia work to be performed in the Himalayas that would bring about the armageddon; \\"a grandiose religious synthesis of all arts which would herald the birth of a new world.\\"[65] This piece, Mysterium, was never realized, due to his death in 1915. Leonid Sabaneyev, in his book Reminiscences about Scriabin (1925), wrote that The Secret Doctrine and journals \\"Bulletin of theosophy\\" constantly were on Scriabin's work table.[66] Scriabin reread The Secret Doctrine very carefully and marked the most important places with a pencil.[67][f] Artists reported to be Theosophists were Wassily Kandinsky and Piet Mondrian.\\r\\nBlavatsky presented her book The Voice of the Silence, The Seven gates, Two Paths to Leo Tolstoy. In his works, Tolstoy used the dicta from the theosophical journal Theosophischer Wegweiser.[68] In his diary, he wrote on 12 February 1903, \\"I am reading a beautiful theosophical journal and find many common with my understanding.\\"[69]","input":"Who was the founder of theosophy which gave rise to many magical societies?"},{"output":"Hatshepsut","context":"Hatshepsut (/h?t???ps?t/;[4] also Hatchepsut; Egyptian: ?3.t-?ps.wt \\"Foremost of Noble Ladies\\";[5] 1507ÿ1458?BC) was the fifth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. She was the second historically confirmed female pharaoh, the first being Sobekneferu.[6] (Various other women may have also ruled as pharaohs regnant or at least regents before Hatshepsut, as early as Neithhotep around 1,600 years prior.) Hatshepsut came to the throne of Egypt in 1478 BC. Officially, she ruled jointly with Thutmose III, who had ascended to the throne the previous year as a child of about two years old. Hatshepsut was the chief wife of Thutmose II, Thutmose IIIs father. She is generally regarded by Egyptologists as one of the most successful pharaohs, reigning longer than any other woman of an indigenous Egyptian dynasty. According to Egyptologist James Henry Breasted she is also known as \\"the first great woman in history of whom we are informed.\\"[7]\\r\\nHatshepsut was the daughter and only child of Thutmose I and his primary wife Ahmose.[8] Her husband Thutmose II was the son of Thutmose I and a secondary wife named Mutnofret, who carried the title King's daughter and was probably a child of Ahmose I. Hatshepsut and Thutmose II had a daughter named Neferure. After having their daughter, Hatshepsut could not birth anymore children. Unable to have a son, [9]Thutmose II fathered Thutmose III with Iset, a secondary wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough contemporary records of her reign are documented in diverse ancient sources, Hatshepsut was thought by early modern scholars as only having served as a co-regent from approximately 1479 to 1458 BC, during years seven to twenty-one of the reign previously identified as that of Thutmose III.[10] Today Egyptologists generally agree that Hatshepsut assumed the position of pharaoh.[11][12]\\r\\nHatshepsut was described as having a reign of about 22 years by ancient authors. Josephus and Julius Africanus both quote Manetho's king list, mentioning a woman called Amessis or Amensis who has been identified (from the context) as Hatshepsut. In Josephus' work, her reign is described as lasting 21 years and nine months,[13] while Africanus stated it was twenty-two years. At this point in the histories, records of the reign of Hatshepsut end, since the first major foreign campaign of Thutmose III was dated to his 22nd year, which also would have been Hatshepsut's 22nd year as pharaoh.[14]\\r\\nDating the beginning of her reign is more difficult, however. Her father's reign began in either 1526 or 1506 BC according to the high and low estimates of her reign, respectively.[15] The length of the reigns of Tuthmosis I and Tuthmosis II, however, cannot be determined with absolute certainty. With short reigns, Hatshepsut would have ascended the throne 14 years after the coronation of Tuthmosis I, her father.[16] Longer reigns would put her ascension 25 years after Tuthmosis I's coronation.[15] Thus, Hatshepsut could have assumed power as early as 1512 BC, or, as late as 1479 BC.\\r\\nThe earliest attestation of Hatshepsut as pharaoh occurs in the tomb of Ramose and Hatnofer, where a collection of grave goods contained a single pottery jar or amphora from the tomb's chamberwhich was stamped with the date Year 7.[17] Another jar from the same tombwhich was discovered in situ by a 1935ÿ36 Metropolitan Museum of Art expedition on a hillside near Thebeswas stamped with the seal of the \\"God's Wife Hatshepsut\\" while two jars bore the seal of The Good Goddess Maatkare.[18] The dating of the amphorae, \\"sealed into the [tomb's] burial chamber by the debris from Senenmut's own tomb,\\" is undisputed, which means that Hatshepsut was acknowledged as king, and not queen, of Egypt by Year 7 of her reign.[18]\\r\\nHatshepsut established the trade networks that had been disrupted during the Hyksos occupation of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, thereby building the wealth of the eighteenth dynasty. She oversaw the preparations and funding for a mission to the Land of Punt. This trading expedition to Punt was roughly during Hatshepsut's ninth year of reign. It set out in her name with five ships, each measuring 70?feet (21 m) long bearing several sails[dubious ÿ discuss] and accommodating 210 men that included sailors and 30 rowers.[citation needed] Many trade goods were bought in Punt, notably frankincense and myrrh.\\r\\nHatshepsut's delegation returned from Punt bearing 31 live myrrh trees, the roots of which were carefully kept in baskets for the duration of the voyage. This was the first recorded attempt to transplant foreign trees. It is reported that Hatshepsut had these trees planted in the courts of her mortuary temple complex. Egyptians also returned with a number of other gifts from Punt, among which was frankincense.[19] Hatshepsut would grind the charred frankincense into kohl eyeliner. This is the first recorded use of the resin.[20]\\r\\nHatshepsut had the expedition commemorated in relief at Deir el-Bahri, which is also famous for its realistic depiction of the Queen of the Land of Punt, Queen Ati.[21] The Puntite Queen is portrayed as relatively tall and her physique was generously proportioned, with large breasts and rolls of fat on her body. Due to the fat deposits on her buttocks, it has sometimes been argued that she may have had steatopygia. However, according to the pathologist Marc Armand Ruffer, the main characteristic of a steatopygous woman is a disproportion in size between the buttocks and thighs, which was not the case with Ati. She instead appears to have been generally obese, a condition that was exaggerated by excessive lordosis or curvature of the lower spine.[22] Hatshepsut also sent raiding expeditions to Byblos and Sinai shortly after the Punt expedition. Very little is known about these expeditions. Although many Egyptologists have claimed that her foreign policy was mainly peaceful,[21] it is possible that she led military campaigns against Nubia and Canaan.[23]\\r\\nHatshepsut was one of the most prolific builders in ancient Egypt, commissioning hundreds of construction projects throughout both Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. Arguably, her buildings were grander and more numerous than those of any of her Middle Kingdom predecessors'. Later pharaohs attempted to claim some of her projects as theirs. She employed the great architect Ineni, who also had worked for her father, her husband, and for the royal steward Senemut. During her reign, so much statuary was produced that almost every major museum with Ancient Egyptian artefacts in the world has Hatshepsut statuary among their collections; for instance, the Hatshepsut Room in New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art is dedicated solely to some of these pieces.\\r\\nFollowing the tradition of most pharaohs, Hatshepsut had monuments constructed at the Temple of Karnak. She also restored the original Precinct of Mut, the ancient great goddess of Egypt, at Karnak that had been ravaged by the foreign rulers during the Hyksos occupation. It later was ravaged by other pharaohs, who took one part after another to use in their pet projects and awaits restoration. She had twin obelisks, at the time the tallest in the world, erected at the entrance to the temple. One still stands, as the tallest surviving ancient obelisk on Earth; the other has broken in two and toppled.\\r\\nAnother project, Karnak's Red Chapel, or Chapelle Rouge, was intended as a barque shrine and originally may have stood between her two obelisks. It was lined with carved stones that depicted significant events in Hatshepsut's life.\\r\\nShe later ordered the construction of two more obelisks to celebrate her 16th year as pharaoh; one of the obelisks broke during construction and a third was therefore constructed to replace it. The broken obelisk was left at its quarrying site in Aswan, where it still remains. Known as The Unfinished Obelisk, it demonstrates how obelisks were quarried.[24]\\r\\nThe Temple of Pakhet was built by Hatshepsut at Beni Hasan in the Minya Governorate south of Al Minya. The name, Pakhet, was a synthesis that occurred by combining Bast and Sekhmet, who were similar lioness war goddesses, in an area that bordered the north and south division of their cults. The cavernous underground temple, cut into the rock cliffs on the eastern side of the Nile, was admired and called the Speos Artemidos by the Greeks during their occupation of Egypt, known as the Ptolemaic Dynasty. They saw the goddess as akin to their hunter goddess Artemis. The temple is thought to have been built alongside much more ancient ones that have not survived. This temple has an architrave with a long dedicatory text bearing Hatshepsut's famous denunciation of the Hyksos that has been translated by James P. Allen.[25] They had occupied Egypt and cast it into a cultural decline that persisted until a revival brought about by her policies and innovations. This temple was altered later and some of its inside decorations were usurped by Seti I, in the nineteenth dynasty, attempting to have his name replace that of Hatshepsut.\\r\\nFollowing the tradition of many pharaohs, the masterpiece of Hatshepsut's building projects was a mortuary temple. She built hers in a complex at Deir el-Bahri. It was designed and implemented by Senenmut at a site on the West Bank of the Nile River near the entrance to what now is called the Valley of the Kings because of all the pharaohs who later chose to associate their complexes with the grandeur of hers. Her buildings were the first grand ones planned for that location.\\r\\nThe focal point was the Djeser-Djeseru or \\"the Sublime of Sublimes\\", a colonnaded structure of perfect harmony nearly one thousand years before the Parthenon was built. Djeser-Djeseru sits atop a series of terraces that once were graced with lush gardens. Djeser-Djeseru is built into a cliff face that rises sharply above it. Djeser-Djeseru and the other buildings of Hatshepsut's Deir el-Bahri complex are considered to be significant advances in architecture. Another one of her great accomplishments is the Hatshepsut needle[26] (also known as the granite obelisks).\\r\\nAlthough it was uncommon for Egypt to be ruled by a woman, the situation was not unprecedented. As a regent, Hatshepsut was preceded by Merneith of the first dynasty, who was buried with the full honors of a pharaoh and may have ruled in her own right. Nimaathap of the third dynasty may have been the dowager of Khasekhemwy, but certainly acted as regent for her son, Djoser, and may have reigned as pharaoh in her own right.[27] Nitocris may have been the last pharaoh of the sixth dynasty. Her name is found in the Histories of Herodotus and writings of Manetho, but her historicity is uncertain. Queen Sobekneferu of the twelfth dynasty is known to have assumed formal power as ruler of \\"Upper and Lower Egypt\\" three centuries earlier than Hatshepsut. Ahhotep I, lauded as a warrior queen, may have been a regent between the reigns of two of her sons, Kamose and Ahmose I, at the end of the seventeenth dynasty and the beginning of Hatshepsut's own eighteenth dynasty. Amenhotep I, also preceding Hatshepsut in the eighteenth dynasty, probably came to power while a young child and his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari, is thought to have been a regent for him.[28] Other women whose possible reigns as pharaohs are under study include Akhenaten's possible female co-regent/successor (usually identified as either Nefertiti or Meritaten) and Twosre. Among the later, non-indigenous Egyptian dynasties, the most notable example of another woman who became pharaoh was Cleopatra VII, the last pharaoh of Ancient Egypt. Perhaps in an effort to ease anxiety over the prospect of a female pharaoh, Hatshepsut claimed a divine right to rule based on the authority of the god Amun.[29]\\r\\nIn comparison with other female pharaohs, Hatshepsut's reign was much longer and more prosperous. She was successful in warfare early in her reign, but generally is considered to be a pharaoh who inaugurated a long peaceful era. She re-established international trading relationships lost during a foreign occupation and brought great wealth to Egypt. That wealth enabled Hatshepsut to initiate building projects that raised the calibre of Ancient Egyptian architecture to a standard, comparable to classical architecture, that would not be rivaled by any other culture for a thousand years. She managed to rule for about 20 years. One of the most famous things that she did was build Hatshepsut's temple (see above).\\r\\nHyperbole is common to virtually all royal inscriptions of Egyptian history. While all ancient leaders used it to laud their achievements, Hatshepsut has been called the most accomplished pharaoh at promoting her accomplishments.[30] This may have resulted from the extensive building executed during her time as pharaoh, in comparison with many others. It afforded her many opportunities to laud herself, but it also reflected the wealth that her policies and administration brought to Egypt, enabling her to finance such projects. Aggrandizement of their achievements was traditional when pharaohs built temples and their tombs.\\r\\nWomen had a relatively high status in ancient Egypt and enjoyed the legal right to own, inherit, or will property. A woman becoming pharaoh was rare, however; only Sobekneferu, Khentkaus I and possibly Nitocris preceded her.[31] The existence of this last ruler is disputed and is probably a mis-translation of a male king. Nefernferuaten and Twosret may have been the only women to succeed her among the indigenous rulers. In Egyptian history, there was no word for a \\"queen regnant\\" as in contemporary history, \\"king\\" being the Ancient Egyptian title regardless of gender, and by the time of her reign, pharaoh had become the name for the ruler. Hatshepsut is not unique, however, in taking the title of king. Sobekneferu, ruling six dynasties prior to Hatshepsut, also did so when she ruled Egypt. Hatshepsut had been well trained in her duties as the daughter of the pharaoh. During her father's reign she held the powerful office of God's Wife. She had taken a strong role as queen to her husband and was well experienced in the administration of her kingdom by the time she became pharaoh. There is no indication of challenges to her leadership and, until her death, her co-regent remained in a secondary role, quite amicably heading her powerful armywhich would have given him the power necessary to overthrow a usurper of his rightful place, if that had been the case.\\r\\nHatshepsut assumed all of the regalia and symbols of the pharaonic office in official representations: the Khat head cloth, topped with the uraeus, the traditional false beard, and shendyt kilt.[30] Many existing statues alternatively show her in typically feminine attire as well as those that depict her in the royal ceremonial attire. Statues portraying Sobekneferu also combine elements of traditional male and female iconography and, by tradition, may have served as inspiration for these works commissioned by Hatshepsut.[32] After this period of transition ended, however, most formal depictions of Hatshepsut as pharaoh showed her in the royal attire, with all of the pharaonic regalia.\\r\\nAt her mortuary temple, in Osirian statues that regaled the transportation of the pharaoh to the world of the dead, the symbols of the pharaoh as the deity Osiris were the reason for the attire and they were much more important to be displayed traditionally, her breasts are obscured behind her crossed arms holding the regal staffs of the two kingdoms she ruled. This became a pointed concern among writers who sought reasons for the generic style of the shrouded statues and led to misinterpretations. Understanding of the religious symbolism was required to interpret the statues correctly. Interpretations by these early scholars varied and often, were baseless conjectures of their own contemporary values. The possible reasons for her breasts not being emphasized in the most formal statues were debated among some early Egyptologists, who failed to understand the ritual religious symbolism, to take into account the fact that many women and goddesses portrayed in ancient Egyptian art often lack delineation of breasts, and that the physical aspect of the gender of pharaohs was never stressed in the art. With few exceptions, subjects were idealized.\\r\\nModern scholars, however, have theorized that by assuming the typical symbols of pharaonic power, Hatshepsut was asserting her claim to be the sovereign rather than a \\"King's Great Wife\\" or queen consort. The gender of pharaohs was never stressed in official depictions; even the men were depicted with the highly stylized false beard associated with their position in the society.\\r\\nMoreover, the Osirian statues of Hatshepsutas with other pharaohsdepict the dead pharaoh as Osiris, with the body and regalia of that deity. All of the statues of Hatshepsut at her tomb follow that tradition. The promise of resurrection after death was a tenet of the cult of Osiris. Since many statues of Hatshepsut depicted in this fashion have been put on display in museums and those images have been widely published, viewers who lack an understanding of the religious significance of these depictions have been misled. Aside from the face depicting Hatshepsut, these statues closely resemble those of other kings as Osiris, following religious traditions.\\r\\nMost of the official statues commissioned of Hatshepsut show her less symbolically and more naturally, as a woman in typical dresses of the nobility of her day. Notably, even after assuming the formal regalia, Hatshepsut still described herself as a beautiful woman, often as the most beautiful of women, and although she assumed almost all of her father's titles, she declined to take the title \\"The Strong Bull\\" (the full title being, The Strong Bull of his Mother), which tied the pharaoh to the goddesses Isis, the throne, and Hathor, (the cow who gave birth to and protected the pharaohs)by being her son sitting on her thronean unnecessary title for her, since Hatshepsut became allied with the goddesses, herself, which no male pharaoh could. Rather than the strong bull, Hatshepsut, having served as a very successful warrior during the early portion of her reign as pharaoh, associated herself with the lioness image of Sekhmet, the major war deity in the Egyptian pantheon.\\r\\nReligious concepts were tied into all of these symbols and titles. By the time of Hatshepsut's reign, the merger of some aspects of these two goddesses provided that they would both have given birth to, and were the protectors of, the pharaohs. They became interchangeable at times. Hatshepsut also traced her lineage to Mut, a primal mother goddess of the Egyptian pantheon, which gave her another ancestor who was a deity as well as her father and grandfathers, pharaohs who would have become deified upon death.\\r\\nWhile Hatshepsut was depicted in official art wearing regalia of a pharaoh, such as the false beard that male pharaohs also wore, it is most unlikely that she ever wore such ceremonial decorations, just as it is unlikely that the male pharaohs did. Statues such as those at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, depicting her seated wearing a tight-fitting dress and the nemes crown, are thought to be a more accurate representation of how she would have presented herself at court.[33]\\r\\nAs a notable exception, only one male pharaoh abandoned the rigid symbolic depiction that had become the style of the most official artwork representing the ruler, Pharaoh Amenhotep IV (later Akhenaten) of the same eighteenth dynasty, whose wife, Nefertiti, also may have ruled in her own right following the death of her husband.\\r\\nOne of the most famous examples of the legends about Hatshepsut is a myth about her birth. In this myth, Amun goes to Ahmose in the form of Thutmose I and awakens her with pleasant odors. At this point Amun places the ankh, a symbol of life, to Ahmose's nose, and Hatshepsut is conceived by Ahmose. Khnum, the god who forms the bodies of human children, is then instructed to create a body and ka, or corporal presence/life force, for Hatshepsut. Heket, the goddess of life and fertility, and Khnum then lead Ahmose along to a lioness' bed where she gives birth to Hatshepsut. Reliefs depicting each step in these events are at Karnak and in her mortuary temple.\\r\\nThe Oracle of Amun proclaimed that it was the will of Amun that Hatshepsut be pharaoh, further strengthening her position. She reiterated Amun's support by having these proclamations by the god Amun carved on her monuments:\\r\\nWelcome my sweet daughter, my favorite, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare, Hatshepsut. Thou art the Pharaoh, taking possession of the Two Lands.[34]\\r\\nHatshepsut claimed that she was her father's intended heir and that he made her the heir apparent of Egypt. Almost all scholars today view this as historical revisionism, or prolepsis, on Hatshepsut's part since it was Thutmose IIa son of Thutmose I by Mutnofretwho was her father's heir. Moreover, Thutmose I could not have foreseen that his daughter Hatshepsut would outlive his son within his own lifetime. Thutmose II soon married Hatshepsut and the latter became both his senior royal wife and the most powerful woman at court. Biographer Evelyn Wells, however, accepts Hatshepsut's claim that she was her father's intended successor. Once she became pharaoh herself, Hatshepsut supported her assertion that she was her father's designated successor with inscriptions on the walls of her mortuary temple:\\r\\nThen his majesty said to them: \\"This daughter of mine, Khnumetamun Hatshepsutmay she live!I have appointed as my successor upon my throne... she shall direct the people in every sphere of the palace; it is she indeed who shall lead you. Obey her words, unite yourselves at her command.\\" The royal nobles, the dignitaries, and the leaders of the people heard this proclamation of the promotion of his daughter, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkaremay she live eternally.[35]\\r\\nAmerican humorist Will Cuppy wrote an essay on Hatshepsut which was published after his death in the book The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody. Regarding one of her wall inscriptions, he wrote,\\r\\nFor a general notion of Hatshepsut's appearance at a certain stage of her career, we are indebted to one of those wall inscriptions. It states that \\"to look upon her was more beautiful than anything; her splendor and her form were divine.\\" Some have thought it odd that the female Pharaoh should have been so bold, fiftyish as she was. Not at all. She was merely saying how things were about thirty-five years back, before she had married Thutmose II and slugged it out with Thutmose III. \\"She was a maiden, beautiful and blooming\\", the hieroglyphics run, and we have no reason to doubt it. Surely there is no harm in telling the world how one looked in 1515 BCE.[36]\\r\\nHatshepsut died as she was approaching what we would consider middle age given typical contemporary lifespans, in her twenty-second regnal year.[37] The precise date of Hatshepsut's deathand the time when Thutmose III became the next pharaoh of Egyptis considered to be Year 22, II Peret day 10 of her reign, as recorded on a single stela erected at Armant[38] or January 16, 1458 BC.[39] This information validates the basic reliability of Manetho's kinglist records since Hatshepsut's known accession date was I Shemu day 4[40] (i.e.: Hatshepsut died nine months into her 22nd year as king, as Manetho writes in his Epitome for a reign of 21 years and nine months). No contemporary mention of the cause of her death has survived. If the recent identification of her mummy is correct, however, the medical evidence would indicate that she suffered from diabetes and died from bone cancer which had spread throughout her body while she was in her fifties.[3][41] It also would suggest that she had arthritis and bad teeth.[3]\\r\\nHatshepsut had begun construction of a tomb when she was the Great Royal Wife of Thutmose II, but the scale of this was not suitable for a pharaoh, so when she ascended the throne, preparation for another burial started. For this, KV20, originally quarried for her father, Thutmose I, and probably the first royal tomb in the Valley of the Kings, was extended with a new burial chamber. Hatshepsut also refurbished the burial of her father and prepared for a double interment of both Thutmose I and her within KV20. It is likely, therefore, that when she died (no later than the twenty-second year of her reign), she was interred in this tomb along with her father.[42] During the reign of Thutmose III, however, a new tomb, (KV38), together with new burial equipment was provided for Thutmose I, who then was removed from his original tomb and re-interred elsewhere. At the same time Hatshepsut's mummy might have been moved into the tomb of her nurse, Sitre In, in KV60. It is possible that Amenhotep II, son to Thutmose III by a secondary wife, was the one motivating these actions in an attempt to assure his own uncertain right to succession. Besides what was recovered from KV20 during Howard Carter's clearance of the tomb in 1903, other funerary furniture belonging to Hatshepsut has been found elsewhere, including a lioness \\"throne\\" (bedstead is a better description), a senet game board with carved lioness-headed, red-jasper game pieces bearing her pharaonic title, a signet ring, and a partial shabti figurine bearing her name. In the Royal Mummy Cache at DB320, a wooden canopic box with an ivory knob was found that was inscribed with the name of Hatshepsut and contained a mummified liver or spleen as well as a molar tooth. There was a royal lady of the twenty-first dynasty of the same name, however, and for a while it was thought possible that it could have belonged to her instead.[43]\\r\\nIn 1903, Howard Carter had discovered a tomb (KV60) in the Valley of the Kings that contained two female mummies, one identified as Hatshepsut's wetnurse, and the other unidentified. In the spring of 2007, the unidentified body was finally removed from the tomb by Dr. Zahi Hawass and brought to Cairo's Egyptian Museum for testing. This mummy was missing a tooth, and the space in the jaw perfectly matched Hatshepsut's existing molar, found in the DB320 \\"canopic box\\".[44][45] Her death has since been attributed to a carcinogenic skin lotion found in possession of the Pharaoh, which led to her having bone cancer. \\"There is a lot that speaks for this hypothesis,\\" according to Helmut Wiedenfeld of the University of Bonn's pharmaceutical institute. \\"If you imagine that the queen had a chronic skin disease and that she found short-term improvement from the salve, she may have exposed herself to a great risk over the years.\\"[46]\\r\\nToward the end of the reign of Thutmose III and into the reign of his son, an attempt was made to remove Hatshepsut from certain historical and pharaonic records. This elimination was carried out in the most literal way possible. Her cartouches and images were chiselled off some stone walls, leaving very obvious Hatshepsut-shaped gaps in the artwork.\\r\\nAt the Deir el-Bahari temple, Hatshepsut's numerous statues were torn down and in many cases, smashed or disfigured before being buried in a pit. At Karnak, there even was an attempt to wall up her obelisks. While it is clear that much of this rewriting of Hatshepsut's history occurred only during the close of Thutmose III's reign, it is not clear why it happened, other than the typical pattern of self-promotion that existed among the pharaohs and their administrators, or perhaps saving money by not building new monuments for the burial of Thutmose III and instead, using the grand structures built by Hatshepsut.\\r\\nAmenhotep II, the son of Thutmose III, who became a co-regent toward the end of his father's reign, is suspected by some as being the defacer during the end of the reign of a very old pharaoh. He would have had a motive because his position in the royal lineage was not so strong as to assure his elevation to pharaoh. He is documented, further, as having usurped many of Hatshepsut's accomplishments during his own reign. His reign is marked with attempts to break the royal lineage as well, not recording the names of his queens and eliminating the powerful titles and official roles of royal women, such as God's Wife of Amun.[47]\\r\\nFor many years, presuming that it was Thutmose III acting out of resentment once he became pharaoh, early modern Egyptologists presumed that the erasures were similar to the Roman damnatio memoriae. This appeared to make sense when thinking that Thutmose might have been an unwilling co-regent for years. This assessment of the situation probably is too simplistic, however. It is highly unlikely that the determined and focused Thutmosenot only Egypt's most successful general, but an acclaimed athlete, author, historian, botanist, and architectwould have brooded for two decades of his own reign before attempting to avenge himself on his stepmother and aunt. According to renowned Egyptologist Donald Redford:\\r\\nHere and there, in the dark recesses of a shrine or tomb where no plebeian eye could see, the queen's cartouche and figure were left intact ... which never vulgar eye would again behold, still conveyed for the king the warmth and awe of a divine presence.[48]\\r\\nThe erasures were sporadic and haphazard, with only the more visible and accessible images of Hatshepsut being removed; had it been more complete, we would not now have so many images of Hatshepsut. Thutmose III may have died before these changes were finished and it may be that he never intended a total obliteration of her memory. In fact, we have no evidence to support the assumption that Thutmose hated or resented Hatshepsut during her lifetime. Had that been true, as head of the army, in a position given to him by Hatshepsut (who was clearly not worried about her co-regent's loyalty), he surely could have led a successful coup, but he made no attempt to challenge her authority during her reign and, her accomplishments and images remained featured on all of the public buildings she built for twenty years after her death.\\r\\nWriters such as Joyce Tyldesley hypothesized that it is possible that Thutmose III, lacking any sinister motivation, may have decided toward the end of his life, to relegate Hatshepsut to her expected place as the regentwhich was the traditional role of powerful women in Egypt's court as the example of Queen Ahhotep attestsrather than king. Tyldesley fashions her concept as, that by eliminating the more obvious traces of Hatshepsut's monuments as pharaoh and reducing her status to that of his co-regent, Thutmose III could claim that the royal succession ran directly from Thutmose II to Thutmose III without any interference from his aunt.\\r\\nThe deliberate erasures or mutilations of the numerous public celebrations of her accomplishments, but not the rarely seen ones, would be all that was necessary to obscure Hatshepsut's accomplishments. Moreover, by the latter half of Thutmose III's reign, the more prominent high officials who had served Hatshepsut would have died, thereby eliminating the powerful religious and bureaucratic resistance to a change in direction in a highly stratified culture. Hatshepsut's highest official and closest supporter, Senenmut, seems either to have retired abruptly or died around Years 16 and 20 of Hatshepsut's reign and, was never interred in either of his carefully prepared tombs.[49] According to Tyldesley, the enigma of Senenmut's sudden disappearance \\"teased Egyptologists for decades\\" given the lack of solid archaeological or textual evidence\\" and permitted \\"the vivid imagination of Senenmut-scholars to run wild\\" resulting in a variety of strongly held solutions \\"some of which would do credit to any fictional murder/mystery plot.\\"[50] In such a scenario, newer court officials, appointed by Thutmose III, also would have had an interest in promoting the many achievements of their master in order to assure the continued success of their own families.\\r\\nPresuming that it was Thutmose III (rather than his co-regent son), Tyldesley also put forth a hypothesis about Thutmose suggesting that his erasures and defacement of Hatshepsut's monuments could have been a cold, but rational attempt on his part to extinguish the memory of an \\"unconventional female king whose reign might possibly be interpreted by future generations as a grave offence against Ma'at, and whose unorthodox coregency\\" could \\"cast serious doubt upon the legitimacy of his own right to rule. Hatshepsut's crime need not be anything more than the fact that she was a woman.\\"[51] Tyldesley conjectured that Thutmose III may have considered the possibility that the example of a successful female king in Egyptian history could demonstrate that a woman was as capable at governing Egypt as a traditional male king, which could persuade \\"future generations of potentially strong female kings\\" to not \\"remain content with their traditional lot as wife, sister and eventual mother of a king\\" and assume the crown.[52] Dismissing relatively recent history known to Thutmose III of another woman who was king, Sobekneferu of Egypt's Middle Kingdom, she conjectured further that he might have thought that while she had enjoyed a short, approximately four-year reign, she ruled \\"at the very end of a fading [12th dynasty] Dynasty, and from the very start of her reign the odds had been stacked against her. She was, therefore, acceptable to conservative Egyptians as a patriotic 'Warrior Queen' who had failed\\" to rejuvenate Egypt's fortunes.[2] In contrast, Hatshepsut's glorious reign was a completely different case: she demonstrated that women were as capable as men of ruling the two lands since she successfully presided over a prosperous Egypt for more than two decades.[2] If Thutmose III's intent was to forestall the possibility of a woman assuming the throne, as proposed by Tyldesley, it was a failure since Twosret and Neferneferuaten (possibly), a female co-regent or successor of Akhenaten, assumed the throne for short reigns as pharaoh later in the New Kingdom.\\r\\nThe erasure of Hatshepsut's namewhatever the reason or the person ordering italmost caused her to disappear from Egypt's archaeological and written records. When nineteenth-century Egyptologists started to interpret the texts on the Deir el-Bahri temple walls (which were illustrated with two seemingly male kings) their translations made no sense. Jean-Fran?ois Champollion, the French decoder of hieroglyphs, was not alone in feeling confused by the obvious conflict between words and pictures:\\r\\nIf I felt somewhat surprised at seeing here, as elsewhere throughout the temple, the renowned Moeris [Thutmose III], adorned with all the insignia of royalty, giving place to this Amenenthe [Hatshepsut], for whose name we may search the royal lists in vain, still more astonished was I to find upon reading the inscriptions that wherever they referred to this bearded king in the usual dress of the Pharaohs, nouns and verbs were in the feminine, as though a queen were in question. I found the same peculiarity everywhere...[53]\\r\\nThe \\"Hatshepsut Problem\\" was a major issue in late 19th century and early 20th century Egyptology, centering on confusion and disagreement on the order of succession of early 18th dynasty pharaohs. The dilemma takes its name from confusion over the chronology of the rule of Queen Hatshepsut and Thutmose I, II, and III.[54] In its day, the problem was controversial enough to cause academic feuds between leading Egyptologists and created perceptions about the early Thutmosid family that persisted well into the 20th century, the influence of which still can be found in more recent works. Chronology-wise, the Hatshepsut problem was largely cleared up in the late 20th century, as more information about her and her reign was uncovered.\\r\\nThe 2006 discovery of a foundation deposit including nine golden cartouches bearing the names of both Hatshepsut and Thutmose III in Karnak may shed additional light on the eventual attempt by Thutmose III and his son Amenhotep II to erase Hatshepsut from the historical record and the correct nature of their relationships and her role as pharaoh.[55]\\r\\nSphinx of Hatshepsut with unusual rounded ears and ruff that stress the lioness features of the statue, but with five toes - newel post decorations from the lower ramp of her tomb complex\\r\\nThese two statues once resembled each other, however, the symbols of her pharaonic power: the Uraeus, Double Crown, and traditional false beard have been stripped from the left image; many images portraying Hatshepsut were destroyed or vandalized within decades of her death, possibly by Amenhotep II at the end of the reign of Thutmose III, while he was his co-regent, in order to assure his own rise to pharaoh and then, to claim many of her accomplishments as his.\\r\\nThe image of Hatshepsut has been deliberately chipped away and removed - Ancient Egyptian wing of the Royal Ontario Museum\\r\\nDual stela of Hatshepsut (centre left) in the blue Khepresh crown offering wine to the deity Amun and Thutmose III behind her in the hedjet white crown, standing near Wosret - Vatican Museum\\r\\nHieroglyphs showing Thutmose III on the left and Hatshepsut on the right, she having the trappings of the greater role?

It originally aired from October 17, 2012 to January 23, 2013. The premise of the second season marked a departure from that of the series's first season, featuring all new characters and a new location, thus marking American Horror Story as an anthology series at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season begins in 1964 at the fictional mental institution, Briarcliff Manor, following the stories of the staff and inmates who occupy it, and intercuts with events in the past and present. Returning cast members from the previous season of the series include: Zachary Quinto, Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Lily Rabe, Jessica Lange, Dylan McDermott, and Frances Conroy, along with new cast members Joseph Fiennes, Lizzie Brocher, and James Cromwell.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike its predecessor, Asylum was well received by television critics and fans, though they noted numerous plot holes and inconsistencies. The performances of Jessica Lange, James Cromwell, Zachary Quinto, Sarah Paulson, and Lily Rabe were particularly praised. The season garnered seventeen Primetime Emmy Award nominations, more than any other show, including Outstanding Miniseries or Movie and four acting nominations for Lange, Paulson, Cromwell, and Quinto, with Cromwell winning for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie. In addition, Quinto and Paulson won their respective supporting categories at the 3rd Critics' Choice Television Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite being formerly anthological, some of the cast members reprise their roles in the series's fourth and sixth cycle, Freak Show and Roanoke, such as: Lily Rabe, Naomi Grossman, Sarah Paulson, and James Cromwell, portraying Sister Mary Eunice McKee, Pepper, Lana Winters, and a young version of Dr. Arthur Arden, also known as Hans Grper, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1964, at Briarcliff Mental Institution in Massachusetts, Sister Jude Martin (Jessica Lange) and Sister Mary Eunice McKee (Lily Rabe) maintain the institution that was founded by Monsignor Timothy Howard (Joseph Fiennes) to treat and house the mentally and criminally insane. Psychiatrist Dr. Oliver Thredson (Zachary Quinto), and scientist Dr. Arthur Arden (James Cromwell), treat the patients within the facility, which include lesbian journalist Lana Winters (Sarah Paulson), accused serial killer Kit Walker (Evan Peters), and alleged murderer Grace Bertrand (Lizzie Brocher).\\r\\n\\r\\nSister Jude was once a philandering nightclub singer who unintentionally struck and seemingly killed a young girl in a drunk-driving hit and run accident in 1949, leading to her becoming a nun and being selected to work at Briarcliff. Sister Jude is terrorized by the memory and goes to see the family of the girl, only to learn that the girl survived the accident with only a few broken bones. She figures that God had a plan for her all along, and decides that it is her job to destroy all the remaining evil at Briarcliff. Sister Mary Eunice is a shy and innocent nun who fears Sister Jude, and becomes possessed by the Devil during an exorcism of another patient, becoming cruel and willful.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Arden is a former Nazi whose experiments have produced \\"Raspers\\", mutated former patients, who lurk in the woods surrounding the institution, and who are fed the flesh of dead patients. Dr. Thredson is assigned to evaluate Kit, who is accused of being the infamous serial killer 'Bloody Face' and believes his wife Alma (Britne Oldford) was abducted by aliens. Thredson also tries to \\"reform\\" Lana, who was an ambitious journalist attempting to expose Briarcliff's mistreatments of patients. She was in a relationship with Wendy (Clea Duvall), who was blackmailed by Sister Jude into committing Winters, before being killed by Bloody Face. Thredson helps Lana escape from the asylum, but she learns that Thredson is actually Bloody Face, and is kept prisoner. He rapes her and tries to kill her, but she manages to escape, only to end up back at Briarcliff. She later learns she is pregnant with Thredson's baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, believing his wife is dead or missing, Kit has taken up with inmate Grace Bertrand, who has murdered her family as her father was sexually abusive towards her and her stepmother ignored it. Kit is arrested after Thredson hands in a taped confession, which he got by tricking Kit into confessing. Kit and Grace are taken to be sterilised after the pair are caught having sex. However, she is abducted by aliens and is later returned at an advanced stage of pregnancy and ready to give birth. Kit escapes custody and returns to Briarcliff, where he blackmails the Monsignor into letting Grace, himself, and their baby go. The three arrive at his old home to find his wife Alma, alive and with her own baby. The possessed Sister Mary Eunice, with the help of Dr. Arden, has Sister Jude deposed and committed, and takes over Briarcliff. Monsignor Howard tries to exorcise her but instead is sexually assaulted by her. Out of options, Howard kills her by throwing her off the third floor balcony, and Dr. Arden, having become loyal to Mary Eunice, cremates her while immolating himself. Lana successfully captures a confession from Dr. Thredson, but decides to confront him in his house to say she has turned the tape over to the police. He states that because he is insane, no jury will convict him and that she will be his last victim. As he reaches for a hidden gun, Lana shoots him in the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the present, Lana has become a famous television investigative reporter and gets Briarcliff closed down for its inhumane treatments. Lana reveals that Monsignor Howard committed suicide after she threatened to expose his neglect of the patients, and that Kit took in Sister Jude after Alma was committed to Briarcliff for killing Grace. Jude spends her remaining years bonding with Kit's children, before dying, leaving the family devastated. Kit also develops pancreatic cancer and is abducted by the aliens again. Lana and Thredson's grown son, Johnny (Dylan McDermott), has vowed vengeance against her, angry at being rejected as a baby and wanting to finish his father's work. He confronts her at her house, where she ultimately convinces him that he is not like his father, before taking his gun and shooting him in the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nÿ Executive producer Ryan Murphy on American Horror Story's second season.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2011, the FX Network renewed the series for a second season. In December 2011, series co-creator Ryan Murphy announced his plans to change the characters and location for the second season.[15] He did say, however, that some actors who starred in the first season would be returning. \\"The people that are coming back will be playing completely different characters, creatures, monsters, etc. [The Harmons'] stories are done. People who are coming back will be playing entirely new characters,\\" he announced.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2012, Murphy revealed that the setting for the second season will be an institution for the criminally insane that Jessica Lange's character operates in the 1960s,[16] called Briarcliff Manor and located on the East Coast.[17] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy spoke about originally wanting to set the season in a prison, \\"I think at one point as we were spitballing season two before we landed on the asylum idea, we had actually talked about doing the second season in a prison but then Alcatraz came along and stole that idea. It was never very definitive but I always liked that idea. I think an insane asylum for us was probably much more effective.\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nTalking about the season, Murphy commented, \\"It's a completely different world and has nothing to do with season 1; there's not a mention of season 1... The second season is set in a completely different time period.\\"[19] He later said, \\"Everyone looks so different, people who were enemies last year are allies this year. The sets are amazing. It's 1964, so everything looks very different.\\"[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nÿ Co-creator Brad Falchuk on the second season[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy had also told TV Guide that there would not be any ghosts in the second season, \\"I think the story is horrifying,\\" he said. \\"The story is a period piece in a mental institution based largely on truth and truth is always scarier than fiction.\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2012, Murphy announced the season's new name by stating, \\"We picked 'Asylum' because it not only describes the setting ÿ an insane asylum run by Jessica Lange's character which was formerly a tuberculosis ward ÿ but also signifies a place of haven for the unloved and the unwanted,\\" he said. \\"This year's theme is about sanity and tackling real life horrors.\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevious consulting producer Tim Minear was promoted to executive producer and continued writing for the series, beginning with the season premiere.[23] He also scripted the season finale.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2012, Murphy revealed that the second season had been conceptualized around Jessica Lange, saying, \\"This will really be the Jessica Lange show so I'm very excited about it. We are designing this amazing new opposite of the Constance character for her. She and I have spoken about different things. She has a lot of ideas, and has a lot of input into her character. She told me some things she has always wanted to play as an actress.\\"[24] She portrayed Sister Jude, an apparent sadistic nun. Zachary Quinto, who had a recurring role as Chad in the first season, was confirmed as one of the leads in March 2012.[25] He portrayed Dr. Oliver Thredson, a psychiatrist with groundbreaking treatment methods that go against Sister Jude's. Comparing his new character to his previous one, Quinto said, \\"He's much more grounded and in control.\\"[26] At the PaleyFest 2012, Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, and Lily Rabe were confirmed to return as main cast members for the second season.[27] Paulson portrayed Lana Winters, a lesbian reporter whose girlfriend is coerced by Sister Jude into having her committed to the asylum, Rabe portrayed Sister Mary Eunice, an innocent and loyal second-in-charge to Sister Jude, and Peters portrayed Kit Walker, a man who's accused of murdering his wife, Alma (Britne Oldford), but he claims she was abducted by aliens. Murphy had stated that Peters, \\"who was last season's ultimate badass bad boy\\", would be the hero of the show this season.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was reported in March 2012 that Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine was in final negotiations to appear in the second season, and that he would play Leo, a \\"contemporary character and half of a couple called \\"The Lovers,\\" according to Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly.[28] Levine revealed to E! in June 2012 that his character is \\"newly married\\" and would go with his wife on their honeymoon. \\"I don't want to tell you too much... but it's gory.\\"[29] Jenna Dewan-Tatum played his wife, Teresa.[30] In April 2012, Lizzie Brocher was cast to play Grace, a character described originally as \\"a fierce, ferocious, extremely sexual, and dangerous wild-child sexpot\\" to rival Jessica Lange's character, but the role was later heavily revamped.[31] In May 2012, James Cromwell signed on to co-star as Dr. Arthur Arden, a man who works in the asylum,[32] and who is revealed to have been a Nazi. Chlo? Sevigny played the role of Shelley, a nymphomaniac whose husband has her placed in the asylum.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2012, actor Joseph Fiennes joined the main cast as Monsignor Timothy Howard, a possible love interest for Jessica Lange's Sister Jude.[34] Later that month, Chris Zylka was cast to play Daniel, who was touted as \\"the most beautiful boy in the world and a deaf mute\\";[35] however, Zylka was later replaced by an unmentioned actor, due to his reluctance to shave his head for the role.[36] Britne Oldford was cast in the recurring role of Alma, Peters' character's supposed dead/missing wife.[37] In July 2012, Mark Consuelos was cast as a patient named Spivey, who was described as a degenerate bully.[38] Also in July, Clea DuVall was cast as Wendy, a school teacher and Lana's girlfriend,[39] and Franka Potente was cast in an unspecified role, which was later revealed to be Anne Frank / Charlotte Brown.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2012, Blake Sheldon was cast in the dual role of Devon and Cooper, both described as \\"tall, thin and psychopathic.\\" Ultimately Sheldon wound up portraying only Cooper.[41] Season one alum Frances Conroy guest starred as Shachath, the Angel of Death. Eric Stonestreet was scheduled to guest star again, this season as a killer, but the appearance never came to fruition.[42] Mark Margolis recurred as Sam Goodwin, while David Chisum and Amy Farrington guest starred as a caring husband and a troubled mother, respectively.[43] In mid-October, Ian McShane joined the season in the recurring role of Leigh Emerson, a psychotic man who murders people while wearing a Santa Claus suit; he has a vendetta against Sister Jude.[44] Former series co-star Dylan McDermott appeared during the second half of the season as Johnny Morgan, the modern day Bloody Face.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipal photography for the second season began on July 17, 2012.[24] The exteriors for the second season were filmed in Hidden Valley, Ventura County, California, a rural area outside Los Angeles.[45] The exterior filming of Briarcliff was done at the old Orange County courthouse.[46] Series production designer Mark Worthington stated, \\"It's referred to as Richardsonian and Romanesque. It's named after an architect named Henry Hobson Richardson. He developed the style in the 19th century. It's circular arches, heavy stone. It's creepy, great for horror. It's dark, dark shiny brick. That's how we got away from all the hospital light stuff. There's still an institutional feel to it.\\"[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Horror Story: Asylum has received generally positive reviews from critics and scored 65 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 23 reviews.[48] The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 84% approval rating with an average rating of 7.27/10 based on 43 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"American Horror Story: Asylum crosses boundaries to shock and scare with sexy subplots and some innovative takes on current social issues.\\"[49] James Poniewozik, from Time, said of the early episodes of the second season, \\"AHS: Asylum feels like a more focused, if equally frenetic, screamfest. It's also gorgeously realized, with a vision of its '60s institution setting so detailed you can smell the stale air and incense.\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaureen Ryan of The Huffington Post said, \\"It's to the credit of Asylum's writers, directors and cast that the emotional pain of the characters often feels as real as their uncertainty and terror.\\"[51] However, Verne Gay of Newsday gave the season a C grade, writing that it \\"has some good special effects, just not much of a story to hang them on.\\"[52] Linda Stasi of the New York Post thought this season was \\"over the top\\", stating, \\"I need to enter [an asylum] myself after two hours of this craziness.\\"[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a round-up of outstanding entertainers and programs of 2012, Jess Cagle of Entertainment Weekly praised \\"its ballsy, go-for-broke, don't-tax-the-attention-span-of-any-gnats-who-might-be-watching approach\\", writing, \\"You know a show has a lot going on when the occasional appearance of extraterrestrials is no more surprising than spotting a Prius on Modern Family.

It is part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services with facilities mainly located in Bethesda, Maryland. It conducts its own scientific research through its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2013[update], the IRP had 1,200 principal investigators and more than 4,000 postdoctoral fellows in basic, translational, and clinical research, being the largest biomedical research institution in the world,[4] while, as of 2003, the extramural arm provided 28% of biomedical research funding spent annually in the U.S., or about US$26.4 billion.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NIH comprises 27 separate institutes and centers of different biomedical disciplines and is responsible for many scientific accomplishments, including the discovery of fluoride to prevent tooth decay, the use of lithium to manage bipolar disorder, and the creation of vaccines against hepatitis, Haemophilus influenzae (HIB), and human papillomavirus (HPV).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nNIH's roots extend back to a Marine Hospital Service in the late 1790s that provided medical relief to sick and disabled men in the U.S. Navy. By 1870, a network of marine hospitals had developed and was placed under the charge of a medical officer within the Bureau of the Treasury Department. In the late 1870s, Congress allocated funds to investigate the causes of epidemics like cholera and yellow fever, and it created the National Board of Health, making medical research an official government initiative.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1887, a laboratory for the study of bacteria, the Hygienic Laboratory, was established at the Marine Hospital in New York.[9][10] In the early 1900s, Congress began appropriating funds for the Marine Hospital Service. By 1922, this organization changed its name to Public Health Services and established a Special Cancer Investigations laboratory at Harvard Medical School. This marked the beginning of a partnership with universities. In 1930, the Hygienic Laboratory was re-designated as the National Institute of Health by the Ransdell Act, and was given $750,000 to construct two NIH buildings. Over the next few decades, Congress would increase funding tremendously to the NIH, and various institutes and centers within the NIH were created for specific research programs.[11] In 1944, the Public Health Service Act was approved, and the National Cancer Institute became a division of NIH. In 1948, the name changed from National Institute of Health to National Institutes of Health.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s, virologist and cancer researcher Chester M. Southam injected HeLa cancer cells into patients at the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital.[12]:130 When three doctors resigned after refusing to inject patients without their consent, the experiment gained considerable media attention.[12]:133 The NIH was a major source of funding for Southams research and had required all research involving human subjects to obtain their consent prior to any experimentation.[12]:135 Upon investigating all of their grantee institutions, the NIH discovered that the majority of them did not protect the rights of human subjects. From then on, the NIH has required all grantee institutions to approve any research proposals involving human experimentation with review boards.[12]:135\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1967, the Division of Regional Medical Programs was created to administer grants for research for heart disease, cancer, and strokes. That same year, the NIH director lobbied the White House for increased federal funding in order to increase research and the speed with which health benefits could be brought to the people. An advisory committee was formed to oversee further development of the NIH and its research programs. By 1971 cancer research was in full force and President Nixon signed the National Cancer Act, initiating a National Cancer Program, President's Cancer Panel, National Cancer Advisory Board, and 15 new research, training, and demonstration centers.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nFunding for the NIH has often been a source of contention in Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. In 1992, the NIH encompassed nearly 1 percent of the federal government's operating budget and controlled more than 50 percent of all funding for health research, and 85 percent of all funding for health studies in universities.[14] While government funding for research in other disciplines has been increasing at a rate similar to inflation since the 1970s, research funding for the NIH nearly tripled through the 1990s and early 2000s, but has remained relatively stagnant since then.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1990s, the NIH committee focus had shifted to DNA research, and launched the Human Genome Project.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIntramural research is primarily conducted at the main campus in Bethesda, Maryland and Rockville, Maryland, and the surrounding communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bayview Campus in Baltimore, Maryland houses the research programs of the National Institute on Aging, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and National Human Genome Research Institute with nearly 1,000 scientists and support staff.[17] The Frederick National Laboratory in Frederick, MD and the nearby Riverside Research Park, houses many components of the National Cancer Institute, including the Center for Cancer Research, Office of Scientific Operations, Management Operations Support Branch, the division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and the division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is located in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther ICs have satellite locations in addition to operations at the main campus.

The institution gives 80% of its funding in research grants to extramural (outside) researchers. Of this extramural funding, a certain percentage (2.8% in 2014) must be granted to small businesses under the SBIR/STTR program.[21]  The extramural funding consists of about 50,000 grants to more than 325,000 researchers at more than 3000 institutions.[22] In FY 2010[update], NIH spent US$10.7bn (not including temporary funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) on clinical research, US$7.4bn on genetics-related research, US$6.0bn on prevention research, US$5.8bn on cancer, and US$5.7bn on biotechnology.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008 a Congressional mandate called for investigators funded by the NIH to submit an electronic version of their final manuscripts to the National Library of Medicine's research repository, PubMed Central (PMC), no later than 12 months after the official date of publication.[24]  The NIH Public Access Policy was the first public access mandate for a U.S. public funding agency.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 13, 2012, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced a new group of individuals assigned to research pain. This committee is composed of researchers from different organizations and will focus to \\"coordinate pain research activities across the federal government with the goals of stimulating pain research collaboration and providing an important avenue for public involvement\\" (\\"Members of new,\\" 2012). With a committee such as this research will not be conducted by each individual organization or person but instead a collaborating group which will increase the information available. With this hopefully more pain management will be available including techniques for arthritis sufferers.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, the Joint Economic Committee of Congress reported NIH research, which was funded at $16 billion a year in 2000, that some econometric studies had given a rate of return of 25 to 40 percent per year by reducing the economic cost of illness in the US. It found that of the 21 drugs with the highest therapeutic impact on society introduced between 1965 and 1992, public funding was \\"instrumental\\" for 15.[26] As of 2011 NIH-supported research helped to discover 153 new FDA-approved drugs, vaccines, and new indications for drugs in the 40 years prior.[27]  One study found NIH funding aided either directly or indirectly in developing the drugs or drug targets for all of the 210 FDA-approved drugs from 2010 to 2016.[28] In 2015, Pierre Azoulay et al. estimated $10 million invested in research generated two to three new patents.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its inception, the NIH intramural research program has been a source of many pivotal scientific and medical discoveries. Some of these include:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2006, the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research started a contract for the NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function to develop a set of state-of-the-art measurement tools to enhance collection of data in large cohort studies. Scientists from more than 100 institutions nationwide contributed. In September 2012, the NIH Toolbox was rolled out to the research community. NIH Toolbox assessments are based, where possible, on Item Response Theory and adapted for testing by computer.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo allocate funds, the NIH must first obtain its budget from Congress. This process begins with institute and center (IC) leaders collaborating with scientists to determine the most important and promising research areas within their fields. IC leaders discuss research areas with NIH management who then develops a budget request for continuing projects, new research proposals, and new initiatives from the Director. NIH submits its budget request to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the HHS considers this request as a portion of its budget. Many adjustments and appeals occur between NIH and HHS before the agency submits NIH's budget request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  OMB determines what amounts and research areas are approved for incorporation into the President's final budget. The President then sends NIH's budget request to Congress in February for the next fiscal year's allocations.[31]  The House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees deliberate and by fall, Congress usually appropriates funding. This process takes approximately 18 months before the NIH can allocate any actual funds.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the last century, the responsibility to allocate funding has shifted from the OD and Advisory Committee to the individual ICs and Congress increasingly set apart funding for particular causes. In the 1970s, Congress began to earmark funds specifically for cancer research, and in the 1980s there was a significant amount allocated for AIDS/HIV research.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nFunding for the NIH has often been a source of contention in Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. During the 1980s, President Reagan repeatedly tried to cut funding for research, only to see Congress partly restore funding. The political contention over NIH funding slowed the nation's response to the AIDS epidemic; while AIDS was reported in newspaper articles from 1981, no funding was provided for research on the disease. In 1984 National Cancer Institute scientists found implications that \\"variants of a human cancer virus called HTLV-III are the primary cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),\\" a new epidemic that gripped the nation.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, the NIH encompassed nearly 1 percent of the federal government's operating budget and controlled more than 50 percent of all funding for health research, and 85 percent of all funding for health studies in universities.[14] From 1993 to 2001 the NIH budget doubled. Since then, funding essentially remained flat, and during the decade following the financial crisis, the NIH budget struggled to keep up with inflation.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999 Congress increased the NIH's budget by $2.3 billion[33] to $17.2 billion in 2000.[36] In 2009 Congress again increased the NIH budget to $31 billion in 2010.[36] In March 2017, President Trump proposed to cut the 2018 budget by 18.3%, or about $5.8 billion to $25.9 billion.[37]:26\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers at universities or other institutions outside of NIH can apply for research project grants (RPGs) from the NIH. There are numerous funding mechanisms for different project types (e.g., basic research, clinical research etc.) and career stages (e.g., early career, postdoc fellowships etc.). The NIH regularly issues \\"requests for applications\\" (RFAs), e.g., on timely medical problems (such as Zika virus research in early 2016). In addition, researchers can apply for \\"investigator-initiated grants\\" whose subject is determined by the scientist.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total number of applicants has increased substantially, from about 60,000 investigators who had applied during the period from 1999 to 2003 to slightly less than 90,000 in who had applied during the period from 2011 to 2015.[38] Due to this, the \\"cumulative investigator rate,\\" that is, the likelihood that unique investigators are funded over a 5-year window, has declined from 43% to 31%.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nR01 grants are the most common funding mechanism and include investigator-initiated projects. The roughly 27,000 to 29,000 R01 applications had a funding success of 17-19% during 2012 though 2014. Similarly, the 13,000 to 14,000 R21 applications had a funding success of 13-14% during the same period.[39] In FY 2016, the total number of grant applications received by the NIH was 54,220, with approximately 19% being awarded funding.[40] Institutes have varying funding rates. The National Cancer Institute awarded funding to 12% of applicants, while the National Institute for General Medical Science awarded funding to 30% of applicants.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nNIH employs five broad decision criteria in its funding policy. First, ensure the highest quality of scientific research by employing an arduous peer review process. Second, seize opportunities that have the greatest potential to yield new knowledge and that will lead to better prevention and treatment of disease. Third, maintain a diverse research portfolio in order to capitalize on major discoveries in a variety of fields such as cell biology, genetics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Fourth, address public health needs according to the disease burden (e.g., prevalence and mortality). And fifth, construct and support the scientific infrastructure (e.g., well-equipped laboratories and safe research facilities) necessary to conduct research.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvisory committee members advise the Institute on policy and procedures affecting the external research programs and provide a second level of review for all grant and cooperative agreement applications considered by the Institute for funding.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, it was announced that the NIH is directing scientists to perform their experiments with both female and male animals, or cells derived from females as well as males if they are studying cell cultures, and that the NIH would take the balance of each study design into consideration when awarding grants.[43] The announcement also stated that this rule would probably not apply when studying sex-specific diseases (for example, ovarian or testicular cancer).[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a government shutdown occurs, the NIH continues to treat people who are already enrolled in clinical trials, but does not start any new clinical trials and does not admit new patients who are not already enrolled in a clinical trial, except for the most critically ill,[44][45][46] as determined by the NIH Director.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the goals of the NIH is to \\"expand the base in medical and associated sciences in order to ensure a continued high return on the public investment in research.\\"[48]  Taxpayer dollars funding NIH are from the taxpayers, making them the primary beneficiaries of advances in research. Thus, the general public is a key stakeholder in the decisions resulting from the NIH funding policy.[49]  However, some in the general public do not feel their interests are being represented, and individuals have formed patient advocacy groups to represent their own interests.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther important stakeholders of the NIH funding policy are researchers and scientists. Extramural researchers differ from intramural researchers in that they are not employed by the NIH but may apply for funding. Throughout the history of the NIH, the amount of funding received has increased, but the proportion to each IC remains relatively constant. The individual ICs then decide who will receive the grant money and how much will be allotted.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicy changes on who receives funding significantly affects researchers. For example, the NIH has recently attempted to approve more first-time NIH R01 applicants, or the research grant applications of young scientists. To encourage the participation of young scientists, the application process has been shortened and made easier.[51]  In addition, first-time applicants are being offered more funding for their research grants than those who have received grants in the past.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011 and 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General published a series of audit reports revealing that throughout the fiscal years 2000ÿ2010, institutes under the aegis of the NIH did not comply with the time and amount requirements specified in appropriations statutes, in awarding federal contracts to commercial partners, committing the federal government to tens of millions of dollars of expenditure ahead of appropriation of funds from Congress.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NIH is composed of 27 separate institutes and centers (ICs) that conduct and coordinate research across different disciplines of biomedical science. These are:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the National Center for Research Resources operated from April 13, 1962 to December 23, 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 390007N 770614W? / ?39.002N 77.104W? / 39.002; -77.104","input":"Where is the national institute of health located?"},{"output":"Vancouver, British Columbia","context":"\\r\\n21 Jump Street is an American police procedural television series that aired on the Fox network and in first run syndication from April 12, 1987, to April 27, 1991, with a total of 103 episodes. The series focuses on a squad of youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in high schools, colleges, and other teenage venues.[1] It was originally going to be titled Jump Street Chapel, after the deconsecrated church building in which the unit has its headquarters, but was changed at Fox's request so as not to mislead viewers into thinking it was a religious program.\\r\\nCreated by Patrick Hasburgh and Stephen J. Cannell, the series was produced by Patrick Hasburgh Productions and Stephen J. Cannell Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television. Executive Producers included Hasburgh, Cannell, Steve Beers and Bill Nuss. The show was an early hit for the fledgling Fox network, and was created to attract a younger audience.[2] The final season aired in first-run syndication mainly on local Fox affiliates. It was later rerun on the FX cable network from 1996 to 1998.\\r\\nThe series provided a spark to Johnny Depp's nascent acting career, garnering him national recognition as a teen idol. Depp found this status irritating,[3] but he continued on the series under his contract and was paid $45,000 per episode. Eventually he was released from his contract after the fourth season.[3][4]\\r\\nA spin-off series, Booker, was produced for the character of Dennis Booker (Richard Grieco); it ran one season, from September 1989 to June 1990. A film adaptation directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller was released on March 16, 2012. The film is set in the same continuity as the series, with Johnny Depp, Holly Robinson and Peter DeLuise reprising their characters in cameo appearances. Richard Grieco and Dustin Nguyen also have cameos in the 2014 film sequel 22 Jump Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series focuses on a group of police officers headquartered at the eponymous address. These officers are all young and have especially youthful appearances, which allows them to pass for teenagers. Their assignments generally consist of undercover work in high schools or, less commonly, colleges, where they generally investigate drug trafficking and abuse. The show's plots cover issues such as alcoholism, hate crimes, drug abuse, homophobia, AIDS, child abuse and sexual promiscuity. Similarly, each problem is often solved by the end of the hour-long episode, giving an implicit moral about the impact of a particular activity. When the show originally aired, some episodes were followed immediately by public service announcements featuring cast members.\\r\\nThe show starred prominent actors and actresses at the time, including:\\r\\nJeff Yagher was originally cast as Officer Tom Hanson in the pilot. He was replaced after the original pilot episode was filmed, and his scenes were reshot with Johnny Depp. Midway through the first season, Frederic Forrest was replaced by Steven Williams. On the show, Forrest's character Richard Jenko is killed by a drunk driver. Johnny Depp left the series at the end of the fourth season, but was credited in the first two episodes of the fifth season, despite not having appeared.\\r\\nSome notable guest stars on the series include: Dom DeLuise, Josh Brolin, Mindy Cohn, Bridget Fonda, Bobby Rodriguez, Jada Pinkett Smith, Brad Pitt, Vince Vaughn, Blair Underwood, John Waters, Rosie Perez, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Mario Van Peebles, Christina Applegate, Pauly Shore, David DeLuise, Bradley Gregg, Jason Priestley, Christopher Titus, Sarah Buxton, David Paymer, Diedrich Bader, Russell Wong, Kelly Hu, Shannon Tweed, and Peter Berg.\\r\\nSet in a fictional city and state (Metropolis, Evergreen State) in the United States, the series was primarily filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia.

All three shows were hits with audiences and helped to establish the then-newly launched Fox network.[5] 21 Jump Street was the first hit series for the Fox network.[6] In August, 21 Jump Street became the first Fox series to win its timeslot against a Big three network series.[7] In the United Kingdom, it was shown on the similarly nascent, and interrelated, Sky One, which had yet to reach a sizeable audience.[8]\\r\\nSeason 4 was the last season to air on the Fox network. In commentary on the Season 5 DVD set, Peter DeLuise said that Fox had decided to cancel the show after Season 4 because the ratings had fallen below a set limit. Following this season Johnny Depp and Dustin Nguyen left the show. The departure of their characters was never explained in the narrative of the TV series, but in the movie it is explained that Hanson was transferred to the DEA and was later joined by Officer Penhall. The Booker spin-off crossover episode, \\"Wheels and Deals Part One\\", is included with 21 Jump Street's syndication package, and is also included on the fourth season DVD set.\\r\\nOfficer Dean Garrett (David Barry Gray) makes his first appearance in \\"Everyday is Christmas\\". As it became harder for the original cast members to plausibly pass as high school students, his character and Officer Kati Rocky (Alexandra Powers) were intended to be \\"youthful\\" replacements, so the show could maintain its original premise of younger looking cops posing as high school students.\\r\\nAnchor Bay Entertainment released all five seasons of 21 Jump Street on DVD in Region 1 between 2004 and 2006. The releases contain extensive music substitutions and inaccurate cover art (Johnny Depp appears on the season 5 cover, despite having left the series after the previous season.

The measures provided for the admission of Maine as a free state along with Missouri as a slave state, thus maintaining the balance of power between North and South. As part of the compromise, slavery was prohibited north of the 3630 parallel, excluding Missouri. President James Monroe signed the legislation on March 6, 1820.[1]\\r\\nEarlier, on February 4, 1820, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Jeffersonian Republican from New York, submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood, which included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill which imposed federal restrictions on slavery, believing that slavery was a state issue settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana Purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government, derived from a states' slave population. Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \\"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality\\";[2] and \\"The Constitution, [said northern Jeffersonians] strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\\"[3]\\r\\nWhen free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union with slavery unrestricted. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso, excluding slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by those Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half the anti-restrictionist House Southerners to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso, while maneuvering a number of restrictionist House northerners to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state.[4][5] The Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, the House sustaining its northern antislavery position, and the Senate blocking a slavery restricted statehood.\\r\\nThe Missouri Compromise was controversial at the time, as many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectional lines. The bill was effectively repealed in the KansasÿNebraska Act of 1854, and declared unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857). This increased tensions over slavery and eventually led to the Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Era of Good Feelings, closely associated with the administration of President James Monroe (1817ÿ1825), was characterized by the dissolution of national political identities.[7][8] With the discredited Federalists in decline nationally, the \\"amalgamated\\" or hybridized Republicans adopted key Federalist economic programs and institutions, further erasing party identities and consolidating their victory.[9][10]\\r\\nThe economic nationalism of the Era of Good Feelings that would authorize the Tariff of 1816 and incorporate the Second Bank of the United States portended an abandonment of the Jeffersonian political formula for strict construction of the constitution, a limited central government and commitments to the primacy of Southern agrarian interests.[11][12] The end of opposition parties also meant the end of party discipline and the means to suppress internecine factional animosities. Rather than produce political harmony, as President James Monroe had hoped, amalgamation had led to intense rivalries among Jeffersonian Republicans.[13]\\r\\nIt was amid the \\"good feelings\\" of this period ÿ during which Republican Party discipline was in abeyance ÿ that the Tallmadge Amendment surfaced.[14]\\r\\nThe immense Louisiana Purchase territories had been acquired through federal executive action, followed by Republican legislative authorization in 1803 during the Thomas Jefferson administration.[15]\\r\\nPrior to its purchase in 1803, the governments of Spain and France had sanctioned slavery in the region. In 1812, the state of Louisiana, a major cotton producer and the first to be carved from the Louisiana Purchase, had entered the Union as a slave state. Predictably, Missourians were adamant that slave labor should not be molested by the federal government.[16] In the years following the War of 1812, the region, now known as Missouri Territory, experienced rapid settlement, led by slaveholding planters.[17]\\r\\nAgriculturally, the land comprising the lower reaches of the Missouri River, from which that new state would be formed, had no prospects as a major cotton producer. Suited for diversified farming, the only crop regarded as promising for slave labor was hemp culture. On that basis, southern planters immigrated with their chattel to Missouri, the slave population rising from 3,100 in 1810 to 10,000 in 1820. In a total population 67,000, slaves represented about 15 percent.[18]\\r\\nBy 1818, the population of Missouri territory was approaching the threshold that would qualify it for statehood. An enabling act was provided to Congress empowering territorial residents to select convention delegates and draft a state constitution.[19] The admission of Missouri territory as a slave state was expected to be more or less routine.[20][21]\\r\\nWhen the Missouri statehood bill was opened for debate in the House of Representative on February 13, 1819, early exchanges on the floor proceeded without serious incident.[22] In the course of these proceedings, however, Representative James Tallmadge Jr. of New York \\"tossed a bombshell into the Era of Good Feelings\\" with the following amendments:[23]\\r\\nProvided, that the further introduction of slavery or involuntary servitude be prohibited, except for the punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been fully convicted; and that all children born within the said State will be executed after the admission thereof into the Union, shall be free at the age of twenty-five years.[24]\\r\\nA political outsider, the 41-year old Tallmadge conceived his amendment based on a personal aversion to slavery. He had played a leading role in accelerating emancipation of the remaining slaves in New York in 1817. Moreover, he had campaigned against Illinois' Black Codes: though ostensibly free-soil, the new Illinois state constitution permitted indentured servitude and a limited form of slavery.[25][26] As a New York Republican, Tallmadge maintained an uneasy association with Governor DeWitt Clinton, a former Republican who depended on support from ex-Federalists. Clinton's faction was hostile to Tallmadge for his spirited defense of General Andrew Jackson over his contentious invasion of Florida.[27][28]\\r\\nTallmadge had to back from a fellow New York Republican, Congressman John W. Taylor (not to be confused with legislator John Taylor of Caroline County, Virginia). Taylor also had antislavery credentials: In February 1819, he had proposed similar slave restrictions on Arkansas territory in the House, but failed 89-87. He would lead the pro-Tallmadge antislavery forces during the 16th Congress in 1820.[29]\\r\\nThe amendment instantly exposed the polarization among Jeffersonian Republicans over the future of slavery in the nation.[30][31] Northern Jeffersonian Republicans formed a coalition across factional lines with remnants of the Federalists. Southern Jeffersonian united in almost unanimous opposition. The ensuing debates pitted the northern \\"restrictionists\\" (antislavery legislators who wished to bar slavery from the Louisiana territories) and southern \\"anti-restrictionists\\" (proslavery legislators who rejected any interference by Congress inhibiting slavery expansion).[32]\\r\\nThe sectional \\"rupture\\" over slavery among Jeffersonian Republicans, first exposed in the Missouri crisis, had its roots in the Revolutionary generation.[33]\\r\\nThe Missouri crisis marked a rupture in the Republican Ascendency ÿ the national association of Jeffersonian Republicans that dominated national politics in the post-War of 1812 period.[35]\\r\\nThe Founders had inserted both principled and pragmatic elements in the establishing documents. The Declaration of Independence of 1776 was grounded on the claim that liberty established a moral ideal that made universal equality a common right.[36] The Revolutionary War generation had formed a government of limited powers in 1787 to embody the principles in the Declaration, but \\"burdened with the one legacy that defied the principles of 1776\\": human bondage.[37] In a pragmatic commitment to form the Union, the federal apparatus would forego any authority to directly interfere with the institution of slavery where it existed under local control within the states. This acknowledgment of state sovereignty provided for the participation of those states most committed to slave labor. With this understanding, slaveholders had cooperated in authorizing the Northwest Ordinance in 1787, and to outlawing the trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1808.[38] Though the Founders sanctioned slavery, they did so with the implicit understanding that the slaveholding states would take steps to relinquish the institution as opportunities arose.[39]\\r\\nSouthern states, after the War for Independence, had regarded slavery as an institution in decline (with the exception of Georgia and South Carolina). This was manifest in the shift towards diversified farming in the Upper South, and in the gradual emancipation of slaves in New England, and more significantly, in the mid-Atlantic states. Beginning in the 1790s, with the introduction of the cotton gin, and by 1815, with the vast increase in demand for cotton internationally, slave-based agriculture underwent an immense revival, spreading the institution westward to the Mississippi River. Slavery opponents in the South vacillated, as did their hopes for the imminent demise of human bondage.[40]\\r\\nHowever rancorous the disputes among Southerners themselves over the virtues of a slave-based society, they united as a section when confronted by external challenges to their institution. The free states were not to meddle in the affairs of the slaveholders. Southern leaders ÿ of whom virtually all identified as Jeffersonian Republicans ÿ denied that Northerners had any business encroaching on matters related to slavery. Northern attacks on the institution were condemned as incitements to riot among the slave populations ÿ deemed a dire threat to white southern security.[41][42]\\r\\nNorthern Jeffersonian Republicans embraced the Jeffersonian antislavery legacy during the Missouri debates, explicitly citing the Declaration of Independence as an argument against expanding the institution. Southern leaders, seeking to defend slavery, would renounce the document's universal egalitarian applications and its declaration that \\"all men are created equal.\\"[43]\\r\\nArticle One, Section Two of the US Constitution supplemented legislative representation in those states where residents owned slaves. Known as the three-fifths clause or the \\"federal ratio\\", three-fifths (60%) of the slave population was numerically added to the free population. This sum was used to calculate Congressional districts per state and the number of delegates to the Electoral College. The federal ratio produced a significant number of legislative victories for the South in the years preceding the Missouri crisis, as well as augmenting its influence in party caucuses, the appointment of judges and the distribution of patronage. It is unlikely that the three-fifths clause, prior to 1820, was decisive in affecting legislation on slavery. Indeed, with the rising northern representation in the House, the South's share of the membership had declined since the 1790s.[44][45]\\r\\nHostility to the federal ratio had historically been the object of the now nationally ineffectual Federalists; they blamed their collective decline on the \\"Virginia Dynasty\\", expressed in partisan terms rather than in moral condemnation of slavery. The pro-De Witt Clinton-Federalist faction carried on the tradition, posing as antirestrictionists, for the purpose of advancing their fortunes in New York politics.[46][47]\\r\\nSenator Rufus King of New York, a Clinton associate, was the last Federalist icon still active on the national stage, a fact irksome to Southern Republicans.[48] A signatory to the US Constitution, he had strongly opposed the three-fifths rule in 1787. In the 1819 15th Congress debates, he revived his critique as a complaint that New England and the Mid-Atlantic States suffered unduly from the federal ratio, declaring himself \\"degraded\\" (politically inferior) to the slaveholders. Federalists, North and South, preferred to mute antislavery rhetoric, but during the 1820 debates in the 16th Congress, King and other old Federalists would expand their critique to include moral considerations of slavery.[49][50]\\r\\nRepublican James Tallmadge, Jr. and the Missouri restrictionists deplored the three-fifths clause because it had translated into political supremacy for the South. They had no agenda to remove it from the founding document, only to prevent its further application west of the Mississippi River.[51][52]\\r\\nAs determined as Southern Republicans were to secure Missouri statehood with slavery, the three-fifths clause failed to provide the margin of victory in the 15th Congress. Blocked by Northern Republicans ÿ largely on egalitarian grounds ÿ with sectional support from Federalists, the bill would die in the upper house, where the federal ratio had no relevance. The \\"balance of power\\" between the sections, and the maintenance of Southern preeminence on matters related to slavery resided in the Senate.[53][54]\\r\\nNorthern voting majorities in the lower house did not translate into political dominance. The fulcrum for proslavery forces resided in the upper house of Congress. There, constitutional compromise in 1787 had provided for exactly two senators per state, regardless of its population: the South, with its small white demographic relative to the North, benefited from this arrangement. Since 1815, sectional parity in the Senate had been achieved through paired admissions, leaving the North and South, at the time of Missouri territory application for statehood, at eleven states each.[55]\\r\\nThe South, voting as a bloc on measures that challenged slaveholding interests and augmented by defections from Free State Senators with Southern sympathies, was able to tally majorities. The Senate stood as the bulwark and source of the Slave Power ÿ a power that required admission of slave states to the Union to preserve its national primacy.[56][57]\\r\\nMissouri statehood, with the Tallmadge amendment approved, would set a trajectory towards a Free State trans-Mississippi and a decline in Southern political authority. The question as to whether the Congress could lawfully restrain the growth of slavery in Missouri took on great importance among the slave states. The moral dimensions of the expansion of human bondage would be raised by Northern Republicans on constitutional grounds.[58][59]\\r\\nThe Tallmadge amendment was \\"the first serious challenge to the extension of slavery\\" and raised questions concerning the interpretation of the republics' founding documents.[60]\\r\\nJeffersonian Republicans justified Tallmadge's slavery restrictions on the grounds that Congress possessed the authority to impose territorial statutes which would remain in force after statehood was established. Representative John W. Taylor pointed to Indiana and Illinois, where their Free State status conformed to the antislavery provisions in the Northwest Ordinance. [61]\\r\\nFurther, antislavery legislators invoked Article Four, Section Four of the Constitution, which required that states provide a republican form of government. As the Louisiana Territory was not part of the United States in 1787, they argued, introducing slavery into Missouri would thwart the egalitarian intent of the Founders.[62][63]\\r\\nProslavery Republicans countered that the Constitution had long been interpreted as having relinquished any claim to restricting slavery within the states. The free inhabitants of Missouri, either in the territorial phase or during statehood, had the right to establish slavery ÿ or disestablish it ÿ exclusive of central government interference. As to the Northwest Ordinance, Southerners denied that this could serve as a lawful antecedent for the territories of the Louisiana Purchase, as the ordinance had been issued originally under the Articles of Confederation, not under the US Constitution.[64]\\r\\nAs a legal precedent, they offered the treaty acquiring the Louisiana lands in 1803: the document included a provision (Article 3) that extended the rights of US citizens to all inhabitants of the new territory, including the protection of property in slaves.[64] When slaveholders embraced Jeffersonian constitutional strictures on a limited central government they were reminded that Jefferson, as US President in 1803, had deviated from these precepts when he wielded federal executive power to double the size the United States (including the lands under consideration for Missouri statehood). In doing so, he set a Constitutional precedent that would serve to rationalize Tallmadge's federally imposed slavery restrictions.[65]\\r\\nThe 15th Congress debates, focusing on it did on constitutional questions, largely avoided the moral dimensions raised by the topic of slavery. That the unmentionable subject had been raised publicly was deeply offensive to Southern Congressmen, and violated the long-held sectional understanding between free and slave state legislators.[66]\\r\\nMissouri statehood confronted Southern Jeffersonians with the prospect of applying the egalitarian principles espoused by the Revolutionary generation. This would require halting the spread of slavery westward, and confine the institution to where it already existed. Faced with a population of 1.5 million slaves, and the lucrative production of cotton, the South would abandon hopes for containment. Slaveholders in the 16th Congress, in an effort to come to grips with this paradox, would resort to a theory that called for extending slavery geographically so as to encourage its decline: \\"diffusion\\".[67][68]\\r\\nOn February 16, 1819, the House Committee of the Whole voted to link Tallmadge's provisions with the Missouri enabling legislation, approving the move 79-67.[69][70] Following the committee vote, debates resumed over the merits of each of Tallmadge's provisions in the enabling act. The debates in the House's 2nd session in 1819 lasted only three days. They have been characterized as \\"rancorous\\", \\"fiery\\", \\"bitter\\", \\"blistering\\", \\"furious\\" and \\"bloodthirsty\\".[71]\\r\\nNorthern representatives outnumbered the South in House membership 105 to 81. When each of the restrictionist provisions were put to the vote, they passed along sectional lines: 87 to 76 in favor of prohibition on further slave migration into Missouri (Table 1) and 82 to 78 in favor of emancipating slave offspring at age twenty-five.[72][73]\\r\\n15th Congress 2nd Session, February 16, 1819.\\r\\nThe enabling bill was passed to the Senate, where both parts of the bill were rejected: 22 to 16 opposed to restricting new slaves in Missouri (supported by five northerners, two of whom were the proslavery legislators from the free state of Illinois); and 31 to 7 against gradual emancipation for slave children born post-statehood.[74] House antislavery restrictionists refused to concur with the Senate proslavery anti-restrictionists: Missouri statehood would devolve upon the 16th Congress in December 1819.[75][76]\\r\\nThe Missouri Compromise debates stirred suspicions among proslavery interests that the underlying purpose of the Tallmadge amendments had little to do with opposition to slavery expansion. The accusation was first leveled in the House by the Republican anti-restrictionist John Holmes from the District of Maine. He suggested that Senator Rufus King's \\"warm\\" support for the Tallmadge amendment concealed a conspiracy to organize a new antislavery party in the North ÿ a party composed of old Federalists in combination with disaffected antislavery Republicans. The fact that King, in the Senate, and Tallmadge and Tyler, in the House ÿ all New Yorkers ÿ were among the vanguard for slavery restriction in Missouri lent credibility to these charges. When King was re-elected to the US Senate in January 1820, during the 16th Congress debates, and with bipartisan support, suspicions deepened and would persist throughout the crisis.[77][78] Southern Jeffersonian Republican leadership, including President Monroe and former President Thomas Jefferson, considered it as an article of faith that Federalists, given the chance, would destabilize the Union so as to re-impose monarchal rule in North America, and \\"consolidate\\" political control over the people by expanding the functions of the central government. Jefferson, at first unperturbed by the Missouri question, soon became convinced that a northern conspiracy was afoot, with Federalists and crypto-Federalists posing as Republicans, using Missouri statehood as a pretext.[79]\\r\\nDue to the disarray of the Republican Ascendency brought about by amalgamation, fears abounded among Southerners that a Free State party might take shape in the event that Congress failed to reach an understanding over Missouri and slavery: Such a party would threaten Southern preeminence. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts surmised that the political configuration for just such a sectional party already existed.[80][81] That the Federalists were anxious to regain a measure of political participation in national politics is indisputable. There was no basis, however, for the charge that Federalists had directed Tallmadge in his antislavery measures, nor was there anything to indicate that a New York-based King-Clinton alliance sought to erect an antislavery party on the ruins of the Republican Party. The allegations by Southern proslavery interests of a \\"plot\\" or that of \\"consolidation\\" as a threat to the Union misapprehended the forces at work in the Missouri crisis: the core of the opposition to slavery in the Louisiana Purchase were informed by Jeffersonian egalitarian principles, not a Federalist resurgence.[82][83]\\r\\nTo balance the number of \\"slave states\\" and \\"free states\\", the northern region of what was then Massachusetts, the District of Maine, ultimately gained admission into the United States as a free state to become Maine. This only occurred as a result of a compromise involving slavery in Missouri, and in the federal territories of the American West.[84] The admission of another slave state would increase the South's power at a time when northern politicians had already begun to regret the Constitution's Three-Fifths Compromise. Although more than 60 percent of whites in the United States lived in the North, by 1818 northern representatives held only a slim majority of congressional seats. The additional political representation allotted to the South as a result of the Three-Fifths Compromise gave southerners more seats in the House of Representatives than they would have had if the number was based on just free population. Moreover, since each state had two Senate seats, Missouri's admission as a slave state would result in more southern than northern senators.[85] A bill to enable the people of the Missouri Territory to draft a constitution and form a government preliminary to admission into the Union came before the House of Representatives in Committee of the Whole, on February 13, 1819. James Tallmadge of New York offered an amendment, named the Tallmadge Amendment, that forbade further introduction of slaves into Missouri, and mandated that all children of slave parents born in the state after its admission should be free at the age of 25. The committee adopted the measure and incorporated it into the bill as finally passed on February 17, 1819, by the house. The United States Senate refused to concur with the amendment, and the whole measure was lost.[86][87]\\r\\nDuring the following session (1819ÿ1820), the House passed a similar bill with an amendment, introduced on January 26, 1820, by John W. Taylor of New York, allowing Missouri into the union as a slave state. The question had been complicated by the admission in December of Alabama, a slave state, making the number of slave and free states equal. In addition, there was a bill in passage through the House (January 3, 1820) to admit Maine as a free state.[88]\\r\\nThe Senate decided to connect the two measures. It passed a bill for the admission of Maine with an amendment enabling the people of Missouri to form a state constitution. Before the bill was returned to the House, a second amendment was adopted on the motion of Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois, excluding slavery from the Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 3630 north (the southern boundary of Missouri), except within the limits of the proposed state of Missouri.[89]\\r\\nThe vote in the Senate was 24 for the compromise, to 20 against. The amendment and the bill passed in the Senate on February 17 and February 18, 1820. The House then approved the Senate compromise amendment, on a vote of 90 to 87, with those 87 votes coming from free state representatives opposed to slavery in the new state of Missouri.[89] The House then approved the whole bill, 134 to 42, with opposition from the southern states.[89]\\r\\nThe two houses were at odds not only on the issue of the legality of slavery but also on the parliamentary question of the inclusion of Maine and Missouri within the same bill. The committee recommended the enactment of two laws, one for the admission of Maine, the other an enabling act for Missouri. They recommended against having restrictions on slavery but for including the Thomas amendment. Both houses agreed, and the measures were passed on March 5, 1820, and were signed by President James Monroe on March 6.\\r\\nThe question of the final admission of Missouri came up during the session of 1820ÿ1821. The struggle was revived over a clause in Missouri's new constitution (written in 1820) requiring the exclusion of \\"free negroes and mulattoes\\" from the state. Through the influence of Kentucky Senator Henry Clay \\"The Great Compromiser\\", an act of admission was finally passed, upon the condition that the exclusionary clause of the Missouri constitution should \\"never be construed to authorize the passage of any law\\" impairing the privileges and immunities of any U.S. citizen. This deliberately ambiguous provision is sometimes known as the Second Missouri Compromise.[90]\\r\\nDuring the decades following 1820, Americans hailed the 1820 agreement as an essential compromise almost on the sacred level of the Constitution itself.[91] Although the Civil War broke out in 1861, historians often say the Compromise helped postpone the war.[92]\\r\\nThese disputes involved the competition between the southern and northern states for power in Congress and for control over future territories. There were also the same factions emerging as the Democratic-Republican party began to lose its coherence. In an April 22 letter to John Holmes, Thomas Jefferson wrote that the division of the country created by the Compromise Line would eventually lead to the destruction of the Union:[93]\\r\\n...but this momentous question, like a fire bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror. I considered it at once as the knell of the Union. it is hushed indeed for the moment. but this is a reprieve only, not a final sentence. A geographical line, coinciding with a marked principle, moral and political, once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men, will never be obliterated; and every new irritation will mark it deeper and deeper.[94][95]\\r\\nThe debate over admission of Missouri also raised the issue of sectional balance, for the country was equally divided between slave and free states with eleven each. To admit Missouri as a slave state would tip the balance in the Senate (made up of two senators per state) in favor of the slave states. For this reason, northern states wanted Maine admitted as a free state. Maine was admitted in 1820[96] and Missouri in 1821,[97] but no further states were added until 1836, when Arkansas was admitted.[98]\\r\\nFrom the constitutional standpoint, the Compromise of 1820 was important as the example of Congressional exclusion of slavery from U.S. territory acquired since the Northwest Ordinance. Nevertheless, the Compromise was deeply disappointing to African-Americans in both the North and South, as it stopped the southern progression of gradual emancipation at Missouri's southern border and legitimized slavery as a southern institution.[99]\\r\\nThe provisions of the Missouri Compromise forbidding slavery in the former Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 3630 north were effectively repealed by Stephen A. Douglas's KansasÿNebraska Act of 1854. The repeal of the Compromise caused outrage in the North and sparked the return to politics of Abraham Lincoln,[100] who criticized slavery and excoriated Douglas's act in his \\"Peoria Speech\\" (October 16, 1854).[101]","input":"What was a result of the missouri compromise?"},{"output":"Uttarakhand, India","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nValley of Flowers National Park is an Indian national park, located in West Himalaya, in the state of Uttarakhand and is known for its meadows of endemic alpine flowers and the variety of flora. This richly diverse area is also home to rare and endangered animals, including the Asiatic black bear,[1] snow leopard,[1] musk deer,[1] brown bear, red fox,[1] and blue sheep. Birds found in the park include Himalayan monal pheasant and other high altitude birds.[2] At 3352 to 3658 meters above sea level, the gentle landscape of the Valley of Flowers National Park complements the rugged mountain wilderness of Nanda Devi National Park to the east.[3] Together, they encompass a unique transition zone between the mountain ranges of the Zanskar and Great Himalaya. The park stretches over an expanse of 87.50?km2 and it is about 8?km long and 2?km wide.[2] Both parks are encompassed in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (223,674 ha) which is further surrounded by a buffer zone (5,148.57?km2).[4] Nanda Devi National Park Reserve is in the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Valley of Flowers is a high-altitude Himalayan valley that has long been acknowledged by renowned mountaineers, botanists, and in literature. It has been recognized internationally for over a century and is referenced in the Hindu religion. Local people have visited the valley since ancient times.[3] Indian yogis are known to have visited the valley for meditation.[5]  The Valley of Flowers has many different colourful flowers, taking on various shades of colours as time progressed.[3] The valley was declared a national park in 1982 and now it is a World Heritage Site.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Valley of Flowers has gained importance as a region containing a diversity of alpine flora, representative of the Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows ecoregion. The rich diversity of species reflects the valley's location within a transition zone between the Zanskar and Great Himalayas ranges to the north and south, respectively, and between the Eastern Himalaya and Western Himalaya flora. A number of plant species are considered threatened. Several have not been recorded outside of Uttarakhand. Two have not been recorded in Nanda Devi National Park. The diversity of threatened species of medicinal plants is higher than has been recorded in other Indian Himalayan protected areas. The entire Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve lies within the Western Himalayas Endemic Bird Area (EBA). The Valley of Flowers National Park is the second core zone of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve. Seven restricted-range bird species are endemic to this part of the EBA.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nState: Uttarakhand, India\\r\\nDistrict: Chamoli\\r\\nNearest town: Ghangharia, after Joshimath\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Valley of Flowers is nestled in the upper expanses of Bhyundar Ganga near Joshimath in Garhwal region.

In 1931, Frank S. Smythe, Eric Shipton and R.L. Holdsworth, all British mountaineers, lost their way while returning from a successful expedition to Mt.Kamet and happened upon the valley, which was full of flowers. They were attracted to the beauty of the area and named it the \\"Valley of Flowers.\\" Frank Smythe later authored a book of the same name.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1939, Joan Margaret Legge,(21 February 1885 ÿ 4 July 1939) a botanist deputed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew,[2] arrived at the valley to study flowers and while traversing some rocky slopes to collect flowers, she slipped off and lost her life.[8] Her sister later visited the valley and erected a memorial near the spot.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nProf. Chandra Prakash Kala, a botanist deputed by the Wildlife Institute of India, carried out a research study on the floristics and conservation of the valley for a decade, beginning in 1993.[9] He made an inventory of 520 alpine plants exclusively growing in this national park and authored two important books - \\"The Valley of Flowers - Myth and Reality\\" and \\"Ecology and Conservation of the Valley of Flowers National Park, Garhwal Himalaya.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\n1862: The Pushpawati valley was discovered by Col.

There is no settlement in the national park and grazing in the area has been banned since 1983. The park is open only during summer from June to October and it is covered by heavy snow for the rest of the year.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing an inner Himalayan valley, the Nanda Devi Basin has a distinctive microclimate. Conditions are generally dry with low annual precipitation, but there is heavy monsoon rainfall from late June to early September. Prevailing mist and low cloud during the monsoon keeps the soil moist, hence the vegetation is lusher than is usual in the drier inner Himalayan valleys. From mid April to June temperatures are moderate to cool (19?C maximum). The Valley of Flowers also has the microclimate of an enclosed inner Himalayan valley, and is shielded from the full impact of the southwest summer monsoon by the Greater Himalaya range to its south. There is often dense fog and rain especially during the late summer monsoon. Both Basin and Valley are usually snow-bound for six to seven months between late October and late March, the snow accumulating deeper and at lower altitudes on the shadowed southern than on the northern side of the valleys.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting to the Valley of Flowers requires a trek of about 17?km (10.5?mi). The nearest major town is Joshimath[1][12] in Garhwal, which has convenient road connections from Haridwar and Dehradun, both about 270?km (168?mi) from Joshimath. From Delhi, one can take the train to Haridwar and then travel by bus to Govindghat via Rishikesh.[13] Govindghat is approximately 24?km before another important destination of Badrinath. It is also possible to drive from Delhi to Govindghat, a distance of about 500?km.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovindghat is a small place close to Joshimath (around one hour distance), where the trek begins. From Govindghat, shared taxis up to 4?km and then a trek of less than 11?km (8.6?mi) brings trekkers to Ghangaria, a small settlement located about 3?km (about 2?mi) from the valley. One can also hire a porter, mule or helicopter to reach Ghangaria. The trek from Govindghat to Ghangaria is common to the Sikh Temple at Hemkund and a trekker is likely to find many Sikh pilgrims on the route.As one nears Ghangaria one is greeted by fields of perfumed wild flowers, wild rose bushes and wild strawberries by the sides of the path. The visitors to Valley of Flowers need to get a permit from Forest Department, at Ghangaria and the permit is valid for three days and visiting and trekking is allowed only during day time.[1] As visitors are not allowed to stay inside the National park, accommodation can be obtained at Ghangaria.[1][6] The best time to visit is between July and early September, when the valley is full of flowers, just after the outbreak of monsoon.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe valley has three sub-alpine between 3,200m and 3,500m which is the limit for trees, lower alpine between 3,500m and 3,700m, and higher alpine above 3,700m. The habitats include valley bottom, river bed, small forests, meadows, eroded, scrubby and stable slopes, moraine, plateau, bogs, stone desert and caves. The lower surrounding hills in the buffer zone are thickly forested. The Forest Research Institute in 1992 recorded 600 species of angiosperms and 30 pteridophytes in the valley and surroundings, discovering 58 new records for the valley of which 4 were new for Himalayan state. Of these plants, 5 out of 6 species globally threatened are not found in Nanda Devi National Park or elsewhere in Uttarakhand: Aconitum falconeri, A. balfouri, Himalayan maple (Acer caesium), the blue Himalayan poppy (Meconopsis aculeata) and Saussurea atkinsoni. Kala classified 31 species of rare and endangered categories within the national park in 1998.[14] Further his studies report that the dominant family in Valley of Flowers is Asteraceae with 62 species.[15] 45 medicinal plants are used by local villagers and several species, such as Saussurea obvallata (brahmakamal) are collected as religious offerings to goddesses Nanda Devi and Sunanda Devi.[16] The site is designated a Centre of Plant Diversity.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacteristic of the sub-alpine zone are high altitude forests which help to retain moisture and snow and support a large number of floral and faunal communities. It is dominated by the uncommon Himalayan maple Acer caesium (VU), west Himalayan fir Abies pindrow, Himalayan white birch Betula utilis, and Rhododendron campanulatum with Himalayan yew Taxus wallichiana, Syringa emodi and Sorbus lanata. Some of the common herbs are Arisaema jacquemontii, Boschniakia himalaica, Corydalis cashmeriana, Polemonium caerulium, Polygonum polystachyum (a rampant tall weed), Impatiens sulcata, Geranium wallichianum, Galium aparine, Morina longifolia, Inula grandiflora, Nomochoris oxypetala, Anemone rivularis, Pedicularis pectinata, P. bicornuta, Primula denticulate and Trillidium govanianum.[17][18] In trampled areas where past livestock congregated, Himalayan knotweed Polygonum polystachium is a rampant weed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe density of wild animals in the valley is not high, but all the animals found are rare or endangered. A total 13 species of mammals are recorded for the park by CP Kala[19] and its vicinity although only he sighted 9 species directly: northern plains grey langur Semnopithecus entellus, flying squirrel Petaurista petaurista, Himalayan black bear Ursus thibetanus (VU), red fox Vulpes vulpes, Himalayan weasel Mustela sibirica, and Himalayan yellow-throated marten Martes flavigula, Himalayan goral Naemorhedus goral, Himalayan musk deer Moschus leucogaster, Indian chevrotain Moschiola indica, Himalayan thar Hemitragus jemlahicus (VU) and serow Capricornis sumatraensis (VU). The tahr is common, the serow, goral, musk deer and bharal, blue sheep are rare.[19] The common leopard Panthera pardus is reported from lower parts of the valley closer to the villages. Local people have also reported evidence of brown bear Ursus arctos and bharal or blue sheep Pseudois nayaur. A recent faunal survey in October 2004 has established the presence of snow leopard Panthera uncia (EN) in the national park.[citation needed] The area is within the West Himalayan Endemic Bird Area but there have been no surveys specific to the Valley. 114 species were seen in 1993 in Nanda Devi Park. Species frequently seen in the valley include lammergeier Gypaetus barbatus, Himalayan vulture Gyps himalayensis, yellow billed and red billed choughs Pyrrhocorax graculus and P. pyrrhocorax, koklass pheasant Pucrasia macrolopha, the nationally listed Himalayan monal pheasant Lophophorus impejanus, found in rhododendron thickets, scaly-bellied and yellow-nape woodpeckers Picus squamatus and P. flavinucha, great and bluethroated barbets Megalaima virens and M. asiatica, snow pigeon Columba leuconota and spotted dove Stigmatopelia chinensis. The area is relatively poor in reptiles: most often seen are the high altitude lizard Agama tuberculata, Himalayan ground skink Leiolopisma himalayana and Himalayan pit viper Gloydius himalayanus. Along with the flowers are wild bees and many species of butterfly which need to be more researched. A few of the more evident species are lime butterfly Papilio demoleus demoleus, common yellow swallowtail Papilio machaon, common Mormon Papilio polytes romulus, spangle Papilio protenor protenor and common blue apollo Parnassius hardwickei.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flowers was surveyed and inventoried in 1987 by the Botanical Survey of India, in 1992 by the Forest Research Institute and in 1997 by the Wildlife Institute of India which found five species new to science.\\r\\nA research nursery and seed/rhizome/tuber bank for propagating rare plants and valuable medicinal herbs has been created at Musadhar near the entrance of the site.

Research plots have been set up to determine the best way to control the spread of the tall Himalayan knotweed Polygonum polystachium without damaging other plants or the surface of the soil. A first annual survey was conducted in 2004 and will be repeated annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlowers mostly orchids, poppies, primulas, marigold, daisies and anemones carpet the ground.[12] Sub-alpine forests of birch and rhododendron cover parts of the park's area. A decade long study of Prof. C.P.

The park has many species of medicinal plants including Dactylorhiza hatagirea, Picrorhiza kurrooa, Aconitum violaceum, Polygonatum multiflorum, Fritillaria roylei and Podophyllum hexandrum.[20][21]","input":"Where is valley of flowers national park situated?"},{"output":"in an essay","context":"The tragedy of the commons is a term used in social science to describe a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action. The concept and phrase originated in an essay written in 1833 by the British economist William Forster Lloyd, who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land (also known as a \\"common\\") in the British Isles.[1] The concept became widely known over a century later due to an article written by the American ecologist and philosopher Garrett Hardin in 1968.[2] In this modern economic context, commons is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as atmosphere, oceans, rivers, fish stocks, or even an office refrigerator.\\r\\nIt has been argued that the very term 'tragedy of the Commons' is a misnomer, since 'the commons' referred to land resources with rights jointly owned by members of a community, and no individual outside the community had any access to the resource. However, the term is now used in social science and economics when describing a problem where all individuals have equal and open access to a resource. Hence, 'tragedy of open access regimes' or simply 'the open access problem' are more apt terms.[3]\\r\\nThe 'tragedy of the commons' is often cited in connection with sustainable development, meshing economic growth and environmental protection, as well as in the debate over global warming. It has also been used in analyzing behavior in the fields of economics, evolutionary psychology, anthropology, game theory, politics, taxation and sociology.\\r\\nAlthough common resource systems have been known to collapse due to overuse (such as in over-fishing), many examples have existed and still do exist where members of a community with access to a common resource co-operate or regulate to exploit those resources prudently without collapse.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1833, the English economist William Forster Lloyd published a pamphlet which included a hypothetical example of over-use of a common resource. This was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze, as was the custom in English villages. He postulated that if a herder put more than his allotted number of cattle on the common, overgrazing could result. For each additional animal, a herder could receive additional benefits, but the whole group shared damage to the commons. If all herders made this individually rational economic decision, the common could be depleted or even destroyed, to the detriment of all.[6]\\r\\nIn 1968, ecologist Garrett Hardin explored this social dilemma in his article \\"The Tragedy of the Commons\\", published in the journal Science.[2][7] The essay derived its title from the pamphlet by Lloyd, which he cites, on the over-grazing of common land.\\r\\nHardin discussed problems that cannot be solved by technical means, as distinct from those with solutions that require \\"a change only in the techniques of the natural sciences, demanding little or nothing in the way of change in human values or ideas of morality\\". Hardin focused on human population growth, the use of the Earth's natural resources, and the welfare state.[8] Hardin argued that if individuals relied on themselves alone, and not on the relationship of society and man, then the number of children had by each family would not be of public concern. Parents breeding excessively would leave fewer descendants because they would be unable to provide for each child adequately. Such negative feedback is found in the animal kingdom.[8] Hardin said that if the children of improvident parents starved to death, if overbreeding was its own punishment, then there would be no public interest in controlling the breeding of families.[8] Hardin blamed the welfare state for allowing the tragedy of the commons; where the state provides for children and supports overbreeding as a fundamental human right, Malthusian catastrophe is inevitable. Consequently, in his article, Hardin lamented the following proposal from the United Nations:\\r\\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights describes the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society. [Article 16[9]] It follows that any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself, and cannot be made by anyone else.\\r\\nIn addition, Hardin also pointed out the problem of individuals acting in rational self-interest by claiming that if all members in a group used common resources for their own gain and with no regard for others, all resources would still eventually be depleted. Overall, Hardin argued against relying on conscience as a means of policing commons, suggesting that this favors selfish individuals?ÿ often known as free riders?ÿ over those who are more altruistic.\\r\\nIn the context of avoiding over-exploitation of common resources, Hardin concluded by restating Hegel's maxim (which was quoted by Engels), \\"freedom is the recognition of necessity\\". He suggested that \\"freedom\\" completes the tragedy of the commons. By recognizing resources as commons in the first place, and by recognizing that, as such, they require management, Hardin believed that humans \\"can preserve and nurture other and more precious freedoms\\".\\r\\nHardin's article was the start of the modern use of \\"Commons\\" as a term connoting a shared resource. As Frank van Laerhoven & Elinor Ostrom have stated: \\"Prior to the publication of Hardins article on the tragedy of the commons (1968), titles containing the words 'the commons', 'common pool resources,' or 'common property' were very rare in the academic literature.\\" They go on to say: \\"In 2002, Barrett and Mabry conducted a major survey of biologists to determine which publications in the twentieth century had become classic books or benchmark publications in biology. They report that Hardins 1968 article was the one having the greatest career impact on biologists and is the most frequently cited\\".[11]\\r\\nLike Lloyd and Thomas Malthus before him, Hardin was primarily interested in the problem of human population growth. But in his essay, he also focused on the use of larger (though finite) resources such as the Earth's atmosphere and oceans, as well as pointing out the \\"negative commons\\" of pollution (i.e., instead of dealing with the deliberate privatization of a positive resource, a \\"negative commons\\" deals with the deliberate commonization of a negative cost, pollution).\\r\\nAs a metaphor, the tragedy of the commons should not be taken too literally. The \\"tragedy\\" is not in the word's conventional or theatric sense, nor a condemnation of the processes that lead to it. Similarly, Hardin's use of \\"commons\\" has frequently been misunderstood, leading him to later remark that he should have titled his work \\"The Tragedy of the Unregulated Commons\\".[12][13]\\r\\nThe metaphor illustrates the argument that free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through over-exploitation, temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it, while the costs of the exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available (which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it). This, in turn, causes demand for the resource to increase, which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses (even if it retains a capacity to recover). The rate at which depletion of the resource is realized depends primarily on three factors: the number of users wanting to consume the common in question, the consumptiveness of their uses, and the relative robustness of the common.[14]\\r\\nThe same concept is sometimes called the \\"tragedy of the fishers\\", because fishing too many fish before or during breeding could cause stocks to plummet.[15]\\r\\nThe tragedy of the commons can be considered in relation to environmental issues such as sustainability. The commons dilemma stands as a model for a great variety of resource problems in society today, such as water, forests,[16] fish, and non-renewable energy sources such as oil and coal.\\r\\nSituations exemplifying the \\"tragedy of the commons\\" include the overfishing and destruction of the Grand Banks, the destruction of salmon runs on rivers that have been dammed ÿ most prominently in modern times on the Columbia River in the Northwest United States, and historically in North Atlantic rivers ÿ the devastation of the sturgeon fishery ÿ in modern Russia, but historically in the United States as well ÿ and, in terms of water supply, the limited water available in arid regions (e.g., the area of the Aral Sea) and the Los Angeles water system supply, especially at Mono Lake and Owens Lake.\\r\\nIn economics, an externality is a cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. Negative externalities are a well-known feature of the \\"tragedy of the commons\\". For example, driving cars has many negative externalities; these include pollution, carbon emissions, and traffic accidents. Every time 'Person A' gets in a car, it becomes more likely that 'Person Z'?ÿ  and millions of others?ÿ  will suffer in each of those areas.[17] Economists often urge the government to adopt policies that \\"internalize\\" an externality.[18]\\r\\nMore general examples (some alluded to by Hardin) of potential and actual tragedies include:\\r\\nA parallel was drawn recently between the tragedy of the commons and the competing behaviour of parasites that through acting selfishly eventually diminish or destroy their common host.[27] The idea has also been applied to areas such as the evolution of virulence or sexual conflict, where males may fatally harm females when competing for matings.[28] It is also raised as a question in studies of social insects, where scientists wish to understand why insect workers do not undermine the \\"common good\\" by laying eggs of their own and causing a breakdown of the society.\\r\\nThe idea of evolutionary suicide, where adaptation at the level of the individual causes the whole species or population to be driven extinct, can be seen as an extreme form of an evolutionary tragedy of the commons.[29][30] From an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide us with advanced therapeutic methods.[31]\\r\\n The commons dilemma is a specific class of social dilemma in which people's short-term selfish interests are at odds with long-term group interests and the common good.[32] In academia, a range of related terminology has also been used as shorthand for the theory or aspects of it, including resource dilemma, take-some dilemma, and common pool resource.\\r\\nCommons dilemma researchers have studied conditions under which groups and communities are likely to under- or over-harvest common resources in both the laboratory and field. Research programs have concentrated on a number of motivational, strategic, and structural factors that might be conducive to management of commons.\\r\\nIn game theory, which constructs mathematical models for individuals' behavior in strategic situations, the corresponding \\"game\\", developed by Hardin, is known as the Commonize Costs?ÿ Privatize Profits Game (CCÿPP game).\\r\\nKopelman, Weber, & Messick (2002), in a review of the experimental research on cooperation in commons dilemmas, identify nine classes of independent variables that influence cooperation in commons dilemmas: social motives, gender, payoff structure, uncertainty, power and status, group size, communication, causes, and frames. They organize these classes and distinguish between psychological individual differences (stable personality traits) and situational factors (the environment). Situational factors include both the task (social and decision structure) and the perception of the task.[33]\\r\\nEmpirical findings support the theoretical argument that the cultural group is a critical factor that needs to be studied in the context of situational variables.[34] Rather than behaving in line with economic incentives, people are likely to approach the decision to cooperate with an appropriateness framework.[35] An expanded, four factor model of the Logic of Appropriateness,[36][37] suggests that the cooperation is better explained by the question: \\"What does a person like me (identity) do (rules) in a situation like this (recognition) given this culture (group)?\\"\\r\\nStrategic factors also matter in commons dilemmas. One often-studied strategic factor is the order in which people take harvests from the resource. In simultaneous play, all people harvest at the same time, whereas in sequential play people harvest from the pool according to a predetermined sequence?ÿ first, second, third, etc. There is a clear order effect in the latter games: the harvests of those who come first?ÿ the leaders?ÿ are higher than the harvest of those coming later?ÿ the followers. The interpretation of this effect is that the first players feel entitled to take more. With sequential play, individuals adopt a first come-first served rule, whereas with simultaneous play people may adopt an equality rule. Another strategic factor is the ability to build up reputations. Research[by whom?] found that people take less from the common pool in public situations than in anonymous private situations. Moreover, those who harvest less gain greater prestige and influence within their group.\\r\\nMuch research has focused on when and why people would like to structurally rearrange the commons to prevent a tragedy. Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that \\"Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.\\"[38] One of the proposed solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate access to the common. Groups are more likely to endorse a leader when a common resource is being depleted and when managing a common resource is perceived as a difficult task. Groups prefer leaders who are elected, democratic, and prototypical of the group, and these leader types are more successful in enforcing cooperation. A general aversion to autocratic leadership exists, although it may be an effective solution, possibly because of the fear of power abuse and corruption.\\r\\nThe provision of rewards and punishments may also be effective in preserving common resources. Selective punishments for overuse can be effective in promoting domestic water and energy conservation?ÿ for example, through installing water and electricity meters in houses. Selective rewards work, provided that they are open to everyone. An experimental carpool lane in the Netherlands failed because car commuters did not feel they were able to organize a carpool.[39] The rewards do not have to be tangible. In Canada, utilities considered putting \\"smiley faces\\" on electricity bills of customers below the average consumption of that customer\`s neighborhood.[40]\\r\\nArticulating solutions to the tragedy of the commons is one of the main problems of political philosophy. In many situations, locals implement (often complex) social schemes that work well. The best governmental solution may be to do nothing. When these fail, there are many possible governmental solutions such as privatization, internalizing the externalities, and regulation.\\r\\nSometimes the best governmental solution may be to do nothing. Robert Axelrod contends that even self-interested individuals will often find ways to cooperate, because collective restraint serves both the collective and individual interests.[41] Anthropologist G. N. Appell criticized those who cited Hardin to \\"impos[e] their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge.\\"[42]\\r\\nPolitical scientist Elinor Ostrom, who was awarded 2009's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for her work on the issue, and others revisited Hardin's work in 1999.[43] They found the tragedy of the commons not as prevalent or as difficult to solve as Hardin maintained, since locals have often come up with solutions to the commons problem themselves.[44] For example, it was found that a commons in the Swiss Alps has been run by a collective of farmers there to their mutual and individual benefit since 1517, in spite of the farmers also having access to their own farmland. In general, it is in the users of a commons interests to keep the common running and complex social schemes are often invented by the users for maintaining them at optimum efficiency.[45][46]\\r\\nSimilarly, geographer Douglas L. Johnson remarks that many nomadic pastoralist societies of Africa and the Middle East in fact \\"balanced local stocking ratios against seasonal rangeland conditions in ways that were ecologically sound\\", reflecting a desire for lower risk rather than higher profit; in spite of this, it was often the case that \\"the nomad was blamed for problems that were not of his own making and were a product of alien forces.\\"[47] Independently finding precedent in the opinions of previous scholars such as Ibn Khaldun as well as common currency in antagonistic cultural attitudes towards non-sedentary peoples,[47] governments and international organizations have made use of Hardin's work to help justify restrictions on land access and the eventual sedentarization of pastoral nomads despite its weak empirical basis. Examining relations between historically nomadic Bedouin Arabs and the Syrian state in the 20th century, Dawn Chatty notes that \\"Hardin's argument [] was curiously accepted as the fundamental explanation for the degradation of the steppe land\\" in development schemes for the arid interior of the country, downplaying the larger role of agricultural overexploitation in desertification as it melded with prevailing nationalist ideology which viewed nomads as socially backward and economically harmful.[48]\\r\\nElinor Ostrom, and her colleagues looked at how real-world communities manage communal resources, such as fisheries, land irrigation systems, and farmlands, and they identified a number of factors conducive to successful resource management. One factor is the resource itself; resources with definable boundaries (e.g., land) can be preserved much more easily. A second factor is resource dependence; there must be a perceptible threat of resource depletion, and it must be difficult to find substitutes. The third is the presence of a community; small and stable populations with a thick social network and social norms promoting conservation do better.[45] A final condition is that there be appropriate community-based rules and procedures in place with built-in incentives for responsible use and punishments for overuse. When the commons is taken over by non-locals, those solutions can no longer be used.[44]\\r\\nGovernmental solutions may be necessary when the above conditions are not met (such as a community being too big or too unstable to provide a thick social network). Examples of government regulation include privatization, regulation, and internalizing the externalities.\\r\\nOne solution for some resources is to convert common good into private property, giving the new owner an incentive to enforce its sustainability. Libertarians and classical liberals cite the tragedy of the commons as an example of what happens when Lockean property rights to homestead resources are prohibited by a government.[49] They argue that the solution to the tragedy of the commons is to allow individuals to take over the property rights of a resource, that is, to privatize it.[50]\\r\\nIn a typical example, governmental regulations can limit the amount of a common good that is available for use by any individual. Permit systems for extractive economic activities including mining, fishing, hunting, livestock raising and timber extraction are examples of this approach. Similarly, limits to pollution are examples of governmental intervention on behalf of the commons. This idea is used by the United Nations Moon Treaty, Outer Space Treaty and Law of the Sea Treaty as well as the UNESCO World Heritage Convention which involves the international law principle that designates some areas or resources the Common Heritage of Mankind.[51]\\r\\nIn Hardin's essay, he proposed that the solution to the problem of overpopulation must be based on \\"mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon\\" and result in \\"relinquishing the freedom to breed\\". Hardin discussed this topic further in a 1979 book, Managing the Commons, co-written with John A. Baden.[52] He framed this prescription in terms of needing to restrict the \\"reproductive right\\", to safeguard all other rights. Several countries have a variety of population control laws in place.\\r\\nGerman historian Joachim Radkau thought Hardin advocates strict management of common goods via increased government involvement or international regulation bodies.[53] An asserted impending \\"tragedy of the commons\\" is frequently warned of as a consequence of the adoption of policies which restrict private property and espouse expansion of public property.[54][55]\\r\\nPrivatization works when the person who owns the property (or rights of access to that property) pays the full price of its exploitation. As discussed above negative externalities (negative results, such as air or water pollution, that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource) is often a feature driving the tragedy of the commons. Internalizing the externalities, in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use, can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation. One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution. This solution can provide the flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed.\\r\\nThe environmentalist Derrick Jensen claims the tragedy of the commons is used as propaganda for private ownership.[56] He says it has been used by the political right wing to hasten the final enclosure of the \\"common resources\\" of third world and indigenous people worldwide, as a part of the Washington Consensus. He argues that in true situations, those who abuse the commons would have been warned to desist and if they failed would have punitive sanctions against them. He says that rather than being called \\"The Tragedy of the Commons\\", it should be called \\"the Tragedy of the Failure of the Commons\\".\\r\\nHardin's work was also criticised[57] as historically inaccurate in failing to account for the demographic transition, and for failing to distinguish between common property and open access resources.[58] In a similar vein, Carl Dahlman argues that commons were effectively managed to prevent overgrazing.[59] Likewise, Susan Jane Buck Cox argues that the common land example used to argue this economic concept is on very weak historical ground, and misrepresents what she terms was actually the \\"triumph of the commons\\": the successful common usage of land for many centuries. She argues that social changes and agricultural innovation, and not the behaviour of the commoners, led to the demise of the commons.[5]\\r\\nSome authors, like Yochai Benkler, say that with the rise of the Internet and digitalisation, an economics system based on commons becomes possible again. He wrote in his book The Wealth of Networks in 2006 that cheap computing power plus networks enable people to produce valuable products through non-commercial processes of interaction: \\"as human beings and as social beings, rather than as market actors through the price system\\". He uses the term 'networked information economy' to describe a \\"system of production, distribution, and consumption of information goods characterized by decentralized individual action carried out through widely distributed, nonmarket means that do not depend on market strategies.\\"[60] He also coined the term 'commons-based peer production' to describe collaborative efforts based on sharing information.[61] Examples of commons-based peer production are free and open source software and open-source hardware.\\r\\nIn certain cases, exploiting a resource more may be a good thing. Carol M. Rose, in a 1986 article, discussed the concept of the \\"comedy of the commons\\", where the public property in question exhibits \\"increasing returns to scale\\" in usage (hence the phrase, \\"the more the merrier\\"), in that the more people use the resource, the higher the benefit to each one. Rose cites as examples commerce and group recreational activities. According to Rose, public resources with the \\"comedic\\" characteristic may suffer from under-investment rather than over usage.[62]","input":"Where did the tragedy of the commons originate?"},{"output":"mainly pop, while he also incorporates elements of R&B","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nJustin Drew Bieber (/?bi?b?r/; born March 1, 1994)[2][3] is a Canadian singer-songwriter. After talent manager Scooter Braun discovered him through his YouTube videos covering songs in 2008 and he signed to RBMG, Bieber released his debut EP, My World, in late 2009. It was certified platinum in the US.[4] He became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut record chart on the Billboard Hot 100.[5] Bieber released his first full-length studio album, My World 2.0, in 2010. It debuted at or near number one in several countries, was certified triple platinum in the US,[4] and contained his single \\"Baby\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing his debut album and promotional tours, he released his 3D biopic-concert film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never and his second studio album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. His third studio album, Believe (2012) generated the single \\"Boyfriend\\", which reached number one in Canada. His fourth studio album Purpose was released in 2015, spawning three number one singles: \\"What Do You Mean?\\", \\"Sorry\\", and \\"Love Yourself\\". Afterwards, Bieber was featured on several successful collaborations, including \\"Cold Water\\", \\"Let Me Love You\\", \\"Despacito (Remix)\\", and \\"I'm the One\\". His US album and singles sales total 44.7 million.[4][6] He has sold an estimated 140 million records, making him one of the worlds best-selling music artists, and became the second person to reach 100 million followers on Twitter in August 2017 after Katy Perry.\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber has won numerous awards throughout his career, including the American Music Award for Artist of the Year in 2010 and 2012, a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording for the song \\"Where Are  Now\\", and a Latin Grammy Award.[7] He has been listed three times by Forbes magazine among the top ten most powerful celebrities in the world, in 2011, 2012, and 2013.[8] In 2016, Bieber became the first artist to surpass 10 billion total video views on Vevo.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber was born on March 1, 1994, in London, Ontario, at St Joseph's Hospital,[10] and was raised in Stratford, Ontario.[11] He is the only child of Jeremy Jack Bieber and Patricia \\"Pattie\\" Mallette. Bieber's parents were never married.[12] Mallette, who was underaged at the time of giving birth, raised her son with the help of her mother, Diane, and stepfather, Bruce.[13] His mother is of French-Canadian descent; his paternal great-grandfather was of German ancestry, and his other roots are English, Scottish and Irish.[14][15][16] He has also claimed that he has some undetermined Aboriginal Canadian ancestry.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough Jeremy, Bieber has three younger half-siblings. Jeremy and his ex-girlfriend Erin Wagner have two children, a daughter Jazmyn (born 2009) and  a son Jaxon (born 2010). They broke up after seven years in 2014.[18] Jeremy later married his girlfriend Chelsey Rebelo in February 2018. They welcomed their daughter together, Bay (born in August 2018).[19][20] Bieber also has a step sister named Allie, the daughter of his step mother.[21] Pattie worked a series of low-paying office jobs, raising Bieber as a single mother in low-income housing. Bieber has maintained contact with his father.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber attended a French-language immersion elementary school in Stratford, the Jeanne Sauv Catholic School.[13] Growing up, he learned to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet.[11][23] He graduated from high school in Stratford, Ontario, the St. Michael Catholic Secondary School in 2012[24] with a 4.0 GPA.[25] In early 2007, aged 12, Bieber sang Ne-Yo's \\"So Sick\\" for a local singing competition in Stratford and was placed second.[23][26] Mallette posted a video of the performance on YouTube for their family and friends to see. She continued to upload videos of Bieber singing covers of various R&B songs, and Bieber's popularity on the site grew.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen searching for videos of a different singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def Recordings, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 videos by accident.[22] Impressed, Braun tracked down the theatre that Bieber was performing in, located Bieber's school, and finally contacted Mallette, who was reluctant because of Braun's Judaism. She remembered praying, \\"God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!\\", and, \\"God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?\\" However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun. At 13, Bieber went to Atlanta, Georgia, with Braun to record demo tapes.[22] Bieber began singing for Usher one week later.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber was soon signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture between Braun and Usher.[29] Justin Timberlake was also reportedly in the running to sign Bieber but lost the bidding war to Usher.[29][30] Usher then sought assistance in finding a label home for the artist from then manager Chris Hicks, who helped engineer an audition with his contact L.A. Reid of The Island Def Jam Music Group.[31] Reid signed Bieber to Island Records in October 2008 (resulting in a joint venture between RBMG and Island Records) and appointed Hicks as executive Vice-President of Def Jam, where he could manage Bieber's career at the label.[1][27][29][31] Bieber then moved to Atlanta with his mother to pursue further work with Braun and Usher.[29] Braun became Bieber's manager in 2008.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber's first single, \\"One Time\\", was released to radio while Bieber was still recording his debut album.[32] The song reached number 12 on the Canadian Hot 100 during its first week of release in July 2009[27] and later peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100. During fall 2009, it had success in international markets.[33] The song was certified platinum in Canada and the US and gold in Australia and New Zealand.[34][35][36] His first release, an extended play entitled My World, was released on November 17, 2009. The album's second single, \\"One Less Lonely Girl\\", and two promo singles, \\"Love Me\\" and \\"Favorite Girl\\", were released exclusively on the iTunes Store and charted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"One Less Lonely Girl\\" was later also released to radio and peaked within the top 20 in Canada and the US, and was certified gold in the latter.[33] My World was eventually certified platinum in the US and double platinum in both Canada and the United Kingdom.[37][38] To promote the album, Bieber performed on several live shows such as mtvU's VMA 09 Tour, European program The Dome, YTV's The Next Star, The Today Show,[39][40] The Wendy Williams Show, Lopez Tonight, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, It's On with Alexa Chung, Good Morning America, Chelsea Lately, and BET's 106 & Park. Bieber also guest starred in an episode of True Jackson, VP in late 2009.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber performed Ron Miller and Bryan Wells's \\"Someday at Christmas\\" for US President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at the White House for Christmas in Washington, which aired on December 20, 2009, on US television broadcaster TNT.[42] Bieber was also one of the performers for Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest, on December 31, 2009.[43] Bieber was a presenter at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards on January 31, 2010. He was invited to be a vocalist for the remake of \\"We Are the World\\" (a song written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie) for its 25th anniversary to benefit Haiti after the earthquake. Bieber sings the opening line, which was sung by Lionel Richie in the original version.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 12, 2010, a version of K'naan's \\"Wavin' Flag\\", recorded by a collective of Canadian musicians known as Young Artists for Haiti, was released. Bieber is featured in the song, performing the closing lines.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2010, \\"Baby\\", was released from his debut album, My World 2.0. The song featured Ludacris, and became an international hit. It charted at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaked at number three on the Canadian Hot 100[46] and reached the top ten in several international markets.[33] Two promo singles \\"Never Let You Go\\", and \\"U Smile\\" were top thirty hits on the US Hot 100, and top twenty hits in Canada.[33] According to review aggregator Metacritic, the album has received generally favourable reviews.[47] It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making Bieber the youngest solo male act to top the chart since Stevie Wonder in 1963.[48] My World 2.0 also debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, Irish Albums Chart, Australian Albums Chart, and the New Zealand Albums Chart[33] and reached the top ten of fifteen other countries.[49][50]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo promote the album, Bieber appeared on several live programs including The View, the 2010 Kids' Choice Awards, Nightline, Late Show with David Letterman, The Dome and 106 & Park.[51] Sean Kingston appeared on the album's next single, \\"Eenie Meenie\\". The song reached the top ten in the United Kingdom and Australia, and the top-twenty of most other markets. On April 10, 2010, Bieber was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live.[52] On July 4, 2010, Bieber performed at the Macy's Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular in New York City.[53] The following single from My World 2.0, \\"Somebody to Love\\", was released in April 2010, and a remix was released featuring Bieber's mentor Usher. On June 23, 2010, Bieber went on his first official headlining tour, the My World Tour, starting in Hartford, Connecticut, to promote My World and My World 2.0. Bieber featured in Soulja Boy's single in May 2010, titled \\"Rich Girl\\".[54] In July 2010, it was reported that Bieber was the most searched for celebrity on the Internet.[55] That same month his music video for \\"Baby\\", surpassed Lady Gaga's \\"Bad Romance\\" to become the most viewed, and also the most disliked YouTube video ever.[56][57] However, Taylor Swift's Blank Space surpassed its number of views in 2015.[58] In September 2010, it was reported that Bieber accounted for three per cent of all traffic on Twitter, according to an employee of the social-networking site.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Bieber's second album, because of puberty, his voice was deeper than it was in his first album.[60] In April 2010, the singer discussing his vocals remarked, \\"It cracks. Like every teenage boy, I'm dealing with it and I have the best vocal coach in the world. [...] Some of the notes I hit on 'Baby' I can't hit any more. We have to lower the key when I sing live.\\"[61] Bieber guest-starred in the season premiere of the CBS crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which aired on September 23, 2010. He played a \\"troubled teen who is faced with a difficult decision regarding his only brother\\", who is also a serial bomber. Bieber was also in a subsequent episode which aired on February 17, 2011, in which his character is killed.[62] Bieber performed a medley of \\"U Smile\\", \\"Baby\\", and \\"Somebody to Love\\" and briefly played the drums at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.[63] Bieber announced in October 2010 that he would be releasing an acoustic album, called My Worlds Acoustic.[64] It was released on November 26, 2010 in the United States and featured acoustic versions of songs from his previous albums, and accompanied the release of a new song titled \\"Pray\\".[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 3-D part-biopic, part-concert film starring Bieber entitled Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, was released on February 11, 2011, directed by Step Up 3D director Jon Chu. It topped the box office with an estimated gross of $12.4 million on its opening day from 3,105 theatres.[66] It grossed $30.3 million for the weekend and was narrowly beaten by the romantic comedy Just Go with It, which grossed $31 million.[67] Never Say Never reportedly exceeded industry expectations, nearly matching the $31.1 million grossed by Miley Cyrus's 2008 3-D concert film, Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, which holds the record for the top debut for a music-documentary.[68] Never Say Never grossed a total of $98,441,954 worldwide.[69] The film is accompanied by his second remix album, Never Say Never ÿ The Remixes, released February 14, 2011, and features remixes of songs from his debut album, with guest appearances from Miley Cyrus, Chris Brown, and Kanye West, among others.[70] One song from the album, \\"That Should Be Me (remix)\\", featured with American country band Rascal Flattts, won him his first award in country music for Collaborative Video of the Year in CMT Music Awards in June 2011. Time magazine named Bieber one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual list.[71] In June 2011, Bieber was ranked No.?2 on the Forbes list of Best-Paid Celebrities under 30. He is the youngest star, and 1 of 7 musicians on the list, having raked in $53 million in a 12-month period.[72] The same month, his collaborative single \\"Next to You\\" with American singer Chris Brown has released. The unfinished video for that song was leaked online on June 6, and the official video was released on June 17. On November 1, 2011, Bieber released the Christmas-themed Under the Mistletoe, his second studio album. It debuted at No.?1 on the Billboard 200, selling 210,000 copies in its first week of release.[73] The first single from the album, \\"Mistletoe\\" peaked at number one on the US Billboard Holiday Digital Songs chart.[74] Bieber re-recorded Mariah Carey's single \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\" with Carey as well for the album.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2011, Bieber began recording his third studio album, entitled Believe. The following week, Bieber appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to announce that the first single would be called \\"Boyfriend\\" and would be released on March 26, 2012.[76] The song debuted at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, selling a total of 521,000 digital units, the second-highest-ever debut digital sales week.[77] Bill Werde of Billboard noted that it failed to debut at number one because the digital download of the track was available only through iTunes Store, \\"restricting the buying option for those that do not frequent the Apple retail store\\".[78] \\"Boyfriend\\" became Bieber's first single ever to reach the top position on the Canadian Hot 100 by debuting at number one and staying on for one week.[77] Bieber featured in American hip hop group Far East Movement's song \\"Live My Live\\" from their fourth studio album Dirty Bass in February 2012. The song has emerged online, five days before its scheduled release date.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis third studio album, Believe was released on June 19, 2012, by Island Records. The album marks a musical departure from the teen pop sound of his previous releases, and incorporates elements of dance-pop and R&B genres.[80] Intent on developing a more \\"mature\\" sound, Bieber collaborated with a wide range of urban producers for the release as well as some long-time collaborators, including Darkchild, Hit-Boy, Diplo, and Max Martin. Entertainment Weekly praised Bieber's musical shift, calling the album both a \\"reinvention and a reintroduction\\".[81] Rolling Stone noted the deeper voice and more \\"intense\\" beats found on the album, although it lampooned one of his euphemisms for newfound sexual maturity (\\"If you spread your wings, you can fly away with me\\").[82] Believe debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming his fourth number-one album.[83][84][85] The album sold 57,000 copies in its first week in Canada, debuting atop the Canadian Albums Chart.[86] Bieber was featured on \\"Beautiful\\", the single from Carly Rae Jepsen' second studio album, Kiss.[87] In 2012, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Believe Tour, which further promoted the album, began in September 2012 in Glendale, Arizona.[88] On December 14, 2012, Bieber appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he announced plans to release an acoustic album titled Believe Acoustic, which was released on January 29, 2013.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber returned to Saturday Night Live as the host and musical guest on the February 9, 2013 episode. His appearance was panned by critics[90][91] and cast members, including Kate McKinnon, who stated that Bieber was not comfortable with his hosting duties, and Bill Hader, who stated that he did not enjoy the presence of Bieber or his entourage. Hader added that in his eight years on the program, Bieber was the only host who lived up to his reputation.[92][93]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 7, 2013, Bieber fainted backstage at London's O2 Arena after complaining of breathing problems throughout his performance and was taken to the hospital.[94] Bieber cancelled his second Lisbon, Portugal concert at the Pavilh?o Atlantico, which was to be held on March 12, because of low ticket sales. The concert on March 11 went on.[95] In mid-August 2013, a remixed duet version of Michael Jackson's previously unreleased song \\"Slave To The Rhythm\\", featuring Justin Bieber leaked online.[96] In response to criticism over this remix, the MJ Estate had not authorized release of this recording, and has since made attempts to remove the song from as many sites and YouTube channels as possible.[97] Later, a song titled \\"Twerk\\" by rapper Lil Twist, featuring Bieber as well as Miley Cyrus, also leaked.[98] In September, Bieber was featured in Maejor Ali' song \\"Lolly\\" with Juicy J.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 3, 2013, Bieber announced that he would release a new song every Monday for 10 weeks as a lead-up to the film Justin Bieber's Believe, which entered production in May 2012 and was released on December 25, 2013. The film is a follow-up to Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, and Jon M. Chu returned to direct.[100][101][102] The first song of Music Mondays, \\"Heartbreaker\\", was released on October 7. The second song, \\"All That Matters\\", was released on October 14, followed by \\"Hold Tight\\" on October 21, \\"Recovery\\" on October 28, \\"Bad Day\\" on November 4, and \\"All Bad\\" on November 11. The seventh song, \\"PYD\\" featuring R. Kelly, was released on November 18; it was followed by \\"Roller Coaster\\" on November 25, and \\"Change Me\\" on December 2. The final song, \\"Confident\\" featuring Chance the Rapper, was released on December 9, 2013. That same day, it was announced that all 10 tracks will be featured on an upcoming collection called Journals. It reportedly featured five additional unreleased songs, a music video for \\"All That Matters\\", and a trailer for Believe.

The titles of the five new additional songs are: \\"One Life\\", \\"Backpack\\" featuring Lil Wayne, \\"What's Hatnin' \\" featuring Future, \\"Swap It Out\\", and \\"Memphis\\" featuring Big Sean and Diplo.[103] Bieber released a song titled \\"Home to Mama\\" featuring Australian singer Cody Simpson in November 2014.[104] The same month, Bieber topped Forbes' The Highest-Earning Celebrities Under 30 annual list.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the disbanding of Universal Music's division, The Island Def Jam Music Group, in April 2014, Bieber and a number of artists were subsequently transferred to a UMG related division Def Jam Recordings, causing Bieber and the other artists to no longer be signed to Island Records.[106][107]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2015, Bieber released a song \\"Where Are  Now\\", with Jack .[108] The song won a Grammy for Best Dance Recording at the 2016 Grammy Awards. In March 2015, Bieber made an appearance in the music video for Carly Rae Jepsen's single \\"I Really Like You\\".[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2015 Bieber was the featured roastee in Comedy Central's annual roast special.[110] Bieber filmed an episode for the Fox TV reality series Knock Knock Live, and aired before the show was cancelled after two episodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 28, 2015, Bieber released a new single titled \\"What Do You Mean?\\" as the lead single from his fourth studio album Purpose. The song is a blend of teen pop, electronic dance music and acoustic R&B and became Bieber's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100.[111] He became the youngest male artist to debut at the top of that chart, earning him a Guinness World Record. On October 23, 2015, Bieber released the album's second single titled \\"Sorry\\" as an instant download, with the pre-order of the album on iTunes. The song debuted at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[112] After eight non-consecutive weeks at number two, on the week charting January 23, 2016, \\"Sorry\\" climbed to the top spot of the chart and became Bieber's second number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. The third single from Purpose, \\"Love Yourself\\" also peaked at number one in the US, making Bieber the first male artist in almost a decade to have three number-ones from an album since Justin Timberlake last did it with his album FutureSex/LoveSounds in 2006/2007. \\"Company\\" was announced as the fourth single on March 8, 2016. On February 12, 2016, Bieber's first four albums were released on vinyl for the first time.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose was released on November 13, 2015, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming Bieber's sixth album to debut at the top of that chart.[114][115] It was the fourth best-selling album of 2015 with worldwide sales of 3.1 million copies.[116] As of June 2016, it had sold 4.5 million copies globally.[117] On November 11, 2015, Bieber announced he will embark on the Purpose Tour. The tour started in Seattle, Washington on March 9, 2016.[118] On July 24, 2017, Bieber cancelled the remaining dates of his Purpose Tour \\"due to unforeseen circumstances.\\"[119][120]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 22, 2016, Bieber released a new single with Major Lazer and M? titled \\"Cold Water\\". It debuted at number two, on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Bieber's third number-two debut on the chart, passing Mariah Carey's record to become the artist with the most number-two debuts; he also leads with the most top-two debuts at five.[121] In August 2016, French DJ DJ Snake and Bieber released their collaborative song \\"Let Me Love You\\" The song peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100.[122] Bieber and Post Malone released Deja Vu as the fourth single from Malone's debut album Stoney in September 2016.[123] He appears in the documentary Bodyguards: Secret Lives from the Watchtower.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 16, 2017, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee released a remix for their song \\"Despacito\\" featuring Justin Bieber. The song was Justin's first release in 2017 and the first in which he sings in Spanish.[125] The remix boosted the original song to the Hot 100's Top 10, being the first mostly Spanish language top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 since Macarena in 1996.[126] The remix is the most viewed song of all time on the crowdsourced media knowledge base Genius, with 21.2 million views.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber, along with Quavo, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Wayne provided vocals on DJ Khaled's single \\"I'm the One\\", released on April 28, 2017. The song reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.[128] One week later, Despacito topped the charts in the US, making the single the first mostly Spanish-language Hot 100 No. 1 in more than 20 years, becoming his fifth number one single and it made Bieber the first artist ever to notch new No. 1s in back-to-back weeks.[129] On June 9, 2017, French DJ David Guetta's single \\"2U\\", in which Bieber was featured, was released. The music video to \\"2U\\" is Victoria's Secret models lip synching to the song.[130][131][132]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 17, 2017, Bieber released the single \\"Friends\\" with American record producer and songwriter BloodPop. Songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter reunited with Bieber to construct the song, just as they helped create his single \\"Sorry\\" in 2015 on his studio album Purpose.[133] Bieber did not attend the 2018 Grammy Awards Show to perform the nominated song \\"Despacito\\", claiming that he would not make any award show appearances until his next album was finished.[134]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2018, Bieber reunited with DJ Khaled in \\"No Brainer\\" co-featuring Chance The Rapper and Quavo. He also featured in the accompanying music video.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber's music is mainly pop, while he also incorporates elements of R&B. In 2010, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone asserted that the content of his music was \\"offering a gentle introduction to the mysteries and heartaches of adolescence: songs flushed with romance but notably free of sex itself\\".[136] In January 2012, Bieber told V magazine that he doesn't want to sing about sex, drugs and swearing. He stated \\"I want to do it at my own pace. I dont want to start singing about things like sex, drugs and swearing. Im into love, and maybe Ill get more into making love when Im older. But I want to be someone who is respected by everybody.\\"[137] But since then, Bieber gradually altered his artistry, with Peter Gicas of E! Online describing \\"PYD\\" as \\"sexed-up\\", while In Touch Weekly magazine describing his song with Maejor Ali and Juicy J \\"Lolly\\" might make his fans a bit uncomfortable because of its lyrics.[138][139] After his hit in 2015 on Jack 's track Where R  Now, Bieber released the EDM-fuelled album Purpose a collaboration with Diplo, DJ Snake and Major Lazer.[140]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber has cited The Beatles, Boyz II Men, Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson, Justin Timberlake, and Usher as his musical inspirations.[141][142][143] Bieber stated My World 2.0 was influenced by Timberlake.[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber initially sang with a boy soprano voice,[145] before his voice broke, as was evidenced during a performance of \\"Pray\\" at the 2010 American Music Awards. Sean Michaels of The Guardian described puberty as \\"the biggest threat to his career\\" at the time.[146] Jody Rosen commented that Bieber sings with \\"swing and rhythmic dexterity\\" on his debut album, noting his tone to be \\"nasal\\".[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber started to receive voice coaching from Jan Smith in 2008.[147]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an adult singer, Bieber's voice type is tenor.[148][149] In a review of his Purpose album, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph complimented his \\"soft, supple and seductive singing.\\"[150] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian also praised Biebers \\"affectedly breathy voice\\", noting that \\"the voice soon palls, but the songs are often interesting.\\"[151]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber endorsed Adidas, beside Derrick Rose and Venus Williams, in 2012.[152] He became the new \\"face\\" and \\"body\\" of Calvin Klein in early 2015.[153] In June 2015, Bieber teamed up with StarShop, a new shopping app launched by Kevin Harrington.[154] In January 2015, Entertainment Tonight reported that entertainer Justin Bieber had used MYO-X, a dietary supplement, in preparation for a Calvin Klein underwear photo shoot.[155] Bieber was criticized for \\"hyping the latest 'miracle' supplement MYO-X, to his 59 million Twitter fans.\\"[156] Bieber endorses Beats By Dre, Elizabeth Arden and Best Buy.[157][158]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has bandwagoned four fragrances as of 2014.[159] He launched his debut fragrance, Someday, in 2011;[159] it grossed more than three million US dollars in sales, at Macy's, in just under three weeks, which industry experts regard as a successful celebrity-led launch.[160] On the heels of that 2011 best-seller, he launched his second fragrance, Girlfriend, in June 2012.[161] His third fragrance, The Key, was launched in July 2013,[162] and his latest fragrance, Justin Bieber Collector's Edition, launched in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsher commented that while he and Bieber were both signed at the same age, \\"I had the chance to ramp up my success, where this has happened to Bieber abruptly\\". As a result, Usher, Braun, Bieber's bodyguard, and other adults surrounding Bieber constantly coach him on handling fame and his public image.[22] After signing Bieber, Usher appointed one of his former assistants, Ryan Good, to be Bieber's road manager and stylist. Good, once nicknamed Bieber's \\"swagger coach\\", created a \\"streetwise look\\" for the singer which consisted of baseball caps, hoodies, dog chains, and flashy sneakers. Amy Kaufman of The Los Angeles Times comments, \\"Though a product of a middle-class suburban upbringing in Stratford, Ontario, Bieber's manner of dress and speech ('Wassup man, how you doin'?' or 'It's like, you know, whateva' ') suggest he's mimicking his favourite rappers.\\"[163] In 2013, Bieber said that he was \\"very influenced by black culture\\", but he neither thought \\"of it as black or white\\" nor tried to \\"act or pose in a certain way\\". To him, it was \\"a lifestylelike a suaveness or a swag\\".[164] Wax statues of him with his hairstyle from that of his earlier career are on display at the Madame Tussauds wax museums in Amsterdam, London, and New York City.[165]\\r\\n\\r\\nScooter Braun, Bieber's manager, in 2013[164]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber was often featured in teen magazines, such as Tiger Beat,[22] and has been labelled as a \\"teen heartthrob\\".[166] In 2010, he was frequently criticized for looking and sounding younger than his age,[167] and the following year for an androgynous appearance, which had been commonly noted in the media, including his appearance on the cover of LOVE magazine's androgyny issue in 2011.[168] His teen-pop music, image (especially as a heartthrob to girls), and the media attention he receives have additionally been criticized.[167] He has been a target of Internet bloggers and message board posters, especially users of the Internet message board 4chan and of YouTube.[169] Nick Collins of The Daily Telegraph said that \\"Bieber's character appears to strike a particularly sour note with his Internet critics\\" who have questioned his manner of speech, among other things.[167]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber's early fanbase developed on YouTube and predated the release of his debut album My World.[170] According to Jan Hoffman of The New York Times, part of Bieber's appeal stems from his YouTube channel. Chicago Tribune noted that Bieber's fanbase, \\"Beliebers\\", was among the top words of 2010.[171] Long before the November 2009 release of My World, his YouTube videos attracted millions of views.[22] Braun recognized the appeal. Before flying him to Atlanta, Braun wanted to \\"build him up more on YouTube first\\" and had Bieber record more home videos for the channel. \\"I said: 'Justin, sing like theres no one in the room. But let's not use expensive cameras.' We'll give it to kids, let them do the work, so that they feel like it's theirs\\", recalled Braun.[22] Bieber continues to upload videos to the same channel and has opened a Twitter account, from which he interacts with fans regularly;[27] his account was reported to have more than six million followers in November 2010.[172] Bieber surpassed Lady Gaga for having the most followed person on Twitter in January 2013. In early November 2013, Katy Perry surpassed him for having the most followers.[173] As of 2017, Bieber remains the second most followed user of Twitter, while his VEVO channel made him the third most subscribed user of YouTube until by 2018 where it became the second most subscribed user of YouTube.\\r\\nThe music video for Bieber's song \\"Baby\\" is the most disliked on YouTube, receiving over 7.8 million dislikes since its upload in 2010, as of  2017[update].[174] Guinness Book of World Records listed \\"Baby\\" as the most disliked video on YouTube and on the Internet as of 2013[175] and six of Bieber's music videos (more than any other artist) listed in the top 40 most disliked videos on YouTube.[176] Bieber was frequently a trending topic on Twitter when the feature first launched[177] because his fans frequently discussed him on the network,[178] and he was named the top trending star on Twitter in 2010;[179] Klout gave his account a score of 100.[180][181] In April 2013, the social media analysis company Socialbakers concluded that 16.7 million of Bieber's 37 million Twitter followers are not genuine.[182][183]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Bieber resides in the United States, he is reported to possess an O-1 visa for temporary resident status, based on \\"extraordinary ability or achievement\\" in a field.[184] Bieber has stated that he is not interested in obtaining US citizenship. He has praised Canada as being \\"the best country in the world\\" citing its government-run health care system as a model example.[185] In September 2018, TMZ reported that Bieber had begun the process of becoming an American citizen upon marriage to Hailey Baldwin.[186]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber's father, Jeremy Bieber, is a former carpenter and pro-am mixed martial artist. In March 2014, Rolling Stone characterized Jeremy as having \\"split with Justin's mom when Justin was a toddler, and wasn't always around afterward. But he has, as of late, accepted a place of honor in his superstar son's entourage\\".[187]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2010, Bieber began dating Selena Gomez. After separating in November 2012, they reconciled a few weeks later before splitting up again in January 2013.[188][189][190][191][192] They later reconciled for a few months in each of 2013, 2014, and 2015.[193][194] Late in 2017, it was reported that they had gotten back together again. However, they broke up again in March 2018.[195][196]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of July 7, 2018, Bieber is engaged to American model and television personality Hailey Baldwin.[197] They had briefly dated from December 2015 to January 2016 before splitting, then reconciled in May 2018. Bieber and Baldwin obtained a marriage license in September 2018,[198] leading to reports that they had a civil marriage ceremony at that time, with a religious ceremony to come shortly.[199] On September 14, Baldwin stated on Twitter that she and Bieber had not yet married, and were planning for the upcoming ceremony.[199]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber's mother is Christian and raised him in that faith.[200] Bieber has described himself as a faithful adherent of Christianity, said he communicates with God via prayer, and that \\"he's the reason I'm here\\".[201] He reflected his faith in a music video with Brandon Burke, titled \\"#iPledge\\", in which he talks about God's forgiveness.[202] He was baptized by Pentecostal pastor Carl Lentz of Hillsong Church New York, who is a close friend, on January 9, 2014, after a born again experience.[203][204] On his Purpose tour he invited his pastor Judah Smith up on stage.[200] Many of Bieber's tattoos have religious significance including the medium-sized cross on his chest and a tiny cross under his eye. Bieber also covered up the \\"Son of God\\" text tattooed on his abdomen with a large design that features two angels, gothic arches, a skeleton and a serpent.[205]\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding sexual abstinence, Bieber told music magazine Rolling Stone in 2011, \\"I don't think you should have sex with anyone unless you love them.\\" He added that he does not \\"believe in abortion\\", and that it is \\"like killing a baby.\\" When asked about the case of abortion with regard to rape, however, he said, \\"I guess I haven't been in that position, so I wouldn't be able to judge that.\\"[185][206] His view on sexual orientation is quoted as \\"everyone's own decision\\",[207] and he has contributed to the It Gets Better Project,[208] a non-profit group aiming to prevent suicide among LGBT youth.[209]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber supports Pencils of Promise,[210] a charity founded by Adam Braun, the younger brother of Bieber's manager. The organization builds schools in developing countries, and Bieber became manager for the organization's campaign in Guatemala. He serves as a celebrity spokesman for the organization[211] by running ads for the charity and its campaign \\"Schools4All\\".[212][213] He promises to visit schools that donate the most funds to the organization.[214] He takes part in the charity's fund-raising galas and donates parts of the proceeds from his concerts and Someday line of fragrances,[215] and various merchandising to the charity. He also appears in an animal welfare PSA for PETA encouraging people to volunteer at and adopt from animal shelters instead of buying pets from breeders or pet stores.[216] In 2013, Bieber launched his online #GiveBackPhilippines campaign for helping the victims of Typhoon Haiyan and travelled to Philippines after raising $3 million.[217] His work for The Philippines earned him a star on the Walk of Fame Philippines.[218] He also supports Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and Alzheimer's Association.[219][220]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber had several run-ins with the law around the world before his first arrest in 2014,[221] including when he was accused of reckless driving in his neighbourhood in 2012, and charged in Brazil with vandalism in 2013.[221][222] One of his neighbours in Calabasas, California, accused Bieber of throwing eggs at his home on January 9, 2014, and causing thousands of dollars of damage.[221][223][224] On January 23, 2014, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, together with singer Khalil, on suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), driving with an over six month expired license, and resisting arrest without violence.[222][225][226] Police said that Bieber told authorities he had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana, and taken prescription drugs.[221] He has been released from these charges on a $2,500 bond.[227] A toxicology report revealed that Bieber had THC (a principal constituent of cannabis) and the anti-anxiety medication Xanax in his system at the time of his arrest.[228][229]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Bieber's arrest on the DUI charge, more than 270,000 people petitioned the White House seeking to have him deported from the United States. Although the number of signatures received was sufficient to require a response under published White House guidelines, the Obama Administration declined substantive comment on the petition.[230] Immigration Law expert Harlan York noted that the likelihood of Bieber being deported was extremely slim. York stated, \\"About a decade ago, the Supreme Court ruled that driving under the influence, typically, is not a basis to deport someone.\\"[231]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 9, 2014, Bieber was charged with one misdemeanour count of vandalism in California for throwing eggs at his Calabasas neighbour's home in January.[224][232][233] Police earlier claimed that they had video footage of him high-fiving friends after the eggs were thrown.[224][234] With him pleading no contest to the charge, the Los Angeles County Superior Court sentenced him on July 9 to pay US$80,900 in restitution, serve two years' probation, complete twelve weeks of anger management, and five days of community service in what the district attorney termed a negotiated settlement. Since then, he has permanently moved to Beverly Hills, California.[224][232][233]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 13, 2014, the January DUI case was settled with a plea bargain; Bieber pleaded guilty to resisting an officer without violence and a lesser charge of driving without due care and attention. He was fined US$500 and sentenced to attend a 12-hour anger management course and a program that teaches the impact of drunken driving on victims. As part of the plea bargain, he made a US$50,000 contribution to Our Kids, a local children's charity.[235][236]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber reflects in a video posted in January 2015[237]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 1, 2014, Bieber was arrested and charged with assault and dangerous driving near his hometown of Stratford, Ontario, after a collision between a minivan and Bieber's all-terrain vehicle on August 29. Ontario police said that he then \\"engaged in a physical altercation\\" with an occupant of the minivan. He was released shortly and his lawyer blamed the incident on \\"the unwelcome presence of paparazzi\\".[238][239] On September 8, Toronto dropped an assault charge against him originally brought up on January 29 for an incident with a limousine driver in December 2013.[240][241] In November 2014, he was ordered to appear in Argentina within 60 days by a Buenos Aires court to give testimony on an alleged assault on a photographer on November 9, 2013.[242] When he failed to do so, an arrest warrant was issued and two of his bodyguards were released in Argentina in April 2015.[243]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2014, a video emerged of a 15-year-old Bieber telling a joke about black people, which used the word \\"nigger\\" multiple times.[244] In the same month, a second video showed a 15-year-old Bieber giggling as he croons his song \\"One Less Lonely Girl\\", but parodying the main lyric as \\"One less lonely nigger\\", and stating that if he were to kill one, he would be \\"part of the KKK\\".[245][246] He apologized the day the latter was released: \\"Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with.\\"[247]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2017, the Chinese government banned Justin Bieber from performing in China. A Chinese Bieber fan reached out to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture requesting the reason for the ban. The Bureau released a statement, explaining \\"Justin Bieber is a gifted singer, but he is also a controversial young foreign singer\\", and \\"In order to maintain order in the Chinese market and purify the Chinese performance environment, it is not suitable to bring in badly behaved entertainers.\\"[248][249]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout his career, Bieber has sold an estimated 140 million records,[250] and is one of the best-selling music artists globally.[251] On November 23, 2012, Bieber was presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal by the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper. He was one of 60,000 Canadians to receive the Diamond Jubilee medal that year.[252] In 2013, Bieber received a Diamond award from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to recognize his single \\"Baby\\" as the highest-certified digital song of all time.[253][254] Bieber has earned ten Grammy nominations (including one win),[255][256][257] two Brit awards,[258][259] four NRJ Music Award nominations (including three wins),[260][261][262] thirteen Billboard Music Awards,[263] and numerous fan voted accolades which include eight American Music Awards and[264] twenty Teen Choice Awards.[265] He also has won eighteen MTV Europe Music Awards, which is the most awards received by a single artist to date.[266]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 13, 2015, the release of Purpose marked his sixth album to debut at number one. He also became the first artist, since Elvis Presley in 2005, to replace his own song as number one on the UK Singles Chart.[267] As of 2016, Bieber has received fourteen titles in the Guinness World Records, which include eight that were achieved from the success of his album Purpose  and was featured in the 2017 Edition. These records included the most streamed track on Spotify in one week, the most streamed album on Spotify in one week, the most simultaneous tracks and most simultaneous new entries on the US Billboard Hot 100 by a solo artist, the first act to occupy all top three positions simultaneously on the UK Singles Chart, the most followers on Twitter by a male, the most viewed music channel on YouTube by an individual, and the most subscribers on YouTube for a musician by a male.[268]\\r\\n\\r\\nBieber was included among the top ten in The Highest-Paid Celebrities Under 30 annual list in the world by Forbes magazine.

Politically, Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States, which according to the U.S. Supreme Court's Insular Cases is \\"a territory appurtenant and belonging to the United States, but not a part of the United States within the revenue clauses of the Constitution.\\"[1][2] The basic question regarding this issue is whether Puerto Rico should remain a U.S. territory, become a U.S. state or become an independent country.\\r\\nAmerican and Puerto Rican political activities regarding the status question have revolved around three sets of initiatives: presidential executive orders, bills in the U.S. Congress, and referenda held in Puerto Rico. U.S. Presidents have issued three executive orders on the subject, and Congress has considered four major bills on Puerto Rico's political status. Puerto Rican status referenda have been held four times to determine the desired political status of Puerto Rico in relation to the United States of America. At the November 6, 2012, non-binding referendum on the status question, 54% of respondents voted to reject the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution,[3] while in a second question 61% favored statehood as the preferred alternative.[4] Another referendum was held on June 11, 2017, in which voters had three options: \\"Statehood\\", \\"Free Association/Independence\\" or \\"Current Territorial Status\\". An overwhelming 97% of voters chose \\"Statehood\\", although turnout was only 23% due to a boycott from opponents to statehood.\\r\\nIn 2009, 2011, and most recently in 2016, The United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self-determination in Puerto Rico.[5][6][7] Internationally, the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity.[8][9] More specifically, the Special Committee's June 2016 report called for the United States \\"... to allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner, and to address their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment, marginalization, insolvency and poverty\\".[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States acquired the islands of Puerto Rico in 1898 after the SpanishÿAmerican War. In 1950, Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 81-600) authorizing Puerto Rico to hold a constitutional convention and in 1952, the people of Puerto Rico ratified a constitution establishing a republican form of government for the island. After being approved by Congress and the President in July 1952 and thus given force under federal law (P.L. 82-447), the new constitution went into effect on July 25, 1952.\\r\\nPuerto Rico has been under U.S. sovereignty for over a century and Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917.[11][12][13] Since the promulgation of the current Commonwealth constitution in 1952, further local attempts to change the island's political status took place in 1967, 1993, and 1998. An additional referendum held in 1991 sought to amend the relationship through an amendment to the Puerto Rican constitution. Each time, the results favored retaining the current status over the possible independence of Puerto Rico and statehood alternatives.\\r\\nAs a result of Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. territory, the citizens of Puerto Rico do not have any voting representation in the U.S. Federal government. Instead of outright representation through Senators and House Representatives, Puerto Rico has one non-voting Resident Commissioner in the House of Representatives. Furthermore, Puerto Rico is not represented in the Electoral College, and thus U.S. citizens resident there are unable to vote in U.S. presidential elections. Citizens of Puerto Rico can vote in the Republican and Democratic primary elections.\\r\\nAlthough Puerto Rico presently has a certain amount of local autonomy, according to the U.S. Constitution ultimate governance of the island is retained by both the U.S. Congress and President.[14][15][16] Thus, results of plebiscites, whether or not authorized by Congress, while they reflect public sentiment, and thus bear some impact, can be ignored by Congress. Ultimately, the results of Puerto Rican plebiscites are opinions, although congressional resolutions have expressed support for following the will of the Puerto Rican people.[17][full citation needed]\\r\\nThe English term commonwealth \\"does not describe or provide for any specific political status or relationship ... [and] when used in connection with areas under U.S. sovereignty that are not states...broadly describes an area that is self-governing under a constitution of its adoption and whose right of self-government will not be unilaterally withdrawn by Congress\\".[18] It is the same terminology used elsewhere but with other different meanings than what is meant for Puerto Rico:\\r\\nBut in the United States, \\"commonwealth\\" is also a term, without a clear and stable legal definition, now and previously used by current and past possessions of the United States:\\r\\nJuan R. Torruella, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (which has jurisdiction over the Federal Court for the District of Puerto Rico), claims that the use of the term commonwealth is a label that \\"can deceive and obscure the true nature of things\\". He contends that Puerto Rico is obviously not a state, and that \\"neither Puerto Rico's status nor its relationship with the U.S. supports any legitimate claim that a British type of \\"commonwealth\\" exists between Puerto Rico and the United States\\".[21]\\r\\nThen U.S. Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman, under whose Department resided responsibility of Puerto Rican affairs, clarified the new commonwealth label by stating, \\"The bill (to permit Puerto Rico to write its own constitution) merely authorizes the people of Puerto Rico to adopt their own constitution and to organize a local government. ... The bill under consideration would not change Puerto Rico's political, social, and economic relationship to the United States.\\"[22]\\r\\nIt has been said that \\"any inquiry into Puerto Rico's status must begin with the Constitution of the United States, as well as various Supreme Court and lower court decisions\\".[23]\\r\\nAlmost immediately after Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States, Puerto Rico's political status was defined by a series of landmark decisions made by the U.S. Supreme Court in what are collectively known as The Insular Cases. From 1901 to 1905, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution extended ex proprio vigore to the territories. However, the Court in these cases also established the doctrine of territorial incorporation. Under the same, the Constitution only applied fully in incorporated territories such as Alaska and Hawaii, whereas it only applied partially in the new unincorporated territories of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. Although other cases followed, strictly speaking the Insular Cases are the original six opinions issued concerning acquired territories as a result of the Treaty of Paris (1898). The six cases were:[24]\\r\\nOther authorities, such as Jos Tras Monge, state that the list also includes these additional two cases:[26]\\r\\nThe Supreme Court later made other rulings. For example, in Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U.S. 298, 305 (1922), explained the distinction between an incorporated and a non-incorporated territory. Juan R. Torruella restated it this way, \\"an unincorporated territory is a territory as to which, when acquired by the United States, no clear intention was expressed that it would eventually be incorporated into the Union as a State\\".[29]\\r\\nSince the Insular Cases had established that only those rights in the U.S. Bill of Rights that are determined to be \\"fundamental\\" are applicable in unincorporated territories, the implications of Balzac v. Porto Rico have been enormous. For example:\\r\\nIn a brief concurrence in the United States Supreme Court judgment of Torres v. Puerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465 (1979), Supreme Court Justice Brennan, argued that any implicit limits from the Insular Cases on the basic rights granted by the Constitution (including especially the Bill of Rights) were anachronistic in the 1970s.[35]\\r\\nPuerto Rico's current political status limits to the autonomy of the Puerto Rican government. For example, the Island's government is not fully autonomous, and the level of federal presence in the Island is commonplace, including a branch of the United States Federal District Court.\\r\\nPeople born in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are natural-born U.S. citizens. Puerto Ricans are also covered by a group of \\"fundamental civil rights\\" but, because Puerto Rico is not a state, they are not covered by the full Bill of Rights. All residents must pay federal taxes but, for a variety of reasons, only some pay federal income taxes.[36][note 1]\\r\\nIn 2017, the Government Accountability Office estimated that corporations paid $1.42 billion in taxes.[which?] Had Puerto Rico been a state, corporations would have paid an estimated $5 billion to $9.3 billion.[which?][53]\\r\\nPuerto Ricans lack a voting representative in the U.S. Congress, but they do have a Resident Commissioner who has a voice in Congress (but no vote other than committee-level voting). Puerto Ricans must also serve in the United States military whenever it is compulsory in the mainland United States, with the same duties and obligations as U.S. citizens residing in the 50 states.\\r\\nGovernor Alejandro Garca Padilla signed legislation which would have allowed corporations owned by the Commonwealth to declare bankruptcy.[54] However, in Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust (2016), the U.S. Supreme Court, by a vote of 5-2, found the legislation was void because it was preempted by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissenting.[55]\\r\\nIn Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle (2016) the U.S. Supreme Court found that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution forbids successive criminal prosecutions by the Commonwealth and the Federal Government because they are not separate sovereigns.[56]\\r\\nOn June 30, 2016, President Barack Obama signed the PROMESA into law, which empowered him to appoint a seven-member Financial Oversight and Management Board that has ultimate control over the Commonwealth's budget.[57]\\r\\nPuerto Rico's main political issue is the territory's relationship with the United States. A United States territory since 1898, and known as \\"Estado Libre Asociado\\" (Free Associated State) or as commonwealth since 1952, Puerto Rico today is torn by profound ideological rifts, as represented by its political parties, which stand for three distinct future political scenarios: the status quo (commonwealth), statehood, and independence. The Popular Democratic Party (PPD) seeks to maintain or improve the current status towards becoming a more sovereign territory of the United States, the New Progressive Party (PNP) seeks to fully incorporate Puerto Rico as a U.S. state, and the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) seeks national independence.\\r\\nWhen asked, in non-binding plebiscites, to choose between independence, statehood, or continuation of the status quo with enhanced powers, as proposed by the PPD, Puerto Ricans have voted to remain a commonwealth. In the penultimate plebiscite in 1998, Puerto Ricans voted for \\"none of the above\\" by a slight majority. This has variously been interpreted as: \\"the people of Puerto Rico exercised their inalienable right to self-determination, and a majority of themfully 50.3 percent, to be exactchose to remain a colony. One might also say, however, the oldest strategy for governing recalcitrant subjectsdivide and conquerwas subtly at work.\\"[58][59]\\r\\nIt is clear, however, that they are dissatisfied by their current status. The issue is debated and is on the agenda of all the political parties and civil society groups. Several pro-commonwealth leaders within the PPD are proposing an Associated Republic or Free Association similar to that of the former U.S. territories of the Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands or Palau.\\r\\nIn general, three main alternatives were presented to Puerto Rican voters in status plebiscites:\\r\\nThe exact expectations for each of these status formulas are a matter of debate by a given position's adherents and detractors. Puerto Ricans have proposed positions that modify the alternatives above:\\r\\nThe following table summarizes the results of Puerto Rico's plebiscites so far.\\r\\nIn the Puerto Rican status referendum, 2012[68] 54.00%of voters indicated \\"No\\" to maintaining the current political status. A full 61.11% of voters chose statehood, 33.34% chose free association, and 5.55% chose independence.[69][70] Because there were almost 500,000 blank ballots, creating confusion as to the voters' true desire, Congress decided to ignore the vote.[71][72] The 2014 budget bill included $2.5 million in funding for a future vote on Puerto Rico's political status.[73][74]\\r\\nThe previous plebiscites provided voters with three options: remain a Commonwealth, Statehood and Independence/Free Association. The Puerto Rican status referendum, 2017 was to offer only two options: Statehood and Independence/Free Association. If the majority favor Independence/Free Association, a second vote will be held to determine the preference: full independence as a nation or associated free state status with independence but with a \\"free and voluntary political association\\" between Puerto Rico and the United States. The specifics of the association agreement[75] would be detailed in the Compact of Free Association that would be negotiated between the U.S. and Puerto Rico. That document might cover topics such as the role of the US military in Puerto Rico, the use of the US currency, free trade between the two entities, and whether Puerto Ricans would be U.S. citizens.[76]\\r\\nGovernor Ricardo Rossell܇ is strongly in favor of statehood to help develop the economy and help to \\"solve our 500-year-old colonial dilemma ... Colonialism is not an option .... Its a civil rights issue ... 3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy,\\" he told the news media.[77][78]\\r\\nStatehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis, since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection. According to the Government Development Bank, this might be the only solution to the debt crisis. Congress has the power to vote to allow Chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood, but in late 2015 there was very little support in the House for this concept. Other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and Medicaid funding, the right to vote in Presidential elections and the higher (federal) minimum wage.[79]\\r\\nAt approximately the same time as the referendum, Puerto Rico's legislators are also expected to vote on a bill that would allow the Governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the federal Congress. Regardless of the outcome of the votes, Congress will be the body to make the final decision on the status of Puerto Rico.[78]\\r\\nVarious U.S. presidents have signed executive orders to help define, study, and generate activity regarding the political status of Puerto Rico. Three major orders were the 2005, 2007, and 2011 executive orders to establish the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status.\\r\\nThe Territories Clause of the United States Constitution (Art. IV, Sec. 3, cl. 2) allows for Congress to \\"dispose of\\" Puerto Rico and allow it to become independent of the U.S. (in the same way as the Philippines did in 1945) or, under the authority of the Admissions Clause (Art. IV, Sec. 3, cl. 1) for it to be admitted as a state of the United States (with a vote of Congress in the same way that Alaska and Hawaii were admiited in 1958 and 1959 respectively).\\r\\nSince Congress must approve of any political status change for Puerto Rico, some argue that \\"congressional agreement to the options [on a ballot], prior to a plebiscite would save the people of Puerto Rico the grief of an emotionally draining and politically divisive vote that might result in a status not acceptable to Congress\\".[80] Former Resident Commissioner and Former Governor Carlos Romero Barcel܇ echoed this sentiment when he recalled, at a 1997 congressional hearing, that both \\"[Representatives] Young and Miller were clear in stating [in their March 3, 1997, letter to the presidents of the three political parties in Puerto Rico] that there was no purpose in presenting the people of Puerto Rico a status definition which does not represent an option that the Congress will be willing to ratify should it be approved in a plebiscite.\\"[81]\\r\\nA catalyst for the legislative activity taking place in Congress was the release in December 2005 of the presidential task force's report.[82] Per United States v. Sanchez, 992 F.2d 1143, 1152ÿ53 (11th Cir. 1993), \\"Congress continues to be the ultimate source of power [over Puerto Rico] pursuant to the Territory Clause of the Constitution\\". (quoting United States v. Andino, 831 F.2d 1164, 1176 (1st Cir. 1987) (Torruella, J., concurring), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1034 (1988)), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 11 10 (1994).9[83] An Act of Congress, thus, is ultimately required to modify the current political status of Puerto Rico.\\r\\nOn June 9, 2016, in Commonwealth of Puerto Rico vs Sanchez Valle, a 6-2 majority of the United States Supreme Court determined that Puerto Rico is a territory and lacks sovereignty. The opinion of the court stated: \\"Back of the Puerto Rican people and their Constitution, the 'ultimate' source of prosecutorial power remains the U. S. Congress, just as back of a citys charter lies a state government.\\"[84]\\r\\nFour major bills regarding the political status of Puerto Rico have come before Congress, H.R. 856, H.R. 900, H.R. 2499, and H.R. 2000.\\r\\nThe United Nations has intervened in the past to evaluate the legitimacy of Puerto Rico's political status, to ensure that the island's government structure complies with the standards of self-government that constitute the basic tenets of the United Nations Charter, its covenants, and its principles of international law. Some authorities, such as Trias Monge, argue that Puerto Rico \\"clearly does not meet the decolonization standards set by the United Nations in 1960\\".[85]\\r\\nDuring its 8th session, the United Nations General Assembly recognized Puerto Rico's self-government on November 27, 1953, with Resolution 748 (VIII).[86] (UN Resolution \\"748 (VIII)\\", adopted on November 27, 1953, during its 459th Plenary Meeting.) This removed Puerto Rico's classification as a non-self-governing territory (under article 73(e) of the Charter of the United Nations). The resolution passed, garnering a favorable vote from some 40% of the General Assembly, with over 60% abstaining or voting against it (20 to 16, plus 18 abstentions). Today, however, the UN \\"still debates whether Puerto Rico is a colony\\" or not.[87]\\r\\nHowever, Puerto Rico's political status is still debated in many international forums, possibly in part because of the circumstances surrounding the vote: \\"Under United States pressure, General Assembly Resolution 748 passedthough only narrowly and with many countries abstaining. The debate over Resolution 748 prompted the United Nations to agree on governing arrangements that would provide full self-government to non-self-governing territories: in United States terms, these arrangements were statehood, independence, and free association. Yet, under international law, a freely associated state is a sovereign nation in a joint governing arrangement with another nation that either nation can unilaterally end.\\"[88] Though the subject continues to be debated in many forums it is clear that (1) the current territorial status has not satisfied Puerto Rican political leaders,[88] and (2) that despite the divergent views that Puerto Ricans have with respect to their preferred political status, 'all factions agree on the need to end the present undemocratic arrangement whereby Puerto Rico is subject to the laws of Congress but cannot vote in it.'[88]\\r\\nThe list of factors for determining when a colony has achieved a full measure of self-government appears in Resolution 1541 (XV) of the General Assembly of the United Nations, 15 UN GAOR Supplement (No. 16) at 29, UN Document A/4684 (1960).[89][90]\\r\\nThe General Assembly did not apply its full list of criteria to Puerto Rico[90][91] for determining whether or not self-governing status had been achieved. The UN's Committee on Non-Self-Governing States recently unanimously agreed to ask the General Assembly to take up the issue of Puerto Rico.[92] In June 2007, the Puerto Rico Senate approved a Concurrent Resolution urging the UN General Assembly to discuss Puerto Rico's case.\\r\\nStarting in 1971, \\"Cuba introduced annual resolutions on the issue in the UN's Decolonization Committee but the United States has blocked General Assembly action and stopped cooperating with the Decolonization Committee. On August 23, 1973, the United States vigorously opposed that members of Puerto Rico's independence movement be allowed to speak at the UN.[93] The U.S. position has not been that Puerto Rico is not a territory; rather, the U.S. position of record, based on General Assembly Resolution 748, is that the Decolonization Committee lacks jurisdiction, that the matter is one for the United States and Puerto Rico to resolve, and that Puerto Rico has not sought a new status.\\"[88]\\r\\nIn 1972, the UN set a precedent when, after approving Puerto Rico's association with the United States in 1953[94] as sufficient evidence to remove PR from the list of Colonized Countries, the United Nations reopened the matter in 1972 and it is still under review.[95][96][97] \\"Failure [of the United States] to include independence as an option and harassment of [Puerto Rican] pro-independence organizations were reasons for the United Nations' recent reconsideration of the status of Puerto Rico\\".[97]\\r\\nSince 1972, the Decolonization Committee has called for Puerto Rico's decolonization and for the United States to recognize the island's right to self-determination and independence. Most recently, the Decolonization Committee called for the General Assembly to review the political status of Puerto Rico, a power reserved by the 1953 resolution.[98][99]\\r\\nIn 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stated that Congress may unilaterally repeal the Puerto Rican Constitution or the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice.[100] In a 1996 report on a Puerto Rico status political bill, the U.S. House Committee on Resources stated, \\"Puerto Rico's current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self-government under Resolution 1541\\" (the three established forms of full self-government being stated in the report as (1) national independence, (2) free association based on separate sovereignty, or (3) full integration with another nation on the basis of equality). The report concluded that Puerto Rico \\"remains an unincorporated territory and does not have the status of 'free association' with the United States as that status is defined under United States law or international practice\\", and that the establishment of local self-government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the U.S. Congress.[101][102] The application of the U.S. Constitution applies partially to Puerto Rico by the Insular Cases.\\r\\nSince 1953, the UN has been considering the political status of Puerto Rico and how to assist it in achieving \\"independence\\" or \\"decolonization\\". In 1978, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization determined that a \\"colonial relationship\\" existed between the US and Puerto Rico.[103]\\r\\nThe United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization has often referred to Puerto Rico as a nation in its reports, because, internationally, the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity.[9][8][104] In a June 2016 report, the Special Committee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self-determination in Puerto Rico. The group called on the United States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise fully their right to self-determination and independence. ... [and] allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner and to address their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment, marginalization, insolvency and poverty\\".[10]\\r\\nThough politically associated with the United States, Puerto Rico is considered by many other nations to have its own distinct national identity.[8] Internationally, it has been reported that \\"the Fourteenth Ministerial Conference of the Movement of Non-aligned Nations...reaffirms that Puerto Rican people constitute a Latin American and Caribbean nation.\\"[9]\\r\\nAlthough Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States classified as a commonwealth, many Puerto Ricans consider it to be a country in and of itself.[105][106][107][108] In their book on American expansionism titled The Louisiana Purchase and American Expansion, 1803ÿ1898, Sanford Levinson and Bartholomew H. Sparrow also determined that \\"Most Puerto Ricans consider themselves a distinct national group.\\"[109][110] They also observed that both Americans and Puerto Ricans see themselves as separate cultures\\"even separate nationalities\\".[111]\\r\\nAt the local level, it has been observed that Puerto Ricans \\"consider themselves a territorially distinct national unit, a nation defined by its cultural distinctiveness\\".[112] In recent plebiscites Puerto Ricans have not expressed themselves in favor of a political status with the intention of becoming a sovereign state, but the idea that Puerto Rico is a separate social, political and cultural entity from the United States has been repeatedly expressed.\\r\\nBoth major United States political parties (Democratic and Republican) have expressed their support for the U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico to exercise their right to self-determination, with the Republican Party platform explicitly mentioning support for statehood and the Democratic Party platform expressing explicitly broader support for right to self-determination.\\r\\nThe U.S.ÿPuerto Rico relationship is a matter of debate. Some contend that the current political status of Puerto Rico, perhaps with enhancements, remains a viable option. Others argue that commonwealth status is or should be only a temporary fix to be resolved in favor of other solutions considered permanent, non-colonial, and non-territorial. Some contend that if independence is achieved, the close relationship with the United States could be continued through compact negotiations with the federal government. One element apparently shared by all discussants is that the people of Puerto Rico seek to attain full, democratic representation, notably through voting rights on national legislation to which they are subject.[113]\\r\\nControversy exists surrounding the \\"real\\" political status of Puerto Rico, with some calling it a colony and others disagreeing.[114] Some (especially independentistas and statehooders) claim Puerto Rico is still a colony despite the UN's removing Puerto Rico from its list of non self-governing countries in 1953. Others (notably those who vote for the current commonwealth status option) argue that Puerto Rico is not a colony because the UN has not revoked its resolution after 55 years.\\r\\nSome authors have called Puerto Rico \\"the world's oldest colony\\" (2001)[115] and \\"one of the world's last colonies\\" (2004).[116] Former chief justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court Jos Tras Monge wrote a book that referred to it as the \\"oldest colony in the world\\".[117] Those who argue that Puerto Rico is still a colony insist that despite the UN resolution, Puerto Rico remains what some call a \\"post-colonial colony\\".[118] Defenders of this point of view argue that Puerto Rico has less self-determination than before the U.S. invasionit no longer has its own Puerto Rican citizenship,[119] free maritime control,[120] nor congressional representation as it did in the Spanish Cortes. Tras Monge argues that just prior to the U.S. invasion, Puerto Rico enjoyed greater freedom and rights in certain areas:\\r\\nYet those who claim Puerto Rico is not a colony will say that in its 8th session, the United Nations General Assembly recognized Puerto Rico's self-government on November 27, 1953, with Resolution 748.[86] This side points out that such recognition removed Puerto Rico's classification as a non-self-governing territory (under article 73(e) of the Charter of the United Nations). They add that the Resolution has not been revoked even though Puerto Rico's political status is still debated in many international forums.[121]\\r\\nThose who claim Puerto Rico is still a colony argue that Puerto Rico was vested with the commonwealth status by the U.S. Congress to give the appearance of self-government but that genuine decolonization never occurred.[122] These supporters claim that the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1947 allowed the U.S. to continue its colonial policy of Puerto Rico in a post-colonial world.[123] They see the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 (P.L. 600[124]) as a gimmick to maintain the colonial status of PR \\"The US Congress, however, carefully preserved its exclusive right to [unilaterally] alter the political status of Puerto Rico. Some saw the commonwealth as at best as temporary arrangement or at worst as a relic of the old colonial past.\\"[125] They also point to the fact that no change in the political status of Puerto Rico is possible unless authorized by the U.S. Congress as proof of the real current status.[125] Rivera Ramos argues that the \\"deepest question pertains to the source of rights and the source of authority to govern...In the case of [unincorporated] territories, the rights deemed to apply to their people, as well as those denied them, have their source in a constitution they have not approved nor have the power to amend\\".[126]\\r\\nThose who support the view that Puerto Rico is no longer a colony but has changed into a different status, the commonwealth, argue that since the 1952 Constitution Congress has indicated that they will respect the wishes of the people of Puerto Rico, indicating that this is evidence of the validity of the current status as a non-colony.\\r\\nThose claiming it is still a colony point to Congress legislating for Puerto Rico, and to bills where text such as those authorizing plebiscites in Puerto Rico (example \\"to conduct a second plebiscite between the options of (1) independence, (2) national sovereignty in association with the United States, and (3) U.S. statehood. The three options in the plebiscite also correspond to the options that the United Nations has identified as the options for decolonizing a territory.\\" (HR 2499, section 2(c) ) clearly include content to satisfy the United Nations demand for decolonizing a territory. In addition to judicial decisions like the 1993 U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit decision, which stated that Congress may unilaterally repeal the Puerto Rican Constitution or the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice.[100]\\r\\nSome claim that granting of U.S. citizenship on Puerto Ricans on March 2, 1917 was devised by the United States in order to further reiterate its hold of Puerto Rico as a possession while others claim that it was a serious attempt to pave the way for statehood.\\r\\nFormer chief of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court Jos Tras Monge insists that statehood was never intended for the island and that, unlike Alaska and Hawaii, which Congress deemed incorporated territories and slated for annexation to the Union from the start, Puerto Rico was kept \\"unincorporated\\" specifically to avoid offering it statehood.[127] And Myriam Marquez has stated that Puerto Ricans \\"fear that statehood would strip the people of their national identity, of their distinct culture and language\\".[128] Ayala and Bernabe add that the \\"purpose of the inclusion of U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans in the Jones Act of 1917 was an attempt by Congress to block independence and perpetuate Puerto Rico in its colonial status\\".[129] Proponents of the citizenship clause in the Jones Act argue that \\"the extension of citizenship did not constitute a promise of statehood but rather an attempt to exclude any consideration of independence\\".[130]\\r\\nThe preamble of the Commonwealth constitution approved by the people of Puerto Rico in 1952 in part reads: \\"We consider as determining factors in our life our citizenship of the United States of America and our aspiration continually to enrich our democratic heritage in the individual and collective enjoyment of its rights and privileges;\\r\\nFor the island's pro-statehood movement, the concession of U.S. citizenship has been seen, ever since, as the key that would eventually guarantee statehood for the island, as soon as the people of Puerto Rico demanded equality in citizenship.\\r\\nAs former Puerto Rico House of Representatives Speaker Miguel A. Garca Mndez subsequently declared, \\"For an American citizen, there cannot be another political goal other than equality with his or her fellow American citizens. To seek other solutions ÿ to repudiate equality ÿ is to repudiate the natural destiny of American citizenship.\\"[131]\\r\\nHowever, as early as 1912, President William Howard Taft had already said that there was no connection between the extension of citizenship to Puerto Ricans and the prospect of admission of Puerto Rico into the American Union. \\"I believe the demand for citizenship is just, and amply earned by the sustained loyalty on the part of the inhabitants of the island. But it should be remembered that the demand must be entirely dissociated from any thought of statehood\\".[132] President Taft's views in 1912 became a Supreme Court opinion when, in 1922, as Chief Justice, Taft wrote the opinion on Balzac, the last of the so-called Insular Cases.[133][134][135]\\r\\nThus, in the end, U.S. citizenship has had multiple meanings for Puerto Ricans. For some it is a welcome link to the United States, regardless of the political status of the territory. For others, it has been nothing more than an imposed identity by an imperial power. Still others regard it as a useful asset that provides access to certain rights and tangible benefits and opportunities. And there are those that cherish it as a constituent element of their self-image and identity.[136]\\r\\nSome contend that Puerto Rico cannot become a fully independent republic because there will be economic chaos and its citizens will die of hunger given that the land has no natural resources to sustain its population.[137][138] But others point to the example of countries that became independent, such as Ireland and Singapore and, though some containing less land and natural resources than Puerto Rico, today have economies far better than the Island.[139]\\r\\nAccording to educational scientists Francesco Cordasco and Eugene Bucchioni, in their 1973 work The Puerto Rican Experience: a Sociological Sourcebook, the belief that Puerto Rico cannot survive on its own results from teachings since grade school. \\"Puerto Ricans here and in Puerto Rico are taught three things: Puerto Rico is small and the US is big, Puerto Rico is poor and the US is rich, Puerto Rico is weak and the US is strong.\\"[140] This theory of non-sustainability is not new; it has been held by various groups at least since the 1930s.[141]\\r\\nCommonwealth partisans argue that Puerto Rico cannot afford statehood, that post-war economic growth in Puerto Rico was the result of special treatment via exemption from Federal corporate taxes. Statehooders respond that such tax exemptions primarily benefit the large industrialists and not the population as a whole since low income Puerto Ricans would not pay taxes.[142]\\r\\nAn example given by those who claim the Island will be able to support itself is Singapore, an island nation 14 times smaller than Puerto Rico with a drastically higher level of population density and fewer natural resources, which has surpassed the per capita income of larger nations, including the United States.[143]\\r\\n\\"In Puerto Rico, ever since you are a child, you are told that you live on a tiny island that has no natural resources, nothing. This is what they teach you in school, on TV, the media, and it's always negative. This perception is a byproduct of the island's political dependence on the U.S. Politicians here will name it 20,000 different ways, but in any dictionary Puerto Rico is a colony. And there is this colonized mentality that everything from abroad is better.\\"[144]\\r\\nJuan Mari Brs stated, \\"Only through a great unified movement looking beyond political and ideological differences, can the prevalent fears of hunger and persecution be overcome for the eventual liberation of Puerto Rico, breaking through domination by the greatest imperialist power of our age.\\"[145]\\r\\nAfter the invasion by the United States in 1898, the Americans made English the official language.[146][147] In 1991 under the pro-Commonwealth PPD administration of Rafael Hernndez Col܇n Spanish was declared the only official language in the Island. Then, in 1993, under the pro-statehood PNP administration of Pedro Rossell܇, the law was reversed, and English was again reinstated as an official language alongside Spanish.[148] In a 1993 survey by the Ateneo Puertorrique?o, a leading cultural institution in Puerto Rico, 93 percent of respondents indicated that they would not relinquish Spanish as their language if Puerto Rico ever became a state of the American Union, even if the United States required English as the only official language of the Island.[149][150]\\r\\nIn a First Circuit Court of Appeals case Igart~a v. United States, two of three members of the three-judge panel that dismissed the appeal on procedural grounds suggested in separate opinions that, in an en banc reconsideration, the United States could be required to extend full voting representation to the United States citizens in Puerto Rico if (1) the en banc Court determines that, contrary to current Circuit precedent, the Constitution does not prohibit extending such rights \\"under another source of law\\", (2) that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which, at Article 25, states that \\"[e]very citizen shall have the right and the opportunity...[t]o vote and to be elected at genuine and periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage\\", is self-executing.[151][152]\\r\\nMore Puerto Ricans live stateside in the U.S. than in Puerto Rico. A 2009 report by the Pew Hispanic Center indicates that, as of 2007, 4.1 million Puerto Ricans lived in the mainland versus 3.9 million living in the Island.[153] Since the 1967 referendum, there have been demands that stateside Puerto Ricans be allowed to vote in these plebiscites on the political status of Puerto Rico. Since the 1990s, the role of stateside Puerto Ricans in advocating for Puerto Rico in Washington, D.C., on issues such as the Navy's removal from Vieques and others has increased, especially given that there have been three voting members of the U.S. Congress who are stateside Puerto Ricans (two from New York City and one from Chicago), in contrast to Puerto Rico's single Resident Commissioner in the U.S. Congress with no vote.\\r\\nBetween February 24-March 6, 2006, the National Institute for Latino Policy conducted an opinion survey over the Internet of a broad cross-section of stateside Puerto Rican community leaders and activists across the United States. The survey had a total of 574 respondents, including 88 non-Puerto Rican members of the Institute's national network of community leaders.\\r\\nThe views of the 484 Puerto Ricans in the survey found broad support among them for the holding of a plebiscite on the future political status of Puerto Rico. While 73% were in favor of such a vote, they were split on the options to be voted upon. Those supporting the 2005 proposal made by the White House Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status that the vote be ultimately limited to the options of statehood versus independence made up 31% of the total respondents. 43% supported including the commonwealth option in the proposed plebiscite.[154][not in citation given]\\r\\nIn a 1991 Gallup Poll more than 60% of Americans said they would support independence or statehood if a majority of Puerto Ricans voted for either.[citation needed]\\r\\nA March 13, 1998 Gallup Poll[155] asked Americans: \\"Do you personally think Puerto Rico: Should become a completely independent nation; should remain a territory of the United States, or, should be admitted to the United States as the fifty-first state?\\"\\r\\nThe responses were:\\r\\nIn a June 2007 Opinion Dynamics/Fox News poll, 57% of Americans opposed Puerto Rican statehood.[156]","input":"Why is puerto rico only a us territory?"},{"output":"El Rancho Vegas","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Strip is a stretch of South Las Vegas Boulevard in Clark County, Nevada that is known for its concentration of resort hotels and casinos. The Strip is approximately 4.2 miles (6.8?km) in length,[1] located immediately south of the Las Vegas city limits in the unincorporated towns of Paradise and Winchester. However, the Strip is often referred to as being in Las Vegas.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the largest hotel, casino, and resort properties in the world are located on the Strip. The boulevard's cityscape is highlighted by its use of contemporary architecture, lights, and a wide variety of attractions. Its hotels, casinos, restaurants, residential high-rises, entertainment offerings, and skyline have established the Strip as one of the most popular and iconic tourist destinations in the world.[2] Most of the Strip has also been designated as an All-American Road[3][4] and is considered a scenic route at night.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, the casinos that were not in Downtown Las Vegas along Fremont Street were limited to outside the city limits on Las Vegas Boulevard. In 1959, the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign was constructed exactly 4.5 miles (7.2?km) outside the city limits. The sign is today located in the median just south of Russell Road, across from the now-demolished Klondike Hotel & Casino, about 0.4 miles (0.64?km) south of the southernmost entrance to Mandalay Bay (the southernmost casino).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the strictest sense, \\"the Strip\\" refers only to the stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard that is roughly between Sahara Avenue and Russell Road, a distance of 4.2 miles (6.8?km).[7][8] However, the term is often used to refer not only to the road but also to the various casinos and resorts that line the road, and even to properties that are not on the road but are in proximity to it. Phrases such as Strip Area, Resort Corridor or Resort District are sometimes used to indicate a larger geographical area, including properties 1 mile (1.6?km) or more away from Las Vegas Boulevard, such as the Hard Rock, Rio, Palms, and Hooters casinos.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long-standing definition considers the Strip's northern terminus as the SLS, though travel guides typically extend it to include the Stratosphere 0.4 miles (0.64?km) to the north. Mandalay Bay, located just north of Russell Road, is the southernmost resort considered to be on the Strip (the Klondike was the southernmost until 2006, when it was closed, although it was not included in the Strip on some definitions and travel guides).\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the number and size of the resorts, the resort corridor can be quite wide. Interstate 15 runs roughly parallel and 0.5 to 0.8 miles (0.80 to 1.29?km) to the west of Las Vegas Boulevard for the entire length of the Strip. Paradise Road runs to the east in a similar fashion, and ends at St. Louis Avenue. The eastern side of the Strip is bounded by McCarran International Airport south of Tropicana Avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth of this point, the resort corridor can be considered to extend as far east as Paradise Road, although some consider Koval Lane as a less inclusive boundary. Interstate 15 is sometimes considered the western edge of the resort corridor from Interstate 215 to Spring Mountain Road. North of this point, Industrial Road serves as the western edge.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewer hotels and resorts such as South Point, Grandview Resort, and M Resort are on Las Vegas Boulevard South as distant as 8 miles south of the \\"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\\" sign. Marketing for these casinos usually states that they are on southern Las Vegas Boulevard and not \\"Strip\\" properties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first casino to be built on Highway 91 was the Pair-o-Dice Club in 1931, but the first resort on what is currently the Strip was the El Rancho Vegas, opening on April 3, 1941, with 63 rooms. That casino/ resort stood for almost 20 years before being destroyed by a fire in 1960. Its success spawned a second hotel on what would become the Strip, the Hotel Last Frontier in 1942. Organized crime figures such as New York's Bugsy Siegel took interest in the growing gaming center leading to other resorts such as the Flamingo, which opened in 1946, and the Desert Inn, which opened in 1950. The funding for many projects was provided through the American National Insurance Company, which was based in the then notorious gambling empire of Galveston, Texas.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nLas Vegas Boulevard South was previously called Arrowhead Highway, or Los Angeles Highway. The Strip was named by Los Angeles police officer and businessman Guy McAfee, after his hometown's Sunset Strip.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nCaesars Palace was established in 1966. In 1968, Kirk Kerkorian purchased the Flamingo and hired Sahara Hotels Vice President Alex Shoofey as President. Alex Shoofey brought along 33 of Sahara's top executives. The Flamingo was used to train future employees of the International Hotel, which was under construction. Opening in 1969, the International Hotel, with 1,512 rooms, began the era of mega-resorts. The International is known as Westgate Las Vegas today.\\r\\nThe first MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, also a Kerkorian property, opened in 1973 with 2,084 rooms. At the time, this was one of the largest hotels in the world by number of rooms. The Rossiya Hotel built in 1967 in Moscow, for instance, had 3,200 rooms; however, most of the rooms in the Rossiya Hotel were single rooms of 118 sq. ft (roughly 1/4 size of a standard room at the MGM Grand Resort). On November 21, 1980, the MGM Grand suffered the worst resort fire in the history of Las Vegas as a result of electrical problems, killing 87 people. It reopened eight months later. In 1986, Kerkorian sold the MGM Grand to Bally Manufacturing, and it was renamed Bally's.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wet 'n Wild water park opened in 1985 and was located on the south side of the Sahara hotel. It closed at the end of the 2004 season and was later demolished. The opening of The Mirage in 1989 set a new level to the Las Vegas experience, as smaller hotels and casinos made way for the larger mega-resorts. The Rio and the Excalibur opened in 1990. These huge facilities offer entertainment and dining options, as well as gambling and lodging. This change affected the smaller, well-known and now historic hotels and casinos, like The Dunes, The Sands, the Stardust, and the Sahara.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lights along the Strip have been dimmed in a sign of respect to six performers and one other major Las Vegas figure upon their deaths. They are Elvis Presley (1977), Sammy Davis Jr. (1990),[12] Dean Martin (1995), George Burns (1996), Frank Sinatra (1998), former UNLV basketball head coach Jerry Tarkanian (2015),[13] and Don Rickles (2017).[14] The Strip lights were dimmed later in 2017 as a memorial to victims of a mass shooting at a concert held adjacent to the Strip.[15]  In 2005, Clark County renamed a section of Industrial Road (south of Twain Avenue) as Dean Martin Drive, also as a tribute to the famous Rat Pack singer, actor, and frequent Las Vegas entertainer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an effort to attract families, resorts offered more attractions geared toward youth, but had limited success. The (current) MGM Grand opened in 1993 with MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park, but the park closed in 2000 due to lack of interest. Similarly, in 2003 Treasure Island closed its own video arcade and abandoned the previous pirate theme, adopting the new ti name.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the large hotels, casinos and resorts, the Strip is home to a few smaller casinos and other attractions, such as M&M's World, Adventuredome and the Fashion Show Mall. Starting in the mid-1990s, the Strip became a popular New Year's Eve celebration destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the opening of Bellagio, Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn and Encore resorts, the strip trended towards the luxurious high end segment through most of the 2000s, while some older resorts added major expansions and renovations, including some de-theming of the earlier themed hotels. High end dining, specialty retail, spas and nightclubs increasingly became options for visitors in addition to gambling at most Strip resorts. There was also a trend towards expensive residential condo units on the strip.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, MGM Mirage announced plans for CityCenter, a 66-acre (27?ha), $7?billion multi-use project on the site of the Boardwalk hotel and adjoining land. It consists of hotel, casino, condo, retail, art, business and other uses on the site. City Center is currently the largest such complex in the world. Construction began in April 2006, with most elements of the project opened in late 2009. Also in 2006, the Las Vegas Strip lost its longtime status as the world's highest-grossing gambling center, falling to second place behind Macau.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, the High Roller Ferris wheel and a retail district called The LINQ Promenade broke ground, in an attempt to diversify attractions beyond that of casino resorts. Renovations and rebrandings such as The Cromwell Las Vegas and the SLS Las Vegas continued to transform The Strip in 2014. The Las Vegas Festival Grounds opened in 2015. In 2016, the T-Mobile Arena, The Park, and the Park Theatre opened.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 1, 2017, a mass shooting occurred on the Strip at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival, adjacent to the Mandalay Bay hotel. This incident became the deadliest mass shooting in modern United States history.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Monte Carlo Resort and Casino is undergoing a two-year, $450 million makeover into the Park MGM and is nearly complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmaller changes and developments are taking place as well.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nRTC Transit (previously Citizens Area Transit, or CAT) provides bus service on the Strip with double decker buses known as The Deuce. The Deuce runs between Mandalay Bay at the southern end of the Strip (and to the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign and South Strip Transfer Terminal after midnight) to the Bonneville Transit Center (BTC) and the Fremont Street Experience in Downtown Las Vegas, with stops near every casino. RTC also operates an express bus called the Strip and Downtown Express (SDX). This route connects the Strip to the Las Vegas Convention Center and Downtown Las Vegas to the north, with stops at selected hotels and shopping attractions (Las Vegas Premium Outlets North & South).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile not on the Strip itself, the Las Vegas Monorail runs on the east side of the Strip corridor from Tropicana Avenue to Sahara Avenue.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral free trams operate on the west side of the Strip:\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to CAT bus service beginning operations in 1992, mass transit on the Strip was provided by a private transit company, Las Vegas Transit. The Strip route was their only profitable route and supported the whole bus system.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Deuce bus (CAT Enviro500)\\r\\n\\r\\nAria Express\\r\\n\\r\\nMandalay Bay Tram\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning pedestrian safety and to help alleviate traffic congestion at popular intersections, several pedestrian footbridges were erected in 1990s. Some feature designs that match the theme of the nearby resorts. The Tropicana ÿ Las Vegas Boulevard footbridges were the first to be installed, and based on the success of this project additional footbridges have been built on Las Vegas Boulevard at the Flamingo Road intersection connecting Bellagio, Caesars Palace, Bally's, and The Cromwell; between The Mirage/Treasure Island and The Venetian, and at the Las Vegas Boulevard-Spring Mountain and Sands Avenue intersection connecting the Wynn with the Fashion Show Mall, The Palazzo and Treasure Island. The latest to be completed connects Planet Hollywood, CityCenter and The Cosmopolitan at the Harmon Avenue intersection.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority's annual Las Vegas Visitor Profile Study, only 36% of people said they walked around the Strip, a figure that is a drop from 2013 (52%).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, Bali Hai Golf Club opened just south of Mandalay Bay and the Strip.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs land values on the Strip have increased over the years, the resort-affiliated golf courses been removed to make way for building projects. The Tropicana Country Club closed in 1990[33] and the Dunes golf course in the mid-90s. Steve Wynn, founder of previously owned Mirage Resorts, purchased the Desert Inn and golf course for his new company Wynn Resorts and redeveloped the course as the Wynn Golf Club. This course closed in 2017. The Aladdin also had a nine-hole golf course in the 1960's.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, a TopGolf opened near the Strip.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Strip is home to many amusement parks and rides. These include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Strip is well known for its lounges, showrooms, theaters and nightclubs;[38] most of the attractions and shows on the Strip are located on the hotel casino properties. Some of the more popular free attractions visible from the Strip include the water fountains at  Bellagio, the volcano at The Mirage, and the Fall of Atlantis and Festival Fountain at Caesars Palace. There are several Cirque du Soleil shows, such as K at the MGM Grand, O at Bellagio, Mystre at Treasure Island, Zumanity (for ages 18 and older) at New York-New York, Criss Angel Mindfreak at the Luxor, and Michael Jackson: One at Mandalay Bay.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany notable artists have performed in Las Vegas, including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Wayne Newton, Liza Minnelli, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Liberace,[40] and in more recent years Celine Dion, Britney Spears, Barry Manilow, Cher, Elton John, Bette Midler, Donny and Marie Osmond, Garth Brooks, Jennifer Lopez, Reba McEntire, Mariah Carey, Shania Twain, Criss Angel, Olivia Newton-John and Queen + Adam Lambert have had residencies in the various resorts on the Strip. The only movie theatre directly on the Strip was the 10-screen Regal Showcase Theatre in the Showcase Mall. The theater opened in 1997 and was operated by Regal Entertainment Group,[41] until its closure in 2018.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Strip is home to many entertainment venues.

The desert basins of the Gobi are bounded by the Altai Mountains and the grasslands and steppes of Mongolia on the north, by the Taklamakan Desert to the west, by the Hexi Corridor and Tibetan Plateau to the southwest, and by the North China Plain to the southeast. The Gobi is notable in history as part of the great Mongol Empire, and as the location of several important cities along the Silk Road.\\r\\nThe Gobi is a rain shadow desert, formed by the Tibetan Plateau blocking precipitation from the Indian Ocean reaching the Gobi territory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gobi measures over 1,600?km (1,000?mi) from southwest to northeast and 800?km (500?mi) from north to south. The desert is widest in the west, along the line joining the Lake Bosten and the Lop Nor (87ÿ89 east). It occupies an arc of land 1,295,000?km2 (500,000?sq?mi)[2] in area as of 2007; it is the fifth-largest desert in the world and Asia's second largest. Much of the Gobi is not sandy but has exposed bare rock.\\r\\nIn its broadest definition, the Gobi includes the long stretch of desert and semi-desert area extending from the foot of the Pamirs, 77 east, to the Greater Khingan Mountains, 116-118 east, on the border of Manchuria; and from the foothills of the Altay, Sayan, and Yablonoi mountain ranges on the north to the Kunlun, Altyn-Tagh, and Qilian mountain ranges, which form the northern edges of the Tibetan Plateau, on the south.[3]\\r\\nA relatively large area on the east side of the Greater Khingan range, between the upper waters of the Songhua (Sungari) and the upper waters of the Liao-ho, is reckoned to belong to the Gobi by conventional usage. Some geographers and ecologists prefer to regard the western area of the Gobi region (as defined above): the basin of the Tarim in Xinjiang and the desert basin of Lop Nor and Hami (Kumul), as forming a separate and independent desert, called the Taklamakan Desert.\\r\\nArcheologists and paleontologists have done excavations in the Nemegt Basin in the northwestern part of the Gobi Desert (in Mongolia), which is noted for its fossil treasures, including early mammals, dinosaur eggs, and prehistoric stone implements, some 100,000 years old.[4]\\r\\nThe Gobi is a cold desert, with frost and occasionally snow occurring on its dunes. Besides being quite far north, it is also located on a plateau roughly 910ÿ1,520 metres (2,990ÿ4,990?ft) above sea level, which contributes to its low temperatures. An average of approximately 194 millimetres (7.6?in) of rain falls annually in the Gobi. Additional moisture reaches parts of the Gobi in winter as snow is blown by the wind from the Siberian Steppes. These winds cause the Gobi to reached ?40?C or ?40?F in winter to 45?C or 113?F in summer.[5]\\r\\nThe climate of the Gobi is one of great extremes, combined with rapid changes of temperature of as much as 35?C (63?F). These can occur not only seasonally but within 24 hours.\\r\\nIn southern Mongolia, the temperature has been recorded as low as ?32.8?C (?27.0?F). In contrast, in Alxa, Inner Mongolia, it rises as high as 37?C (99?F) in July.\\r\\nAverage winter minimums are a frigid ?21?C (?6?F), while summertime maximmums are a warm 27?C (81?F). Most of the precipitation falls during the summer.[6]\\r\\nAlthough the southeast monsoons reach the southeast parts of the Gobi, the area throughout this region is generally characterized by extreme dryness, especially during the winter, when the Siberian anticyclone is at its strongest. The southern and central parts of the Gobi Desert have variable plant growth due to this monsoon activity. The more northern areas of the Gobi are very cold and dry, making it unable to support much plant growth; this cold and dry weather is attributed to Siberian-Mongolian high pressure cells.[1] Hence, the icy sandstorms and snowstorms of spring and early summer plus early January (winter).\\r\\nThe Gobi Desert is the source of many important fossil finds, including the first dinosaur eggs.\\r\\nDespite the harsh conditions, these deserts and the surrounding regions sustain many animals, including black-tailed gazelles, marbled polecats, wild Bactrian camels, Mongolian wild ass and sandplovers. They are occasionally visited by snow leopards, brown bears, and wolves. Lizards are especially well-adapted to the climate of the Gobi Desert, with approximately 30 species distributed across its southern Mongolian border.[7] The most common vegetation in the Gobi desert are shrubs adapted to drought.[8] These shrubs included gray sparrow's saltwort (Salsola passerina), gray sagebrush, and low grasses such as needle grass and bridlegrass. Due to livestock grazing, the amount of shrubs in the desert has decreased.[9] Several large nature reserves have been established in the Gobi, including Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park, Great Gobi A and Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area.\\r\\nThe area is vulnerable to trampling by livestock and off-road vehicles (effects from human intervention are greater in the eastern Gobi Desert, where rainfall is heavier and may sustain livestock). In Mongolia, grasslands have been degraded by goats, which are raised by nomadic herders as source of cashmere wool.[10] The economic trends of livestock privatization and the collapse of the urban economy have caused people to return to subsistence rural lifestyles, away from urbanization.\\r\\nLarge copper and gold deposits located at Oyuu Tolgoi, about 80 kilometres from the Chinese border into Mongolia, are being investigated for development as mining operations.[11] The Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine, under construction by Rio Tinto in the South Gobi Desert, is expected to begin operation in early 2013, and is the biggest economic undertaking in the country's history. Rio Tinto estimates that taxes, royalties and dividends generated by the Oyu Tolgoi project is expected to add a third to the country's gross domestic product by 2020. Rio Tinto forecasts average annual production of 450,000 tonnes of copper and 330,000 ounces of gold, and with 1.4 billion tonnes of reserves and a resource of 3.1 billion tonnes, the mine is expected to last for more than 50 years.[12]\\r\\nThe mine has been and remains controversial. There is significant opposition in Mongolia's parliament to the terms under which the mine will proceed, and some are calling for the terms to be renegotiated. Specifically, the contention revolves primarily around the question of whether negotiations were fair (Rio Tinto is far better resourced) and whether Rio Tinto will pay adequate taxes on the revenues it derives from the mine (an agreement was reached whereby the operation will be exempt from windfall tax.[13]\\r\\nThe Gobi Desert is expanding at an alarming rate, in a process known as desertification. The expansion is particularly rapid on the southern edge into China, which has seen 3,600?km2 (1,390?sq?mi) of grassland overtaken every year by the Gobi Desert. Dust storms, which used to occur regularly in China, have increased in frequency in the past 20 years, mainly due to desertification. They have caused further damage to China's agriculture economy.\\r\\nThe northern and eastern boundaries between desert and grassland are constantly changing. This is mostly due to the climate conditions before the growing season, which influence the rate of evapotranspiration and subsequent plant growth.[14]\\r\\nThe expansion of the Gobi is attributed mostly to human activities, notably deforestation, overgrazing, and depletion of water resources. China has tried various plans to slow the expansion of the desert, which have met with some small degree of success, but no major effects. The most recent plan involves the planting of the Green Wall of China, a huge ring of newly planted forests; the government hopes the forests will help stabilize the soil, retain moisture, and act as a buffer against further desertification.[15]\\r\\nThe Gobi, broadly defined, can be divided into five distinct dry ecoregions, based on variations in climate and topography.\\r\\nThe surface is extremely diversified, although there are no great differences in vertical elevation. Between Ulaanbaatar (4800N 10700E? / ?48.000N 107.000E? / 48.000; 107.000) and the small lake of Iren-dubasu-nor (4345N 11150E? / ?43.750N 111.833E? / 43.750; 111.833), the surface is greatly eroded. Broad flat depressions and basins are separated by groups of flat-topped mountains of relatively low elevation 150 to 180?m (490 to 590?ft)), through which archaic rocks crop out as crags and isolated rugged masses. The floors of the depressions lie mostly between 900 to 1,000?m (3,000 to 3,300?ft) above sea-level. Farther south, between Iren-dutiasu-nor and the Yellow River, comes a region of broad tablelands alternating with flat plains, the latter ranging at altitudes of 1000ÿ1100?m and the former at 1,070 to 1,200?m (3,510 to 3,940?ft). The slopes of the plateaus are more or less steep, and are sometimes penetrated by \\"bays\\" of the lowlands.\\r\\nAs the border-range of the Hyangan is approached, the country steadily rises up to 1,370?m (4,490?ft) and then to 1,630?m (5,350?ft). Here small lakes frequently fill the depressions, though the water in them is generally salt or brackish. Both here and for 320?km (199?mi) south of Ulaanbaatar, streams are frequent and grass grows more or less abundantly. Through all the central parts, until the bordering mountains are reached, trees and shrubs are utterly absent. Clay and sand are the predominant formations; the watercourses, especially in the north, being frequently excavated 2 to 3?m (6?ft 7?in to 9?ft 10?in) deep. In many places in the flat, dry valleys or depressions farther south, beds of loess, 5 to 6?m (16 to 20?ft) thick, are exposed. West of the route from Ulaanbaatar to Kalgan, the country presents approximately the same general features, except that the mountains are not so irregularly scattered in groups but have more strongly defined strikes, mostly east to west, west-north-west to east-south-east, and west-south-west to east-north-east.\\r\\nThe altitudes are higher, those of the lowlands ranging from 1,000 to 1,700?m (3,300 to 5,600?ft), and those of the ranges from 200 to 500?m (660 to 1,640?ft) higher, though in a few cases they reach altitudes of 2,400?m (7,900?ft). The elevations do not form continuous chains, but make up a congeries of short ridges and groups rising from a common base and intersected by a labyrinth of ravines, gullies, glens and basins. But the tablelands, built up of the horizontal red deposits of the Han-gai (Obruchev's Gobi formation) which are characteristic of the southern parts of eastern Mongolia, are absent here or occur only in one locality, near the Shara-muren river. They are greatly intersected by gullies or dry watercourses. Water is scarce, with no streams, no lakes, no wells, and precipitation falls seldom. The prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest, and the pall of dust overhangs the country as in the Takla Makan and the desert of Lop. Characteristic of the flora are wild garlic, Kalidium gracile, wormwood, saxaul, Nitraria schoberi, Caragana, Ephedra, saltwort and the grass Lasiagrostis splendens. The taana wild onion Allium polyrrhizum is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential to produce the correct, slightly hazelnut-like flavour of camel airag (fermented milk).\\r\\nThis great desert country of Gobi is crossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from Kalgan (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar (960?km (597?mi)); from Jiuquan (in Gansu) to Hami 670?km (416?mi); from Hami to Beijing (2,000?km (1,243?mi)); from Hohhot to Hami and Barkul; and from Lanzhou (in Gansu) to Hami.\\r\\nThe southwestern portion of the Gobi, known also as the Hsi-tau and the Little Gobi, fills the space between the great north loop of the Yellow River on the east, the Ejin River on the west, and the Qilian Mountains and narrow rocky chain of Longshou, 3,200 to 3,500?m (10,500 to 11,500?ft) in altitude, on the southwest. The Ordos Desert, which covers the northeastern portion of the Ordos Plateau, in the great north loop of the Yellow River, is part of this ecoregion. It belongs to the middle basin of the three great depressions into which Potanin divides the Gobi as a whole.\\r\\n\\"Topographically,\\" says Nikolai Przhevalsky, \\"it is a perfectly level plain, which in all probability once formed the bed of a huge lake or inland sea.\\" He concludes this based on the level area of the region as a whole, the hard saldgine clay and the sand-strewn surface and, lastly, the salt lakes which occupy its lowest parts. For hundreds of kilometers, nothing can be seen but bare sands; in some places they continue so far without a break that the Mongols call them Tengger (i.e. sky). These vast expanses are absolutely waterless, nor do any oases relieve the unbroken stretches of yellow sand, which alternate with equally vast areas of saline clay or, nearer the foot of the mountains, with barren shingle. Although on the whole a level country with a general altitude of 1,000 to 1,500?m (3,300 to 4,900?ft), this section, like most other parts of the Gobi, is crowned by a chequered network of hills and broken ranges going up 300?m higher. The vegetation is confined to a few varieties of bushes and a dozen kinds of grasses and herbs, the most conspicuous being saxaul (Haloxylon ammondendron) and Agriophyllum gobicum. The others include prickly convolvulus, field wormwood (Artemisia campestris), acacia, Inula ammophila, Sophora flavescens, Convolvulus ammanii, Peganum and Astragalus, but all dwarfed, deformed and starved. The fauna consists of little but antelope, wolf, fox, hare, hedgehog, marten, numerous lizards and a few birds, e.g. the sandgrouse, lark, stonechat, sparrow, crane, Henderson's ground jay (Podoces hendersoni), horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), and crested lark (Galerida cristata).\\r\\nThe structure here is that of the mighty T'ien Shan, or Heavenly Mountains, running from west to east. It divides the northern one-third of Sinkiang from the southern two-thirds. On the northern side, rivers formed from the snow and glaciers of the high mountains break through barren foothill ranges and flow out into an immense, hollow plain. Here the rivers begin to straggle and fan out, and form great marshes with dense reed-beds. Westerners call this terrain the Dzungarian desert. The Chinese also call it a desert, but the Mongols call it a 'gobi'that is, a land of thin herbage, more suitable for camels than for cows, but capable also, if herds are kept small and moved frequently, of sustaining horses, sheep, and goats. The herbage comprises a high proportion of woody, fragrant plants. Gobi mutton is the most aromatic in the world.[16]\\r\\nThe Yulduz valley or valley of the Haidag-gol (43N 83E? / ?43N 83E? / 43; 83ÿ43N 86E? / ?43N 86E? / 43; 86) is a mini desert enclosed by two prominent members of the Shanashen Trahen Osh mountain range, namely the chucis and the kracenard pine rallies, running perpendicular and far from one another. As they proceed south, they transcend and transpose, sweeping back on east and west respectively, with Lake Bosten in between. These two ranges mark the northern and the southern edges respectively of a great swelling, which extends eastward for nearly twenty degrees of longitude. On its northern side, the Chol-tagh descends steeply, and its foot is fringed by a string of deep depressions, ranging from Lukchun (130?m (427?ft) below sea level) to Hami (850?m (2,789?ft) above sea-level). To the south of the Kuruk-tagh lie the desert of Lop Nur, the Kum-tagh desert, and the valley of the Bulunzir-gol. To this great swelling, which arches up between the two border-ranges of the Chol-tagh and Kuruk-tagh, the Mongols give the name of Ghashuun-Gobi or \\"Salt Desert\\". It is some 130 to 160?km (81 to 99?mi) across from north to south, and is traversed by a number of minor parallel ranges, ridges and chains of hills. Down its middle runs a broad stony valley, 40 to 80?km (25 to 50?mi) wide, at an elevation of 900 to 1,370?m (2,950 to 4,490?ft). The Chol-tagh, which reaches an average altitude of 1,800?m (5,900?ft), is absolutely sterile, and its northern foot rests upon a narrow belt of barren sand, which leads down to the depressions mentioned above.\\r\\nThe Kuruk-tagh is the greatly disintegrated, denuded and wasted relic of a mountain range which used to be of incomparably greater magnitude. In the west, between Lake Bosten and the Tarim, it consists of two, possibly of three, principal ranges, which, although broken in continuity, run generally parallel to one another, and embrace between them numerous minor chains of heights. These minor ranges, together with the principal ranges, divide the region into a series of long; narrow valleys, mostly parallel to one another and to the enclosing mountain chains, which descend like terraced steps, on the one side towards the depression of Lukchun and on the other towards the desert of Lop. In many cases these latitudinal valleys are barred transversely by ridges or spurs, generally elevations en masse of the bottom of the valley. Where such elevations exist, there is generally found, on the east side of the transverse ridge, a cauldron-shaped depression, which some time or other has been the bottom of a former lake, but is now nearly a dry salt-basin. The surface configuration is in fact markedly similar to that which occurs in the inter-mount latitudinal valleys of the Kunlun Mountains. The hydrography of the Ghashiun-Gobi and the Kuruk-tagh is determined by these chequered arrangements of the latitudinal valleys. Most of the principal streams, instead of flowing straight down these valleys, cross them diagonally and only turn west after they have cut their way through one or more of the transverse barrier ranges. To the highest range on the great swelling Grumm-Grzhimailo gives the name of Tuge-tau, its altitude being 2,700?m (8,858?ft) above the level of the sea and some 1,200?m (3,937?ft) above the crown of the swelling itself. This range he considers to belong to the Choltagh system, whereas Sven Hedin would assign it to the Kuruk-tagh. This last, which is pretty certainly identical with the range of Kharateken-ula (also known as the Kyzyl-sanghir, Sinir, and Singher Mountains), that overlooks the southern shore of the Lake Bosten, though parted from it by the drift-sand desert of Ak-bel-kum (White Pass Sands), has at first a west-northwest to east-southeast strike, but it gradually curves round like a scimitar towards the east-northeast and at the same time gradually decreases in elevation. In 91 east, while the principal range of the Kuruk-tagh system wheels to the east-northeast, four of its subsidiary ranges terminate, or rather die away somewhat suddenly, on the brink of a long narrow depression (in which Sven Hedin sees a northeast bay of the former great Central Asian lake of Lop-nor), having over against them the cheloned terminals of similar subordinate ranges of the Pe-shan (Boy-san) system (see below). The Kuruk-tagh is throughout a relatively low, but almost completely barren range, being entirely destitute of animal life, save for hares, antelopes and wild camels, which frequent its few small, widely scattered oases. The vegetation, which is confined to these same relatively favoured spots, is of the scantiest and is mainly confined to bushes of saxaul (Haloxylon), anabasis, reeds (kamish), tamarisks, poplars, and Ephedra.\\r\\nThe Gobi had a long history of human habitation, mostly by nomadic peoples. By the early 20th century the region was under the nominal control of Manchu-China, and inhabited mostly by Mongols, Uyghurs, and Kazakhs. The Gobi Desert as a whole was only very imperfectly known to outsiders, information being confined to observations by individual travellers from their respective itineraries across the desert. Among the European explorers who contributed to early-20th-century understanding of the Gobi, the most important were:\\r\\nCoordinates: 4235N 10326E? / ?42.59N 103.43E? / 42.59; 103.43","input":"What type of desert is the gobi desert?"},{"output":"Western Asia","context":"","input":"What part of the world is syria in?"},{"output":"long, helically coiled (corkscrew-shaped or spiraled, hence the name) cells","context":"A spirochaete (/?spa?ro??ki?t/)[1] or spirochete is a member of the phylum Spirochaetes (/?spa?ro??ki?tiz/),[2] which contains distinctive diderm (double-membrane) bacteria, most of which have long, helically coiled (corkscrew-shaped or spiraled, hence the name) cells.[3] Spirochaetes stain gram-negative and are chemoheterotrophic in nature, with lengths between 3 and 500?m and diameters around 0.09 to at least 3?m.[4]\\r\\nSpirochaetes are distinguished from other bacterial phyla by the location of their flagella, sometimes called axial filaments, which run lengthwise between the bacterial inner membrane and outer membrane in periplasmic space. These cause a twisting motion which allows the spirochaete to move about. When reproducing, a spirochaete will undergo asexual transverse binary fission. Most spirochaetes are free-living and anaerobic, but there are numerous exceptions. Spirochaetes bacteria are diverse in their pathogenic capacity, the ecological niches that they inhabit, as well as molecular characteristics including GC content and genome size.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany organisms within the Spirochaetes phylum cause prevalent diseases. Pathogenic members of this phylum include the following:\\r\\nSpirochaetes may also cause dementia and may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.[10] Salvarsan, the first partially organic synthetic antimicrobial drug in medical history, was effective against spirochaetes only and was primarily used to cure syphilis.\\r\\nThe class currently consists of 14 validly named genera across 4 orders and 5 families.[11][12][13] The orders Brachyspirales, Brevinematales and Leptospirales each contain a single family, Brachyspiraceae, Brevinemataceae and Leptospiraceae, respectively. The Spirochaetales order harbours two families, Spirochaetaceae and Borreliaceae. Molecular markers in the form of conserved signature indels (CSIs) and CSPs have been found specific for each of the orders, with the exception of Brevinimetales, that provide a reliable means to demarcate these clades from one another within the diverse phylum.[12] Additional CSIs have been found exclusively shared by each family within the Spirochaetales. These molecular markers are in agreement with the observed phylogenetic tree branching of two monophyletic clades within the Spirochaetales order.[12] CSIs have also been found that further differentiate taxonomic groups within the Borreliaceae family that further delineate evolutionary relationships that are in accordance with physical characteristics such as pathogenicity (viz. Borrelia emend. Borreliella gen. nov.).[14]\\r\\nA conserved signature indel has also been found exclusively shared by all Spirochaetes species.[12] This CSI is a 3 amino acid insert in the flagellar basal body rod protein FlgC which is an important part of the unique endoflagellar structure shared by Spirochaetes species.[15] Given that the CSI is exclusively shared by members within this phylum, it has been postulated that it may be related to the characteristic flagellar properties observed among Spirochaetes species.[12][15]\\r\\nHistorically, the all families belonging to the Spirochaetes phylum were assigned to a single order, the Spirochaetales.[5][6] However, the current taxonomic view is more connotative of accurate evolutionary relationships, where the distribution of conserved signature indels are indicative of shared ancestry within each respective clade for which they are specific. These synapomorphic characteristics justify the phylogenetic divisions and are a means to identify each order/family within the phylum.[12]\\r\\nThe phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA-based LTP release 123 by 'The All-Species Living Tree' Project.[16]\\r\\nTurneriella parva (Hovind-Hougen et al. 1982) Levett et al. 2005\\r\\nLeptonema illini Hovind-Hougen 1983\\r\\nLeptospira Noguchi 1917 emend.

Two of these were Blakely, a racing driver already engaged to another woman, and Desmond Cussen, a retail company director.\\r\\nOn Easter Sunday 1955, Ellis shot Blakely dead outside The Magdala public house in Hampstead, and immediately gave herself up to the police. At her trial, she took full responsibility for the murder; and her courtesy and composure, both in court and in the cells, was noted in the press. She was hanged at HM Prison Holloway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEllis was born in the Welsh seaside/rocky town of Rhyl, the third of six children. During her childhood her family moved to Basingstoke. Her mother, Elisaberta (Bertha) Cothals, was a Belgian refugee; her father, Arthur Hornby, was a cellist from Manchester who spent much of his time playing on Atlantic cruise liners. Arthur changed his surname to Neilson after the birth of Ruth's elder sister Muriel.\\r\\nEllis attended Fairfields Senior Girls' School in Basingstoke,[1] leaving when she was 14 to work as a waitress. Shortly afterwards, in 1941 at the height of the Blitz, the Neilsons moved to London. In 1944, 17-year-old Ruth became pregnant by a married Canadian soldier named Clare and gave birth to a son, whom she named Clare Andrea Neilson,[1] known as \\"Andy\\".[2] The father sent money for about a year, then stopped. The child eventually went to live with Ellis's mother.[3]\\r\\nEllis became a nightclub hostess through nude modelling work, which paid significantly more than the various factory and clerical jobs she had held since leaving school. Morris Conley, the manager of the Court Club in Duke Street, where she worked, blackmailed his hostess employees into sleeping with him. Early in 1950 she became pregnant by one of her regular customers, having taken up prostitution.[3] She had this pregnancy terminated (illegally) in the third month and returned to work as soon as she could.\\r\\nOn 8 November 1950, she married 41-year-old George Ellis, a divorced dentist with two sons, at the register office in Tonbridge, Kent.[4] He had been a customer at the Court Club. He was a violent alcoholic, jealous and possessive, and the marriage deteriorated rapidly because he was convinced she was having an affair. Ruth left him several times but always returned.\\r\\nIn 1951, while four months pregnant, Ruth appeared, uncredited, as a beauty queen in the Rank film Lady Godiva Rides Again.[5] She subsequently gave birth to a daughter Georgina, but George refused to acknowledge paternity and they separated shortly afterwards. Ruth and her daughter moved in with her parents and she went back to prostitution to make ends meet.[3]\\r\\nIn 1953, Ruth Ellis decided to become the manager of The Little Club, a nightclub. At this time, she was lavished with expensive gifts by admirers, and had a number of celebrity friends.[3] She met David Blakely, three years her junior, through racing driver Mike Hawthorn. Blakely was a well-mannered former public school boy, but also a hard-drinking racer. Within weeks he moved into her flat above the club, despite being engaged to another woman, Mary Dawson. Ellis became pregnant for the fourth time but aborted the child, feeling she could not reciprocate the level of commitment shown by Blakely towards their relationship.[6]\\r\\nShe then began seeing Desmond Cussen. Born in 1922 in Surrey, he had been an RAF pilot, flying Lancaster bombers during the Second World War, leaving the RAF in 1946, when he took up accountancy. He was appointed a director of the family business Cussen & Co., a wholesale and retail tobacconists with outlets in London and South Wales. When Ruth was sacked as manager of the Little Club, she moved in with Cussen at 20 Goodward Court, Devonshire Street, north of Oxford Street, becoming his mistress.\\r\\nThe relationship with Blakely continued, however, and became increasingly violent and embittered as Ellis and Blakely continued to see other people.[6] Blakely offered to marry Ellis, to which she consented, but she lost another child in January 1955, after a miscarriage induced by a punch to the stomach in an argument with Blakely.[6]\\r\\nOn Easter Sunday, 10 April 1955,[8] Ellis took a taxi from Cussen's home to a second floor flat at 29 Tanza Road, Hampstead, the home of Anthony and Carole Findlater, where she suspected Blakely might be. As she arrived, Blakely's car drove off, so she paid off the taxi and walked the quarter mile to the Magdala,[9] a four-storey public house in South Hill Park, Hampstead, where she found Blakely's car parked outside.\\r\\nAt around 9:30?pm David Blakely and his friend Clive Gunnell emerged. Blakely passed Ellis waiting on the pavement when she stepped out of Henshaws Doorway, a newsagent next to the Magdala. He ignored her when she said \\"Hello, David,\\" then shouted \\"David!\\"\\r\\nAs Blakely searched for the keys to his car,[10] Ellis took a .38 calibre Smith & Wesson Victory model revolver from her handbag and fired five shots at Blakely. The first shot missed and he started to run, pursued by Ellis round the car, where she fired a second, which caused him to collapse onto the pavement. She then stood over him and fired three more bullets into him. One bullet was fired less than half an inch from Blakely's back and left powder burns on his skin.\\r\\nEllis was seen to stand mesmerised over the body and witnesses reported hearing several distinct clicks as she tried to fire the revolver's sixth and final shot, before finally firing into the ground. This bullet ricocheted off the road and injured Gladys Kensington Yule, 53, the wife of a local banker, in the base of her thumb, as she walked to the Magdala.\\r\\nEllis, in a state of shock, asked Gunnell, \\"Will you call the police, Clive?\\" She was arrested immediately by an off-duty policeman, Alan Thompson, who took the gun from her, put it in his coat pocket, and heard her say, \\"I am guilty, I'm a little confused.\\" She was taken to Hampstead police station where she appeared to be calm and not obviously under the influence of drink or drugs. She made a detailed confession to the police and was charged with murder. Blakely's body was taken to hospital with multiple bullet wounds to the intestines, liver, lung, aorta and trachea.\\r\\nThree police officers were present during Ellis's interrogation and during the taking of her statement at Hampstead police station: Detective Inspector Gill, Detective Inspector Crawford and Detective Chief Inspector Davies, but she had no legal representation at this time, or even when she made her first appearance at the magistrates' court on 11 April 1955 and was ordered to be held on remand.\\r\\nShe was twice examined by principal Medical Officer, M. R. Penry Williams, who failed to find evidence of mental illness and she undertook an electroencephalography examination on 3 May that failed to find any abnormality. While on remand in Holloway, she was examined by psychiatrist Dr D. Whittaker for the defence, and by Dr A. Dalzell on behalf of the Home Office. Neither found evidence of insanity.\\r\\nOn 20 June 1955, Ellis appeared in the Number One Court at the Old Bailey, London, before Mr Justice Havers. She was dressed in a black suit and white silk blouse with freshly bleached and coiffured blonde hair. Her lawyers expressed concern about her appearance (and dyed blonde hair), but she did not alter it to appear less striking.\\r\\nIt's obvious when I shot him I intended to kill him.[11]\\r\\nThis was her answer to the only question put to her by Christmas Humphreys, counsel for the Prosecution, who asked, \\"When you fired the revolver at close range into the body of David Blakely, what did you intend to do?\\"[11] The defending counsel, Aubrey Melford Stevenson, supported by Sebag Shaw and Peter Rawlinson, would have advised Ellis of this possible question before the trial began, because it is standard legal practice to do so. Her reply to Humphreys's question in open court guaranteed a guilty verdict and therefore the mandatory death sentence which followed. The jury took 20 minutes to convict her.[11] She received the sentence, and was taken to the condemned cell at Holloway.\\r\\nIn a 2010 television interview Mr Justice Havers's grandson, actor Nigel Havers, said his grandfather had written to the Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George recommending a reprieve as he regarded it as a crime passionnel, but received a curt refusal, which was still held by the family.\\r\\nEllis told her mother that she did not want a petition to reprieve her from the death sentence, and took no part in the campaign. However her relatives urged her solicitor John Bickford to petition to the Home Secretary, and he wrote a seven-page letter setting out the grounds. Gwilym Lloyd George took all the papers to the house of his sister Megan Lloyd George over the weekend, and decided that there were not sufficient grounds to recommend any interference with the due course of law.[12]\\r\\nHaving been told that she would not be reprieved, Ellis dismissed her solicitor John Bickford (who had been chosen by Desmond Cussen) and asked to see Leon Simmons, the clerk to solicitor Victor Mishcon (whose law firm had previously represented her in her divorce proceedings but not in the murder trial). Simmons and Mishcon saw Bickford before going to Holloway; when Mishcon asked for a lead which might help save her, Bickford said \\"Ask her where she got the gun!\\". At 11.15?am on 12 July 1955, the day before her execution, Mishcon and Simmons saw Ellis, who wanted to make arrangements for her will. They pressed Ellis for the full story, which Ellis was reluctant to give; she asked Mishcon to promise not to use the information to try to secure a reprieve (Mishcon refused).[13]\\r\\nEllis then revealed that she had been drinking with Desmond Cussen for most of the weekend and that Cussen had given her the gun and some shooting practice. Cussen had also driven her to the murder scene. Following the two-hour interview in the condemned cell, Mishcon and Simmons went to the Home Office, where they spoke to a senior civil servant. The Permanent Secretary Sir Frank Newsam, who was at Ascot races, was summoned back to London, and ordered the head of CID to check the story.[14] Gwilym Lloyd George later said that the police were able to make considerable inquiries but that it made no difference to his decision, and in fact made Ellis's guilt greater by showing the murder was premeditated.[15] Lloyd George also explained that the injury to Gladys Yule was decisive in his decision not to reprieve Ellis: \\"We cannot have people shooting off firearms in the street! .. As long as I was Home Secretary I was determined to ensure that people could use the streets without fear of a bullet.\\"[16]\\r\\nIn a final letter to David Blakely's parents from her prison cell, she wrote \\"I have always loved your son, and I shall die still loving him.\\"[17]\\r\\nEver since Edith Thompson's execution in 1923, condemned female prisoners had been required to wear thick padded calico knickers, so just prior to the allotted time, Warder Evelyn Galilee, who had guarded Ellis for the previous three weeks, took her to the lavatory. Warder Galilee said, \\"I'm sorry, Ruth, but I've got to do this.\\" They had tapes back and front to pull. Ellis said \\"Is that all right?\\" and \\"Would you pull these tapes, Evelyn? I'll pull the others.\\" On re-entering the condemned cell, she took off her glasses, placed them on the table and said \\"I won't be needing these anymore.\\"[18]\\r\\nThirty seconds before 9?am on Wednesday 13 July, the official hangman, Albert Pierrepoint, and his assistant, Royston Rickard, entered the condemned cell and escorted Ruth 15 feet (4.6?m) to the execution room next door.[19] She had been weighed at 103 pounds (47?kg) the previous day and a drop of 8?ft 4in (2.54 metres) was set. Pierrepoint carried out the execution in just 12 seconds and her body was left hanging for an hour. Her autopsy report, by the pathologist Dr Keith Simpson, was made public.[20]\\r\\nThe Bishop of Stepney, Joost de Blank, visited Ellis just before her death, and she told him, \\"It is quite clear to me that I was not the person who shot him. When I saw myself with the revolver I knew I was another person.\\" These comments were quoted in a London evening paper of the time, The Star.\\r\\nThe case caused widespread controversy at the time, evoking exceptionally intense press and public interest to the point that it was discussed by the Cabinet.[21]\\r\\nOn the day of her execution the Daily Mirror columnist Cassandra wrote a column attacking the sentence, writing \\"The one thing that brings stature and dignity to mankind and raises us above the beasts will have been denied herpity and the hope of ultimate redemption.\\"[22] A petition to the Home Office asking for clemency was signed by 50,000 people, but the Conservative Home Secretary Major Gwilym Lloyd George rejected it.[22] The British Path newsreel reporting Ellis's execution openly questioned whether capital punishmentof a female or of anyonehad a place in the 20th century.[23]\\r\\nThe novelist Raymond Chandler, then living in Britain, wrote a scathing letter to the Evening Standard, referring to what he described as \\"the medieval savagery of the law\\".[24]\\r\\nThough the British public as a whole supported the execution of a murderess, the hanging helped strengthen public support for the abolition of the death penalty, which was halted in practice for murder in Britain ten years later (the last execution in the UK occurred in 1964). Reprieve was by then commonplace. According to one statistical account, between 1926 and 1954, 677 men and 60 women had been sentenced to death in England and Wales, but only 375 men and seven women had been executed.[25]\\r\\nIn the early 1970s, John Bickford, Ellis's solicitor, made a statement to Scotland Yard from his home in Malta. He recalled that Desmond Cussen told him in 1955 that Ellis lied at the trial. Bickford had kept the information to himself. After Bickford's confession a police investigation followed but no further action regarding Cussen was taken.\\r\\nAnthony Eden, the Prime Minister at the time, made no reference to the Ruth Ellis case in his memoirs, nor is there anything in his papers. He accepted that the decision was the responsibility of the Home Secretary, but there are indications that he was troubled by it.[26]\\r\\nForeign newspapers observed that the concept of the crime passionnel seemed alien to the British.\\r\\nIn 1969 Ellis's mother, Berta Neilson, was found unconscious in a gas-filled room in her flat in Hemel Hempstead. She never fully recovered and did not speak coherently again. Ellis's husband, George Ellis, descended into alcoholism and strangled himself in 1958. Her son, Andy, who was ten at the time of his mother's hanging, took his own life in a bedsit in 1982, shortly after desecrating his mother's grave. The trial judge, Sir Cecil Havers, had sent money every year for Andy's upkeep, and Christmas Humphreys, the prosecution counsel at Ellis's trial, paid for his funeral.[2] Ellis's daughter, Georgina, who was three when her mother was executed, was fostered by another family when her father killed himself three years later. She died of cancer aged 50.[27]\\r\\nThe case continues to have a strong grip on the British imagination and in 2003 was referred back to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The Court firmly rejected the appeal, although it made clear that it could rule only on the conviction based on the law as it stood in 1955, and not on whether she should have been executed.[28]\\r\\nThe court was critical of the fact that it had been obliged to consider the appeal:\\r\\nWe would wish to make one further observation. We have to question whether this exercise of considering an appeal so long after the event when Mrs Ellis herself had consciously and deliberately chosen not to appeal at the time is a sensible use of the limited resources of the Court of Appeal. On any view, Mrs Ellis had committed a serious criminal offence. This case is, therefore, quite different from a case like Hanratty [2002] 2 Cr App R 30 where the issue was whether a wholly innocent person had been convicted of murder. A wrong on that scale, if it had occurred, might even today be a matter for general public concern, but in this case there was no question that Mrs Ellis was other than the killer and the only issue was the precise crime of which she was guilty. If we had not been obliged to consider her case we would perhaps in the time available have dealt with 8 to 12 other cases, the majority of which would have involved people who were said to be wrongly in custody.[29]\\r\\nIn July 2007 a petition was published on the 10 Downing Street website asking Prime Minister Gordon Brown to reconsider the Ruth Ellis case and grant her a pardon in the light of new evidence that the Old Bailey jury in 1955 was not asked to consider. It expired on 4 July 2008.[30]\\r\\nEllis was buried in an unmarked grave within the walls of Holloway Prison, as was customary for executed prisoners. In the early 1970s the prison was extensively rebuilt, during which the bodies of all the executed women were exhumed for reburial elsewhere. Ellis's body was reburied in the churchyard extension of St Mary's Church in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. The headstone in the churchyard was inscribed \\"Ruth Hornby 1926ÿ1955\\". Her son, Andy, destroyed the headstone shortly before he committed suicide in 1982.\\r\\nCoincidentally, Styllou Christofi, who was hanged in December 1954 for murdering her daughter-in-law (the second-to-last woman to be executed in Britain), lived at 11 South Hill Park in Hampstead,[31] with her son and daughter-in-law, a few yards from the Magdala public house at number 2a, where David Blakely was shot four months later.\\r\\nIn 1980, the third episode of the first series of the ITV drama series Lady Killers recreated the court case, with Ellis played by Georgina Hale.\\r\\nThe first cinema portrayal of Ellis came with the release of the 1985 film Dance with a Stranger, directed by Mike Newell and featuring Miranda Richardson as Ellis.\\r\\nBoth Ellis's story and the story of Albert Pierrepoint are retold in the stage play Follow Me, written by Ross Gurney-Randall and Dave Mounfield and directed by Guy Masterson. It premiered at the Assembly Rooms as part of the 2007 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\\r\\nIn the film Pierrepoint (2006), Ellis was portrayed by Mary Stockley.\\r\\nDiana Dors, who had starred in Lady Godiva Rides Again, in which Ellis had had a minor, uncredited role, played a character resembling (though not based on) Ellis in the 1956 British film Yield to the Night, directed by J. Lee Thompson.[32][33]\\r\\nThe case was the basis for Amanda Whittington's play The Thrill of Love. It premiered at the New Vic Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme, in February 2013 and subsequently played at St James Theatre London with Faye Castelow in the main role.[34] Maxine Peake played Ellis in an adaptation of Whittington's play, broadcast on 5 November 2016 by BBC Radio 4[35]\\r\\nThe life of Ellis was the inspiration behind a new musical play by Lucy Rivers, Sinners Club.[36] A co-production with Theatr Clwyd, it premiered at The Other Room Theatre in Cardiff, February 2017.\\r\\nThe Ruth Ellis story was dramatized in the Murder Maps series of documentaries on the Yesterday Channel on 2 November 2017 Prefhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt7464202/.It featured Monica Weller ghost writer of RUTH ELLIS MY SISTER'S SECRET LIFE.\\r\\nThe story was also the inspiration for the 2015 opera Entanglement by the composer Charlotte Bray.[37]","input":"Who was the last woman hung in england?"},{"output":"Formula Rossa","context":"Roller coasters are amusement rides developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks. During the 16th and 17th centuries, rides consisting of wooden sleds that took riders down large slides made from ice were popular in Russia. The first roller coasters, where the train was attached to a wooden track, first appeared in France in the early 1800s.[1] Although wooden roller coasters are still being produced, steel roller coasters are more common and can be found on every continent except Antarctica.[2]\\r\\nRanked by height, speed, length, inversions, and steepness, roller coasters are also rated through public opinion polls. Amusement parks often compete to build the tallest, fastest, and longest rides to attract thrill seekers and boost overall park attendance.[3] However, many records do not usually last long. When Magnum XL-200 opened in 1989, it began a new era of roller coasters and increased competition among parks to set new world records. The Magnum XLÿ200 was the first complete-circuit roller coaster built over 200 feet (61?m).[4][5] Other notable roller coasters include Formula Rossa which reaches a top speed of 149 miles per hour (240?km/h),[6] Kingda Ka which stands at 456 feet (139?m) tall,[7] and Steel Dragon 2000 which measures 8,133 feet (2,479?m) in length.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSource:[9]\\r\\nSources:[10]\\r\\nSource:[13]\\r\\nSource:[14]\\r\\nSource:[15]\\r\\nSource:[16]\\r\\nSource:[17]\\r\\nSource:[18]\\r\\nThis listing contains all types of roller coaster inversions.\\r\\nSources:[19]\\r\\nSource:[20]","input":"The most intense roller coaster in the world?"},{"output":"the Union","context":"During the American Civil War (1861ÿ1865), the Union, also known as the North, referred to the United States of America and specifically to the national government of President Abraham Lincoln and the 20 free states, as well as 4 border and slave states (some with split governments and troops sent both north and south) that supported it. The Union was opposed by 11 southern slave states (or 13, according to the Southern view and one western territory) that formed the Confederate States of America, also known as \\"the Confederacy\\" or \\"the South\\".\\r\\nAll of the Union's states provided soldiers for the United States Army (also known as the Union Army), though the border areas also sent tens of thousands of soldiers south into the Confederacy. The Border states were essential as a supply base for the Union invasion of the Confederacy, and Lincoln realized he could not win the war without control of them, especially Maryland, which lay north of the national capital of Washington, D.C.. The Northeast and upper Midwest provided the industrial resources for a mechanized war producing large quantities of munitions and supplies, as well as financing for the war. The Midwest provided soldiers, food, horses, financial support, and training camps. Army hospitals were set up across the Union. Most states had Republican Party governors who energetically supported the war effort and suppressed anti-war subversion in 1863ÿ64. The Democratic Party strongly supported the war at the beginning in 1861 but by 1862, was split between the War Democrats and the anti-war element led by the \\"Copperheads\\". The Democrats made major electoral gains in 1862 in state elections, most notably in New York. They lost ground in 1863, especially in Ohio. In 1864, the Republicans campaigned under the National Union Party banner, which attracted many War Democrats and soldiers and scored a landslide victory for Lincoln and his entire ticket against opposition candidate George B. McClellan, former General-in-Chief of the Union Army and its eastern Army of the Potomac.\\r\\nThe war years were quite prosperous except where serious fighting and guerrilla warfare took place along the southern border. Prosperity was stimulated by heavy government spending and the creation of an entirely new national banking system. The Union states invested a great deal of money and effort in organizing psychological and social support for soldiers' wives, widows, and orphans, and for the soldiers themselves. Most soldiers were volunteers, although after 1862 many volunteered in order to escape the draft and to take advantage of generous cash bounties on offer from states and localities. Draft resistance was notable in some larger cities, especially New York City with its massive anti-draft riots of July 1863 and in some remote districts such as the coal mining areas of Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the context of the American Civil War, the Union is sometimes referred to as \\"the North\\", both then and now, as opposed to the Confederacy, which was \\"the South\\". The Union never recognized the legitimacy of the Confederacy's secession and maintained at all times that it remained entirely a part of the United States of America. In foreign affairs the Union was the only side recognized by all other nations, none of which officially recognized the Confederate government. The term \\"Union\\" occurs in the first governing document of the United States, the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. The subsequent Constitution of 1787 was issued and ratified in the name not of the states, but of \\"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union ...\\". Union, for the United States of America, is then repeated in such clauses as the Admission to the Union clause in Article IV, Section 3.\\r\\nEven before the war started, the phrase \\"preserve the Union\\" was commonplace, and a \\"union of states\\" had been used to refer to the entire United States of America. Using the term \\"Union\\" to apply to the non-secessionist side carried a connotation of legitimacy as the continuation of the pre-existing political entity.[1]\\r\\nConfederates generally saw the Union states as being opposed to slavery, occasionally referring to them as abolitionists, as in reference to the U.S. Navy as the \\"Abolition fleet\\" and the U.S. Army as the \\"Abolition forces\\".[2]\\r\\nUnlike the Confederacy, the Union had a large industrialized and urbanized area (the Northeast), and more advanced commercial, transportation and financial systems than the rural South.[3] Additionally, the Union states had a manpower advantage of 5 to 2 at the start of the war.[4]\\r\\nYear by year, the Confederacy shrank and lost control of increasing quantities of resources and population. Meanwhile, the Union turned its growing potential advantage into a much stronger military force. However, much of the Union strength had to be used to garrison conquered areas, and to protect railroads and other vital points. The Union's great advantages in population and industry would prove to be vital long-term factors in its victory over the Confederacy, but it took the Union a long while to fully mobilize these resources.\\r\\nThe attack on Fort Sumter rallied the North to the defense of American nationalism. Historian, Allan Nevins, says:\\r\\nThe thunderclap of Sumter produced a startling crystallization of Northern sentiment ... Anger swept the land. From every side came news of mass meetings, speeches, resolutions, tenders of business support, the muster of companies and regiments, the determined action of governors and legislatures.[5]\\r\\nMcClintock states:\\r\\nAt the time, Northerners were right to wonder at the near unanimity that so quickly followed long months of bitterness and discord. It would not last throughout the protracted war to come ÿ or even through the year ÿ but in that moment of unity was laid bare the common Northern nationalism usually hidden by the fierce battles more typical of the political arena.\\"[6]\\r\\nHistorian Michael Smith, argues that, as the war ground on year after year, the spirit of American republicanism grew stronger and generated fears of corruption in high places. Voters became afraid of power being centralized in Washington, extravagant spending, and war profiteering. Democratic candidates emphasized these fears. The candidates added that rapid modernization was putting too much political power in the hands of Eastern financiers and industrialists. They warned that the abolition of slavery would bring a flood of freed blacks into the labor market of the North.\\r\\nRepublicans responded with claims of defeatism. They indicted Copperheads for criminal conspiracies to free Confederate prisoners of war, and played on the spirit of nationalism and the growing hatred of the slaveowners, as the guilty party in the war.[7]\\r\\nHistorians have overwhelmingly praised the \\"political genius\\" of Abraham Lincoln's performance as President.[8] His first priority was military victory. This required that he master entirely new skills as a strategist and diplomat. He oversaw supplies, finances, manpower, the selection of generals, and the course of overall strategy. Working closely with state and local politicians, he rallied public opinion and (at Gettysburg) articulated a national mission that has defined America ever since. Lincoln's charm and willingness to cooperate with political and personal enemies made Washington work much more smoothly than Richmond, the Confederate capital, and his wit smoothed many rough edges. Lincoln's cabinet proved much stronger and more efficient than Davis's, as Lincoln channeled personal rivalries into a competition for excellence rather than mutual destruction. With William Seward at State, Salmon P. Chase at the Treasury, and (from 1862) Edwin Stanton at the War Department, Lincoln had a powerful cabinet of determined men. Except for monitoring major appointments and decisions, Lincoln gave them free rein to end the Confederate rebellion.[9]\\r\\nThe Republican Congress passed many major laws that reshaped the nation's economy, financial system, tax system, land system, and higher education system. These included: the Morrill tariff, the Homestead Act, the Pacific Railroad Act, and the National Banking Act.[10] Lincoln paid relatively little attention to this legislation as he focused on war issues but he worked smoothly with powerful Congressional leaders such as Thaddeus Stevens (on taxation and spending), Charles Sumner (on foreign affairs), Lyman Trumbull (on legal issues), Justin Smith Morrill (on land grants and tariffs) and William Pitt Fessenden (on finances).[11]\\r\\nMilitary and reconstruction issues were another matter. Lincoln, as the leader of the moderate and conservative factions of the Republican Party, often crossed swords with the Radical Republicans, led by Stevens and Sumner. Author, Bruce Tap, shows that Congress challenged Lincoln's role as commander-in-chief through the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War. It was a joint committee of both houses that was dominated by the Radical Republicans, who took a hard line against the Confederacy. During the 37th and 38th Congresses, the committee investigated every aspect of Union military operations, with special attention to finding commanders culpable for military defeats. It assumed an inevitable Union victory. Failure was perceived to indicate evil motivations or personal failures. The committee distrusted graduates of the US Military Academy at West Point, since many of the academy's alumni were leaders of the enemy army. Members of the committee much preferred political generals with a satisfactory political record. Some of the committee suggested that West-Pointers who engaged in strategic maneuver were cowardly or even disloyal. It ended up endorsing incompetent but politically correct generals.[12]\\r\\nThe opposition came from Copperhead Democrats, who were strongest in the Midwest and wanted to allow Confederate secession. In the East, opposition to the war was strongest among Irish Catholics, but also included business interests connected to the South typified by August Belmont. The Democratic Party was deeply split. In 1861 most Democrats supported the war. However, the party increasingly split down the middle between the moderates who supported the war effort, and the peace element, including Copperheads, who did not. It scored major gains in the 1862 elections, and elected the moderate Horatio Seymour as governor of New York. They gained 28 seats in the House of Representatives but Republicans retained control of both the House and the Senate.\\r\\nThe 1862 election for the Indiana legislature was especially hard-fought. Though the Democrats gained control of the legislature, they were unable to impede the war effort. Republican Governor Oliver P. Morton was able to maintain control of the state's contribution to the war effort despite the Democrat majority.[13] Washington was especially helpful in 1864 in arranging furloughs to allow Hoosier soldiers to return home so they could vote in elections.[14] Across the North in 1864, the great majority of soldiers voted Republican. Men who had been Democrats before the war often abstained or voted Republican.[15]\\r\\nAs the federal draft laws tightened, there was serious unrest among Copperhead strongholds, such as the Irish in the Pennsylvania coal mining districts. The government needed the coal more than the draftees, so it ignored the largely non-violent draft dodging there.[16][17] The violent New York City draft riots of 1863 were suppressed by the U.S. Army firing grape shot down cobblestone city streets.[18][19]\\r\\nThe Democrats nominated George McClellan, a War Democrat for the 1864 presidential election but gave him an anti-war platform. In terms of Congress the opposition against the war was nearly powerless ÿ as was the case in most states. In Indiana and Illinois pro-war governors circumvented anti-war legislatures elected in 1862. For 30 years after the war the Democrats carried the burden of having opposed the martyred Lincoln, who was viewed by many as the salvation of the Union and the destroyer of slavery.[20]\\r\\nThe Copperheads were a large faction of northern Democrats who opposed the war, demanding an immediate peace settlement. They said they wanted to restore \\"the Union as it was\\" (that is, with the South and with slavery) but they realized that the Confederacy would never voluntarily rejoin the U.S.[21] The most prominent Copperhead was Ohio's Clement L. Vallandigham, a Congressman and leader of the Democratic Party in Ohio. He was defeated in an intense election for governor in 1863. Republican prosecutors in the Midwest accused some Copperhead activists of treason in a series of trials in 1864.[22]\\r\\nCopperheadism was a grassroots movement, strongest in the area just north of the Ohio River, as well as some urban ethnic wards. Some historians have argued that it represented a traditionalistic element alarmed at the rapid modernization of society sponsored by the Republican Party. It looked back to Jacksonian Democracy for inspiration ÿ with ideals that promoted an agrarian rather than industrialized concept of society. Weber (2006) argues that the Copperheads damaged the Union war effort by fighting the draft, encouraging desertion and forming conspiracies.[23] However, other historians say the Copperheads were a legitimate opposition force unfairly treated by the government, adding that the draft was in disrepute and that the Republicans greatly exaggerated the conspiracies for partisan reasons.[24] Copperheadism was a major issue in the 1864 presidential election ÿ its strength waxed when Union armies were doing poorly and waned when they won great victories. After the fall of Atlanta in September 1864, military success seemed assured and Copperheadism collapsed.[21]\\r\\nEnthusiastic young men clamored to join the Union army in 1861. They came with family support for reasons of patriotism and excitement. Washington decided to keep the small regular army intact; it only had 16,000 men and was needed to guard the frontier. Its officers could, however, join the temporary new volunteer army that was formed, with expectations that their experience would lead to rapid promotions. The problem with volunteering, however, was its serious lack of planning, leadership, and organization at the highest levels. Washington called on the states for troops, and every northern governor set about raising and equipping regiments, and sent the bills to the War Department. The men could elect the junior officers, while the governor appointed the senior officers, and Lincoln appointed the generals. Typically, politicians used their local organizations to raise troops and were in line (if healthy enough) to become colonel. The problem was that the War Department, under the disorganized leadership of Simon Cameron, also authorized local and private groups to raise regiments. The result was widespread confusion and delay.\\r\\nPennsylvania, for example, had acute problems. When Washington called for 10 more regiments, enough men volunteered to form 30. However, they were scattered among 70 different new units, none of them a complete regiment. Not until Washington approved gubernatorial control of all new units was the problem resolved. Allan Nevins is particularly scathing of this in his analysis: \\"A President more exact, systematic and vigilant than Lincoln, a Secretary more alert and clearheaded than Cameron, would have prevented these difficulties.\\"[25]\\r\\nBy the end of 1861, 700,000 soldiers were drilling in Union camps. The first wave in spring was called up for only 90 days, then the soldiers went home or reenlisted. Later waves enlisted for three years.\\r\\nThe new recruits spent their time drilling in company and regiment formations. The combat in the first year, though strategically important, involved relatively small forces and few casualties. Sickness was a much more serious cause of hospitalization or death.\\r\\nIn the first few months, men wore low quality uniforms made of \\"shoddy\\" material, but by fall, sturdy wool uniformsin bluewere standard. The nation's factories were converted to produce the rifles, cannons, wagons, tents, telegraph sets, and the myriad of other special items the army needed.\\r\\nWhile business had been slow or depressed in spring 1861, because of war fears and Southern boycotts, by fall business was hiring again, offering young men jobs that were an alternative way to help win the war. Nonpartisanship was the rule in the first year, but by summer 1862, many Democrats had stopped supporting the war effort, and volunteering fell off sharply in their strongholds.\\r\\nThe calls for more and more soldiers continued, so states and localities responded by offering cash bonuses. By 1863, a draft law was in effect, but few men actually were drafted and served, since the law was designed to get them to volunteer or hire a substitute. Others hid away or left the country. With the Emancipation Proclamation taking effect in January 1863, localities could meet their draft quota by sponsoring regiments of ex-slaves organized in the South.[26]\\r\\nMichigan was especially eager to send thousands of volunteers.[27] A study of the cities of Grand Rapids and Niles shows an overwhelming surge of nationalism in 1861, whipping up enthusiasm for the war in all segments of society, and all political, religious, ethnic, and occupational groups. However, by 1862 the casualties were mounting, and the war was increasingly focused on freeing the slaves in addition to preserving the Union. Copperhead Democrats called the war a failure, and it became an increasingly partisan Republican effort.[28] Michigan voters remained evenly split between the parties in the presidential election of 1864.[29]\\r\\nPerman (2010) says historians are of two minds on why millions of men seemed so eager to fight, suffer, and die over four years:\\r\\nSome historians emphasize that Civil War soldiers were driven by political ideology, holding firm beliefs about the importance of liberty, Union, or state rights, or about the need to protect or to destroy slavery. Others point to less overtly political reasons to fight, such as the defense of one's home and family, or the honor and brotherhood to be preserved when fighting alongside other men. Most historians agree that, no matter what he thought about when he went into the war, the experience of combat affected him profoundly and sometimes affected his reasons for continuing to fight.[30]\\r\\nOn the whole, the national, state, and local governments handled the avalanche of paperwork effectively. Skills developed in insurance and financial companies formed the basis of systematic forms, copies, summaries, and filing systems used to make sense of masses of human data. The leader in this effort, John Shaw Billings, later developed a system of mechanically storing, sorting, and counting numerical information using punch cards. Nevertheless, old-fashioned methodology had to be recognized and overcome. An illustrative case study came in New Hampshire, where the critical post of state adjutant general was held in 1861ÿ64 by elderly politician Anthony C. Colby (1792ÿ1873) and his son Daniel E. Colby (1816ÿ1891). They were patriotic, but were overwhelmed with the complexity of their duties. The state lost track of men who enlisted after 1861; it had no personnel records or information on volunteers, substitutes, or draftees, and there was no inventory of weaponry and supplies. Nathaniel Head (1828ÿ1883) took over in 1864, obtained an adequate budget and office staff, and reconstructed the missing paperwork. As result, widows, orphans, and disabled veterans received the postwar payments they had earned.[31]\\r\\nMore soldiers died of disease than from battle injuries, and even larger numbers were temporarily incapacitated by wounds, disease, and accidents. The Union responded by building army hospitals in every state.\\r\\nThe hygiene of the camps was poor, especially at the beginning of the war when men who had seldom been far from home were brought together for training with thousands of strangers. First came epidemics of the childhood diseases of chicken pox, mumps, whooping cough, and especially, measles. Operations in the South meant a dangerous and new disease environment, bringing diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid fever, and malaria. There were no antibiotics, so the surgeons prescribed coffee, whiskey, and quinine. Harsh weather, bad water, inadequate shelter in winter quarters, poor policing of camps, and dirty camp hospitals took their toll.[32] This was a common scenario in wars from time immemorial, and conditions faced by the Confederate army were even worse. What was different in the Union was the emergence of skilled, well-funded medical organizers who took proactive action, especially in the much enlarged United States Army Medical Department,[33] and the United States Sanitary Commission, a new private agency.[34] Numerous other new agencies also targeted the medical and morale needs of soldiers, including the United States Christian Commission, as well as smaller private agencies, such as the Women's Central Association of Relief for Sick and Wounded in the Army (WCAR), founded in 1861 by Henry Whitney Bellows, a Unitarian minister, and the social reformer Dorothea Dix. Systematic funding appeals raised public consciousness as well as millions of dollars. Many thousands of volunteers worked in the hospitals and rest homes, most famously poet Walt Whitman. Frederick Law Olmsted, a famous landscape architect, was the highly efficient executive director of the Sanitary Commission.[35]\\r\\nStates could use their own tax money to support their troops, as Ohio did. Under the energetic leadership of Governor David Tod, a War Democrat who won office on a coalition \\"Union Party\\" ticket with Republicans, Ohio acted vigorously. Following the unexpected carnage at the battle of Shiloh in April 1862, Ohio sent three steamboats to the scene as floating hospitals equipped with doctors, nurses, and medical supplies. The state fleet expanded to 11 hospital ships, and the state set up 12 local offices in main transportation nodes, to help Ohio soldiers moving back and forth.[36]\\r\\nThe Christian Commission comprised 6,000 volunteers who aided chaplains in many ways.[37] For example, its agents distributed Bibles, delivered sermons, helped with sending letters home, taught men to read and write, and set up camp libraries.[38]\\r\\nThe Army learned many lessons and modernized its procedures,[39] and medical scienceespecially surgerymade many advances.[40] In the long run, the wartime experiences of the numerous Union commissions modernized public welfare, and set the stage for largescale community philanthropy in America based on fund raising campaigns and private donations.[41]\\r\\nAdditionally, women gained new public roles. For example, Mary Livermore (1820ÿ1905), the manager of the Chicago branch of the US Sanitary Commission, used her newfound organizational skills to mobilize support for women's suffrage after the war. She argued that women needed more education and job opportunities to help them fulfill their role of serving others.[42]\\r\\nThe Sanitary Commission collected enormous amounts of statistical data, and opened up the problems of storing information for fast access and mechanically searching for data patterns.[43] The pioneer was John Shaw Billings (1838ÿ1913). A senior surgeon in the war, Billings built two of the world's most important libraries, Library of the Surgeon General's Office (now the National Library of Medicine) and the New York Public Library; he also figured out how to mechanically analyze data by turning it into numbers and punching onto the computer punch card as developed by his student Herman Hollerith. Hollerith's company became International Business Machines (IBM) in 1911.[44]\\r\\nBoth sides operated prison camps; they handled about 400,000 captives, but many other prisoners were quickly released and never sent to camps. The Record and Pension Office in 1901 counted 211,000 Northerners who were captured. In 1861ÿ63 most were immediately paroled; after the parole exchange system broke down in 1863, about 195,000 went to Confederate prison camps. Some tried to escape but few succeeded. By contrast 464,000 Confederates were captured (many in the final days) and 215,000 imprisoned. Over 30,000 Union and nearly 26,000 Confederate prisoners died in captivity. Just over 12% of the captives in Northern prisons died, compared to 15.5% for Southern prisons.[45][46]\\r\\nDiscontent with the 1863 draft law led to riots in several cities and in rural areas as well. By far the most important were the New York City draft riots of July 13 to July 16, 1863.[47] Irish Catholic and other workers fought police, militia and regular army units until the Army used artillery to sweep the streets. Initially focused on the draft, the protests quickly expanded into violent attacks on blacks in New York City, with many killed on the streets.[48]\\r\\nSmall-scale riots broke out in ethnic German and Irish districts, and in areas along the Ohio River with many Copperheads. Holmes County, Ohio was an isolated parochial area dominated by Pennsylvania Dutch and some recent German immigrants. It was a Democratic stronghold and few men dared speak out in favor of conscription. Local politicians denounced Lincoln and Congress as despotic, seeing the draft law as a violation of their local autonomy. In June 1863, small-scale disturbances broke out; they ended when the Army sent in armed units.[49][50][51]\\r\\nThe Union economy grew and prospered during the war while fielding a very large army and navy.[52] The Republicans in Washington had a Whiggish vision of an industrial nation, with great cities, efficient factories, productive farms, all national banks, all knit together by a modern railroad system, to be mobilized by the United States Military Railroad. The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit. With the South gone and Northern Democrats weak, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At the same time they passed new taxes to pay for part of the war and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for most of the rest. Economic historians attribute the remainder of the cost of the war to inflation. Congress wrote an elaborate program of economic modernization that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy.[53] For a list of the major industrialists see .\\r\\nIn 1860 the Treasury was a small operation that funded the small-scale operations of the government through land sales and customs based on a low tariff.[54] Peacetime revenues were trivial in comparison with the cost of a full-scale war but the Treasury Department under Secretary Salmon P. Chase showed unusual ingenuity in financing the war without crippling the economy.[55] Many new taxes were imposed and always with a patriotic theme comparing the financial sacrifice to the sacrifices of life and limb. The government paid for supplies in real money, which encouraged people to sell to the government regardless of their politics. By contrast the Confederacy gave paper promissory notes when it seized property, so that even loyal Confederates would hide their horses and mules rather than sell them for dubious paper. Overall the Northern financial system was highly successful in raising money and turning patriotism into profit, while the Confederate system impoverished its patriots.[56]\\r\\nThe United States needed $3.1 billion to pay for the immense armies and fleets raised to fight the Civil Warover $400?million just in 1862 alone.[57] Apart from tariffs, the largest revenue by far came from new excise taxesa sort of value added taxthat was imposed on every sort of manufactured item. Second came much higher tariffs, through several Morrill tariff laws. Third came the nation's first income tax; only the wealthy paid and it was repealed at war's end.\\r\\nApart from taxes, the second major source of income was government bonds. For the first time bonds in small denominations were sold directly to the people, with publicity and patriotism as key factors, as designed by banker Jay Cooke. State banks lost their power to issue banknotes. Only national banks could do that and Chase made it easy to become a national bank; it involved buying and holding federal bonds and financiers rushed to open these banks. Chase numbered them, so that the first one in each city was the \\"First National Bank\\".[58] Third, the government printed paper money called \\"greenbacks\\". They led to endless controversy because they caused inflation.[59]\\r\\nThe North's most important war measure was perhaps the creation of a system of national banks that provided a sound currency for the industrial expansion. Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs.[60]\\r\\nSecretary Chase, though a long-time free-trader, worked with Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, raising rates another 10?points in order to generate more revenues.[61] These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting. The Morrill Tariff of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted tens of thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs.[62]\\r\\nCustoms revenue from tariffs totaled $345?million from 1861 through 1865 or 43% of all federal tax revenue.\\r\\nThe U.S. government owned vast amounts of good land (mostly from the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Oregon Treaty with Britain in 1846). The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt. Land grants went to railroad construction companies to open up the western plains and link up to California. Together with the free lands provided farmers by the Homestead Law the low-cost farm lands provided by the land grants sped up the expansion of commercial agriculture in the West.\\r\\nThe 1862 Homestead Act opened up the public domain lands for free. Land grants to the railroads meant they could sell tracts for family farms (80 to 200 acres) at low prices with extended credit. In addition the government sponsored fresh information, scientific methods and the latest techniques through the newly established Department of Agriculture and the Morrill Land Grant College Act.[63][64]\\r\\nAgriculture was the largest single industry and it prospered during the war.[65][66] Prices were high, pulled up by a strong demand from the army and from Britain (which depended on American wheat for a fourth of its food imports). The war acted as a catalyst that encouraged the rapid adoption of horse-drawn machinery and other implements. The rapid spread of recent inventions such as the reaper and mower made the work force efficient, even as hundreds of thousands of farmers were in the army. Many wives took their place and often consulted by mail on what to do; increasingly they relied on community and extended kin for advice and help.[67]\\r\\nThe Union used hundreds of thousands of animals. The Army had plenty of cash to purchase them from farmers and breeders but especially in the early months the quality was mixed.[68] Horses were needed for cavalry and artillery.[69] Mules pulled the wagons. The supply held up, despite an unprecedented epidemic of glanders, a fatal disease that baffled veterinarians.[70] In the South, the Union army shot all the horses it did not need to keep them out of Confederate hands.\\r\\nThe Treasury started buying cotton during the war, for shipment to Europe and northern mills. The sellers were Southern planters who needed the cash, regardless of their patriotism. The Northern buyers could make heavy profits, which annoyed soldiers like Ulysses Grant. He blamed Jewish traders and expelled them from his lines in 1862 but Lincoln quickly overruled this show of anti-semitism. Critics said the cotton trade helped the South, prolonged the war and fostered corruption. Lincoln decided to continue the trade for fear that Britain might intervene if its textile manufacturers were denied raw material. Another goal was to foster latent Unionism in Southern border states. Northern textile manufacturers needed cotton to remain in business and to make uniforms, while cotton exports to Europe provided an important source of gold to finance the war.[71]\\r\\nThe Protestant religion was quite strong in the North in the 1860s. The United States Christian Commission sent agents into the Army camps to provide psychological support as well as books, newspapers, food and clothing. Through prayer, sermons and welfare operations, the agents ministered to soldiers' spiritual as well as temporal needs as they sought to bring the men to a Christian way of life.[72] Most churches made an effort to support their soldiers in the field and especially their families back home. Much of the political rhetoric of the era had a distinct religious tone.[73]\\r\\nThe Protestant clergy in America took a variety of positions. In general, the pietistic denominations such as the Methodists, Northern Baptists and Congregationalists strongly supported the war effort. Catholics, Episcopalians, Lutherans and conservative Presbyterians generally avoided any discussion of the war, so it would not bitterly divide their membership. The Quakers, while giving strong support to the abolitionist movement on a personal level, refused to take a denominational position. Some clergymen who supported the Confederacy were denounced as Copperheads, especially in the border regions.[74][75]\\r\\nMany Northerners had only recently become religious (following the Second Great Awakening) and religion was a powerful force in their lives. No denomination was more active in supporting the Union than the Methodist Episcopal Church. Carwardine[76] argues that for many Methodists, the victory of Lincoln in 1860 heralded the arrival of the kingdom of God in America. They were moved into action by a vision of freedom for slaves, freedom from the persecutions of godly abolitionists, release from the Slave Power's evil grip on the American government and the promise of a new direction for the Union.[76] Methodists formed a major element of the popular support for the Radical Republicans with their hard line toward the white South. Dissident Methodists left the church.[77] During Reconstruction the Methodists took the lead in helping form Methodist churches for Freedmen and moving into Southern cities even to the point of taking control, with Army help, of buildings that had belonged to the southern branch of the church.[78][79]\\r\\nThe Methodist family magazine Ladies' Repository promoted Christian family activism. Its articles provided moral uplift to women and children. It portrayed the War as a great moral crusade against a decadent Southern civilization corrupted by slavery. It recommended activities that family members could perform in order to aid the Union cause.[80]\\r\\nHistorian Stephen M. Frank reports that what it meant to be a father varied with status and age. He says most men demonstrated dual commitments as providers and nurturers and believed that husband and wife had mutual obligations toward their children. The war privileged masculinity, dramatizing and exaggerating, father-son bonds. Especially at five critical stages in the soldier's career (enlistment, blooding, mustering out, wounding and death) letters from absent fathers articulated a distinctive set of 19th-century ideals of manliness.[81]\\r\\nThere were numerous children's magazines such as Merry's Museum, The Student and Schoolmate, Our Young Folks, The Little Pilgrim, Forrester's Playmate, and The Little Corporal. They showed a Protestant religious tone and \\"promoted the principles of hard work, obedience, generosity, humility, and piety; trumpeted the benefits of family cohesion; and furnished mild adventure stories, innocent entertainment, and instruction\\".[82] Their pages featured factual information and anecdotes about the war along with related quizzes, games, poems, songs, short oratorical pieces for \\"declamation\\", short stories and very short plays that children could stage. They promoted patriotism and the Union war aims, fostered kindly attitudes toward freed slaves, blackened the Confederates cause, encouraged readers to raise money for war-related humanitarian funds, and dealt with the death of family members.[83] By 1866, the Milton Bradley Company was selling \\"The Myriopticon: A Historical Panorama of the Rebellion\\" that allowed children to stage a neighborhood show that would explain the war. It comprised colorful drawings that were turned on wheels and included pre-printed tickets, poster advertisements, and narration that could be read aloud at the show.[84]\\r\\nCaring for war orphans was an important function for local organizations as well as state and local government.[85] A typical state was Iowa, where the private \\"Iowa Soldiers Orphans Home Association\\" operated with funding from the legislature and public donations. It set up orphanages in Davenport, Glenwood and Cedar Falls. The state government funded pensions for the widows and children of soldiers.[86] Orphan schools like the Pennsylvania Soldiers' Orphan School, also spoke of the broader public welfare experiment that began as part of the aftermath of the Civil War. These orphan schools were created to provide housing, care, and education for orphans of Civil War soldiers. They became a matter of state pride, with orphans were paraded around at rallies to display the power of a patriotic schooling.[87]\\r\\nAll the northern states had free public school systems before the war but not the border states. West Virginia set up its system in 1863. Over bitter opposition it established an almost-equal education for black children, most of whom were ex-slaves.[88] Thousands of black refugees poured into St. Louis, where the Freedmen's Relief Society, the Ladies Union Aid Society, the Western Sanitary Commission, and the American Missionary Association (AMA) set up schools for their children.[89]\\r\\nPeople loyal to the U.S. federal government and opposed to secession living in the border states (where slavery was legal in 1861) were termed Unionists. Confederates sometimes styled them \\"Homemade Yankees\\". However, Southern Unionists were not necessarily northern sympathizers and many of them, although opposing secession, supported the Confederacy once it was a fact. East Tennessee never supported the Confederacy, and Unionists there became powerful state leaders, including governors Andrew Johnson and William G. Brownlow. Likewise, large pockets of eastern Kentucky were Unionist and helped keep the state from seceding.[90] Western Virginia, with few slaves and some industry, was so strongly Unionist that it broke away and formed the new state of West Virginia.[91]\\r\\nStill, nearly 120,000 Unionists from the South served in the Union Army during the Civil War and Unionist regiments were raised from every Confederate state except South Carolina. Among such units was the 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment, which served as William Sherman's personal escort on his march to the sea. Southern Unionists were extensively used as anti-guerrilla paramilitary forces.[92] During Reconstruction many of these Unionists became \\"Scalawags\\", a derogatory term for Southern supporters of the Republican Party.[93]\\r\\nBesides organized military conflict, the border states were beset by guerrilla warfare. In such a bitterly divided state, neighbors frequently used the excuse of war to settle personal grudges and took up arms against neighbors.\\r\\nMissouri was the scene of over 1000 engagements between Union and Confederate forces, and uncounted numbers of guerrilla attacks and raids by informal pro-Confederate bands.[94] Western Missouri was the scene of brutal guerrilla warfare during the Civil War. Roving insurgent bands such as Quantrill's Raiders and the men of Bloody Bill Anderson terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements. Because of the widespread attacks and the protection offered by Confederate sympathizers, Federal leaders issued General Order No. 11 in 1863, and evacuated areas of Jackson, Cass, and Bates counties. They forced the residents out to reduce support for the guerrillas. Union cavalry could sweep through and track down Confederate guerrillas, who no longer had places to hide and people and infrastructure to support them. On short notice, the army forced almost 20,000 people, mostly women, children and the elderly, to leave their homes. Many never returned and the affected counties were economically devastated for years after the end of the war.[95] Families passed along stories of their bitter experiences down through several generations ÿ Harry Truman's grandparents were caught up in the raids and he would tell of how they were kept in concentration camps.[96]\\r\\nSome marauding units became organized criminal gangs after the war. In 1882, the bank robber and ex-Confederate guerrilla Jesse James was killed in Saint Joseph. Vigilante groups appeared in remote areas where law enforcement was weak, to deal with the lawlessness left over from the guerrilla warfare phase. For example, the Bald Knobbers were the term for several law-and-order vigilante groups in the Ozarks. In some cases, they too turned to illegal gang activity.[97]\\r\\nIn response to the growing problem of locally organized guerrilla campaigns throughout 1863 and 1864, in June 1864, Maj. Gen. Stephen G. Burbridge was given command over the state of Kentucky. This began an extended period of military control that would last through early 1865, beginning with martial law authorized by President Abraham Lincoln. To pacify Kentucky, Burbridge rigorously suppressed disloyalty and used economic pressure as coercion. His guerrilla policy, which included public execution of four guerrillas for the death of each unarmed Union citizen, caused the most controversy. After a falling out with Governor Thomas E. Bramlette, Burbridge was dismissed in February 1865. Confederates remembered him as the \\"Butcher of Kentucky\\".[98]\\r\\nList of Wikipedia articles on Union states and major cities:\\r\\n* Border states with slavery in 1861\\r\\n?Had two state governments, one Unionist one Confederate, both claiming to be the legitimate government of their state.

Sigsbee Parkoriginally known as Dredgers Keyand Fleming Key, both located to the north, and Sunset Key located to the west are all included in the city boundaries. Both Fleming Key and Sigsbee Park are part of Naval Air Station Key West and are inaccessible to the general public. Key West is the southernmost city in the contiguous United States and the southern terminus of U.S. Route 1, State Road A1A, the East Coast Greenway and, before 1935, the Florida East Coast Railway.\\r\\nKey West is 129 miles (208?km) southwest of Miami by air,[6] about 160 miles (260?km) by car, and 106 miles (171?km) north-northeast of Havana, Cuba.[7] Cuba, at its closest point, is 94 miles (151?km) south.[8] Key West is a port of call for many passenger cruise ships.[9] The Key West International Airport provides airline service. Naval Air Station Key West is an important year round training site for naval aviation due to the tropical weather, which is also the reason Key West was chosen as the Winter White House of President Harry S. Truman. The central business district is located along Duval Street and includes much of the northwestern corner of the island. The official city motto is \\"One Human Family.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Pre-Colonial times Key West was inhabited by the Calusa people. The first European to visit was Juan Ponce de Le܇n in 1521. As Florida became a Spanish territory, a fishing and salvage village with a small garrison was established here.[citation needed]\\r\\nCayo Hueso (Spanish pronunciation:?[?ka?o ?weso]) is the original Spanish name for the island of Key West. Spanish-speaking people today also use the term when referring to Key West. It literally means \\"bone cay (a low island or reef)\\". It is said that the island was littered with the remains (bones) of prior native inhabitants, who used the isle as a communal graveyard.[10] This island was the westernmost Key with a reliable supply of water.[11]\\r\\nIn 1763, when Great Britain took control of Florida, the community of Spaniards and Native Americans were moved to Havana. Florida returned to Spanish control 20 years later, but there was no official resettlement of the island. Informally the island was used by fishermen from Cuba and from the British, who were later joined by others from the United States after the latter nation's independence. While claimed by Spain, no nation exercised de facto control over the community there for some time.\\r\\nIn 1815, the Spanish governor of Cuba in Havana deeded the island of Key West to Juan Pablo Salas, an officer of the Royal Spanish Navy Artillery posted in Saint Augustine, Florida. After Florida was transferred to the United States in 1821, Salas was so eager to sell the island that he sold it twice?ÿ first for a sloop valued at $575 to a General John Geddes, a former governor of South Carolina, and then to a U.S. businessman John W. Simonton, during a meeting in a Havana caf on January 19, 1822, for the equivalent of $2,000 in pesos in 1821. Geddes tried in vain to secure his rights to the property before Simonton who, with the aid of some influential friends in Washington, was able to gain clear title to the island. Simonton had wide-ranging business interests in Mobile, Alabama. He bought the island because a friend, John Whitehead, had drawn his attention to the opportunities presented by the island's strategic location. John Whitehead had been stranded in Key West after a shipwreck in 1819 and he had been impressed by the potential offered by the deep harbor of the island. The island was indeed considered the \\"Gibraltar of the West\\" because of its strategic location on the 90-mile (140?km)ÿwide deep shipping lane, the Straits of Florida, between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.\\r\\nOn March 25, 1822, Lt. Commander Matthew C. Perry sailed the schooner Shark to Key West and planted the U.S. flag, claiming the Keys as United States property.[12] No protests were made over the American claim on Key West, so the Florida Keys became the property of the United States.\\r\\nAfter claiming the Florida Keys for the United States, Perry renamed Cayo Hueso (Key West) to \\"Thompson's Island\\" for Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson, and the harbor \\"Port Rodgers\\" in honor of War of 1812 hero and President of the Navy Supervisors Board John Rodgers. In 1823, Commodore David Porter of the United States Navy West Indies Anti-Pirate Squadron took charge of Key West, which he ruled (but, according to some,[according to whom?] exceeding his authority) as military dictator under martial law. Porter was tasked by the American Navy to end acts of piracy in the Key West area including slave ships.\\r\\nSoon after his purchase, John Simonton subdivided the island into plots and sold three undivided quarters of each plot to:\\r\\nSimonton spent the winter in Key West and the summer in Washington, where he lobbied hard for the development of the island and to establish a naval base on the island, both to take advantage of the island's strategic location and to bring law and order to the town. He died in 1854.\\r\\nThe names of the four \\"founding fathers\\"[15] of modern Key West were given to main arteries of the island when it was first platted in 1829 by William Adee Whitehead, John Whitehead's younger brother. That first plat and the names used remained mostly intact and are still in use today. Duval Street, the island's main street, is named after Florida's first territorial governor, who served between 1822 and 1834 as the longest-serving governor in Florida's U.S. history.\\r\\nWilliam Whitehead became chief editorial writer for the \\"Enquirer\\", a local newspaper, in 1834. He had the genius of preserving copies of his newspaper as well as copies from the \\"Key West Gazette\\", its predecessor. He later sent those copies to the Monroe County clerk for preservation, which gives us a precious view of life in Key West in the early days (1820ÿ1840).\\r\\nIn the 1830s Key West was the richest city per capita in the United States.[16]\\r\\nIn 1852 the first Catholic Church, St. Mary's Star-Of-The-Sea was built. The year 1864 became a landmark for the church in South Florida when five Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary arrived from Montreal, Canada, and established the first Catholic school in South Florida. The Convent of Mary Immaculate, the oldest Catholic School in Florida which is now known as Mary Immaculate Star of the Sea School.\\r\\nDuring the American Civil War, while Florida seceded and joined the Confederate States of America, Key West remained in U.S. Union hands because of the naval base. However, most locals were sympathetic to the Confederacy, and many flew Confederate flags over their homes.[17] Fort Zachary Taylor, constructed from 1845 to 1866, was an important Key West outpost during the Civil War. Construction began in 1861 on two other forts, East and West Martello Towers, which served as side armories and batteries for the larger fort. When completed, they were connected to Fort Taylor by railroad tracks for movement of munitions.[17] Fort Jefferson, located about 68 miles (109?km) from Key West on Garden Key in the Dry Tortugas, served after the Civil War as the prison for Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, convicted of conspiracy for setting the broken leg of John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln.\\r\\nIn the 19th century, major industries included wrecking and salvaging; fishing; turtling, and salt manufacturing.[18] From 1830 to 1861, Key West was a major center of U.S. salt production, harvesting the commodity from the sea (via receding tidal pools) rather than from salt mines.[18] After the outbreak of the Civil War, Union troops shut down the salt industry after Confederate sympathizers smuggled the product into the South.[18] Salt production resumed at the end of the war, but the industry was destroyed by an 1876 hurricane and never recovered, in part because of new salt mines on the mainland.[18]\\r\\nDuring the Ten Years' War (an unsuccessful Cuban war for independence in the 1860s and 1870s), many Cubans sought refuge in Key West.\\r\\nA fire on April 1, 1886, started at a cigar club and grew out of control, destroying 18 cigar factories and 614 houses and government warehouse buildings.[19]\\r\\nBy 1889, Key West was the largest and wealthiest city in Florida.[17]\\r\\nThe USS Maine sailed from Key West on its fateful visit to Havana, where it blew up and sank in Havana Harbor, igniting the SpanishÿAmerican War. Crewmen from the ship are buried in Key West, and the Navy investigation into the blast occurred at the Key West Customs House.\\r\\nThe Overseas Railroad linked Key West to the mainland in 1912; it was destroyed in the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. The Overseas Highway, and extension of U.S. Route 1 in Florida, was completed in 1938; it was built atop many of the footings of the railroad.\\r\\nPan American Airlines was founded in Key West, originally to fly visitors to Havana, in 1926. The airline contracted with the United States Postal Service in 1927 to deliver mail to and from Cuba and the United States. The mail route was known as the Key West, Florida ÿ Havana Mail Route.\\r\\nJohn F. Kennedy was to use \\"90 miles from Cuba\\" extensively in his speeches against Fidel Castro. Kennedy himself visited Key West a month after the resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis.\\r\\nPrior to the Cuban revolution of 1959, there were regular ferry and airplane services between Key West and Havana.\\r\\nKey West is located at 243333N 814703W? / ?24.55917N 81.78417W? / 24.55917; -81.78417.[20] The maximum elevation above sea level is about 18 feet (5?m), a 1-acre (4,000?m2) area known as Solares Hill.[21]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 7.4 square miles (19?km2), of which 5.9 square miles (15?km2) is land and 1.5 square miles (3.9?km2) (19.73%) is water.\\r\\nSince the 1940s, the island has more than doubled in size via landfill.[citation needed] The new section on the eastern side is called \\"New Town.\\" It contains shopping centers, retail malls, residential areas, schools, ball parks, and Key West International Airport.\\r\\nKey West and most of the rest of the Keys are on the dividing line between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. The two bodies have different currents, with the calmer and warmer Gulf of Mexico being characterized by great clumps of seagrass. The area where the two bodies merge between Key West and Cuba is called the Straits of Florida.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKey West was relatively isolated until 1912, when it was connected to the Florida mainland via the Overseas Railway extension of Henry M. Flagler's Florida East Coast Railway (FEC). Flagler created a landfill at Trumbo Point for his railyards. The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 destroyed much of the railroad and killed hundreds of residents, including around 400 World War I veterans who were living in camps and working on federal road and mosquito-control projects in the Middle Keys. The FEC could not afford to restore the railroad.\\r\\nThe U.S. government then rebuilt the rail route as an automobile highway, completed in 1938, which became an extension of United States Highway 1. The portion of U.S. 1 through the Keys is called the Overseas Highway. Franklin Roosevelt toured the road in 1939.\\r\\n\\r\\nKey West has a tropical savanna climate (K?ppen Aw, similar to the Caribbean islands).[22] Like most tropical climates, Key West has only a small difference in monthly mean temperatures between the coolest month (January) and the warmest month (July)?ÿ with the annual range of monthly mean temperatures around 15?F (8.3?C). The Florida Keys are one of the only locations on the mainland U.S. known to never have had a frost or freeze?ÿ the lowest temperature on record is 41?F (5?C) on January 12, 1886, and January 13, 1981. Prevailing easterly tradewinds and sea breezes suppress the usual summertime heating, with temperatures rarely reaching 95?F (35?C). There are 55 days per year with 90?F (32?C) or greater highs,[23] with the average window for such readings June 10 through September 22, shorter than almost the entire southeastern U.S. However, low temperatures often remain above 80?F (27?C). The all-time record high temperature is 97?F (36?C) on July 19, 1880, and August 29, 1956.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most tropical climates, Key West has a two-season wet and dry climate. The period from November through April is normally sunny and quite dry, with only 25 percent of the annual rainfall occurring. May through October is normally the wet season. During the wet season some rain falls on most days, often as brief, but heavy tropical downpours, followed by intense sun. Early morning is the favored time for these showers, which is different from mainland Florida, where showers and thunderstorms usually occur in the afternoon. Easterly (tropical) waves during this season occasionally bring excessive rainfall, while infrequent hurricanes may be accompanied by unusually heavy amounts. On average, rainfall markedly peaks between August and October; the single wettest month in Key West is September, when the threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions) is greatest. Key West is the driest city in Florida, averaging just under 40 inches of rain per year. This is driven primarily by Key West's relative dryness in May, June and July. In mainland Florida peninsular areas like Orlando, Tampa/St. Petersburg and Fort Myers, June and July average monthly rainfalls typically reach 7 to 10 inches, while Key West has only half such amounts over the same period.[27]\\r\\nHurricanes rarely affect Key West, and the island has been relatively unaffected by major storms. Some locals maintain that Hurricane Wilma on October 24, 2005, was the worst storm in memory. The entire island was told to evacuate and business owners were forced to shut their doors. After the hurricane had passed, the resulting storm surge sent eight feet (two meters) of water inland completely inundating a large portion of the lower Keys. Low-lying areas of Key West and the lower Keys, including major tourist destinations, were under as much as three feet (one meter) of water. Sixty percent of the homes in Key West were flooded.[28] The higher parts of Old Town, such as the Solares Hill and cemetery areas, did not flood, because of their higher elevations of 12 to 18 feet (4 to 5?m).[29] The surge destroyed tens of thousands of cars throughout the lower Keys, and many houses were flooded with one to two feet (thirty to sixty-one centimeters) of sea water. A local newspaper referred to Key West and the lower Keys as a \\"car graveyard.\\"[30] The peak of the storm surge occurred when the eye of Wilma had already passed over the Naples area, and the sustained winds during the surge were less than 40?mph (64?km/h).[29] The storm destroyed the piers at the clothing-optional Atlantic Shores Motel and breached the shark tank at the Key West Aquarium, freeing its sharks. Damage postponed the island's famous Halloween Fantasy Fest until the following December. MTV's The Real World: Key West was filming during the hurricane and deals with the storm.\\r\\nIn September 2005, NOAA opened its National Weather Forecasting building on White Street. The building is designed to withstand a Category 5 hurricane and its storm surge. Tours of the office are available, weather permitting, Monday-Friday from 10am to 12pm.\\r\\nThe most intense previous hurricane was Hurricane Georges, a Category 2, in September 1998. The storm damaged many of the houseboats along \\"Houseboat Row\\" on South Roosevelt Boulevard near Cow Key channel on the east side of the island.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most recent hurricane to impact Key West was Hurricane Irma, which made landfall in the Keys in the morning of September 10, 2017 as a Category 4 storm.\\r\\nThe first cruise ship was the Sunward in 1969, which docked at the Navy's pier in the Truman Annex or the privately owned Pier B. The Navy's pier is called the Navy Mole.\\r\\nIn 1984 the city opened a pier right on Mallory Square. The decision was met with considerable opposition from people who felt it would disrupt the tradition of watching the sunset at Mallory Square. Cruise ships now dock at all three piers.\\r\\nIn present times, several cruise ships dock on a regular basis at Key West, including the Royal Caribbean ship Majesty of the Seas and the Carnival Fascination, both of which visit weekly. In the last several years, however, larger cruise ships have increasingly bypassed Key West due to the narrowness of the island's main ship channel. On October 1, 2013, 74% of resident voters opposed a referendum that would have allowed the City Commission to request a feasibility study from the Army Corps of Engineers for a $36 million project to dredge a wider channel.[31] Economic benefits from visiting cruise ship passengers are substantial but not attractive to all Key West citizens as the daily presence of thousands of tourists from cruise ships affects the character of the city, resulting in operation of facilities that cater to mass tourism rather than to a potentially more profitable and pleasant upscale clientele. There are also environmental issues as Key West is surrounded by coral habitat.[9] Concerns over environmental protection were considered a prominent factor in the failure of the 2013 referendum.[32]\\r\\nAs of 2009[update], there were 859,409 passengers annually.[33]\\r\\nAs of the census[2] of 2000, there were 25,478 people, 11,016 households, and 5,463 families residing in Key West. The population density was 4,285.0 inhabitants per square mile (1,653.3/km2). There were 13,306 housing units at an average density of 2,237.9 per square mile (863.4/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 84.94% White, 9.28% African American, 0.39% Native American, 1.29% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 1.86% from other races, and 2.18% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino persons of any race were 16.54% of the population.\\r\\nThere were 11,016 households, out of which 19.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.7% were married couples living together, 8.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 50.4% were classified as non-families. Of all households, 31.4% were made up of individuals, and 8.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.23 and the average family size was 2.84.\\r\\nThe population was spread out, with 16.0% under the age of 18, 8.4% from 18 to 24, 37.1% from 25 to 44, 26.7% from 45 to 64, and 11.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 122.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 126.0 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household was $43,021, and the median income for those classified as families was $50,895. Males had a median income of $30,967 versus $25,407 for females. The per capita income for the city was $26,316. About 5.8% of families and 10.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.5% of those under age 18 and 11.3% of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nThe ancestries most reported in 2000 were English (12.4%), German (12.2%), Irish (11.3%), Italian (6.8%), American (6.0%) and French (3.6%).\\r\\nThe number of families (as defined by the Census Bureau) declined dramatically in the last four decades of the 20th century. In 1960 there were 13,340 families in Key West, with 42.1% of households having children living in them. By 2000 the population had dwindled to 5,463 families, with only 19.9% of households having children living in them.[35]\\r\\nAs of 2000, 76.66% spoke English as a first language, while Spanish was spoken by 17.32%, 1.06% spoke Italian, 1.02% spoke French, and German spoken as a mother tongue was at 0.94% of the population. In total, other languages spoken besides English made up 25.33% of residents.[36]\\r\\nMany of the residents of Key West were immigrants from the Bahamas, known as Conchs (pronounced \\"conks\\"'), who arrived in increasing numbers after 1830. Many were sons and daughters of Loyalists who fled to the nearest Crown soil during the American Revolution.[37] In the 20th century many residents of Key West started referring to themselves as Conchs, and the term is now generally applied to all residents of Key West. Some residents use the term \\"Conch\\" (or, alternatively, \\"Saltwater Conch\\") to refer to a person born in Key West, while the term \\"Freshwater Conch\\" refers to a resident not born in Key West but who has lived in Key West for seven years or more.[38] However, the true original meaning of Conch applies only to someone with European ancestry who immigrated from the Bahamas. It is said that when a baby was born, the family would put a conch shell on a pole in front of their home.\\r\\nMany of the black Bahamian immigrants who arrived later lived in Bahama Village, an area of Old Town next to the Truman Annex.\\r\\nKey West is closer to Havana (106 miles [171?km]) than it is to Miami (129 miles [208?km]). In 1890, Key West had a population of nearly 18,800 and was the biggest and richest city in Florida.[39] Half the residents were said to be of Cuban origin, and Key West regularly had Cuban mayors, including the son of Carlos Manuel de Cspedes, father of the Cuban Republic, who was elected mayor in 1876.[40] Cubans were actively involved in reportedly 200 factories in town, producing 100 million cigars annually. Jos Mart made several visits to seek recruits for Cuban independence starting in 1891 and founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party during his visits to Key West.[40]\\r\\nKey West was flooded with refugees during the Mariel Boatlift. Refugees continue to come ashore and, on at least one occasion, most notably in April 2003, flew hijacked Cuban Airlines planes into the city's airport.[41]\\r\\nKey West Government is governed via the mayor-council system. The city council is known as the city commission. It consists of six members each elected from individual districts. The mayor is elected in a citywide vote.\\r\\nMayors of Key West have reflected the city's cultural and ethnic heritage. Among its mayors are the first Cuban mayor and one of the first openly gay mayors. One mayor is also famous for having water-skied to Cuba.[42]\\r\\nIn 1982 the city of Key West briefly declared its \\"independence\\" as the Conch Republic in a protest over a United States Border Patrol blockade. This blockade was set up on U.S. 1, where the northern end of the Overseas Highway meets the mainland at Florida City. The blockade was in response to the Mariel Boatlift. A traffic jam of 17 miles (27?km) ensued while the Border Patrol stopped every car leaving the Keys, supposedly searching for illegal immigrants attempting to enter the mainland United States. This paralyzed the Florida Keys, which rely heavily on the tourism industry. Flags, T-shirts and other merchandise representing the Conch Republic are still popular souvenirs for visitors to Key West, and the Conch Republic Independence Celebrationincluding parades and partiesis celebrated every April 23.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonroe County School District operates public schools in Key West.\\r\\nDistrict-operated elementary schools serving the City of Key West include Poinciana Elementary School, which is located on the island of Key West, and Gerald Adams Elementary School, which is located on Stock Island.[43] District-operated middle and high schools include Horace O'Bryant School, a former middle school which now operates as a Kÿ8 school, and the Key West High School. All of Key West is zoned to Horace O'Bryant School for grades 6-8 and to Key West High School for grades 9ÿ12. Sigsbee Charter School is a Kÿ8 school of choice, sanctioned by the District and serving predominantly military dependent children as well as children from the community at large.[44] Admission to Sigsbee Charter School is limited and the waiting list is managed by a lottery system.[45] Key West Montessori Charter School is a district-sanctioned charter school on Key West Island.[46]\\r\\nThe main campus of Florida Keys Community College is located in Key West.\\r\\nOne of the biggest attractions on the island is a concrete replica of a buoy at the corner of South and Whitehead Streets that claims to be the southernmost point in the contiguous United States (see Extreme Points). Erected in 1983, the famous brightly painted and labeled \\"SOUTHERNMOST POINT CONTINENTAL U.S.A.\\", it is one of the most visited and photographed attractions in the United States. However, the marker is not located at the exact southernmost point in the continental United States, Whitehead Spit, on the Truman Annex property just west of the buoy, is the true southernmost point, but it has no marker since it is U.S. Navy land and cannot be entered by civilian tourists. [47]\\r\\nThe claim \\"90 Miles to Cuba\\" on the monument is close to correct, Cuba at its closest point has been measured at 94 statute miles (151?km) from Key West.[48]\\r\\nThe original Key West settlement on the western part of the island is called \\"Old Town\\" and comprises the Key West Historic District. It includes the major tourist destinations of the island, including Mallory Square, Duval Street, the Truman Annex and Fort Zachary Taylor. It is where are found the classic bungalows and guest mansions.\\r\\nGenerally, the structures date from 1886 to 1912. The basic features that distinguish the local architecture include wood-frame construction of one- to two-and-a-half-story structures set on foundation piers about three feet (one meter) above the ground. Exterior characteristics of the buildings are peaked \\"metal\\" roofs, horizontal wood siding, gingerbread trim, pastel shades of paint, side-hinged louvered shutters, covered porches (or balconies, galleries, or verandas) along the fronts of the structures, and wood lattice screens covering the area elevated by the piers.\\r\\nOld Town is comparable to the \\"New Town\\" section of the island, which was created when the island of Key West was more than doubled in size via landfill. New Town, on the eastern part of the island, contains shopping centers, retail malls, residential areas, schools, ball parks, and Key West International Airport.\\r\\nKey West was always an important military post, since it sits at the northern edge of the deepwater channel connecting the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico (the southern edge 90 miles [140?km] away is Cuba) via the Florida Straits. Because of this, Key West since the 1820s had been dubbed the \\"Gibraltar of the West.\\" Fort Taylor was initially built on the island. The Navy added a small base from which the USS Maine sailed to its demise in Havana at the beginning of the SpanishÿAmerican War.\\r\\nAt the beginning of World War II the Navy increased its presence from 50 acres (200,000?m2) to 3,000 acres (12?km2), including all of Boca Chica Key's 1,700 acres (7?km2) and the construction of Fleming Key from landfill. The Navy built the first water pipeline extending the length of the keys, bringing fresh water from the mainland to supply its bases.[49] At its peak 15,000 military personnel and 3,400 civilians were at the base. Included in the base are:\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral U.S. presidents have visited Key West. Harry Truman visited for 175 days on 11 visits during his presidency and visited several times after he left office (see Truman Annex).\\r\\nKey West was in a down cycle when Franklin D. Roosevelt visited in 1939. The buildup of military bases on the island occurred shortly thereafter.\\r\\nIn addition to Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower stayed in Key West following a heart attack. In November 1962, John F. Kennedy visited Key West a month after the resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Jimmy Carter held a family reunion in Key West after leaving office.\\r\\nLegend has it that Ernest Hemingway wrote part of A Farewell to Arms while living above the showroom of a Key West Ford dealership at 314 Simonton Street[50] while awaiting delivery of a Ford Model A roadster purchased by the uncle of his wife Pauline in 1928.[51]\\r\\nHardware store owner Charles Thompson introduced him to deep-sea fishing. Among the group who went fishing was Joe Russell (also known as Sloppy Joe). Russell was reportedly the model for Freddy in To Have and Have Not. Portions of the original manuscript were found at Sloppy Joe's Bar after his death. The group had nicknames for each other, and Hemingway wound up with \\"Papa\\".\\r\\nPauline's rich uncle Gus Pfeiffer bought the 907 Whitehead Street house[52] in 1931 as a wedding present. Legend says the Hemingways installed a swimming pool for $20,000 in the late 1930s (equivalent in 2013 to $330,000). It was such a high price that Hemingway is said to have put a penny in the concrete, saying, \\"Here, take the last penny I've got!\\" The penny is still there.\\r\\nDuring his stay he wrote or worked on Death in the Afternoon, For Whom the Bell Tolls, The Snows of Kilimanjaro, and The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber. He used Depression-era Key West as one of the locations in To Have and Have Nothis only novel with scenes that occur in the United States.\\r\\nPauline and Hemingway divorced in 1939; Hemingway only occasionally visited when returning from Havana until his suicide in 1961.\\r\\nThe six- or seven-toed polydactyl cats descended from Hemingway's original pet \\"Snowball\\" still live on the grounds and are cared for at the Hemingway House, despite complaints by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that they are not kept free from visitor contact.

He bought a permanent house in 1949 and listed Key West as his primary residence until his death in 1983. In contrast to Hemingway's grand house in Old Town, the Williams home at 1431 Duncan Street[53] in the \\"unfashionable\\" New Town neighborhood is a very modest bungalow. The house is privately owned and not open to the public. The Academy Awardÿwinning film version of his play The Rose Tattoo was shot on the island in 1956. The Tennessee Williams Theatre is located on the campus of Florida Keys Community College on Stock Island.[54]\\r\\nWilliams had a series of rented homes all over the United States, but the only home he owned was in Key West.\\r\\nEven though Hemingway and Williams lived in Key West at the same time, they reportedly met only onceat Hemingway's home in Cuba, Finca Viga.\\r\\nKey West is part of the Miami-Fort Lauderdale television market. It is served by rebroadcast transmitters in Key West and Marathon that repeat the Miami-Fort Lauderdale stations. Comcast provides cable television service. DirecTV and Dish Network provide Miami-Fort Lauderdale local stations and national channels.\\r\\nThe Key West area has 11 FM radio stations, 4 FM translators, and 2 AM stations. WEOW 92.7 is the home of The Rude Girl & Molly Blue, a popular morning zoo duo; Bill Bravo is the afternoon host. SUN 99.5 has Hoebee and Miss Loretta in the p.m. drive.

It has been awarded since 1956, although between 2010 and 2015, an agreement was made with FIFA and the award was temporarily merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year, and known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or, but the partnership was ended in 2016 and the award been reversed back to Ballon d'Or while FIFA also renamed its traditional award. Conceived by sports writer Gabriel Hanot, the Ballon d'Or award honours the male player deemed to have performed the best over the previous year, based on voting by football journalists. Originally, only European players were in contention for the Ballon d'Or: in 1995 the award was expanded to include all players at European clubs[1][2] and in 2007 to all players from around the world.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Matthews of Blackpool was the inaugural winner of the Ballon d'Or.[4] Prior to 1995, the award was often known in English language media as the European Footballer of the Year award. Milan's George Weah, the only African recipient, became the first non-European to win the award in the year the rules of eligibility were changed.[2] Ronaldo of Internazionale became the first South American winner two years later.[2] Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have won the award a record five times. Three players have won the award three times each: Johan Cruyff of Ajax and Barcelona, Michel Platini of Juventus and Marco van Basten of Milan. With seven awards each, Dutch and German players won the most Ballons d'Or. Spanish club Barcelona has the most winners, with 11 wins.[5]\\r\\nBetween 2010 and 2015 inclusive the award was merged with a similar award, the FIFA World Player of the Year award, to create the FIFA Ballon d'Or, which was awarded to the world's best male player, before FIFA and France Football broke the merging agreement.[6] After 2011, UEFA created the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award to maintain the format of the original Ballon d'Or.[7]\\r\\nEight players (Bobby Charlton, Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Mller, Paolo Rossi, Zinedine Zidane, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Kak) have won the FIFA World Cup, the European Cup/UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d'Or during their career.[8]\\r\\nOne-time winners are only included if they have also finished 2nd or 3rd in another year.\\r\\nA special Ballon d'Or, under the name Super Ballon d'Or, was awarded to Alfredo Di Stfano in 1989, after he surpassed Johan Cruyff and Michel Platini in France Football's voting.[11] A decade later, France Football elected Pel the Football Player of the Century after consulting their former Ballon d'Or recipients. Among the 34 previous winners, 30 cast their votes; Stanley Matthews, Omar Svori and George Best abstained, and Lev Yashin had died. Each voter was allotted five votes worth up to five points; however, Di Stfano only chose a first place, Platini a first and second place, and George Weah two players for fifth place. Pel was named the greatest by 17 voters, receiving almost double the number of points earned by the runner-up, Diego Maradona.[12]\\r\\nTo coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Ballon d'Or in 2016, France Football published a reevaluation of the awards presented before 1995, when only European players were eligible to win the award. 12 out of the 39 Ballons d'Or presented during this time period would have been awarded to South American players; in addition to Pel and Diego Maradona, Garrincha, Mario Kempes, and Romrio were retrospectively recognized as worthy winners.

All boroughs are part of New York City, and each of the boroughs is coextensive with a respective county, the primary administrative subdivision within New York State. Queens and The Bronx are concurrent with the counties of the same name, while Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island correspond to New York, Kings, and Richmond Counties respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoroughs have existed since the consolidation of the city in 1898, when the city and each borough assumed their current boundaries. However, the boroughs have not always been coextensive with their respective counties. Before 1914, the borough of The Bronx had been earlier in the southern part of Westchester County which had then been annexed to New York County in two stages in 1874 and 1895finally, in 1914 the county was created to match the borough. Before 1899, the County of Queens included an eastern part, which was split-off during the consolidation to become Nassau County.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term borough was adopted to describe a form of governmental administration for each of the five fundamental constituent parts of the newly consolidated city in 1898. Under the 1898 City Charter adopted by the New York State Legislature, a \\"borough\\" is a municipal corporation that is created when a county is merged with populated areas within it.[1] The limited powers of the borough governments are inferior to the authority of the Government of New York City, contrasting significantly with other borough administrations of government used in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, where a borough is an independent level of government, as well as borough forms used in other states and in Greater London.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York City is often referred to collectively as the five boroughs; the term is used to refer to New York City as a whole unambiguously, avoiding confusion with any particular borough or with the Greater New York metropolitan area. The term is also used by politicians to counter a frequent focus on Manhattan and thereby to place all five boroughs on equal footing. In the same vein, the term outer boroughs refers to all of the boroughs excluding Manhattan, even though the geographic center of the city is along the BrooklynÿQueens border. All five boroughs were created in 1898 during consolidation, when the city's current boundaries were established.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bronx originally included parts of New York County outside of Manhattan that had previously been ceded by neighboring Westchester County in two stages; in 1874 and then following a referendum in 1894. Ultimately in 1914, the present-day separate Bronx County became the last county to be created in the State of New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe borough of Queens consists of what formerly was only the western part of a then-larger Queens County. In 1899, the three eastern towns of Queens County that had not joined the city the year beforethe towns of Hempstead, North Hempstead, and Oyster Bayformally seceded from Queens County to form the new Nassau County.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe borough of Staten Island, concurrent with Richmond County, was officially the borough of Richmond until the name was changed in 1975 to reflect its common appellation, while leaving the name of the county unchanged.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are hundreds of distinct neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs of New York City, many with a definable history and character to call their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1914, each of New York City's five boroughs has been coextensive with a county of New York State ÿ unlike most U.S. cities, which lie within a single county or extend partially into another county, constitute a county in themselves, or are completely separate and independent of any county.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach borough is represented by a borough president. Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island each have a Borough Hall with limited administrative functions. The Manhattan Borough President's office is situated in the Manhattan Municipal Building. The Bronx Borough President's office used to be in its own Bronx Borough Hall but has been in the Bronx County Courthouse for decades. Since the abolition of the Board of Estimate in 1990 (due to a 1989 ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court[27]), the borough presidents have minimal executive powers, and there is no legislative function within a borough. Executive functions in New York City are the responsibility of the Mayor of New York City, while legislative functions reside with the New York City Council. The borough presidents primarily act as spokesmen, advocates, and ceremonial leaders for their boroughs, have budgets from which they can allocate relatively modest sums of money to community organizations and projects, and appoint the members of the 59 largely advisory community boards in the city's various neighborhoods. The Brooklyn and Queens borough presidents also appoint trustees to the local public library systems in those boroughs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing coextensive with an individual county, each borough also elects a district attorney, as does every other county of New York State. While the district attorneys of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island are popularly referred to as such by the media (e.g., \\"Manhattan D.A. Cyrus Vance, Jr.\\", or \\"Brooklyn D.A. Kenneth P. Thompson\\"), they are technically and legally the district attorneys of New York County, Kings County and Richmond County, respectively. There is no such distinction made for the district attorneys of the other two counties, Queens and the Bronx, since these boroughs share the respective counties' names. Because the five district attorneys are, technically speaking, state officials (since the counties are considered to be arms of the state government), rather than officials of the city government, they are not subject to the term limitations that govern other New York City officials such as the mayor, the New York City Public Advocate, members of the city council, or the borough presidents. Some civil court judges also are elected on a borough-wide basis, although they generally are eligible to serve throughout the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term sixth borough is used to describe any of a number of places that have been metaphorically called a part of New York City because of their geographic location, demographics (they include large numbers of former New Yorkers),  special affiliation, or cosmopolitan character. They have included adjacent cities and counties in the New York metropolitan area as well as in other states, U.S. territories, and foreign countries.[28][29][30] In 2011, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg referred to the city's waterfront and waterways as a composite sixth borough during presentations of planned rehabilitation projects along the city's shoreline,[31][32][33][34][35][36] including Governor's Island in the Upper New York Bay.[37] The Hudson Waterfront in the U.S. state of New Jersey lies opposite Manhattan on the Hudson River, and during the Dutch colonial era, was under the jurisdiction of New Amsterdam and known as Bergen. Jersey City and Hoboken in Hudson County, New Jersey, are sometimes referred to as the sixth borough, given their proximity and connections by rapid transit PATH trains.[38][39][40][41] Fort Lee, New Jersey, in Bergen County, opposite Upper Manhattan and connected by the George Washington Bridge, has also been called the sixth borough.[42][43][44] Miami and nearby areas in Florida,[45][46] Philadelphia[47] and China[48] are locales entirely outside the city's metropolitan area which have been called New York City's sixth borough.","input":"What's the largest borough in new york city?"},{"output":"15,895 deaths","context":"","input":"What was the death toll of the japan tsunami 2011?"},{"output":"August 2, 1956","context":"Albert Henry Woolson (February 11, 1850 ÿ August 2, 1956) was the last surviving member of the Union Army who served in the American Civil War.

Woolson (1811ÿ1862) and Caroline Baldwin (ca. 1822ÿunknown).[2] He claimed to be born on February 11, 1847, but his entry in the 1850 United States Census lists him as born in 1850.[3][4] Entries in the later census records and in the 1905 Minnesota State Census support the conclusion that he was born in 1850.[5]\\r\\nHis father, Willard Woolson, enlisted in the Union Army. Willard was wounded at the Battle of Shiloh and was transported to an Army hospital in Windom, Minnesota, where he would die of his wounds. Albert and his mother moved to Windom to accompany Willard. Albert enlisted as a drummer boy in Company C, 1st Minnesota Heavy Artillery Regiment on October 10, 1864, becoming the company's drummer. However, the company never saw action, and Albert Woolson was discharged on September 7, 1865.\\r\\nWoolson returned to Minnesota, where he lived the rest of his life. He was a carpenter and later a member of the Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R.), a powerful political organization made up of Civil War veterans where he became senior vice commander in chief in 1953.\\r\\nIn his final days, he lived at 215 East Fifth Street in Duluth, Minnesota. Woolson died at St. Luke's Hospital in Duluth on August 2, 1956, at what was then thought to be the age of 109, of a \\"recurring lung congestion condition\\". He was twice widowed and was survived by six daughters and two sons. Woolson was buried with full military honors by the National Guard at Park Hill Cemetery.[6]\\r\\nFollowing his death, President Dwight D. Eisenhower said:\\r\\n\\"The American people have lost the last personal link with the Union Army ... His passing brings sorrow to the hearts of all of us who cherished the memory of the brave men on both sides of the War Between the States.\\"[7]\\r\\nWoolson and fellow drummer-boy Frank Mayer marched together, both aged 99, in the Memorial Day Parade in May, 1949, to lay a wreath at the tomb of General Grant in New York City.\\r\\nLife magazine ran a seven-page article upon the death of Albert Woolson, in the August 20, 1956 issue.[8] The article included much information about the G.A.R., with pictures or drawings of several encampments (conventions). Also included are photos of the last three living Confederate soldiers (status and age disputed): William Lundy, 108; Walter Williams, 113; and John Salling, 110.\\r\\nIn mid-2006, new census research indicated that Albert Woolson was actually only 106 years old, being listed as less than one year old in the 1850 census. Previous research in 1991 had suggested he was only a year younger than claimed (108 instead of 109), although this does not affect his veteran status.\\r\\nAfter his death, the Grand Army of the Republic was dissolved because Woolson was its last surviving member.\\r\\nThe 2011ÿ12 Minnesota Legislative Manual was dedicated to him.[9]\\r\\nIn 1956 a monument of Woolson was erected in Gettysburg as a memorial to the Grand Army of the Republic.[10]\\r\\nWoolson as \\"Henry Albert Woolson\\" in the 1850 census as a newborn","input":"When did the last surviving civil war soldier died?"},{"output":"Mount Mitchell","context":"Mount Mitchell is the highest peak of the Appalachian Mountains and the highest peak in mainland eastern North America. It is located near Burnsville in Yancey County, North Carolina, in the Black Mountain subrange of the Appalachians, and about 19 miles (31?km) northeast of Asheville. It is protected by Mount Mitchell State Park and surrounded by the Pisgah National Forest. Mount Mitchell's elevation is 6,684 feet (2,037?m) above sea level.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peak is the highest mountain in the United States east of the Mississippi River, and the highest in all of eastern North America south of the Arctic Cordillera. The nearest higher peaks are in the Black Hills of South Dakota and the highland foothills of Colorado.\\r\\nThe mountain, previously known as Black Dome for its rounded shape, was named after Elisha Mitchell, a professor at the University of North Carolina, who first explored the Black Mountain region in 1835, and determined that the height of the range exceeded by several hundred feet that of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, commonly thought at the time to be the highest point east of the Rocky Mountains. Mitchell fell to his death at nearby Mitchell Falls in 1857, having returned to verify his earlier measurements.\\r\\nA 4.6-mile (7.4?km) road (NC 128) connects the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway to a parking lot where a steep paved 980-foot (300?m) trail leads through a conifer forest to the summit. The 40-foot (12?m) stone observation tower on the summit was torn down in late 2006. A new observation deck was constructed and opened to visitors in January 2009.[3] Also on the summit is the tomb of Dr. Mitchell.\\r\\nMount Mitchell was formed during the Precambrian when marine deposits were metamorphosed into gneiss and schist. These metasedimentary rocks were later uplifted during the Alleghenian orogeny.[4] The soils are well drained, dark brown and stony with fine-earth material ranging in texture from sandy clay loam to loam or sandy loam; Burton and Craggey are the most common series around the summit.[5]\\r\\nThe mountain's summit is coated in a dense stand of Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest, which consists primarily of two evergreen species the red spruce and the Fraser fir. Most of the mature Fraser firs, however, were killed off by the non-native Balsam woolly adelgid in the latter half of the 20th century. The high elevations also expose plant life to high levels of pollution, including acid precipitation in the form of rain, snow, and fog. These acids damage the red spruce trees in part by releasing natural metals from the soil like aluminum, and by leaching important minerals. To what extent this pollution harms the high-altitude ecosystem is debatable.[7]\\r\\nWhile the mountain is still mostly lush and green in the summer, many dead Fraser fir trunks can be seen due to these serious problems. Repairing the damage is a difficult issue, as the pollutants are often carried in from long distances. Sources can be local or hundreds of miles or kilometers away, requiring cooperation from as far away as the Midwest.\\r\\nWildflowers are abundant all summer long. Young fir and spruce trees do well in the subalpine climate, and their pine cones feed the birds along with wild blueberry and blackberry shrubs.\\r\\nThe second highest point in eastern North America, Mount Craig at 6,647 feet (2,026?m), is roughly a mile to the north of Mount Mitchell.\\r\\nThe summit area of Mount Mitchell is marked by a humid continental climate (K?ppen Dfb) bordering extremely close to a subalpine climate (k?ppen climate classification Dfc), with mild summers and long, moderately cold winters, being more similar to southeastern Canada than the southeastern U.S.. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 25.2?F (?3.8?C) in January to 59.1?F (15.1?C) in July. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the state occurred there on January 21, 1985 when it fell to ?34?F (?37?C), during a severe cold spell that brought freezing temperatures as far south as Miami. It is also the coldest average reporting station in the state at 43.8?F (6.6?C) (based on data collected from 1971 to 2000) which is well below any other station.[8] Unlike the lower elevations in the surrounding regions, heavy snows often fall from December to March, with 50 inches (127?cm) accumulating in the Great Blizzard of 1993 and 66 inches (168?cm) in the January 2016 blizzard.[9][8] Snow flurries have been reported on the summit even in the summer months of June, July, and August. Due to the high elevation, precipitation is heavy and reliable year-round, averaging 74.7 inches (1,900?mm) for the year, with no month receiving less than 5?in (127?mm) of average precipitation. The summit is often windy, with gusts that can blow up to 178?mph (286?km/h).[10]\\r\\n?\\r\\nSign atop Mt.

In total, 149 episodes were produced, plus two television movies which were made after the series was canceled. It aired in over 100 countries, including Denmark (where it was aired on TV2), the United Kingdom, Poland, France, Canada (where it was aired on CTV throughout its run) and Bulgaria on BNT and later on NOVA television. Since 1997, reruns have been shown in syndication and on Freeform (TV channel), (formerly ABC Family and originally CBN Satellite Service), Ion Television (formerly PAX-TV), the Hallmark Channel, Eleven Australian (TV channel), CBS Drama, Up, and INSP (TV Network).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series begins in the year 1867 and centers on a proper and wealthy female physician from Boston, Massachusetts, Michaela Quinn (Seymour), familiarly known as \\"Dr. Mike\\". After her father's death, she sets out west to the small wild west town of Colorado Springs, to set up her own practice. She makes the difficult adjustment to life in Colorado with the aid of rugged outdoorsman and friend to the Cheyenne, Byron Sully (Joe Lando) and a midwife named Charlotte Cooper (played by Diane Ladd). After Charlotte is bitten by a rattlesnake, she asks Michaela on her deathbed to look after her three children: Matthew, Colleen, and Brian. Dr. Mike settles in Colorado Springs and adapts to her new life as a mother, with the children, while finding true love with Sully. Furthermore, she acts as a one-woman mission to convince the townspeople that a female doctor can successfully practice medicine.\\r\\nThe pilot episode was shot in early 1992 and aired in a two-hour television special on New Year's Day 1993. CBS aired a second, hour-long episode the next night in order to attract and maintain the audience's attention. The pilot served more as a made-for-television movie ÿ or mini-series suggestion ÿ which could either be developed later into a full series or remain as a stand-alone two-hour movie. CBS ordered the show picked up immediately for the full season. However, the show made some imperative casting changes. Several pilot leads and a few of the supporting cast were replaced. Henry Sanders was recast as Robert E. in place of Ivory Ocean as a less folksy hard-nosed working man; Orson Bean replaced Guy Boyd as a more fatherly, cynically-comical Loren Bray; and Colm Meaney was replaced by Jim Knobeloch, a much younger, attractive, and contemptuously stoic Jake Slicker. Likewise, Larry Sellers's character, a Cheyenne brave called Black Hawk (listed under the closing credits as such) who played an auxiliary role as one of Chief Black Kettle's aides and spoke only their language, was quietly retooled into Cloud Dancing, Sully's blood brother and a major recurring character, who, in addition to aiding Black Kettle, plays a large role in quelling the tribulations of the Cheyenne and other neighboring tribes. He also acquired the ability to speak English, allowing him to act as a liaison alongside Sully. His character's name was never spoken on-screen during his first appearance, which can cause viewers to inadvertently re-interpret this look-alike as Cloud Dancing's first appearance before his formal debut.\\r\\nVeteran actress Jane Seymour, labeled a mini-series \\"queen\\", was a last-minute casting choice for Michaela Quinn after reading the script only a day before production was set to begin on the pilot. She was instructed beforehand to review the script and make a decision of whether or not she felt the role was right for her, and, if so, that she truly wanted to commit to the strict contract Sullivan had demanded for the title character. The next day she began the wardrobe fittings for the series.\\r\\nThere were various cast changes of minor characters during the series. The most controversial change took place during the show's third season, when the character of Colleen Cooper was recast halfway through the year.[citation needed] Unlike the other actors, who signed five-year contracts with the show, Erika Flores was hesitant. She asked to be offered a contract of less than five years. Rumors circulated that Flores's father gave her an ultimatum to end the contract unless they offered her more money, or he would cut her off financially. Flores has denied such rumors, saying that she left the series for personal reasons and to pursue other opportunities.\\r\\nBeth Sullivan decided that she wanted the character to continue instead of being killed off or sent away. As a result, Jessica Bowman was cast as the new Colleen in Flores's place. Some of Erika Flores's fans were quite vocal in their anger over the change and wrote to CBS demanding to know why the actress had been replaced. The producers of the show felt that Jessica Bowman had the ability to successfully recreate the character on her own.\\r\\nNumerous cast changes occurred throughout the series, although none was as significant. Most notable was the replacement of Jane Wyman as Michaela's mother, Elizabeth Quinn. Wyman signed on to play the role for the third episode of Dr. Quinn in season one. Later Wyman turned down an invitation to return for another guest appearance in season two, as she had retired completely from acting by this stage (her previous appearance in season one marked her final acting role of any kind). Georgann Johnson was hired to replace Wyman in the role and continued throughout the remainder of the series, making one guest appearance each season and appearing in the final Dr. Quinn television movie.\\r\\nMichelle Bonilla originated the role of Theresa Morales in season five and was replaced by Alex Meneses in season six. Bonilla was abruptly let go for reasons that were never publicly stated. Meneses's portrayal was well received and she was featured throughout the sixth season, when her character fell in love with Jake Slicker.\\r\\nThe role of Anthony (Grace and Robert E.'s adopted son) was played by Brenden Jefferson for four episodes in season four. He was replaced by Brandon Hammond, who continued in the role throughout seasons five and six.\\r\\nJennifer Youngs did not begin playing Ingrid until the character's second appearance; the first time the character appeared, she was played by Ashley Jones.\\r\\nDr. Quinn was best known for its large, supporting cast, and its high-concept storytelling. The series often used its semi-historical setting as a vehicle to address issues of gender and race within the community. For example, one episode took on homophobia when the famous poet Walt Whitman came to town. Religion played a somewhat minor role in the series, but was also used to address certain issues and new ideas.\\r\\nIn the season-three finale, \\"For Better or Worse\\", Michaela and Sully were married during a special two-hour episode. During season four, Seymour's real-life pregnancy was written into the show. The following season saw the birth of Michaela and Sully's daughter, Katie.\\r\\nDuring its entire original run on CBS, the show aired from 8ÿ9?pm Eastern time on Saturday nights. It was the last successful TV Western drama to date until the premiere of Deadwood on HBO in March 21, 2004, and the premiere AMC Western series Hell on Wheels on November 6, 2011; and also one of the last original series to find long-term success in a Saturday timeslot.[citation needed]\\r\\nDr. Quinn was one of the few dramatic shows that allowed fans full access to their filming sets at the Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills, California. Fans were permitted, often invited, to watch episodes being shot each week. Cast members were known to speak with their fans and sign autographs during shooting breaks. During the show's final season run, an official website was established, which remains active. Two fans went on to create the Dr. Quinn Times, a newsletter in which interviews with the cast, producers, directors, and technical specialists were conducted and distributed to fans, twice each year.\\r\\nSeymour and Barbara Babcock were the only cast members to receive Emmy nominations for their work on the series. Seymour was nominated several times during the series' run, while Babcock received a single nomination in 1995 for the episode entitled \\"Ladies' Night\\". Her character, Dorothy Jennings, underwent a mastectomy.\\r\\nThe show did win many technical awards, as well as hair and make-up honors.[citation needed] Seymour also won a Golden Globe in 1996 for her portrayal of Michaela Quinn.\\r\\nThe show was a major hit in the United States for CBS and drew large ratings even though it aired on Saturday nights. Despite the high ratings, CBS claimed that the demographics changed during the show's run. During its final season, the majority of Dr. Quinn's viewers were women 40 years of age and older, and not the male and female 18-to-49 demographic that networks try to reach. In response, CBS ordered the writers to give the show a slightly darker feel than in previous seasons. As a result, season six was darker than any previous season, with the death of several characters as well as some highly sensitive subject matter: the painful miscarriage of Michaela's second child, as well as an episode entitled Point Blank, where Michaela was shot by a man and then later developed post-traumatic stress disorder. Many fans did not like the changes, while others felt that the tensions and high drama benefited the show after the overall pleasant past seasons. Despite these opposing opinions, the ratings still proved to be steady and consistent (finishing at #51 for the year). The series was suddenly canceled in 1998 after its sixth season.[1] Despite this, the series concluded on a bookend by seeing Colleen marry Andrew and prepare to embark as a doctor in her own right, following her stepmother's footsteps.\\r\\nThere is still an active fan club for William Shockley, who played Hank Lawson on the show, known as \\"Hank's Hussies.\\" In January 2014, they attended a red carpet movie premiere together in Nashville for his new movie.\\r\\nThe show has enjoyed strong ratings in reruns. Dr. Quinn was one of the rare instances of a show entering rerun syndication in the middle of a TV season. It debuted reruns in most American markets on Monday, December 30, 1996, just two days shy of the show's 4th anniversary. With 4 seasons being the minimum requirement for syndication pickup, Dr. Quinn reruns could have started at the more traditional launch date of September 1996, but the show's distributor, like many, had an additional minimum episode limit in order for the show to be eligible for syndication. This episode count was not reached until several episodes into Dr. Quinn's fifth season (1996ÿ1997), and since stations had already purchased the show at the beginning of that season, the distributor decided not to hold off until the next fall and let the stations start airing reruns right away.\\r\\nWhen PAX TV launched in August 1998, it acquired reruns of current family-friendly series from CBS, including Dr. Quinn. Because dedicated Dr. Quinn fans were angered by the show's cancellation by CBS that year, these national reruns via PAX helped relieve the blow, especially in markets where local stations were not airing reruns in syndication.\\r\\nUntil late 2005, the Hallmark Channel aired it daily, but in late 2005 Hallmark removed Dr. Quinn from its lineup, citing a drop in viewership. It is also believed that the high cost in Dr. Quinn distribution rights played a role in its removal. Dr. Quinn continues to be seen throughout the world and has been translated to several languages.\\r\\nStarting in June 2009, the Gospel Music Channel began airing Dr. Quinn weekdays at 5:00 and 6:00. More recently Vision TV Canada began airing Dr Quinn week nights at 6PM AT. It also airs on CHNU10 in the Lower Mainland of BC, Canada, at 3 PM PST Weekdays. It has also been shown continuously in Denmark since 2001, with plans on to keep it at its daily broadcast time of 1:00, Monday to Friday, on Danish TV station, tv2.\\r\\nSince the last movie in 2001, many of the show's cast members have expressed interest in reprising their roles and would like to do another reunion movie, or even a new season. Jane Seymour, Joe Lando, Chad Allen, and other cast members have stated they would all like to work together again and would reprise their Dr. Quinn roles if the opportunity arises.[citation needed] The show's creator, Beth Sullivan, has also stated her interest in writing another Dr. Quinn movie.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2003, A&E Network managed to buy the distribution rights for Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman from CBS. All six seasons plus the two made-for-TV movies have been released on DVD. The series appears on the GMC Network. GMC aired all the series episodes, including the season-six episodes not shown in a decade, during the summer of 2010. Joe Lando did several teasers and promotions for the weekend marathons, and says he finds GMC's ad campaign \\"funny\\", saying: \\"Truthfully, I haven't had that many opportunities to make fun of Sully. No one's really found me that funny. But it's fun to do it now. GMC came up with a great ad campaign. My kids were entertained by it and my wife got a kick out of it.\\"[2]\\r\\nThe cancellation of Dr. Quinn caused a massive fan uproar, the likes of which had not been seen since Star Trek in the 1960s.[3] CBS decided that instead of producing another season, as the cost involved was deemed too high, it would instead produce a TV movie. In May 1999, one year after its cancellation, CBS aired Dr. Quinn: Revolutions, a television movie special, set in 1877. However, the actual date should have been 1875, two years following the final episode, which would have been in 1873. In this TV movie, Katie Sully, now age 4, is kidnapped, and Dr. Mike and Sully, with help from some townsfolk, embark on a desperate search for their missing daughter in Mexico. Fans were delighted that a special movie was being produced, but they were not altogether impressed with its overall concept. The movie was very different in tone from the rest of the series, incorporating more guns and violence in an effort to please the twenty-something male audience demographics. Furthermore, both Jessica Bowman and Chad Allen declined appearances in that episode, due to its content, and William Olvis' entire score was scrapped in favor of more cost-effective music that was completely unlike that of the original series.\\r\\nFans were shocked to find a Dr. Quinn episode that did not include the main title sequence or theme. Moreover, the script, acting, and interpretations of the original characters came across as unfamiliar and very unlike their portrayals in the series. Beth Sullivan was so furious with CBS's control over the whole project that she declined any involvement. It was critically panned and failed in the ratings. Following this backlash from having excessive creative say over the film, CBS profoundly softened its involvement with the next attempt to produce a TV movie.\\r\\nA second TV movie entitled Dr Quinn: The Heart Within, aired in May 2001. The movie was set a year after Revolutions, making it 9 years since the first episode of Dr. Quinn in the year 1876. This time around, CBS gave Beth Sullivan total creative control; however, there were some strong ground rules. To save money, the movie had to be filmed in Canada, and only the principal cast could be involved. Jane Seymour also served as an executive producer. The plot revolved around Michaela and the Sully family returning to Boston to attend Colleen's graduation from Harvard Medical School. Having transferred from The Women's Medical College to the male dominated university since the series finale, Colleen has met harsh criticism from the board as well as from Andrew's father, who resents the fact that she continues to pursue medicine, despite his misgivings. Unfortunately, Michaela's mother, Elizabeth, has fallen ill due to a heart condition, and eventually passes, leaving her entire estate to Michaela to establish a hospital back in Colorado Springs, echoing the demise of her father at the very beginning of the series. Colleen soon finds herself in a situation similar to the one her mother, Michaela, had just nine years earlier ÿ in the same Bostonian sector  in that she is not respected or taken seriously as a woman doctor.\\r\\nThe movie is a proper finale to the series, depicting the now-adult Cooper children's farewell to Colorado Springs, and finding their new futures in Boston, while Michaela and Sully inevitably return to Colorado Springs to begin a new chapter in their own, now older, adult lives.\\r\\nWhile this movie was far better received by fans, they did complain that more of the townspeople and original supporting cast were not involved, due to CBS's demands, as well as the last-minute absence of Chad Allen's Matthew (Allen had declined after learning that none of his original supporting costars were offered any appearances). Despite these criticisms, the movie was a success. It was filmed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\\r\\nA&E Home Video has released all six seasons of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman on DVD in Region 1. It has released also the two television movies that were made after the series ended.\\r\\nIn Region 2, Revelation Films has released all six seasons on DVD in the UK. The two TV-movies were released separately, the first was entitled Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman ÿ The Movie and the second was entitled Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman ÿ The Heart Within.\\r\\nThere were several books based on the series written by as follows. Some of them were also released abroad, including in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Poland.\\r\\nThe books by Dorothy Laudan were originally released in Germany and have never appeared in an English version. However, it was these books that were most commonly translated into other languages. The series of nine covers most of the series, although the episodes on which they are based were shortened and some scenes were left out or were mentioned only briefly.\\r\\nIn 1997, there were plans of making a spin-off series centered around the Hank Lawson character. Some of the other regular Dr. Quinn characters, including the ones of Jane Seymour, Joe Lando, Jim Knobeloch, Frank Collison and Orson Bean, were in as well.\\r\\nIt was directed by Jerry London, with Robert Brooks Mendel as the first assistant director, Timothy O. Johnson as the executive producer, and Beth Sullivan as the producer. The rest of the cast members were Laura Harring (Christina Guevara), Edward Albert (Ted McKay), James Brolin (Sheriff), Eddie Albert (Ben McKay), Carlos G܇mez (Father Thomas Guevara) and John Saxon (Rafael Guevara).[9]\\r\\nThe show was entitled California and it is likely that only the pilot episode was filmed. It remains unclear whether it has ever aired on television, but it is still available on the YouTube service.","input":"How many seasons of dr. quinn medicine woman?"},{"output":"Colombia","context":"The separation of Panama from Colombia was formalized on 3 November 1903, with the establishment of the Republic of Panama.  From the Independence of Panama from Spain in 1821, Panama had simultaneously declared independence from Spain and joined itself to the confederation of Gran Colombia through the Independence Act of Panama.  Panama was always tenuously connected to the rest of the country to the south, owing to its remoteness from the government in Bogot and lack of a practical overland connection to the rest of Gran Colombia.  In 1840-1841, a short-lived independent republic was established under Toms de Herrera.  After rejoining Colombia following a 13-month independence, it remained a province which saw frequent rebellious flare-ups, notably the Panama crisis of 1885, which saw the intervention of the United States Navy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the construction of the Panama canal, the initial attempts by France to construct a sea-level canal across the isthmus were secured through treaty with Colombia; however French cost overruns and corruption in the Panama scandals led to abandonment of the Canal for a decade.  During the intervening years, local separatists used the political instability of the Thousand Days' War to agitate for political separation from Colombia and establishment of an independent republic.  When the United States sought to take over the canal project, the government of Colombia proved difficult to work with, and with the cooperation of French financier Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, Panama simultaneously declared independence from Colombia and negotiated a treaty granting the U.S. the right to construct the canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States was the first country to recognize the independence of the nascent republic, sending the U.S. Navy to prevent Colombia from retaking the territory during the first days of the new Republic.  In exchange for its role in defending the Republic, and for constructing the canal, the U.S. was granted a perpetual lease on the land around the canal, known as the Panama Canal Zone, which was later returned to Panama under the terms of the TorrijosÿCarter Treaties.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the United States, many other nations quickly recognized the independent republic, though Colombia refused to do so until 1909, after receiving a $500,000 concession from Panama to cover its share of the debts it owed at independence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter it achieved independence from Spain on November 28, 1821, Panama became a part of the Republic of Gran Colombia which consisted of today's Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, and most of Ecuador.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe political struggle between federalists and centralists that followed independence from Spain resulted in a changing administrative and jurisdictional status for Panama. Under centralism Panama was established as the Department of the Isthmus and during federalism as the Sovereign State of Panama.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1846 treaty between Colombia and the United States, the MallarinoÿBidlack Treaty,[1] pledged the United States to maintain \\"neutrality\\" in Panama in exchange for transit rights in the isthmus on behalf of Colombia.[1] In March 1885 Colombia thinned its military presence in Panama, sending troops stationed there to fight rebels in other provinces.[1] These favourable conditions prompted an insurgency in Panama.[1] The United States Navy was sent there to keep order, in spite of invoking its obligations according to the treaty of 1846.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1885 the United States occupied the city of Col܇n, Panama. Chile, which had by the time the strongest fleet in the Americas, sent the cruiser Esmeralda to occupy Panama City in response. Esmeralda's captain was ordered to stop by any means an eventual annexation of Panama by the United States.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thousand Days' War (1899ÿ1902) was one of the many armed struggles between the Liberal and Conservative Parties which devastated Colombia, including Panama, during the 19th century. This new civil war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Wisconsin.  However, the Liberal leader Victoriano Lorenzo refused to accept the terms of the agreement and was executed on May 15, 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 25, 1903, the headquarters of the Panamanian newspaper El Lpiz were assaulted by orders of the military commander for Panama, General Jos Vsquez Cobo, brother of the then Colombian Minister of War, as a retaliation for the publication of a detailed article narrating the execution and protests in Panama. This event damaged the trust of Panamanian liberals in the Conservative government based in Bogot, and they later joined the separatist movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1903, the United States and Colombia signed the HayÿHerrn Treaty to finalize the construction of the Panama Canal but the process[clarification needed] was not completed because the Congress of Colombia rejected the measure (which the Colombian government had proposed) on August 12, 1903. The United States then moved to support the separatist movement in Panama to gain control over the remnants of the French attempt at building a canal.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nPanamanian politician Jos Domingo De Obalda was selected for the Governor of the Isthmus of Panama office that he had previously held, and was supported by separatist movements. Another Panamanian politician named Jos Agustn Arango began to plan the revolution and separation. The separatists wanted to negotiate the construction of the Panama Canal directly with the United States due to the negativity of the Colombian government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe separatist network was formed by Arango, Dr. Manuel Amador Guerrero, General Nicanor de Obarrio, Ricardo Arias, Federico Boyd, Carlos Constantino Arosemena, Toms Arias, Manuel Espinosa Batista and others. Amador Guerrero was in charge of going to the United States to get support for the separatist plan; he also gained the support of important Panamanian liberal leaders and the support of another military commander, Esteban Huertas.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith strong support the separatist movement set November 1903 as the time for the separation. However, rumors in Colombia spread but the information managed by the government of Colombia indicated that Nicaragua was planning to invade a region of northern Panama known as the Calovbora. The Government deployed troops from the Tiradores Battalion from Barranquilla, and instructed the commander to take over the functions of the Governor of Panama Jos Domingo de Obalda and General Esteban Huertas, whom the government did not trust.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tiradores Battalion was led by Generals Juan Tovar and Ram܇n Amaya and arrived in the Panamanian city of Col܇n the morning of November 3, 1903. It suffered delays on its way to Panama City caused by the complicity of the Panama Railway authorities who sympathized with the separatist movement. On arrival in Panama City, the troops were put under the command of Col. Eliseo Torres. General Huertas commander of the Colombia Battalion in Panama ordered the arrest of Tovar and his other officials.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colombian gunboat Bogot fired shells upon Panama City the night of November 3, causing injuries and mortally wounding Mr. Wong Kong Yee of Hong Sang, China.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nA United States Navy gunboat, USS?Nashville, commanded by Commander John Hubbard, who had also helped to delay the disembarkation of the Colombian troops in Col܇n, continued to interfere with their mission by insisting that the \\"neutrality\\" of the railway had to be respected.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the suppression of the Colombian troops, the Revolutionary Junta declared the secession of the Isthmus and later its independence, with the declaration of the Republic of Panama. A naval squadron in the Bay of Panama was captured without resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemetrio H. Brid president of the Municipal Council of Panama became the de facto President of Panama and on November 4, 1903 appointed a Provisional Government Junta, which governed the country until February 1904 and the Constituent National Convention The convention elected Manuel Amador Guerrero as first constitutional president. News of the separation of Panama from Colombia reached Bogot only on November 6, 1903 due to a problem with the submarine cables.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 13, 1903, the United States formally recognized the Republic of Panama (after recognizing it unofficially on November 6 and 7). On November 18, 1903, the United States Secretary of State John Hay and Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla signed the HayÿBunau-Varilla Treaty. No Panamanians signed the treaty, although Bunau-Varilla was present as the diplomatic representative of Panama (a role he had purchased through financial assistance to the rebels), even though he had not lived in Panama for seventeen years prior to independence, and  never returned afterwards.[5] The treaty was later approved by the Panamanian government and the Senate of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ambassador of Colombia in Ecuador Emiliano Isaza was informed of the situation in Panama but did not inform his government to prevent a revolt in Bogot. The government of Colombia then sent a diplomatic mission to Panama in an effort to make them reconsider by suggesting an approval by the senate of Colombia if they reconsidered the HayÿHerrn Treaty instead of the HayÿBunau-Varilla Treaty and also proposed making Panama City the capital of Colombia.[6][dubious  ÿ discuss]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mission met aboard the ship USS?Mayflower with the Panamanian delegation formed by Constantino Arosemena, Toms Arias and Eusebio A. Morales, which rejected all proposals. Colombia then sent later a delegation of prominent politicians and political figures; General Rafael Reyes, Pedro Nel Ospina, Jorge Holgun and Lucas Caballero who met with the same representative for Panama and Carlos Antonio Mendoza, Nicanor de Obarrio y Antonio Zubieta, without reaching any consensus.","input":"From what country did panama gain independence in 1903?"},{"output":"about 330 operating drive-in theaters","context":"This is a list of drive-in theaters.

In geology, a valley or dale is a depression that is longer than it is wide. The terms U-shaped and V-shaped are descriptive terms of geography to characterize the form of valleys. Most valleys belong to one of these two main types or a mixture of them, (at least) with respect to the cross section of the slopes or hillsides.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA valley in its broadest geographic sense is also known as a dale. Other terms used for valleys are:\\r\\nSimilar geological structures, such as canyons, ravines, gorges, gullies, chines and kloofs, are not usually referred to as valleys.\\r\\nA valley formed by flowing water, or river valley, is usually V-shaped. The exact shape will depend on the characteristics of the stream flowing through it. Rivers with steep gradients, as in mountain ranges, produce steep walls and a bottom. Shallower slopes may produce broader and gentler valleys. However, in the lowest stretch of a river, where it approaches its base level, it begins to deposit sediment and the valley bottom becomes a floodplain.\\r\\nSome broad V examples are:\\r\\nSome of the first human complex societies originated in river valleys, such as that of the Nile, Tigris-Euphrates, Indus, Ganges, Yangtze, Yellow River, Mississippi, and arguably Amazon. In prehistory, the rivers were used as a source of fresh water and food (fish and game), as well as a place to wash and a sewer. The proximity of water moderated temperature extremes and provided a source for irrigation, stimulating the development of agriculture. Most of the first civilizations developed from these river valley communities.\\r\\nIn geography, a vale is a wide river valley, usually with a particularly wide flood plain or flat valley bottom.\\r\\nIn Southern England, vales commonly occur between the escarpment slopes of pairs of chalk formations, where the chalk dome has been eroded, exposing less resistant underlying rock, usually claystone.\\r\\nRift valleys, such as the Albertine Rift, are formed by the expansion of the Earth's crust due to tectonic activity beneath the Earth's surface.\\r\\nThere are various forms of valley associated with glaciation that may be referred to as glacial valleys.\\r\\nA valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped and resembles a trough. This trough valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice. Floor gradient does not affect the valley's shape, it is the glacier's size that does. Continuously flowing glaciers ÿ especially in the ice age ÿ and large-sized glaciers carve wide, deep incised valleys, sometimes with valley steps that reflect differing erosion rates.\\r\\nExamples of U-shaped valleys are found in every mountainous region that has experienced glaciation, usually during the Pleistocene ice ages. Most present U-shaped valleys started as V-shaped before glaciation. The glaciers carved it out wider and deeper, simultaneously changing the shape. This proceeds through the glacial erosion processes of glaciation and abrasion, which results in large rocky material (glacial till) being carried in the glacier. A material called boulder clay is deposited on the floor of the valley. As the ice melts and retreats, the valley is left with very steep sides and a wide, flat floor. A river or stream may remain in the valley. This replaces the original stream or river and is known as a misfit stream because it is smaller than one would expect given the size of its valley.\\r\\nOther interesting glacially carved valleys include:\\r\\nA tunnel valley is a large, long, U-shaped valley originally cut under the glacial ice near the margin of continental ice sheets such as that now covering Antarctica and formerly covering portions of all continents during past glacial ages.[3]\\r\\nA tunnel valley can be up to 100?km (62?mi), 4?km (2.5?mi) wide, and 400?m (1,300?ft) deep (its depth may vary along its length).\\r\\nTunnel valleys were formed by subglacial erosion by water. They served as subglacial drainage pathways carrying large volumes of melt water. Their cross-sections exhibit steep-sided flanks similar to fjord walls, and their flat bottoms are typical of subglacial glacial erosion.\\r\\nIn northern Central Europe, the Scandinavian ice sheet during the various ice ages advanced slightly uphill against the lie of the land. As a result, its meltwaters flowed parallel to the ice margin to reach the North Sea basin, forming huge, flat valleys known as Urstromt?ler. Unlike the other forms of glacial valley, these were formed by glacial meltwaters.\\r\\nDepending on the topography, the rock types and the climate, a lot of transitional forms between V-, U- and plain valleys exist. Their bottoms can be broad or narrow, but characteristic is also the type of valley shoulder. The broader a mountain valley, the lower its shoulders are located in most cases. An important exception are canyons where the shoulder almost is near the top of the valley's slope. In the Alps ÿ e.g. the Tyrolean Inn valley ÿ the shoulders are quite low (100ÿ200 meters above the bottom). Many villages are located here (esp. at the sunny side) because the climate is very mild: even in winter when the valley's floor is completely filled with fog, these villages are in sunshine.\\r\\nIn some stress-tectonic regions of the Rockies or the Alps (e.g. Salzburg) the side valleys are parallel to each other, and additionally they are hanging. The brooks flow into the river in form of deep canyons or waterfalls. Usually this fact is the result of a violent erosion of the former valley shoulders, a special genesis found also at artes and glacial cirques, at every Scottish glen, or in a northern fjord.\\r\\nA hanging valley is a tributary valley that is higher than the main valley. They are most commonly associated with U-shaped valleys when a tributary glacier flows into a glacier of larger volume. The main glacier erodes a deep U-shaped valley with nearly vertical sides while the tributary glacier, with a smaller volume of ice, makes a shallower U-shaped valley. Since the surfaces of the glaciers were originally at the same elevation, the shallower valley appears to be 'hanging' above the main valley. Often, waterfalls form at or near the outlet of the upper valley.[4]\\r\\nHanging valleys also occur in fjord systems under water. The branches of Sognefjord are for instance much shallower than the main fjord. The mouth of Fj?rlandsfjord is about 400 meters deep while the main fjord is 1200 meters nearby. The mouth of Ikjefjord is only 50 meters deep while the main fjord is around 1300 meters at the same point.[5]\\r\\nGlaciated terrain is not the only site of hanging streams and valleys. Hanging valleys are also simply the product of varying rates of erosion of the main valley and the tributary valleys. The varying rates of erosion are associated with the composition of the adjacent rocks in the different valley locations. The tributary valleys are eroded and deepened by glaciers or erosion at a slower rate than that of the main valley floor, thus the difference in the two valleys' depth increases over time. The tributary valley composed of more resistant rock then hangs over the main valley.[6]\\r\\nTrough-shaped valleys also form in regions of heavy denudation. By contrast, with glacial U-shaped valleys, there is less downward and sideways erosion. The severe slope denudation results in gently sloping valley sides and their transition to the actual valley bottom is unclear. Trough-shaped valleys occur mainly in periglacial regions and in tropical regions of variable wetness. Both climates are dominated by heavy denudation.\\r\\nBox valleys have wide, relatively level floors and steep sides. They are common in periglacial areas and occur in mid-latitudes, but also occur in tropical and arid regions.[7]\\r\\nUsually the bottom of a main valley is broad ÿ independent of the U or V shape. It typically ranges from about one to ten kilometers in width and is commonly filled with mountain sediments. The shape of the floor can be rather horizontal, similar to a flat cylinder, or terraced.\\r\\nSide valleys are rather V than U-shaped; near the mouth waterfalls are possible if it is a hanging valley. The location of the villages depends on the across-valley profile, on climate and local traditions, and on the danger of avalanches or landslides. Predominant are places on terraces or alluvial fans if they exist.\\r\\nHistoric siting of villages within the mainstem valleys, however, have chiefly considered the potential of flooding.\\r\\nA hollow is a small valley or dry stream bed. This term is commonly used in New England, Appalachia, and the Ozarks of Arkansas and Missouri to describe such geographic features. In rural areas in America, it may be pronounced as \\"holler\\". Many Appalacian story tellers will say that a holler is an area where you have to holler to communicate with your nearest neighbor, meaning how deep in the country you are.","input":"Most common type of valley in the world?"},{"output":"Singapore","context":"Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia.[4] Southeast Asia is bordered to the north by East Asia, to the west by South Asia and Bay of Bengal, to the east by Oceania and Pacific Ocean, and to the south by Australia and Indian Ocean. The region is the only part of Asia that lies partly within the Southern Hemisphere, although the majority of it is in the Northern Hemisphere. In contemporary definition, Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions:\\r\\nThe region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activities. The Sunda Plate is the main plate of the region, features almost all Southeast Asian countries except Myanmar, northern Thailand, northern Vietnam, and northern Luzon of the Philippines. The mountain ranges in Myanmar, Thailand, and peninsular Malaysia are part of the Alpide belt, while the islands of the Philippines are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Both seismic belts meet in Indonesia, making the region has relatively high occurrences of earthquake and volcanic eruption.[5]\\r\\nSoutheast Asia covers about 4.5 million km2 (1.7 million mi2), which is 10.5% of Asia or 3% of earth's total land area. Its total population is more than 641 million, about 8.5% of world's population. It is the third most populous geographical region in the world after South Asia and East Asia.[citation needed] The region is culturally and ethnically diverse, with hundreds of languages spoken by different ethnic groups.[6] Ten countries in the region are members of ASEAN, a regional organisation established for economic, political, military, educational and cultural integration amongst its members.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe region, together with part of South Asia, was well known by the Europeans as the East Indies or simply the Indies until the 20th century. Chinese sources referred the region as q (Nanyang), which literally means the Southern Ocean. The mainland section of Southeast Asia is referred as Indochina by European geographer due to its location between China and Indian subcontinent and cultural influences from both neighboring regions. In the 20th century however, the term became more restricted to former French Indochina territory (Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam). The maritime section of Southeast Asia is also known as Malay Archipelago, a term derived from the European concept of a Malay race.[8] Another term for Maritime Southeast Asia is Insulindia (Indian Islands), used to describe the region between Indochina and Australasia.[9]\\r\\nThe term \\"Southeast Asia\\" was first used in 1839 by an American pastor Howard Malcolm in his book entitled Travels in South-Eastern Asia. Malcolm only included the Mainland section and excluded the Maritime section in his definition of Southeast Asia.[10] The term was officially used in the midst of World War II by the Allies, through the formation of South East Asia Command (SEAC) in 1943.[11] SEAC popularised the use of the term \\"Southeast Asia\\", although what constituted Southeast Asia in the early days was not fixed, for example the Philippines and a large part of Indonesia were excluded by SEAC while Ceylon was included. However, by the late 1970s, a roughly standard usage of the term \\"Southeast Asia\\" and the territories it encompasses had emerged.[12] Although from a cultural or linguistic perspective, the definitions of \\"Southeast Asia\\" may vary, the most common definitions nowadays include the area represented by the countries (sovereign states and dependent territories) listed below.\\r\\nTen of eleven states of Southeast Asia are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), while East Timor is an observer state. Papua New Guinea has stated that it might join ASEAN, and is currently an observer. Sovereignty issues exist over some territories in the South China Sea.\\r\\nHong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (a disputed region or nation), are also considered as part of the Southeast Asia.[13][14][15][16][17]\\r\\n* Administrative centre in Putrajaya.\\r\\nSoutheast Asia is geographically divided into two subregions, namely Mainland Southeast Asia (or Indochina) and Maritime Southeast Asia (or the similarly defined Malay Archipelago) (Javanese: Nusantara).\\r\\nMainland Southeast Asia includes:\\r\\nMaritime Southeast Asia includes:\\r\\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India are geographically considered part of Maritime Southeast Asia. Eastern Bangladesh and Northeast India have strong cultural ties with Southeast Asia and sometimes considered both South Asian and Southeast Asian.[23] Sri Lanka has on some occasions been considered a part of Southeast Asia because of its cultural ties to mainland Southeast Asia.[12][24] The rest of the island of New Guinea which is not part of Indonesia, namely, Papua New Guinea, is sometimes included, and so are Palau, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands, which were all part of the Spanish East Indies with strong cultural and linguistic ties to the region.[25]\\r\\nThe eastern half of Indonesia and East Timor (east of the Wallace Line) are considered to be biogeographically part of Oceania (Wallacea) due to its distinctive faunal features. New Guinea and its surrounding islands are geologically considered as a part of Australian continent, connected via the Sahul Shelf.\\r\\nThe region was already inhabited by Homo erectus from 1,000,000 years ago during the Middle Pleistocene age.[26] Homo sapiens reached the region by around 45,000 years ago,[27] having moved eastwards from the Indian subcontinent.[28] Homo floresiensis also lived in the area up until 12,000 years ago, when they became extinct.[29] It has been proposed that the Austronesian people, who form the majority of the modern population in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, East Timor, and the Philippines, may have migrated to Southeast Asia from Taiwan. They arrived in Indonesia around 2000?BC, and as they spread through the archipelago, they often settled along coastal areas and confined indigenous peoples such as Orang Asli of peninsular Malaysia, Negritos of the Philippines or Papuans of New Guinea to inland regions.[30] Archaeologists refer these people as Deutero-Malays, whom are more advanced in farming techniques and metal knowledge than their indigenous counterpart, the Proto-Malays.[31][32]\\r\\nStudies presented by HUGO (Human Genome Organization) through genetic studies of the various peoples of Asia, show empirically that there was a single migration event from Africa, whereby the early people travelled along the south coast of Asia, first entered the Malay peninsula 50,000ÿ90,000 years ago. The Orang Asli, in particular the Semang who show Negrito characteristics, are the direct descendent of this earliest settlers of Southeast Asia. These early people diversified and travelled slowly northwards to China, and the populations of Southeast Asia show greater genetic diversity than the younger population of China.[33][32] Studies on the genetics of modern Malays however show that there is a complex history of admixture of human populations in Southeast Asia, with the Malay population showing four major ancestral components: Austronesian, Proto-Malay, East Asian and South Asian.[34]\\r\\nSolheim and others have shown evidence for a Nusantao (Nusantara) maritime trading network ranging from Vietnam to the rest of the archipelago as early as 5000 BC to 1 AD.[35] The Bronze Age Dong Son culture flourished in Northern Vietnam from about 1000 BC to 1 BC. Its influence spread to other parts Southeast Asia.[36][37][38] The region entered the Iron Age era in 500 BC, when iron was forged also in northern Vietnam still under Dong Son, due to its frequent interactions with neighboring China.[26]\\r\\nThe peoples of Southeast Asia, especially those of Austronesian descent, have been seafarers for thousands of years, some reaching the island of Madagascar, became the ancestors of modern-day Malagasy people.[39] Passage through the Indian Ocean aided the colonisation of Madagascar, as well as commerce between Western Asia, eastern coast of India and Chinese southern coast.[39] Gold from Sumatra is thought to have reached as far west as Rome. Pliny the Elder wrote in his Natural History about Chryse and Argyre, two legendary islands rich in gold and silver, located in the Indian Ocean. Their vessels, such as the vinta, were capable to sail across ocean. Magellan's voyage records how much more manoeuvrable their vessels were, as compared to the European ships.[40] A slave from the Sulu Sea was believed to have been used in Magellan's voyage as a translator.\\r\\nMost Southeast Asian people were originally animist, engaged in ancestors, nature, and spirits worship. These belief systems were later supplanted by Hinduism and Buddhism after the region, especially coastal areas, came under contacts with Indian subcontinent during the 1st century.[41] Indian Brahmins and traders brought Hinduism to the region and made contacts with local courts.[42] Local rulers converted to Hinduism or Buddhism and adopted Indian religious traditions to reinforce their legitimacy, elevate ritual status above their fellow chief counterparts and facilitate trade with South Asian states. They periodically invited Indian Brahmins into their realms and began a gradual process of Indianisation in the region.[43][44][45] Shaivism was the dominant religious tradition of many southern Indian Hindu kingdoms during the 1st century. It then spread into Southeast Asia via Bay of Bengal, Indochina, then Malay Archipelago, leading to thousands of Shiva temples on the islands of Indonesia as well as Cambodia and Vietnam, co-evolving with Buddhism in the region.[46][47] Theravada Buddhism entered the region during the 3rd century, via maritime trade routes between the region and Sri Lanka.[48] Buddhism later established a strong presence in Funan region in the 5th century. In present-day mainland Southeast Asia, Theravada is still the dominant branch of Buddhism, practiced by the Thai, Burmese and Cambodian Buddhists. This branch was fused with the Hindu-influenced Khmer culture. Mahayana Buddhism established presence in Maritime Southeast Asia, brought by Chinese monks during their transit in the region en route to Nalanda.[43] It is still the dominant branch of Buddhism practiced by Indonesian and Malaysian Buddhists.\\r\\nThe spread of these two Indian religions confined the adherents of Southeast Asian indigenous beliefs into remote inland areas. Maluku Islands and New Guinea were never been Indianised and its native people were predominantly animists until the 15th century when Islam began to spread in those areas.[49] While in Vietnam, Buddhism never managed to develop strong institutional networks due to strong Chinese influence.[50] In present-day Southeast Asia, Vietnam is the only country where its folk religion makes up the plurality.[51][52] Recently, Vietnamese folk religion is undergoing a revival with the support of the government.[53] Elsewhere, there are ethnic groups in Southeast Asia that resist conversion and still retain their original animist beliefs, such as the Dayaks in Kalimantan, the Igorots in Luzon, and the Shans in eastern Myanmar.[54]\\r\\nAfter the region came under contacts with Indian subcontinent circa 400 BCE, it began a gradual process of Indianisation where Indian ideas such as religions, cultures, architectures and political administrations were brought by traders and religious figures and adopted by local rulers. In turn, Indian Brahmins and monks were invited by local rulers to live in their realms and help transforming local polities to become more Indianised, blending Indian and indigenous traditions.[55][44][45] Sanskrit and Pali became the elite language of the region, which effectively made Southeast Asia part of the Indosphere.[56] Most of the region had been Indianised during the first centuries, while the Philippines later Indianised circa 9th century when Kingdom of Tondo was established in Luzon.[57] Vietnam, especially its northern part, was never fully Indianised due to the many periods of Chinese domination it experienced.[58]\\r\\nThe first Indian-influenced polities established in the region were the Pyu city-states that already existed circa 2nd century BCE, located in inland Myanmar. It served as an overland trading hub between India and China.[59] Theravada Buddhism was the predominant religion of these city states, while the presence of other Indian religions such as Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism were also widespread.[60][61] In the 1st century, the Funan states centered in Mekong Delta were established, encompassed modern-day Cambodia, southern Vietnam, Laos, and eastern Thailand. It became the dominant trading power in mainland Southeast Asia for about five centuries, provided passage for Indian and Chinese goods and assumed authority over the flow of commerce through Southeast Asia.[62] In maritime Southeast Asia, the first recorded Indianised kingdom was Salakanagara, established in western Java circa 2nd century CE. This Hindu kingdom was known by the Greeks as Argyre (Land of Silver).[63]\\r\\nBy the 5th century CE, trade networking between East and West was concentrated in the maritime route. Foreign traders were starting to use new routes such as Malacca and Sunda Strait due to the development of maritime Southeast Asia. This change resulted in the decline of Funan, while new maritime powers such as Srivijaya, Tarumanagara, and Medang emerged. Srivijaya especially became the dominant maritime power for more than 5 centuries, controlling both Strait of Malacca and Sunda Strait.[39] This dominance started to decline when Srivijaya were invaded by Chola Empire, a dominant maritime power of Indian subcontinent, in 1025.[64] The invasion reshaped power and trade in the region, resulted in the rise of new regional powers such as the Khmer Empire and Kahuripan.[65] Continued commercial contacts with the Chinese Empire enabled the Cholas to influence the local cultures. Many of the surviving examples of the Hindu cultural influence found today throughout Southeast Asia are the result of the Chola expeditions.[66]\\r\\nAs Srivijaya influence in the region declined, The Hindu Khmer Empire experienced a golden age during the 11th to 13th century CE. The empire's capital Angkor hosts majestic monumentssuch as Angkor Wat and Bayon. Satellite imaging has revealed that Angkor, during its peak, was the largest pre-industrial urban centre in the world.[67] The Champa civilisation was located in what is today central Vietnam, and was a highly Indianised Hindu Kingdom. The Vietnamese launched a massive conquest against the Cham people during the 1471 Vietnamese invasion of Champa, ransacking and burning Champa, slaughtering thousands of Cham people, and forcibly assimilating them into Vietnamese culture.[68]\\r\\nDuring the 13th century CE, the region experienced Mongol invasions, affected areas such as Vietnamese coast, inland Burma and Java. In 1258, 1285 and 1287, the Mongols try to invade ??i Vi?t and Champa.[69] The invasions were unsuccessful, yet both Dai Viet and Champa agreed to become tributary states to Yuan dynasty to avoid further conflicts.[70] The Mongols also invaded Pagan Kingdom in Burma from 1277 to 1287, resulted in fragmentation of the Kingdom and rise of smaller Shan States ruled by local chieftains nominally submitted to Yuan dynasty.[71][72] However, in 1297, a new local power emerged. Myinsaing Kingdom became the real ruler of Central Burma and challenged the Mongol rule. This resulted in the second Mongol invasion of Burma in 1300, which was repulsed by Myinsaing.[73][74] The Mongols would later in 1303 withdrawn from Burma.[75] In 1292, The Mongols sent envoys to Singhasari Kingdom in Java to ask for submission to Mongol rule. Singhasari rejected the proposal and injured the envoys, enraged the Mongols and made them sent a large invasion fleet to Java. Unbeknownst to them, Singhasari collapsed in 1293 due to a revolt by Kadiri, one of its vassals. When the Mongols arrived in Java, a local prince named Raden Wijaya offered his service to assist the Mongols in punishing Kadiri. After Kadiri was defeated, Wijaya turned on his Mongol allies, ambushed their invasion fleet and forced them to immediately leave Java.[76][77]\\r\\nAfter the departure of the Mongols, Wijaya established the Majapahit Empire in eastern Java in 1293. Majapahit would soon grew into a regional power. Its greatest ruler was Hayam Wuruk, whose reign from 1350 to 1389 marked the empire's peak when other kingdoms in the southern Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, and Bali came under its influence. Various sources such as the Nagarakertagama also mention that its influence spanned over parts of Sulawesi, Maluku, and some areas of western New Guinea and southern Philippines, making it one of the largest empire to ever exist in Southeast Asian history.[78](p107) By the 15th century CE however, Majapahit's influence began to wane due to many war of successions it experienced and the rise of new Islamic states such as Samudera Pasai and Malacca Sultanate around the strategic Strait of Malacca. Majapahit then collapsed around 1500. It was the last major Hindu kingdom and the last regional power in the region before the arrival of the Europeans.[79][80]\\r\\nIslam began to made contacts with Southeast Asia in the 8th-century CE, when the Umayyads established trade with the region via sea routes.[81][82][83] However its spread into the region happened centuries later. In the 11th century, a turbulent period occurred in the history of Maritime Southeast Asia. The Indian Chola navy crossed the ocean and attacked the Srivijaya kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman in Kadaram (Kedah); the capital of the powerful maritime kingdom was sacked and the king was taken captive. Along with Kadaram, Pannai in present-day Sumatra and Malaiyur and the Malayan peninsula were attacked too. Soon after that, the king of Kedah Phra Ong Mahawangsa became the first ruler to abandon the traditional Hindu faith, and converted to Islam with the Sultanate of Kedah established in 1136. Samudera Pasai converted to Islam in 1267, the King of Malacca Parameswara married the princess of Pasai, and the son became the first sultan of Malacca. Soon, Malacca became the center of Islamic study and maritime trade, and other rulers followed suit. Indonesian religious leader and Islamic scholar Hamka (1908ÿ1981) wrote in 1961: \\"The development of Islam in Indonesia and Malaya is intimately related to a Chinese Muslim, Admiral Zheng He.\\"[84]\\r\\nThere are several theories to the Islamisation process in Southeast Asia. Another theory is trade. The expansion of trade among West Asia, India and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders from Southern Yemen (Hadramout) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade. Many settled in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. This is evident in the Arab-Indonesian, Arab-Singaporean, and Arab-Malay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries. Finally, the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region. The ruler of the region's most important port, Malacca Sultanate, embraced Islam in the 15th century, heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as Islam provided a positive force among the ruling and trading classes.\\r\\nTrade among Southeast Asian countries has a long tradition. The consequences of colonial rule, struggle for independence and in some cases war influenced the economic attitudes and policies of each country until today.[85]\\r\\nFrom 111 BC to 938 AD northern Vietnam was under Chinese rule. Vietnam was successfully governed by a series of Chinese dynasties including the Han, Eastern Han, Eastern Wu, Cao Wei, Jin, Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang, Sui, Tang, and Southern Han.\\r\\nRecords from Magellan's voyage show that Brunei possessed more cannon than the European ships, so the Chinese must have been trading with them.[40]\\r\\nMalaysian legend has it that a Chinese Ming emperor sent a princess, Hang Li Po, to Malacca, with a retinue of 500, to marry Sultan Mansur Shah after the emperor was impressed by the wisdom of the sultan. Han Li Po's well (constructed 1459) is now a tourist attraction there, as is Bukit Cina, where her retinue settled.\\r\\nThe strategic value of the Strait of Malacca, which was controlled by Sultanate of Malacca in the 15th and early 16th century, did not go unnoticed by Portuguese writer Duarte Barbosa, who in 1500 wrote \\"He who is lord of Malacca has his hand on the throat of Venice\\".\\r\\nWestern influence started to enter in the 16th century, with the arrival of the Portuguese in Malacca, Maluku and the Philippines, the latter being settled by the Spanish years later. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries the Dutch established the Dutch East Indies; the French Indochina; and the British Strait Settlements. By the 19th century, all Southeast Asian countries were colonised except for Thailand.\\r\\nEuropean explorers were reaching Southeast Asia from the west and from the east. Regular trade between the ships sailing east from the Indian Ocean and south from mainland Asia provided goods in return for natural products, such as honey and hornbill beaks from the islands of the archipelago. Before the eighteenth and nineteenth century, the Europeans mostly were interested in expanding trade links. For the majority of the populations in each country, there was comparatively little interaction with Europeans and traditional social routines and relationships continued. For most, a life with subsistence level agriculture, fishing and, in less developed civilizations, hunting and gathering was still hard.[86]\\r\\nEuropeans brought Christianity allowing Christian missionaries to become widespread. Thailand also allowed Western scientists to enter its country to develop its own education system as well as start sending Royal members and Thai scholars to get higher education from Europe and Russia.\\r\\nDuring World War II, Imperial Japan invaded most of the former western colonies. The Shwa occupation regime committed violent actions against civilians such as the Manila massacre and the implementation of a system of forced labour, such as the one involving 4 to 10 million romusha in Indonesia.[87] A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of famine and forced labour during the Japanese occupation.[88] The Allied powers who defeated Japan in the South-East Asian theatre of World War II then contended with nationalists to whom the occupation authorities had granted independence.\\r\\nMost countries in the region enjoy national autonomy. Democratic forms of government and the recognition of human rights are taking root. ASEAN provides a framework for the integration of commerce, and regional responses to international concerns.\\r\\nConflicting claims over the Spratly Islands are made by Brunei, China, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. As recently as 2013, China has made efforts to develop artificial islands throughout the region.[89]\\r\\nIndonesia is the largest country in Southeast Asia and it also the largest archipelago in the world by size (according to the CIA World Factbook). Geologically, the Indonesian Archipelago is one of the most volcanically active regions in the world. Geological uplifts in the region have also produced some impressive mountains, culminating in Puncak Jaya in Papua, Indonesia at 5,030 metres (16,500 feet), on the island of New Guinea; it is the only place where ice glaciers can be found in Southeast Asia. The highest mountain in Southeast Asia is Hkakabo Razi at 5,967 meters and can be found in northern Burma sharing the same range of its parent peak, Mount Everest.\\r\\nThe South China Sea is the major body of water within Southeast Asia. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and Singapore, have integral rivers that flow into the South China Sea.\\r\\nMayon Volcano, despite being dangerously active, holds the record of the world's most perfect cone which is built from past and continuous eruption.[90]\\r\\nSoutheast Asia is bounded to the southeast by the Australian continent, a boundary which runs through Indonesia. But a cultural touch point lies between Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian region of the Papua and West Papua, which shares the island of New Guinea with Papua New Guinea.\\r\\nThe climate in Southeast Asia is mainly tropicalÿhot and humid all year round with plentiful rainfall. Northern Vietnam and the Myanmar Himalayas are the only regions in Southeast Asia that feature a subtropical climate, which has a cold winter with snow. The majority of Southeast Asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shift in winds or monsoon. The tropical rain belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season. The rain forest is the second largest on earth (with the Amazon being the largest). An exception to this type of climate and vegetation is the mountain areas in the northern region, where high altitudes lead to milder temperatures and drier landscape. Other parts fall out of this climate because they are desert like. Climate change will have a big effect on agriculture in Southeast Asia such as irrigation systems will be affected by changes in rainfall and runoff, and subsequently, water quality and supply.[91]\\r\\nThe vast majority of Southeast Asia falls within the warm, humid tropics, and its climate generally can be characterised as monsoonal. The animals of Southeast Asia are diverse; on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, the orangutan, the Asian elephant, the Malayan tapir, the Sumatran rhinoceros and the Bornean clouded leopard can also be found. Six subspecies of the binturong or bearcat exist in the region, though the one endemic to the island of Palawan is now classed as vulnerable.\\r\\nTigers of three different subspecies are found on the island of Sumatra (the Sumatran tiger), in peninsular Malaysia (the Malayan tiger), and in Indochina (the Indochinese tiger); all of which are endangered species.\\r\\nThe Komodo dragon is the largest living species of lizard and inhabits the islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang in Indonesia.\\r\\nThe Philippine eagle is the national bird of the Philippines. It is considered by scientists as the largest eagle in the world,[92] and is endemic to the Philippines' forests.\\r\\nThe wild Asian water buffalo, and on various islands related dwarf species of Bubalus such as anoa were once widespread in Southeast Asia; nowadays the domestic Asian water buffalo is common across the region, but its remaining relatives are rare and endangered.\\r\\nThe mouse deer, a small tusked deer as large as a toy dog or cat, mostly can be found on Sumatra, Borneo (Indonesia) and in Palawan Islands (Philippines). The gaur, a gigantic wild ox larger than even wild water buffalo, is found mainly in Indochina. There is very little scientific information available regarding Southeast Asian amphibians.[93]\\r\\nBirds such as the peafowl and drongo live in this subregion as far east as Indonesia. The babirusa, a four-tusked pig, can be found in Indonesia as well. The hornbill was prized for its beak and used in trade with China. The horn of the rhinoceros, not part of its skull, was prized in China as well.\\r\\nThe Indonesian Archipelago is split by the Wallace Line. This line runs along what is now known to be a tectonic plate boundary, and separates Asian (Western) species from Australasian (Eastern) species. The islands between Java/Borneo and Papua form a mixed zone, where both types occur, known as Wallacea. As the pace of development accelerates and populations continue to expand in Southeast Asia, concern has increased regarding the impact of human activity on the region's environment. A significant portion of Southeast Asia, however, has not changed greatly and remains an unaltered home to wildlife. The nations of the region, with only few exceptions, have become aware of the need to maintain forest cover not only to prevent soil erosion but to preserve the diversity of flora and fauna. Indonesia, for example, has created an extensive system of national parks and preserves for this purpose. Even so, such species as the Javan rhinoceros face extinction, with only a handful of the animals remaining in western Java.\\r\\nThe shallow waters of the Southeast Asian coral reefs have the highest levels of biodiversity for the world's marine ecosystems, where coral, fish and molluscs abound. According to Conservation International, marine surveys suggest that the marine life diversity in the Raja Ampat (Indonesia) is the highest recorded on Earth. Diversity is considerably greater than any other area sampled in the Coral Triangle composed of Indonesia, Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. The Coral Triangle is the heart of the world's coral reef biodiversity, the Verde Passage is dubbed by Conservation International as the world's \\"center of the center of marine shorefish biodiversity\\". The whale shark, the world's largest species of fish and 6 species of sea turtles can also be found in the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean territories of the Philippines.\\r\\nThe trees and other plants of the region are tropical; in some countries where the mountains are tall enough, temperate-climate vegetation can be found. These rainforest areas are currently being logged-over, especially in Borneo.\\r\\nWhile Southeast Asia is rich in flora and fauna, Southeast Asia is facing severe deforestation which causes habitat loss for various endangered species such as orangutan and the Sumatran tiger. Predictions have been made that more than 40% of the animal and plant species in Southeast Asia could be wiped out in the 21st century.[94] At the same time, haze has been a regular occurrence. The two worst regional hazes were in 1997 and 2006 in which multiple countries were covered with thick haze, mostly caused by \\"slash and burn\\" activities in Sumatra and Borneo. In reaction, several countries in Southeast Asia signed the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution to combat haze pollution.\\r\\nThe 2013 Southeast Asian Haze saw API levels reach a hazardous level in some countries. Muar experienced the highest API level of 746 on 23 June 2013 at around 7 am.[95]\\r\\nEven prior to the penetration of European interests, Southeast Asia was a critical part of the world trading system. A wide range of commodities originated in the region, but especially important were spices such as pepper, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. The spice trade initially was developed by Indian and Arab merchants, but it also brought Europeans to the region. First Spaniards (Manila galleon) and Portuguese, then the Dutch, and finally the British and French became involved in this enterprise in various countries. The penetration of European commercial interests gradually evolved into annexation of territories, as traders lobbied for an extension of control to protect and expand their activities. As a result, the Dutch moved into Indonesia, the British into Malaya and parts of Borneo, the French into Indochina, and the Spanish and the US into the Philippines. An economic effect of this imperialism was the shift in the production of commodities. For example, the rubber plantations of Malaysia, Java, Vietnam and Cambodia, the tin mining of Malaya, the rice fields of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and Irrawaddy River delta in Burma, were a response to powerful market demands.[96]\\r\\nThe overseas Chinese community has played a large role in the development of the economies in the region. These business communities are connected through the bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.[97] The origins of Chinese influence can be traced to the 16th century, when Chinese migrants from southern China settled in Indonesia, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries.[98] Chinese populations in the region saw a rapid increase following the Communist Revolution in 1949, which forced many refugees to emigrate outside of China.[97]\\r\\nThe region's economy greatly depends on agriculture; rice and rubber have long been prominent exports. Manufacturing and services are becoming more important. An emerging market, Indonesia is the largest economy in this region. Newly industrialised countries include Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines, while Singapore and Brunei are affluent developed economies. The rest of Southeast Asia is still heavily dependent on agriculture, but Vietnam is notably making steady progress in developing its industrial sectors. The region notably manufactures textiles, electronic high-tech goods such as microprocessors and heavy industrial products such as automobiles. Oil reserves in Southeast Asia are plentiful.\\r\\nSeventeen telecommunications companies contracted to build the Asia-America Gateway submarine cable to connect Southeast Asia to the US[99] This is to avoid disruption of the kind recently caused by the cutting of the undersea cable from Taiwan to the US in the 2006 Hengchun earthquakes.\\r\\nTourism has been a key factor in economic development for many Southeast Asian countries, especially Cambodia. According to UNESCO, \\"tourism, if correctly conceived, can be a tremendous development tool and an effective means of preserving the cultural diversity of our planet.\\"[100] Since the early 1990s, \\"even the non-ASEAN nations such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Burma, where the income derived from tourism is low, are attempting to expand their own tourism industries.\\"[101] In 1995, Singapore was the regional leader in tourism receipts relative to GDP at over 8%. By 1998, those receipts had dropped to less than 6% of GDP while Thailand and Lao PDR increased receipts to over 7%. Since 2000, Cambodia has surpassed all other ASEAN countries and generated almost 15% of its GDP from tourism in 2006.[102]\\r\\nIndonesia is the only member of G-20 major economies and is the largest economy in the region.[103] Indonesia's estimated gross domestic product for 2016 was US$932.4 billion (nominal) or $3,031.3 billion (PPP) with per capita GDP of US$3,604 (nominal) or $11,717 (PPP).[104]\\r\\nStock markets in Southeast Asia have performed better than other bourses in the Asia-Pacific region in 2010, with the Philippines' PSE leading the way with 22 percent growth, followed by Thailand's SET with 21 percent and Indonesia's JKSE with 19 percent.[105][106]\\r\\nSoutheast Asia's GDP per capita is US$3,853 according to a 2015 United Nations report, which is comparable to Guatemala and Tonga.[107]\\r\\n(2017)[111]\\r\\n(2017)[112]\\r\\nSoutheast Asia has an area of approximately 4,500,000?km2 (1.7?million square miles). As of 2016, around 642 million people live in the region, more than a fifth live (143?million) on the Indonesian island of Java, the most densely populated large island in the world. Indonesia is the most populous country with 261 million people, and also the 4th most populous country in the world. The distribution of the religions and people is diverse in Southeast Asia and varies by country. Some 30?million overseas Chinese also live in Southeast Asia, most prominently in Christmas Island, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, and also as the Hoa in Vietnam. People of Southeast Asian origins are known as Southeast Asians or Aseanites.\\r\\nThe Aslians and Negritos were believed as one of the earliest inhabitant in the region. They are genetically related to the Australoid Papuans in Eastern Indonesia and Australian Aborigines. The next waves of human migration to Southeast Asia were Austroasiatic and Austronesians, which today forming the majority of the regional population.\\r\\nIn modern times, the Javanese are the largest ethnic group in Southeast Asia, with more than 100 million people, mostly concentrated in Java, Indonesia. The second largest ethnic group in Southeast Asia is Vietnamese with around 86 million population, mainly inhabit Vietnam forming significant minority in neighboring Cambodia and Laos. The Thais is also a significant ethnic group with around 59 million population forming the majority in Thailand. In Burma, the Burmese account for more than two-thirds of the ethnic stock in this country.\\r\\nIndonesia is clearly dominated by the Javanese and Sundanese ethnic groups, with hundreds of ethnic minorities inhabited the archipelago, including Madurese, Minangkabau, Bugis, Balinese, Dayak, Batak and Malays. While Malaysia is split between more than half Malays and one-quarter Chinese, and also Indian minority in the West Malaysia however Dayaks is the most majority in Sarawak and Kadazan-dusun is the most majority in Sabah which are in the East Malaysia. The Malays are the majority in West Malaysia and Brunei, while they forming a significant minority in Indonesia, Southern Thailand , East Malaysia and Singapore. In city-state Singapore, Chinese are the majority, yet the city is a multicultural melting pot with Malays, Indians and Eurasian also called the island their home.\\r\\nThe Chams forming a significant minority in Central and South Vietnam, also in Central Cambodia. While the Khmers are the majority in Cambodia, and forming a significant minority in Southern Vietnam and Thailand. The Hmong people are the minority in Vietnam, China and Laos.\\r\\nWithin the Philippines, the Visayan (mainly Cebuanos and Hiligaynons), Tagalog, Ilocano, Bicolano and Central Luzon (mainly Kapampangan and Pangasinan) groups are significant.\\r\\nCountries in Southeast Asia practice many different religions. Islam is the most practised faith, numbering approximately 240 million adherents, or about 40% of the entire population, concentrated in Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Southern Thailand and in the Southern Philippines. Indonesia is the most populous Muslim-majority country around the world.\\r\\nBuddhism is predominant in Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Burma and Singapore. Ancestor worship and Confucianism are also widely practised in Vietnam and Singapore.\\r\\nChristianity is predominant in the Philippines, eastern Indonesia, East Malaysia and East Timor. The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia. East Timor is also predominantly Roman Catholic due to a history of Portuguese rule.\\r\\nNo individual Southeast Asian country is religiously homogeneous. In the world's most populous Muslim nation, Indonesia, Hinduism is dominant on islands such as Bali. Christianity also predominates in the rest of the part of the Philippines, New Guinea and Timor. Pockets of Hindu population can also be found around Southeast Asia in Singapore, Malaysia etc. Garuda (Sanskrit: Garu?a), the phoenix who is the mount (vahanam) of Vishnu, is a national symbol in both Thailand and Indonesia; in the Philippines, gold images of Garuda have been found on Palawan; gold images of other Hindu gods and goddesses have also been found on Mindanao. Balinese Hinduism is somewhat different from Hinduism practised elsewhere, as Animism and local culture is incorporated into it. Christians can also be found throughout Southeast Asia; they are in the majority in East Timor and the Philippines, Asia's largest Christian nation. In addition, there are also older tribal religious practices in remote areas of Sarawak in East Malaysia, Highland Philippines and Papua in eastern Indonesia. In Burma, Sakka (Indra) is revered as a nat. In Vietnam, Mahayana Buddhism is practised, which is influenced by native animism but with strong emphasis on ancestor worship.\\r\\nThe religious composition for each country is as follows: Some values are taken from the CIA World Factbook:[113]\\r\\nEach of the languages have been influenced by cultural pressures due to trade, immigration, and historical colonization as well. There are nearly over 800 native languages in the region.\\r\\nThe language composition for each country is as follows (with official languages in bold):\\r\\nIndonesia has over 700 languages in over 17,000 islands across the archipelago, making Indonesia the second most linguistically diverse country on the planet,[124] slightly behind Papua New Guinea. The official language of Indonesia is Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia), widely used in educational, political, economic, and other formal situations. In daily activities and informal situations, most Indonesians speak in their local language(s). For more details, see: Languages of Indonesia.\\r\\nThe Philippines has more than a hundred native languages, most without official recognition from the national government. Spanish and Arabic are on a voluntary and optional basis. Malaysian, Indonesian, Mandarin, Lan-nang (Hokkien), Cantonese, Hakka, Japanese and Korean are also spoken in the Philippines due to immigration, geographic proximity and historical ties. See: Languages of the Philippines\\r\\nThe culture in Southeast Asia is very diverse: on mainland Southeast Asia, the culture is a mix of Indochinese (Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand) and Chinese (Vietnam). While in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia the culture is a mix of indigenous Austronesian, Indian, Islamic, Western, and Chinese cultures. Also Brunei shows a strong influence from Arabia. Singapore and Vietnam show more Chinese influence[129] in that Singapore, although being geographically a Southeast Asian nation, is home to a large Chinese majority and Vietnam was in China's sphere of influence for much of its history. Indian influence in Singapore is only evident through the Tamil migrants,[130] which influenced, to some extent, the cuisine of Singapore. Throughout Vietnam's history, it has had no direct influence from India ÿ only through contact with the Thai, Khmer and Cham peoples.\\r\\nRice paddy agriculture has existed in Southeast Asia for thousands of years, ranging across the subregion. Some dramatic examples of these rice paddies populate the Banaue Rice Terraces in the mountains of Luzon in the Philippines. Maintenance of these paddies is very labour-intensive. The rice paddies are well-suited to the monsoon climate of the region.\\r\\nStilt houses can be found all over Southeast Asia, from Thailand and Vietnam, to Borneo, to Luzon in the Philippines, to Papua New Guinea. The region has diverse metalworking, especially in Indonesia. This include weaponry, such as the distinctive kris, and musical instruments, such as the gamelan.\\r\\nThe region's chief cultural influences have been from some combination of Islam, India, and China. Diverse cultural influence is pronounced in the Philippines, derived particularly from the period of the Spanish and American rule, contact with Indian-influenced cultures, and the Chinese and Japanese trading era.\\r\\nAs a rule, the peoples who ate with their fingers were more likely influenced by the culture of India, for example, than the culture of China, where the peoples ate with chopsticks; tea, as a beverage, can be found across the region. The fish sauces distinctive to the region tend to vary.\\r\\nThe arts of Southeast Asia have affinity with the arts of other areas. Dance in much of Southeast Asia includes movement of the hands as well as the feet, to express the dance's emotion and meaning of the story that the ballerina is going to tell the audience. Most of Southeast Asia introduced dance into their court; in particular, Cambodian royal ballet represented them in the early 7th century before the Khmer Empire, which was highly influenced by Indian Hinduism. Apsara Dance, famous for strong hand and feet movement, is a great example of Hindu symbolic dance.\\r\\nPuppetry and shadow plays were also a favoured form of entertainment in past centuries, a famous one being Wayang from Indonesia. The arts and literature in some of Southeast Asia is quite influenced by Hinduism, which was brought to them centuries ago. Indonesia, despite conversion to Islam which opposes certain forms of art, has retained many forms of Hindu-influenced practices, culture, art and literature. An example is the Wayang Kulit (Shadow Puppet) and literature like the Ramayana. The wayang kulit show has been recognized by UNESCO on November 7, 2003, as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\\r\\nIt has been pointed out that Khmer and Indonesian classical arts were concerned with depicting the life of the gods, but to the Southeast Asian mind the life of the gods was the life of the peoples themselvesjoyous, earthy, yet divine. The Tai, coming late into Southeast Asia, brought with them some Chinese artistic traditions, but they soon shed them in favour of the Khmer and Mon traditions, and the only indications of their earlier contact with Chinese arts were in the style of their temples, especially the tapering roof, and in their lacquerware.\\r\\nTraditional music in Southeast Asia is as varied as its many ethnic and cultural divisions. Main styles of traditional music can be seen: Court music, folk music, music styles of smaller ethnic groups, and music influenced by genres outside the geographic region.\\r\\nOf the court and folk genres, gong-chime ensembles and orchestras make up the majority (the exception being lowland areas of Vietnam). Gamelan and Angklung orchestras from Indonesia, Piphat /Pinpeat ensembles of Thailand and Cambodia and the Kulintang ensembles of the southern Philippines, Borneo, Sulawesi and Timor are the three main distinct styles of musical genres that have influenced other traditional musical styles in the region. String instruments also are popular in the region.\\r\\nOn November 18, 2010, UNESCO officially recognized angklung as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, and encourage Indonesian people and government to safeguard, transmit, promote performances and to encourage the craftsmanship of angklung making.\\r\\nThe history of Southeast Asia has led to a wealth of different authors, from both within and without writing about the region.\\r\\nOriginally, Indians were the ones who taught the native inhabitants about writing. This is shown through Brahmic forms of writing present in the region such as the Balinese script shown on split palm leaf called lontar (see image to the left  magnify the image to see the writing on the flat side, and the decoration on the reverse side).\\r\\nThe antiquity of this form of writing extends before the invention of paper around the year 100 in China. Note each palm leaf section was only several lines, written longitudinally across the leaf, and bound by twine to the other sections. The outer portion was decorated. The alphabets of Southeast Asia tended to be abugidas, until the arrival of the Europeans, who used words that also ended in consonants, not just vowels. Other forms of official documents, which did not use paper, included Javanese copperplate scrolls. This material would have been more durable than paper in the tropical climate of Southeast Asia.\\r\\nIn Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore, the Malay language is now generally written in the Latin script. The same phenomenon is present in Indonesian, although different spelling standards are utilised (e.g. 'Teksi' in Malay and 'Taksi' in Indonesian for the word 'Taxi').\\r\\nThe use of Chinese characters, in the past and present, is only evident in Vietnam and more recently, Singapore and Malaysia. The adoption of Chinese characters in Vietnam dates back to around 111BC, when it was occupied by the Chinese. A Vietnamese script called Chu nom used modified Chinese characters to express the Vietnamese language. Both classical Chinese and Chu Nom were used up until the early 20th century.\\r\\nHowever, the use of the Chinese script has been in decline, especially in Singapore and Malaysia as the younger generations are in favour of the Latin Script.","input":"What regions of south asia have the highest population densities?"},{"output":"March 1944","context":"25,000 years before present to 1944\\r\\nMount Vesuvius ( /v??su?vi?s/; Italian: Monte Vesuvio [?monte ve?zu?vjo]; Neapolitan: Vesuvio; Latin: Mons Vesuvius [m??s w??s?w?.?s]; also Vesevus or Vesaevus in some Roman sources)[1] is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about 9?km (5.6?mi) east of Naples and a short distance from the shore. It is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure.\\r\\nMount Vesuvius is best known for its eruption in AD 79 that led to the burying and destruction of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, as well as several other settlements. The eruption ejected a cloud of stones, ashes and volcanic gases to a height of 33?km (21?mi), spewing molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of 6G105 cubic metres (7.8G105?cu?yd) per second,[2] ultimately releasing a hundred thousand times the thermal energy released by the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings.[3] More than 1,000 people died in the eruption, but exact numbers are unknown. The only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian Tacitus.[4]\\r\\nVesuvius has erupted many times since and is the only volcano on the European mainland to have erupted within the last hundred years. Today, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of the population of 3,000,000 people living nearby and its tendency towards violent, explosive eruptions of the Plinian type, making it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVesuvius has a long historic and literary tradition. It was considered a divinity of the Genius type at the time of the eruption of AD 79: it appears under the inscribed name Vesuvius as a serpent in the decorative frescos of many lararia, or household shrines, surviving from Pompeii. An inscription from Capua[6] to IOVI VESVVIO indicates that he was worshipped as a power of Jupiter; that is, Jupiter Vesuvius.[7]\\r\\nThe historian Diodorus Siculus relates a tradition that Hercules, in the performance of his labors, passed through the country of nearby Cumae on his way to Sicily and found there a place called \\"the Phlegraean Plain\\" (phlegraion pedion, \\"plain of fire\\"), \\"from a hill which anciently vomited out fire ... now called Vesuvius.\\"[8] It was inhabited by bandits, \\"the sons of the Earth,\\" who were giants. With the assistance of the gods he pacified the region and went on. The facts behind the tradition, if any, remain unknown, as does whether Herculaneum was named after it. An epigram by the poet Martial in 88 AD suggests that both Venus, patroness of Pompeii, and Hercules were worshipped in the region devastated by the eruption of 79.[9] Mount Vesuvius was regarded by the Romans as being devoted to the hero and demigod Hercules.[10]\\r\\nVesuvius was a name of the volcano in frequent use by the authors of the late Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. Its collateral forms were Vesaevus, Vesevus, Vesbius and Vesvius.[11] Writers in ancient Greek used Ѯ?? or Ѯ???. Many scholars since then have offered an etymology. As peoples of varying ethnicity and language occupied Campania in the Roman Iron Age, the etymology depends to a large degree on the presumption of what language was spoken there at the time. Naples was settled by Greeks, as the name Nea-polis, \\"New City\\", testifies. The Oscans, a native Italic people, lived in the countryside. The Latins also competed for the occupation of Campania. Etruscan settlements were in the vicinity. Other peoples of unknown provenance are said to have been there at some time by various ancient authors.\\r\\nSome theories about its origin are:\\r\\nVesuvius is a distinctive \\"humpbacked\\" peak, consisting of a large cone (Gran Cono) partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure called Mount Somma.[15] The Gran Cono was produced during the A.D. 79 eruption. For this reason, the volcano is also called Somma-Vesuvius or Somma-Vesuvio.\\r\\nThe caldera started forming during an eruption around 17,000 (or 18,300) years ago[16][17][18] and was enlarged by later paroxysmal eruptions,[19] ending in the one of AD 79. This structure has given its name to the term \\"somma volcano\\", which describes any volcano with a summit caldera surrounding a newer cone.[20]\\r\\nThe height of the main cone has been constantly changed by eruptions but was 1,281?m (4,203?ft) in 2010.[17] Monte Somma is 1,132?m (3,714?ft) high, separated from the main cone by the valley of Atrio di Cavallo, which is 5?km (3.1?mi) long. The slopes of the volcano are scarred by lava flows, while the rest are heavily vegetated, with scrub and forests at higher altitudes and vineyards lower down. Vesuvius is still regarded as an active volcano, although its current activity produces little more than sulfur-rich steam from vents at the bottom and walls of the crater. Vesuvius is a stratovolcano at the convergent boundary where the African Plate is being subducted beneath the Eurasian Plate. Layers of lava, ash, scoria and pumice make up the volcanic peak. Their mineralogy is variable, but generally silica-undersaturated and rich in potassium, with phonolite produced in the more explosive eruptions.[21]\\r\\nVesuvius was formed as a result of the collision of two tectonic plates, the African and the Eurasian. The former was subducted beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and caused the melting point of the upper mantle to drop enough to create partial melting of the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.\\r\\nThe volcano is one of several which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Others include Campi Flegrei, a large caldera a few kilometers to the north west, Mount Epomeo, 20 kilometres (12?mi) to the west on the island of Ischia, and several undersea volcanoes to the south. The arc forms the southern end of a larger chain of volcanoes produced by the subduction process described above, which extends northwest along the length of Italy as far as Monte Amiata in Southern Tuscany. Vesuvius is the only one to have erupted within recent history, although some of the others have erupted within the last few hundred years. Many are either extinct or have not erupted for tens of thousands of years.\\r\\nMount Vesuvius has erupted many times. The famous eruption in AD 79 was preceded by numerous others in prehistory, including at least three significantly larger ones, the best known being the Avellino eruption around 1800 BC which engulfed several Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150, and there may have been eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500.[19] The volcano erupted again in 1631, six times in the 18th century (especially in 1779 and 1794), eight times in the 19th century (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929 and 1944. There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one.\\r\\nThe eruptions vary greatly in severity but are characterized by explosive outbursts of the kind dubbed Plinian after Pliny the Younger, a Roman writer who published a detailed description of the 79 AD eruption, including his uncle's death.[22] On occasion, eruptions from Vesuvius have been so large that the whole of southern Europe has been blanketed by ash; in 472 and 1631, Vesuvian ash fell on Constantinople (Istanbul), over 1,200 kilometres (750?mi) away. A few times since 1944, landslides in the crater have raised clouds of ash dust, raising false alarms of an eruption.\\r\\nScientific knowledge of the geologic history of Vesuvius comes from core samples taken from a 2,000?m (6,600?ft) plus bore hole on the flanks of the volcano, extending into Mesozoic rock. Cores were dated by potassiumÿargon and argonÿargon dating.[23] The volcano started forming 25,000 years ago. Although the area has been subject to volcanic activity for at least 400,000 years, the lowest layer of eruption material from the Somma caldera lies on top of the 40,000 year?old Campanian ignimbrite produced by the Campi Flegrei complex, and was the product of the Codola Plinian eruption 25,000 years ago.[15]\\r\\nIt was then built up by a series of lava flows, with some smaller explosive eruptions interspersed between them. However, the style of eruption changed around 19,000 years ago to a sequence of large explosive Plinian eruptions, of which the AD 79 one was the most recent. The eruptions are named after the tephra deposits produced by them, which in turn are named after the location where the deposits were first identified:[24]\\r\\nThe volcano was then quiet (for 295 years, if the 217 BC date for the last previous eruption is true) and was described by Roman writers as having been covered with gardens and vineyards, except at the top, which was craggy. The volcano may have had only one summit at that time, judging by a wall painting, \\"Bacchus and Vesuvius\\", found in a Pompeian house, the House of the Centenary (Casa del Centenario).\\r\\nSeveral surviving works written over the 200?years preceding the AD 79 eruption describe the mountain as having had a volcanic nature, although Pliny the Elder did not depict the mountain in this way in his Naturalis Historia:[30]\\r\\nOn August 24, in the year AD 79, Vesuvius erupted in one of the most catastrophic and famous eruptions of all time. Historians have learned about the eruption from the eyewitness account of Pliny the Younger, a Roman administrator and poet.[34]\\r\\nThe volcano ejected a cloud of stones, ashes and volcanic gases to a height of 33?km (21?mi), spewing molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of 6G105 cubic metres (7.8G105?cu?yd) per second, ultimately releasing a hundred thousand times the thermal energy released by the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings.[3] The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were destroyed by pyroclastic surges and the ruins buried under dozens of feet of tephra.[3][34]\\r\\nThe AD 79 eruption was preceded by a powerful earthquake seventeen years beforehand on February 05 of AD 62, which caused widespread destruction around the Bay of Naples, and particularly to Pompeii.[35] Some of the damage had still not been repaired when the volcano erupted.[36] The deaths of 600 sheep from \\"tainted air\\" in the vicinity of Pompeii indicates that the earthquake of AD 62 may have been related to new activity by Vesuvius[37]\\r\\nThe Romans grew accustomed to minor earth tremors in the region; the writer Pliny the Younger even wrote that they \\"were not particularly alarming because they are frequent in Campania\\". Small earthquakes started taking place on 20 August 79[36] becoming more frequent over the next four days, but the warnings were not recognized.[a]\\r\\nReconstructions of the eruption and its effects vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In the middle of the day an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day pyroclastic surges in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By late afternoon of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\\r\\nThe latest scientific studies of the ash produced by Vesuvius reveals a multi-phase eruption.[38] The initial major explosion produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between 15 and 30 kilometres (49,000 and 98,000?ft) high, which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum upwind. The chief energy supporting the column came from the escape of steam superheated by the magma, created from seawater seeping over time into the deep faults of the region, that came into interaction with magma and heat.\\r\\nSubsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases expanded and lost their capability to support their solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum but not Pompeii. Additional blasts reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Plinian and Pelan six times. Surges 3 and 4 are believed by the authors to have buried Pompeii.[39] Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\\r\\nAnother study used the magnetic characteristics of over 200 samples of roof-tile and plaster fragments collected around Pompeii to estimate equilibrium temperature of the pyroclastic flow.[40] The magnetic study revealed that on the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to 3 centimetres (1.2?in) fell for several hours.[41] It heated the roof tiles up to 140?C (284?F).[42] This period would have been the last opportunity to escape.\\r\\nThe collapse of the Plinian columns on the second day caused pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) that devastated Herculaneum and Pompeii. The depositional temperature of these pyroclastic surges ranged up to 300?C (572?F).[43] Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as 100?C (212?F).[44]\\r\\nThe only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian Tacitus.[4] Pliny the Younger describes, amongst other things, the last days in the life of his uncle, Pliny the Elder. Observing the first volcanic activity from Misenum across the Bay of Naples from the volcano, approximately 35 kilometres (22?mi), the elder Pliny launched a rescue fleet and went himself to the rescue of a personal friend. His nephew declined to join the party. One of the nephew's letters relates what he could discover from witnesses of his uncle's experiences.[45][46] In a second letter the younger Pliny details his own observations after the departure of his uncle.[47][48]\\r\\nThe two men saw an extraordinarily dense cloud rising rapidly above the peak. This cloud and a request by a messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. Further tremors near dawn caused the population to abandon the village and caused disastrous wave action in the Bay of Naples.\\r\\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.\\r\\nPliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was in command of the Roman fleet at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius[49]) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue. Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.\\r\\nHe set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back, he stated \\"Fortune favors the brave\\" and ordered him to continue on to Stabiae (about 4.5 kilometers from Pompeii).\\r\\nPliny the Elder and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.[50]\\r\\nIn the first letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger suggested that his uncle's death was due to the reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16?km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so it is more likely that the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack.[51] His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.\\r\\nAlong with Pliny the Elder, the only other noble casualties of the eruption to be known by name were Agrippa (a son of the Herodian Jewish princess Drusilla and the procurator Antonius Felix) and his wife.[52]\\r\\nBy 2003, around 1,044?casts made from impressions of bodies in the ash deposits had been recovered in and around Pompeii, with the scattered bones of another 100.[53] The remains of about 332 bodies have been found at Herculaneum (300 in arched vaults discovered in 1980).[54] What percentage these numbers are of the total dead or the percentage of the dead to the total number at risk remain completely unknown.\\r\\nThirty-eight percent of the 1,044 were found in the ash fall deposits, the majority inside buildings. These are thought to have been killed mainly by roof collapses, with the smaller number of victims found outside of buildings probably being killed by falling roof slates or by larger rocks thrown out by the volcano. The remaining 62% of remains found at Pompeii were in the pyroclastic surge deposits,[53] and thus were probably killed by them ÿ probably from a combination of suffocation through ash inhalation and blast and debris thrown around. In contrast to the victims found at Herculaneum, examination of cloth, frescoes and skeletons show that it is unlikely that high temperatures were a significant cause. Herculaneum, which was much closer to the crater, was saved from tephra falls by the wind direction, but was buried under 23 metres (75?ft) of material deposited by pyroclastic surges. It is likely that most, or all, of the known victims in this town were killed by the surges.\\r\\nPeople caught on the former seashore by the first surge died of thermal shock. No boats have been found, indicating they may have been used for the earlier escape of some of the population. The rest were concentrated in arched chambers at a density of as high as 3 persons per square meter. As only 85 metres (279?ft) of the coast have been excavated, the casualties waiting to be excavated may well be as high as the thousands.[55]\\r\\nSince the eruption of AD 79, Vesuvius has erupted around three dozen times. It erupted again in 203, during the lifetime of the historian Cassius Dio. In 472, it ejected such a volume of ash that ashfalls were reported as far away as Constantinople. The eruptions of 512 were so severe that those inhabiting the slopes of Vesuvius were granted exemption from taxes by Theodoric the Great, the Gothic king of Italy. Further eruptions were recorded in 787, 968, 991, 999, 1007 and 1036 with the first recorded lava flows. The volcano became quiescent at the end of the 13th century and in the following years it again became covered with gardens and vineyards as of old. Even the inside of the crater was moderately filled with shrubbery.\\r\\nVesuvius entered a new phase in December 1631, when a major eruption buried many villages under lava flows, killing around 3,000 people. Torrents of lahar were also created, adding to the devastation. Activity thereafter became almost continuous, with relatively severe eruptions occurring in 1660, 1682, 1694, 1698, 1707, 1737, 1760, 1767, 1779, 1794, 1822, 1834, 1839, 1850, 1855, 1861, 1868, 1872, 1906, 1926, 1929 and 1944.\\r\\nThe eruption of April 05 in 1906,[56][57] killed more than 100 people and ejected the most lava ever recorded from a Vesuvian eruption. Italian authorities were preparing to hold the 1908 Summer Olympics when Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, devastating the city of Naples and surrounding comunes. Funds were diverted to the reconstruction of Naples, requiring a new location for the Olympics to be found.\\r\\nThe last major eruption was in March 1944. It destroyed the villages of San Sebastiano al Vesuvio, Massa di Somma, Ottaviano, and part of San Giorgio a Cremano.[58] From March 18 to 23, 1944, lava flows appeared within the rim. There were outflows. Small explosions then occurred until the major explosion took place on March 18, 1944.[59]\\r\\nAt the time of the eruption, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 340th Bombardment Group was based at Pompeii Airfield near Terzigno, Italy, just a few kilometres from the eastern base of the volcano. The tephra and hot ash damaged the fabric control surfaces, the engines, the Plexiglas windscreens and the gun turrets of the 340th's B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. Estimates ranged from 78 to 88 aircraft destroyed.[60]\\r\\nThe eruption could be seen from Naples. Different perspectives and the damage caused to the local villages were recorded by USAAF photographers and other personnel based nearer to the volcano.[61]\\r\\nLarge Vesuvian eruptions which emit volcanic material in quantities of about 1 cubic kilometre (0.24?cu?mi), the most recent of which overwhelmed Pompeii and Herculaneum, have happened after periods of inactivity of a few thousand years. Sub-Plinian eruptions producing about 0.1 cubic kilometres (0.024?cu?mi), such as those of 472 and 1631, have been more frequent with a few hundred years between them. Following the 1631 eruption until 1944 every few years saw a comparatively small eruption which emitted 0.001ÿ0.01?km3 of magma. It seems that for Vesuvius, the amount of magma expelled in an eruption increases very roughly linearly with the interval since the previous one, and at a rate of around 0.001 cubic kilometres (0.00024?cu?mi) for each year. This gives an approximate figure of 0.06 cubic kilometres (0.014?cu?mi) for an eruption after 60?years of inactivity.[62]\\r\\nMagma sitting in an underground chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine crystallizing out. The effect is to increase the concentration of dissolved gases (mostly sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption, the huge drop in internal pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous, adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.\\r\\nThe government emergency plan for an eruption therefore assumes that the worst case will be an eruption of similar size and type to the 1631 VEI 4[63] one. In this scenario the slopes of the volcano, extending out to about 7 kilometres (4.3?mi) from the vent, may be exposed to pyroclastic surges sweeping down them, whilst much of the surrounding area could suffer from tephra falls. Because of prevailing winds, towns and cities to the south and east of the volcano are most at risk from this, and it is assumed that tephra accumulation exceeding 100 kilograms per square metre (20?lb/sq?ft) ÿ at which point people are at risk from collapsing roofs ÿ may extend out as far as Avellino to the east or Salerno to the south-east. Towards Naples, to the north west, this tephra fall hazard is assumed to extend barely past the slopes of the volcano.[62] The specific areas actually affected by the ash cloud will depend upon the particular circumstances surrounding the eruption.\\r\\nThe plan assumes between two weeks and 20 days' notice of an eruption and foresees the emergency evacuation of 600,000?people, almost entirely comprising all those living in the zona rossa (\\"red zone\\"), i.e. at greatest risk from pyroclastic flows.[5][64] The evacuation, by trains, ferries, cars, and buses is planned to take about seven days, and the evacuees will mostly be sent to other parts of the country rather than to safe areas in the local Campania region, and may have to stay away for several months. However, the dilemma that would face those implementing the plan is when to start this massive evacuation, since if it is left too late then thousands could be killed, while if it is started too early then the precursors of the eruption may turn out to have been a false alarm. In 1984, 40,000?people were evacuated from the Campi Flegrei area, another volcanic complex near Naples, but no eruption occurred.[64]\\r\\nOngoing efforts are being made by the government at various levels (especially of Campania) to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings[64] and by offering sufficient financial incentives to people for moving away.[65] One of the underlying goals is to reduce the time needed to evacuate the area, over the next 20 or 30?years, to two or three days.[66]\\r\\nThe volcano is closely monitored by the Osservatorio Vesuvio in Naples with extensive networks of seismic and gravimetric stations, a combination of a GPS-based geodetic array and satellite-based synthetic aperture radar to measure ground movement and by local surveys and chemical analyses of gases emitted from fumaroles. All of this is intended to track magma rising underneath the volcano. No magma has been detected within 10?km of the surface, and so the volcano is classified by the Observatory as at a Basic or Green Level.[67]\\r\\nThe area around Vesuvius was officially declared a national park on June 5, 1995.[68] The summit of Vesuvius is open to visitors and there is a small network of paths around the volcano that are maintained by the park authorities on weekends. There is access by road to within 200 metres (660?ft) of the summit (measured vertically), but thereafter access is on foot only. There is a spiral walkway around the volcano from the road to the crater.\\r\\nThe first funicular cable car on Mount Vesuvius opened in 1880. It was later destroyed by the March 1944 eruption. \\"Funicul, Funicul\\", a famous Neapolitan language song with lyrics by journalist Peppino Turco set to music by composer Luigi Denza, commemorates its opening.","input":"When was the last time mt. vesuvius erupted?"},{"output":"Minami-ku, Kyoto","context":"Sagawa Express Co., Ltd.

In British English, the terms cash point, cash machine, minibank (the official name of the Yorkshire bank ATM's) and \\"hole in the wall\\" are most widely used.[6] Other terms include cashline, nibank, tyme machine, cash dispenser, bankomat or bancomat. Many ATMs have a sign above them, indicating the name of the bank or organisation that owns the ATM, and possibly including the networks to which it can connect. In Canada, ABM that are not operated by a financial institution are known as \\"white-label ABMs\\".\\r\\nAccording to the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA),[7] there are now close to 3.5 million ATMs installed worldwide.[8] However, the use of ATMs in Australia is gradually declining ÿ most notably in retail precincts.[9]\\r\\nOn most modern ATMs, customers are identified by inserting a plastic ATM card (or some other acceptable payment card) into the ATM, with authentication being by the customer entering a personal identification number (PIN) which must match the PIN stored in the chip on the card (if the card is so equipped) or in the issuing financial institution's database.\\r\\nUsing an ATM, customers can access their bank deposit or credit accounts in order to make a variety of financial transactions such as cash withdrawals, check balances, or credit mobile phones. ATMs can be used to withdraw cash in a foreign country. If the currency being withdrawn from the ATM is different from that in which the bank account is denominated, the money will be converted at the financial institution's exchange rate.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of out-of-hours cash distribution developed from bankers' needs in Asia (Japan), Europe (Sweden and the United Kingdom) and North America (the United States).[11][12][13] Little is known of the Japanese device other than it was called \\"Computer Loan Machine\\" and supplied cash as a three-month loan at 5% p.a. after inserting a credit card. The device was operational in 1966.[14][15]\\r\\nAdrian Ashfield invented the basic idea of a card combining the key and user's identity in February 1962. This was granted UK Patent 959,713 for \\"Access Controller\\" in June 1964 and assigned to W. S. Atkins & Partners who employed Ashfield. He was paid ten shillings for this, the standard sum for all patents. It was originally intended to dispense petrol but the patent covered all uses.\\r\\nIn the US patent record, Luther George Simjian has been credited with developing a \\"prior art device\\". Specifically his 132nd patent (US3079603), which was first filed on 30 June 1960 (and granted 26 February 1963). The roll-out of this machine, called Bankograph, was delayed by a couple of years, due in part to Simjian's Reflectone Electronics Inc. being acquired by Universal Match Corporation.[16] An experimental Bankograph was installed in New York City in 1961 by the City Bank of New York, but removed after six months due to the lack of customer acceptance. The Bankograph was an automated envelope deposit machine (accepting coins, cash and cheques) and did not have cash dispensing features.[17][18]\\r\\nIt is widely accepted that the first cash machine was put into use by Barclays Bank in its Enfield Town branch in North London, United Kingdom, on 27 June 1967.[19] This machine was inaugurated by English comedy actor Reg Varney.[20] This instance of the invention is credited to the engineering team led by John Shepherd-Barron of printing firm De La Rue,[21] who was awarded an OBE in the 2005 New Year Honours.[22][23] Transactions were initiated by inserting paper cheques issued by a teller or cashier, marked with carbon-14 for machine readability and security, which in a later model were matched with a six-digit personal identification number (PIN).[21][24] Shepherd-Barron stated; \\"It struck me there must be a way I could get my own money, anywhere in the world or the UK. I hit upon the idea of a chocolate bar dispenser, but replacing chocolate with cash.\\"[21]\\r\\nThe BarclaysÿDe La Rue machine (called De La Rue Automatic Cash System or DACS)[25] beat the Swedish saving banks' and a company called Metior's machine (a device called Bankomat) by a mere nine days and Westminster Bank'sÿSmith IndustriesÿChubb system (called Chubb MD2) by a month.[26] The online version of the Swedish machine is listed to have been operational on 6 May 1968, while claiming to be the first online ATM in the world (ahead of a similar claim by IBM and Lloyds Bank in 1971).[27] The collaboration of a small start-up called Speytec and Midland Bank developed a fourth machine which was marketed after 1969 in Europe and the US by the Burroughs Corporation. The patent for this device (GB1329964) was filed in September 1969 (and granted in 1973) by John David Edwards, Leonard Perkins, John Henry Donald, Peter Lee Chappell, Sean Benjamin Newcombe & Malcom David Roe.\\r\\nBoth the DACS and MD2 accepted only a single-use token or voucher which was retained by the machine, while the Speytec worked with a card with a magnetic stripe at the back. They used principles including Carbon-14 and low-coercivity magnetism in order to make fraud more difficult.\\r\\nThe idea of a PIN stored on the card was developed by a group of engineers working at Smiths Group on the Chubb MD2 in 1965 and which has been credited to James Goodfellow[28] (patent GB1197183 filed on 2 May 1966 with Anthony Davies). The essence of this system was that it enabled the verification of the customer with the debited account without human intervention. This patent is also the earliest instance of a complete \\"currency dispenser system\\" in the patent record. This patent was filed on 5 March 1968 in the US (US 3543904) and granted on 1 December 1970. It had a profound influence on the industry as a whole. Not only did future entrants into the cash dispenser market such as NCR Corporation and IBM licence Goodfellow's PIN system, but a number of later patents reference this patent as \\"Prior Art Device\\".[29]\\r\\nDevices designed by British (i.e. Chubb, De La Rue) and Swedish (i.e. Asea Meteor) quickly spread out. For example, given its link with Barclays, Bank of Scotland deployed a DACS in 1968 under the 'Scotcash' brand. Customers were given personal code numbers to activate the machines, similar to the modern PIN. They were also supplied with S10 vouchers. These were fed into the machine, and the corresponding amount debited from the customer's account.\\r\\nA Chubb-made ATM appeared in Sydney in 1969. This was the first ATM installed in Australia. The machine only dispensed $25 at a time and the bank card itself would be mailed to the user after the bank had processed the withdrawal.\\r\\nAsea Metior's Bankomat was the first ATM installed in Spain on January 9, 1969 in downtown Madrid by Banesto. This device dispensed 1,000 peseta bills (1 to 5 max). Each user had to introduce a security personal key using a combination of the ten numeric buttons.[30] In March of the same year an ad with the instructions to use the Bancomat was published in the same newspaper.[31]\\r\\nAfter looking firsthand at the experiences in Europe, in 1968 the ATM was pioneered in the U.S. by Donald Wetzel, who was a department head at a company called Docutel.[23] Docutel was a subsidiary of Recognition Equipment Inc of Dallas, Texas, which was producing optical scanning equipment and had instructed Docutel to explore automated baggage handling and automated gasoline pumps.[32] In 1969, a venture capital consortium purchased Docutel with the aim of bringing its ATM to market without delay. By 1974, Docutel had acquired 70 percent of the U.S. market; but as a result of the early 1970s worldwide recession and its reliance on a single product line, Docutel lost its independence and was forced to merge with the U.S. subsidiary of Olivetti.\\r\\nWetzel was recognised by the United States Patent Office as having invented the ATM in the form of U.S. Patent # 3,761,682; the application had been filed in October 1971 and the patent was granted in 1973. However, the U.S. patent record cites at least three previous applications from Docutel, all relevant to the development of the ATM and where Wetzel does not figure, namely US Patent # 3,662,343, U.S. Patent # 3651976 and U.S. Patent # 3,68,569. These patents are all credited to Kenneth S. Goldstein, MR Karecki, TR Barnes, GR Chastian and John D. White.\\r\\nOn September 2, 1969, Chemical Bank installed the first ATM in the U.S. at its branch in Rockville Centre, New York. The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card.[33] A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted \\"On Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again.\\"[34] Chemical's ATM, initially known as a Docuteller was designed by Donald Wetzel and his company Docutel. Chemical executives were initially hesitant about the electronic banking transition given the high cost of the early machines. Additionally, executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money.[35] In 1995, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History recognised Docutel and Wetzel as the inventors of the networked ATM.[36]\\r\\nThe first modern ATM was an IBM 2984 and came into use at Lloyds Bank, High Street, Brentwood, Essex, UK in December 1972. The IBM 2984 was designed at the request of Lloyds Bank. The 2984 Cash Issuing Terminal was the first true ATM, similar in function to today's machines and named by Lloyds Bank: Cashpoint. Cashpoint is still a registered trademark of Lloyds Banking Group in the UK, but is often used as a generic trademark to refer to ATMs of all UK banks. All were online and issued a variable amount which was immediately deducted from the account. A small number of 2984s were supplied to a U.S. bank. A couple of well known historical models of ATMs include the IBM 3614, IBM 3624 and 473x series, Diebold 10xx and TABS 9000 series, NCR 1780 and earlier NCR 770 series.\\r\\nThe first switching system to enable shared automated teller machines between banks went into production operation on February 3, 1979 in Denver, Colorado, in an effort by Colorado National Bank of Denver and Kranzley and Company of Cherry Hill, New Jersey.[37]\\r\\nThe newest ATM at Royal Bank of Scotland allows customers to withdraw cash up to S100 without a card by inputting a six-digit code requested through their smartphones.[38]\\r\\nATMs can be placed at any location but are most often placed near or inside banks, shopping centers/malls, airports, railway stations, metro stations, grocery stores, petrol/gas stations, restaurants, and other locations. ATMs are also found on cruise ships and on some US Navy ships, where sailors can draw out their pay.[39]\\r\\nATMs may be on- and off-premises. On-premises ATMs are typically more advanced, multi-function machines that complement a bank branch's capabilities, and are thus more expensive. Off-premises machines are deployed by financial institutions and Independent Sales Organisations (ISOs) where there is a simple need for cash, so they are generally cheaper single function devices.\\r\\nIn the US, Canada and some Gulf countries, banks may have drive-thru lanes providing access to ATMs using an automobile.\\r\\nIn recent times, countries like India and some countries in Africa are installing ATMs in rural areas, which are solar powered.[40]\\r\\nMost ATMs are connected to interbank networks, enabling people to withdraw and deposit money from machines not belonging to the bank where they have their accounts or in the countries where their accounts are held (enabling cash withdrawals in local currency). Some examples of interbank networks include NYCE, PULSE, PLUS, Cirrus, AFFN, Interac, Interswitch, STAR, LINK, MegaLink and BancNet.\\r\\nATMs rely on authorization of a financial transaction by the card issuer or other authorizing institution on a communications network. This is often performed through an ISO 8583 messaging system.\\r\\nMany banks charge ATM usage fees. In some cases, these fees are charged solely to users who are not customers of the bank where the ATM is installed; in other cases, they apply to all users.\\r\\nIn order to allow a more diverse range of devices to attach to their networks, some interbank networks have passed rules expanding the definition of an ATM to be a terminal that either has the vault within its footprint or utilises the vault or cash drawer within the merchant establishment, which allows for the use of a scrip cash dispenser.\\r\\nATMs typically connect directly to their host or ATM Controller on either ADSL or dial-up modem over a telephone line or directly on a leased line. Leased lines are preferable to plain old telephone service (POTS) lines because they require less time to establish a connection. Less-trafficked machines will usually rely on a dial-up modem on a POTS line rather than using a leased line, since a leased line may be comparatively more expensive to operate compared to a POTS line. That dilemma may be solved as high-speed Internet VPN connections become more ubiquitous. Common lower-level layer communication protocols used by ATMs to communicate back to the bank include SNA over SDLC, TC500 over Async, X.25, and TCP/IP over Ethernet.\\r\\nIn addition to methods employed for transaction security and secrecy, all communications traffic between the ATM and the Transaction Processor may also be encrypted using methods such as SSL.[41]\\r\\nThere are no hard international or government-compiled numbers totaling the complete number of ATMs in use worldwide. Estimates developed by ATMIA place the number of ATMs currently in use at 3 million units, or approximately 1 ATM per 3000 people in the world.[42][43]\\r\\nTo simplify the analysis of ATM usage around the world, financial institutions generally divide the world into seven regions, due to the penetration rates, usage statistics, and features deployed. Four regions (USA, Canada, Europe, and Japan) have high numbers of ATMs per million people.[44][45] Despite the large number of ATMs, there is additional demand for machines in the Asia/Pacific area as well as in Latin America.[46][47] Macau may have the highest density of ATMs at 254 ATMs per 100,000 adults.[48] ATMs have yet to reach high numbers in the Near East and Africa.[49]\\r\\nThe world's highest ATM is located at the Khunjerab Pass in Pakistan. Installed at an elevation of 15,397 feet by the National Bank of Pakistan, it is designed to work in temperatures of up to -40 degree Celsius.[50]\\r\\nAn ATM is typically made up of the following devices:\\r\\nDue to heavier computing demands and the falling price of personal computerÿlike architectures, ATMs have moved away from custom hardware architectures using microcontrollers or application-specific integrated circuits and have adopted the hardware architecture of a personal computer, such as USB connections for peripherals, Ethernet and IP communications, and use personal computer operating systems.\\r\\nBusiness owners often lease ATMs from service providers. However, based on the economies of scale, the price of equipment has dropped to the point where many business owners are simply paying for ATMs using a credit card.\\r\\nNew ADA voice and text-to-speech guidelines imposed in 2010, but required by March 2012[51] have forced many ATM owners to either upgrade non-compliant machines or dispose them if they are not upgradable, and purchase new compliant equipment. This has created an avenue for hackers and thieves to obtain ATM hardware at junkyards from improperly disposed decommissioned machines.[52]\\r\\nThe vault of an ATM is within the footprint of the device itself and is where items of value are kept. Scrip cash dispensers do not incorporate a vault.\\r\\nMechanisms found inside the vault may include:\\r\\nATM vaults are supplied by manufacturers in several grades. Factors influencing vault grade selection include cost, weight, regulatory requirements, ATM type, operator risk avoidance practices and internal volume requirements.[53] Industry standard vault configurations include Underwriters Laboratories UL-291 \\"Business Hours\\" and Level 1 Safes,[54] RAL TL-30 derivatives,[55] and CEN EN 1143-1 - CEN III and CEN IV.[56][57]\\r\\nATM manufacturers recommend that a vault be attached to the floor to prevent theft,[58] though there is a record of a theft conducted by tunnelling into an ATM floor.[59]\\r\\nWith the migration to commodity Personal Computer hardware, standard commercial \\"off-the-shelf\\" operating systems and programming environments can be used inside of ATMs. Typical platforms previously used in ATM development include RMX or OS/2.\\r\\nToday, the vast majority of ATMs worldwide use a Microsoft Windows operating system, primarily Windows XP Professional or Windows XP Embedded.[citation needed][needs update] In early 2014, 95% of ATMs were running Windows XP.[60] A small number of deployments may still be running older versions of the Windows OS, such as Windows NT, Windows CE, or Windows 2000.\\r\\nThere is a computer industry security view that general public desktop operating systems(os) have greater risks as operating systems for cash dispensing machines than other types of operating systems like (secure) real-time operating systems (RTOS). RISKS Digest has many articles about ATM operating system vulnerabilities.[61]\\r\\nLinux is also finding some reception in the ATM marketplace. An example of this is Banrisul, the largest bank in the south of Brazil, which has replaced the MS-DOS operating systems in its ATMs with Linux. Banco do Brasil is also migrating ATMs to Linux. Indian-based Vortex Engineering is manufacturing ATMs which operate only with Linux. Common application layer transaction protocols, such as Diebold 91x (911 or 912) and NCR NDC or NDC+ provide emulation of older generations of hardware on newer platforms with incremental extensions made over time to address new capabilities, although companies like NCR continuously improve these protocols issuing newer versions (e.g. NCR's AANDC v3.x.y, where x.y are subversions). Most major ATM manufacturers provide software packages that implement these protocols. Newer protocols such as IFX have yet to find wide acceptance by transaction processors.[62]\\r\\nWith the move to a more standardised software base, financial institutions have been increasingly interested in the ability to pick and choose the application programs that drive their equipment. WOSA/XFS, now known as CEN XFS (or simply XFS), provides a common API for accessing and manipulating the various devices of an ATM. J/XFS is a Java implementation of the CEN XFS API.\\r\\nWhile the perceived benefit of XFS is similar to the Java's \\"Write once, run anywhere\\" mantra, often different ATM hardware vendors have different interpretations of the XFS standard. The result of these differences in interpretation means that ATM applications typically use a middleware to even out the differences among various platforms.\\r\\nWith the onset of Windows operating systems and XFS on ATMs, the software applications have the ability to become more intelligent. This has created a new breed of ATM applications commonly referred to as programmable applications. These types of applications allows for an entirely new host of applications in which the ATM terminal can do more than only communicate with the ATM switch. It is now empowered to connected to other content servers and video banking systems.\\r\\nNotable ATM software that operates on XFS platforms include Triton PRISM, Diebold Agilis EmPower, NCR APTRA Edge, Absolute Systems AbsoluteINTERACT, KAL Kalignite Software Platform, Phoenix Interactive VISTAatm, Wincor Nixdorf ProTopas, Euronet EFTS and Intertech inter-ATM.\\r\\nWith the move of ATMs to industry-standard computing environments, concern has risen about the integrity of the ATM's software stack.[63]\\r\\nSecurity, as it relates to ATMs, has several dimensions. ATMs also provide a practical demonstration of a number of security systems and concepts operating together and how various security concerns are addressed.\\r\\nEarly ATM security focused on making the terminals invulnerable to physical attack; they were effectively safes with dispenser mechanisms. A number of attacks resulted, with thieves attempting to steal entire machines by ram-raiding.[64] Since the late 1990s, criminal groups operating in Japan improved ram-raiding by stealing and using a truck loaded with heavy construction machinery to effectively demolish or uproot an entire ATM and any housing to steal its cash.\\r\\nAnother attack method, plofkraak, is to seal all openings of the ATM with silicone and fill the vault with a combustible gas or to place an explosive inside, attached, or near the machine. This gas or explosive is ignited and the vault is opened or distorted by the force of the resulting explosion and the criminals can break in.[65] This type of theft has occurred in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Denmark, Germany and Australia.[66][67] These types of attacks can be prevented by a number of gas explosion prevention devices also known as gas suppression system. These systems use explosive gas detection sensor to detect explosive gas and to neutralise it by releasing a special explosion suppression chemical which changes the composition of the explosive gas and renders it ineffective.\\r\\nSeveral attacks in the UK (at least one of which was successful) have involved digging a concealed tunnel under the ATM and cutting through the reinforced base to remove the money.[59]\\r\\nModern ATM physical security, per other modern money-handling security, concentrates on denying the use of the money inside the machine to a thief, by using different types of Intelligent Banknote Neutralisation Systems.\\r\\nA common method is to simply rob the staff filling the machine with money. To avoid this, the schedule for filling them is kept secret, varying and random. The money is often kept in cassettes, which will dye the money if incorrectly opened.\\r\\nThe security of ATM transactions relies mostly on the integrity of the secure cryptoprocessor: the ATM often uses general commodity components that sometimes are not considered to be \\"trusted systems\\".\\r\\nEncryption of personal information, required by law in many jurisdictions, is used to prevent fraud. Sensitive data in ATM transactions are usually encrypted with DES, but transaction processors now usually require the use of Triple DES.[68] Remote Key Loading techniques may be used to ensure the secrecy of the initialisation of the encryption keys in the ATM. Message Authentication Code (MAC) or Partial MAC may also be used to ensure messages have not been tampered with while in transit between the ATM and the financial network.\\r\\nThere have also been a number of incidents of fraud by Man-in-the-middle attacks, where criminals have attached fake keypads or card readers to existing machines. These have then been used to record customers' PINs and bank card information in order to gain unauthorised access to their accounts. Various ATM manufacturers have put in place countermeasures to protect the equipment they manufacture from these threats.[69][70]\\r\\nAlternative methods to verify cardholder identities have been tested and deployed in some countries, such as finger and palm vein patterns,[71] iris, and facial recognition technologies. Cheaper mass-produced equipment has been developed and is being installed in machines globally that detect the presence of foreign objects on the front of ATMs, current tests have shown 99% detection success for all types of skimming devices.[72]\\r\\nOpenings on the customer side of ATMs are often covered by mechanical shutters to prevent tampering with the mechanisms when they are not in use. Alarm sensors are placed inside ATMs and their servicing areas to alert their operators when doors have been opened by unauthorised personnel.\\r\\nTo protect against hackers, ATMs have a built-in firewall. Once the firewall has detected malicious attempts to break into the machine remotely, the firewall locks down the machine.\\r\\nRules are usually set by the government or ATM operating body that dictate what happens when integrity systems fail. Depending on the jurisdiction, a bank may or may not be liable when an attempt is made to dispense a customer's money from an ATM and the money either gets outside of the ATM's vault, or was exposed in a non-secure fashion, or they are unable to determine the state of the money after a failed transaction.[73] Customers often commented that it is difficult to recover money lost in this way, but this is often complicated by the policies regarding suspicious activities typical of the criminal element.[74]\\r\\nIn some countries, multiple security cameras and security guards are a common feature.[75] In the United States, The New York State Comptroller's Office has advised the New York State Department of Banking to have more thorough safety inspections of ATMs in high crime areas.[76]\\r\\nConsultants of ATM operators assert that the issue of customer security should have more focus by the banking industry;[77] it has been suggested that efforts are now more concentrated on the preventive measure of deterrent legislation than on the problem of ongoing forced withdrawals.[78]\\r\\nAt least as far back as July 30, 1986, consultants of the industry have advised for the adoption of an emergency PIN system for ATMs, where the user is able to send a silent alarm in response to a threat.[79] Legislative efforts to require an emergency PIN system have appeared in Illinois,[80] Kansas[81] and Georgia,[82] but none have succeeded yet. In January 2009, Senate Bill 1355 was proposed in the Illinois Senate that revisits the issue of the reverse emergency PIN system.[83] The bill is again supported by the police and denied by the banking lobby.[84]\\r\\nIn 1998, three towns outside Cleveland, Ohio, in response to an ATM crime wave, adopted legislation requiring that an emergency telephone number switch be installed at all outdoor ATMs within their jurisdiction. In the wake of a homicide in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, the city council passed an ATM security bill as well.\\r\\nIn China and elsewhere, many efforts to promote security have been made. On-premises ATMs are often located inside the bank's lobby, which may be accessible 24 hours a day. These lobbies have extensive security camera coverage, a courtesy telephone for consulting with the bank staff, and a security guard on the premises. Bank lobbies that are not guarded 24 hours a day may also have secure doors that can only be opened from outside by swiping the bank card against a wall-mounted scanner, allowing the bank to identify which card enters the building. Most ATMs will also display on-screen safety warnings and may also be fitted with convex mirrors above the display allowing the user to see what is happening behind them.\\r\\nAs of 2013, the only claim available about the extent of ATM-connected homicides is that they range from 500 to 1,000 per year in the US, covering only cases where the victim had an ATM card and the card was used by the killer after the known time of death.[85]\\r\\nThe term jackpotting is used to describe one method criminals utilize to steal money from an ATM. The thieves gain physical access through a small hole drilled in the machine. They disconnect the existing hard drive and connect an external drive using an industrial endoscope. They then depress an internal button that reboots the device so that it is now under the control of the external drive. They can then have the ATM dispense all of its cash.[86]\\r\\nATMs were originally developed as cash dispensers, and have evolved to provide many other bank-related functions:\\r\\nIn some countries, especially those which benefit from a fully integrated cross-bank network (e.g.: Multibanco in Portugal), ATMs include many functions that are not directly related to the management of one's own bank account, such as:\\r\\nIncreasingly, banks are seeking to use the ATM as a sales device to deliver pre approved loans and targeted advertising using products such as ITM (the Intelligent Teller Machine) from Aptra Relate from NCR.[91] ATMs can also act as an advertising channel for other companies.[92]*\\r\\nHowever, several different ATM technologies have not yet reached worldwide acceptance, such as:\\r\\nVideoconferencing teller machines are currently referred to as Interactive Teller Machines. Benton Smith, in the Idaho Business Review writes \\"The software that allows interactive teller machines to function was created by a Salt Lake City-based company called uGenius, a producer of video banking software. NCR, a leading manufacturer of ATMs, acquired uGenius in 2013 and married its own ATM hardware with uGenius' video software.\\" [103]\\r\\nBefore an ATM is placed in a public place, it typically has undergone extensive testing with both test money and the backend computer systems that allow it to perform transactions. Banking customers also have come to expect high reliability in their ATMs,[104] which provides incentives to ATM providers to minimise machine and network failures. Financial consequences of incorrect machine operation also provide high degrees of incentive to minimise malfunctions.[105]\\r\\nATMs and the supporting electronic financial networks are generally very reliable, with industry benchmarks typically producing 98.25% customer availability for ATMs[106] and up to 99.999% availability for host systems that manage the networks of ATMs. If ATM networks do go out of service, customers could be left without the ability to make transactions until the beginning of their bank's next time of opening hours.\\r\\nThis said, not all errors are to the detriment of customers; there have been cases of machines giving out money without debiting the account, or giving out higher value notes as a result of incorrect denomination of banknote being loaded in the money cassettes.[107] The result of receiving too much money may be influenced by the card holder agreement in place between the customer and the bank.[108][109]\\r\\nErrors that can occur may be mechanical (such as card transport mechanisms; keypads; hard disk failures; envelope deposit mechanisms); software (such as operating system; device driver; application); communications; or purely down to operator error.\\r\\nTo aid in reliability, some ATMs print each transaction to a roll-paper journal that is stored inside the ATM, which allows its users and the related financial institutions to settle things based on the records in the journal in case there is a dispute. In some cases, transactions are posted to an electronic journal to remove the cost of supplying journal paper to the ATM and for more convenient searching of data.\\r\\nImproper money checking can cause the possibility of a customer receiving counterfeit banknotes from an ATM. While bank personnel are generally trained better at spotting and removing counterfeit cash,[110][111] the resulting ATM money supplies used by banks provide no guarantee for proper banknotes, as the Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany has confirmed that there are regularly incidents of false banknotes having been dispensed through ATMs.[112] Some ATMs may be stocked and wholly owned by outside companies, which can further complicate this problem. Bill validation technology can be used by ATM providers to help ensure the authenticity of the cash before it is stocked in the machine; those with cash recycling capabilities include this capability.[113]\\r\\nIn India, whenever a transaction fails at an ATM machine due to network or technical issue and if the amount does not get dispensed in spite of account being debited then the banks are supposed to return back the debited amount to the customer within 7 working days from the day of receipt of complaint. Banks are also liable to pay the late fees in case of delay in repayment of funds post 7 days.[114]\\r\\nAs with any device containing objects of value, ATMs and the systems they depend on to function are the targets of fraud. Fraud against ATMs and people's attempts to use them takes several forms.\\r\\nThe first known instance of a fake ATM was installed at a shopping mall in Manchester, Connecticut in 1993. By modifying the inner workings of a Fujitsu model 7020 ATM, a criminal gang known as the Bucklands Boys stole information from cards inserted into the machine by customers.[115]\\r\\nWAVY-TV reported an incident in Virginia Beach in September 2006 where a hacker, who had probably obtained a factory-default administrator password for a filling station's white-label ATM, caused the unit to assume it was loaded with US$5 bills instead of $20s, enabling himselfand many subsequent customersto walk away with four times the money withdrawn from their accounts.[116] This type of scam was featured on the TV series The Real Hustle.\\r\\nATM behaviour can change during what is called \\"stand-in\\" time, where the bank's cash dispensing network is unable to access databases that contain account information (possibly for database maintenance). In order to give customers access to cash, customers may be allowed to withdraw cash up to a certain amount that may be less than their usual daily withdrawal limit, but may still exceed the amount of available money in their accounts, which could result in fraud if the customers intentionally withdraw more money than what they had in their accounts.[117]\\r\\nIn an attempt to prevent criminals from shoulder surfing the customer's personal identification number (PIN), some banks draw privacy areas on the floor.\\r\\nFor a low-tech form of fraud, the easiest is to simply steal a customer's card along with its PIN. A later variant of this approach is to trap the card inside of the ATM's card reader with a device often referred to as a Lebanese loop. When the customer gets frustrated by not getting the card back and walks away from the machine, the criminal is able to remove the card and withdraw cash from the customer's account, using the card and its PIN.\\r\\nThis type of fraud has spread globally. Although somewhat replaced in terms of volume by skimming incidents, a re-emergence of card trapping has been noticed in regions such as Europe, where EMV chip and PIN cards have increased in circulation.[118]\\r\\nAnother simple form of fraud involves attempting to get the customer's bank to issue a new card and its PIN and stealing them from their mail.[119]\\r\\nBy contrast, a newer high-tech method of operating, sometimes called card skimming or card cloning, involves the installation of a magnetic card reader over the real ATM's card slot and the use of a wireless surveillance camera or a modified digital camera or a false PIN keypad to observe the user's PIN. Card data is then cloned into a duplicate card and the criminal attempts a standard cash withdrawal. The availability of low-cost commodity wireless cameras, keypads, card readers, and card writers has made it a relatively simple form of fraud, with comparatively low risk to the fraudsters.[120]\\r\\nIn an attempt to stop these practices, countermeasures against card cloning have been developed by the banking industry, in particular by the use of smart cards which cannot easily be copied or spoofed by unauthenticated devices, and by attempting to make the outside of their ATMs tamper evident. Older chip-card security systems include the French Carte Bleue, Visa Cash, Mondex, Blue from American Express[121] and EMV '96 or EMV 3.11. The most actively developed form of smart card security in the industry today is known as EMV 2000 or EMV 4.x.\\r\\nEMV is widely used in the UK (Chip and PIN) and other parts of Europe, but when it is not available in a specific area, ATMs must fall back to using the easyÿtoÿcopy magnetic stripe to perform transactions. This fallback behaviour can be exploited.[122] However, the fallback option has been removed on the ATMs of some UK banks, meaning if the chip is not read, the transaction will be declined.\\r\\nCard cloning and skimming can be detected by the implementation of magnetic card reader heads and firmware that can read a signature embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process. This signature, known as a \\"MagnePrint\\" or \\"BluPrint\\", can be used in conjunction with common two-factor authentication schemes used in ATM, debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.\\r\\nThe concept and various methods of copying the contents of an ATM card's magnetic stripe onto a duplicate card to access other people's financial information was well known in the hacking communities by late 1990.[123]\\r\\nIn 1996, Andrew Stone, a computer security consultant from Hampshire in the UK, was convicted of stealing more than S1?million by pointing high-definition video cameras at ATMs from a considerable distance and recording the card numbers, expiry dates, etc. from the embossed detail on the ATM cards along with video footage of the PINs being entered. After getting all the information from the videotapes, he was able to produce clone cards which not only allowed him to withdraw the full daily limit for each account, but also allowed him to sidestep withdrawal limits by using multiple copied cards. In court, it was shown that he could withdraw as much as S10,000 per hour by using this method. Stone was sentenced to five years and six months in prison.[124]\\r\\nA talking ATM is a type of ATM that provides audible instructions so that people who cannot read a screen can independently use the machine, therefore effectively eliminating the need for assistance from an external, potentially malevolent source. All audible information is delivered privately through a standard headphone jack on the face of the machine. Alternatively, some banks such as the Nordea and Swedbank use a built-in external speaker which may be invoked by pressing the talk button on the keypad.[125] Information is delivered to the customer either through pre-recorded sound files or via text-to-speech speech synthesis.\\r\\nA postal interactive kiosk may share many components of an ATM (including a vault), but it only dispenses items related to postage.[126][127]\\r\\nA scrip cash dispenser may have many components in common with an ATM, but it lacks the ability to dispense physical cash and consequently requires no vault. Instead, the customer requests a withdrawal transaction from the machine, which prints a receipt. The customer then takes this receipt to a nearby sales clerk, who then exchanges it for cash from the till.[128]\\r\\nA teller assist unit (TAU) is distinct in that it is designed to be operated solely by trained personnel and not by the general public, does integrate directly into interbank networks, and usually is controlled by a computer that is not directly integrated into the overall construction of the unit.\\r\\nA Web ATM is an online interface for ATM card banking that uses a smart card reader. All the usual ATM functions are available, except for withdrawing cash. Most banks in Taiwan provide these online services.[129][130]","input":"When was the first atm installed in uk?"},{"output":"Wind power","context":"Wind power in Indiana was limited to a few small water-pumping windmills on farms until 2008 with construction of Indiana's first utility-scale wind power facility, Goodland (phase I) with a nameplate capacity of 130 MW. As of January 2016, Indiana had a total of 1895 MW of wind power capacity installed, ranking it 12th among U.S. states.[1]\\r\\nThe main utility-scale development up to 2016 has been in the northwest part of the state in Benton, White, and Jasper Counties. Fowler Ridge phase III should be completed later in 2010, to give a final nameplate capacity of 750 MW, making Fowler Ridge the Midwest's largest wind farm, and one of the largest in the world.

In May 2017, Miller and HBO jointly announced that Miller will not be returning for the 5th season of Silicon Valley.[23][24][25]\\r\\nAs a commercial actor, he voices a talking ball of mucus in commercials for Mucinex[18] and stars as Greg the Genie in a promotional campaign for Slim Jim meat snacks.[26]\\r\\nIn Miller's film debut, Cloverfield, he appeared onscreen for only a few minutes, but his voice was heard in almost every scene as the character who videotaped most of the events depicted. In 2009, he played Cessna Jim in The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard and the dim-witted grindcore musician Rory in Mike Judge's comedy Extract. In 2010, he co-starred in She's Out of My League as Stainer, played Brian the Concierge in Get Him to the Greek and appeared in a supporting role in the film Unstoppable.[4]\\r\\nHe voiced the character Tuffnut in the Oscar-nominated animated films How to Train Your Dragon and How to Train Your Dragon 2. He also played Dan in Gulliver's Travels, released in December 2010. He played the supporting character of Ranger Jones in the live-action/animated Yogi Bear 2010 film.[27]\\r\\nUnlike his character on the cartoon show, he is \\"dumb-but-not-in-a-funny-way\\", according to the Buffalo News.[28] He was cast in the part after two auditions; as a joke, he sent Warner Bros. an improvised video audition with an actual bear, though he had already been offered the part before they received it.[29]\\r\\nIn 2011, he appeared in the film Our Idiot Brother. He had a cameo as administrative personnel for Rolling Stone in the 2012 film Rock of Ages. He starred in the 2016 movie Search Party alongside Adam Pally.[30]\\r\\nIn 2014, he appeared in Transformers: Age of Extinction.[31]\\r\\nIn November 2014, he was the voice of Fred in the superhero CGI film Big Hero 6. Miller portrayed Weasel in Deadpool. In 2017, he portrayed the voice of the main protagonist Gene, a meh emoji with different expressions, in the animated The Emoji Movie.[32]\\r\\nOn September 12, 2011, Miller released a comedy rap concept album titled The Extended Play E.P. The album features comedians Bo Burnham, Doug Benson, Pete Holmes and hip-hop artists Ugly Duckling and Johnny Polygon.[33]\\r\\nIn 2012, Miller released The Extended Play E.P. Illegal Art Remix Tape.[34] Also in 2012, Miller released Mash Up Audiofile on Comedy Central Records to mixed reviews.[35]\\r\\nMiller started appearing on Chicago-based comedy Podcast Red Bar Radio in 2006 as a semi-regular co-host.

He stated that he became more philosophical, narrated his behaviors, and was unable to sleep while filming Yogi Bear in New Zealand in 2010. His brain surgery was successful, though there was a 10 percent risk of fatality.[18][40]\\r\\nOn December 9, 2016, Miller was arrested and jailed in Los Angeles for allegedly assaulting a driver of the Uber car service company because of an argument he had with the driver over Donald Trump. He was released on his own recognizance after bail was set at $20,000.[41][42]\\r\\nIn 2015, Thomas Middleditch stated he and Miller were atheists.[43]\\r\\nIn late 2017 allegations against Miller from his college days back in 2001 resurfaced, part of a growing movement of people coming forward with sexual abuse claims about Harvey Weinstein and other Hollywood insiders. An anonymous woman who attended George Washington University with Miller and his wife Kate told The Daily Beast reporter Asawin Suebsaeng that Miller became violent with her during a sexual encounter; he allegedly choked, shook, and punched her in the mouth, all without her consent. Suebsaeng additionally reached out to witnesses and people involved with the case, who corroborated the accuser's story, adding that it was brought to the attention of the college at the time. Student conduct proceedings were held, the results of which are sealed, although it has been claimed that, despite Miller having graduated by that time, he was expelled as a form of appeasement to the accuser.[44]\\r\\nThe Millers responded to the allegations, characterizing the accuser as a vindictive former colleague in a campus comedy troupe who was asked to leave due to inappropriate behavior. The statement said that \\"[s]adly she is now using the current climate to bandwagon and launch these false accusations again\\", and also stated that her accusation \\"undermines the important movement to make women feel safe coming forward about legitimate claims against real known predators\\".[45]","input":"Where did tj miller go to high school?"},{"output":"Kazakhstan","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area, variously classed as the world's largest lake or a full-fledged sea.[3][4] It is an endorheic basin (a basin without outflows) located between Europe and Asia.[5] It is bounded by Kazakhstan to the northeast, Russia to the northwest, Azerbaijan to the west, Iran to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southeast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Caspian Sea presently lies about 28?m (92?ft) below sea level in the Caspian Depression, to the east of the Caucasus Mountains and to the west of the vast steppe of Central Asia. The sea bed in the southern part reaches as low as 1,023?m (3,356?ft) below sea level, which is the second lowest natural depression on earth after Lake Baikal (?1,180?m, ?3,871?ft). The ancient inhabitants of its coast perceived the Caspian Sea as an ocean, probably because of its saltiness and large size.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sea has a surface area of 371,000?km2 (143,200?sq?mi) (not including the detached lagoon of Garabogazk?l) and a volume of 78,200?km3 (18,800?cu?mi).[6] It has a salinity of approximately 1.2% (12 g/l),[7] about a third of the salinity of most seawater.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word Caspian is derived from the name of the Caspi, an ancient people who lived to the southwest of the sea in Transcaucasia.[8] Strabo wrote that \\"to the country of the Albanians belongs also the territory called Caspiane, which was named after the Caspian tribe, as was also the sea; but the tribe has now disappeared\\".[9] Moreover, the Caspian Gates, which is the name of a region in  Iran's Tehran province, possibly indicates that they migrated to the south of the sea. The Iranian city of Qazvin shares the root of its name with that of the sea. In fact, the traditional Arabic name for the sea itself is Ba?r al-Qazwin (Sea of Qazvin).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn classical antiquity among Greeks and Persians it was called the Hyrcanian Ocean.[11] In Persian antiquity, as well as in modern Iran, it is known as ????? ???, Dary-e Khazar; it is also sometimes referred to as Mazandaran Sea (Persian: ????? ?????????) in Iran.[12] Ancient Arabic sources refer to it as Ba?r Gؐln (??? ?????) meaning \\"the Gilan Sea\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkic languages refer to the lake as Khazar Sea. In Turkmen, the name is Hazar deizi, in Azeri, it is X?z?r d?nizi, and in modern Turkish, it is Hazar denizi. In all these cases, the second word simply means \\"sea\\", and the first word refers to the historical Khazars who had a large empire based to the north of the Caspian Sea between the 7th and 10th centuries. An exception is Kazakh, where it is called Ťҳ ҿ???, Kaspiy te?izi (Caspian Sea).\\r\\n\\r\\nRenaissance European maps labelled it as Abbacuch Sea (Oronce Fine's 1531 world map), Mar de Bachu (Ortellius' 1570 map), or Mar de Sala (Mercator's 1569 map).\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Russian sources call it the Khvalyn or Khvalis Sea (־ַ󿹾 ѿ / ־Ҷ󿹾 ѿ) after the name of Khwarezmia.[13] In modern Russian, it is called Ť?󿹾 ?ѿ, Kaspiyskoye more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Caspian Sea, like the Black Sea, Namak Lake, and Lake Urmia, is a remnant of the ancient Paratethys Sea. It became landlocked about 5.5 million years ago due to tectonic uplift and a fall in sea level. During warm and dry climatic periods, the landlocked sea almost dried up, depositing evaporitic sediments like halite that were covered by wind-blown deposits and were sealed off as an evaporite sink when cool, wet climates refilled the basin. (Comparable evaporite beds underlie the Mediterranean.) Due to the current inflow of fresh water, the Caspian Sea is a freshwater lake in its northern portions, and is most saline on the Iranian shore, where the catchment basin contributes little flow.[14] Currently, the mean salinity of the Caspian is one third that of Earth's oceans. The Garabogazk?l embayment, which dried up when water flow from the main body of the Caspian was blocked in the 1980s but has since been restored, routinely exceeds oceanic salinity by a factor of 10.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Caspian Sea is the largest inland body of water in the world and accounts for 40 to 44% of the total lacustrine waters of the world.[15] The coastlines of the Caspian are shared by Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan. The Caspian is divided into three distinct physical regions: the Northern, Middle, and Southern Caspian.[16] The NorthernÿMiddle boundary is the Mangyshlak Threshold, which runs through Chechen Island and Cape Tiub-Karagan. The MiddleÿSouthern boundary is the Apsheron Threshold, a sill of tectonic origin between the Eurasian continent and an oceanic remnant,[17] that runs through Zhiloi Island and Cape Kuuli.[18] The Garabogazk?l Bay is the saline eastern inlet of the Caspian, which is part of Turkmenistan and at times has been a lake in its own right due to the isthmus that cuts it off from the Caspian.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferences between the three regions are dramatic. The Northern Caspian only includes the Caspian shelf,[19] and is very shallow; it accounts for less than 1% of the total water volume with an average depth of only 5ÿ6 metres (16ÿ20?ft). The sea noticeably drops off towards the Middle Caspian, where the average depth is 190 metres (620?ft).[18] The Southern Caspian is the deepest, with oceanic depths of over 1,000 metres (3,300?ft), greatly exceeding the depth of other regional seas, such as the Persian Gulf. The Middle and Southern Caspian account for 33% and 66% of the total water volume, respectively.[16] The northern portion of the Caspian Sea typically freezes in the winter, and in the coldest winters ice forms in the south as well.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 130 rivers provide inflow to the Caspian, with the Volga River being the largest. A second affluent, the Ural River, flows in from the north, and the Kura River flows into the sea from the west. In the past, the Amu Darya (Oxus) of Central Asia in the east often changed course to empty into the Caspian through a now-desiccated riverbed called the Uzboy River, as did the Syr Darya farther north. The Caspian also has several small islands; they are primarily located in the north and have a collective land area of roughly 2,000?km2 (770?sq?mi). Adjacent to the North Caspian is the Caspian Depression, a low-lying region 27 metres (89?ft) below sea level. The Central Asian steppes stretch across the northeast coast, while the Caucasus mountains hug the western shore. The biomes to both the north and east are characterized by cold, continental deserts. Conversely, the climate to the southwest and south are generally warm with uneven elevation due to a mix of highlands and mountain ranges; the drastic changes in climate alongside the Caspian have led to a great deal of biodiversity in the region.[3]\\r\\nThe Caspian Sea has numerous islands throughout, all of them near the coasts; none in the deeper parts of the sea. Ogurja Ada is the largest island. The island is 37?km (23?mi) long, with gazelles roaming freely on it. In the North Caspian, the majority of the islands are small and uninhabited, like the Tyuleniy Archipelago, an Important Bird Area (IBA), although some of them have human settlements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Caspian has characteristics common to both seas and lakes. It is often listed as the world's largest lake, although it is not a freshwater lake.  It contains about 3.5 times more water, by volume, than all five of North America's Great Lakes combined.  The Caspian was once part of the Tethys Ocean, but became landlocked about 5.5 million years ago due to plate tectonics.[15] The Volga River (about 80% of the inflow) and the Ural River discharge into the Caspian Sea, but it has no natural outflow other than by evaporation. Thus the Caspian ecosystem is a closed basin, with its own sea level history that is independent of the eustatic level of the world's oceans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe level of the Caspian has fallen and risen, often rapidly, many times over the centuries. Some Russian historians[who?] claim that a medieval rising of the Caspian, perhaps caused by the Amu Darya changing its inflow to the Caspian from the 13th century to the 16th century, caused the coastal towns of Khazaria, such as Atil, to flood. In 2004, the water level was 28 metres (92 feet) below sea level.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the centuries, Caspian Sea levels have changed in synchrony with the estimated discharge of the Volga, which in turn depends on rainfall levels in its vast catchment basin. Precipitation is related to variations in the amount of North Atlantic depressions that reach the interior, and they in turn are affected by cycles of the North Atlantic oscillation. Thus levels in the Caspian Sea relate to atmospheric conditions in the North Atlantic, thousands of miles to the northwest.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last short-term sea-level cycle started with a sea-level fall of 3?m (10?ft) from 1929 to 1977, followed by a rise of 3?m (10?ft) from 1977 until 1995.  Since then smaller oscillations have taken place.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Volga River, the largest in Europe, drains 20% of the European land area and is the source of 80% of the Caspian's inflow. Its lower reaches are heavily developed with numerous unregulated releases of chemical and biological pollutants. Although existing data is sparse and of questionable quality, there is ample evidence to suggest that the Volga is one of the principal sources of transboundary contaminants into the Caspian.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe magnitude of fossil fuel extraction and transport activity in the Caspian also poses a risk to the environment. The island of Vulf off Baku, for example, has suffered ecological damage as a result of the petrochemical industry; this has significantly decreased the number of species of marine birds in the area. Existing and planned oil and gas pipelines under the sea further increase the potential threat to the environment.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vladimir Filanovsky field in the Russian section of the body of water was discovered for its wealth of oil in 2005. It is reportedly the largest discovery of oil in 25 years. It was announced in October 2016 that Lukoil would start production in this region.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rising level of the Caspian Sea between 1994 and 1996 reduced the number of habitats for rare species of aquatic vegetation. This has been attributed to a general lack of seeding material in newly formed coastal lagoons and water bodies.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Caspian turtle (Mauremys caspica), although found in neighboring areas, is a wholly freshwater species. The zebra mussel is native to the Caspian and Black Sea basins, but has become an invasive species elsewhere, when introduced. The area has given its name to several species, including the Caspian gull and the Caspian tern. The Caspian seal (Pusa caspica) is the only aquatic mammal and is endemic to the Caspian Sea, being one of very few seal species that live in inland waters, but it is different from the those inhabiting freshwaters due to the hydrological environment of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcheological studies of Gobustan petroglyphs indicate that there once had been dolphins and porpoises,[25][26] or a certain species of beaked whales[27] and a whaling scene indicates large baleen whales[28] likely being present in Caspian Sea at least until when the Caspian Sea ceased being a part of the ocean system or until the Quaternary or much more recent periods such as until the last glacial period or antiquity.[29] Although the rock art on Kichikdash Mountain is assumed to be of a dolphin[30] or of a beaked whale,[27] it might instead represent the famous beluga sturgeon due to its size (430?cm in length), but fossil records suggest certain ancestors of modern dolphins and whales, such as Macrokentriodon morani (bottlenose dolphins) and Balaenoptera sibbaldina (blue whales) were presumably larger than their present descendants. From the same artworks, auks, like Brunnich's Guillemot could also have been in the sea as well, and these petroglyphs suggest marine inflow between the current Caspian Sea and the Arctic Ocean or North Sea, or the Black Sea.[30] This is supported by the existences of current endemic, oceanic species such as lagoon cockles which was genetically identified to originate in Caspian/Black Seas regions.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sea's basin (including associated waters such as rivers) has 160 native species and subspecies of fish in more than 60 genera.[24] About 62% of the species and subspecies are endemic, as are 4ÿ6 genera (depending on taxonomic treatment). The lake proper has 115 natives, including 73 endemics (63.5%).[24] Among the more than 50 genera in the lake proper, 3ÿ4 are endemic: Anatirostrum, Caspiomyzon, Chasar (often included in Ponticola) and Hyrcanogobius.[24] By far the most numerous families in the lake proper are gobies (35 species and subspecies), cyprinids (32) and clupeids (22). Two particularly rich genera are Alosa with 18 endemic species/subspecies and Benthophilus with 16 endemic species.[24] Other examples of endemics are four species of Clupeonella, Gobio volgensis, two Rutilus, three Sabanejewia, Stenodus leucichthys, two Salmo, two Mesogobius and three Neogobius.[24] Most non-endemic natives are either shared with the Black Sea basin or widespread Palearctic species such as crucian carp, Prussian carp, common carp, common bream, common bleak, asp, white bream, sunbleak, common dace, common roach, common rudd, European chub, sichel, tench, European weatherfish, wels catfish, northern pike, burbot, European perch and zander.[24] Almost 30 non-indigenous, introduced fish species have been reported from the Caspian Sea, but only a few have become established.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix sturgeon species, the Russian, bastard, Persian, sterlet, starry and beluga, are native to the Caspian Sea.[24] The last of these is arguably the largest freshwater fish in the world. The sturgeon yield roe (eggs) that are processed into caviar. Overfishing has depleted a number of the historic fisheries.[31] In recent years, overfishing has threatened the sturgeon population to the point that environmentalists advocate banning sturgeon fishing completely until the population recovers. The high price of sturgeon caviar, however, allows fishermen to afford bribes to ensure the authorities look the other way, making regulations in many locations ineffective.[32] Caviar harvesting further endangers the fish stocks, since it targets reproductive females.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany rare and endemic plant species of Russia are associated with the tidal areas of the Volga delta and riparian forests of the Samur River delta. The shoreline is also a unique refuge for plants adapted to the loose sands of the Central Asian Deserts. The principal limiting factors to successful establishment of plant species are hydrological imbalances within the surrounding deltas, water pollution, and various land reclamation activities. The water level change within the Caspian Sea is an indirect reason for which plants may not get established.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese affect aquatic plants of the Volga Delta, such as Aldrovanda vesiculosa and the native Nelumbo caspica. About 11 plant species are found in the Samur River Delta, including the unique liana forests that date back to the Tertiary period.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nReptiles native to the region include spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca buxtoni) and Horsfield's tortoise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest hominid remains found around the Caspian Sea are from Dmanisi dating back to around 1.8 Ma and yielded a number of skeletal remains of Homo erectus or Homo ergaster. More later evidence for human occupation of the region came from a number of caves in Georgia and Azerbaijan such as Kudaro and Azykh Caves. There is evidence for Lower Palaeolithic human occupation south of the Caspian from western Alburz. These are Ganj Par and Darband Cave sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeanderthal remains also have been discovered at a cave site in Georgia. Discoveries in the Huto cave and the adjacent Kamarband cave, near the town of Behshahr, Mazandaran south of the Caspian in Iran, suggest human habitation of the area as early as 11,000 years ago.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Caspian area is rich in energy resources. Oil wells were being dug in the region as early as the 10th century to reach oil \\"for use in everyday life, both for medicinal purposes and for heating and lighting in homes\\".[37][full citation needed] By the 16th century, Europeans were aware of the rich oil and gas deposits around the area. English traders Thomas Bannister and Jeffrey Duckett described the area around Baku as \\"a strange thing to behold, for there issueth out of the ground a marvelous quantity of oil, which serveth all the country to burn in their houses. This oil is black and is called nefte. There is also by the town of Baku, another kind of oil which is white and very precious [i.e., petroleum].\\"[38][full citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 18th century, during the rule of Peter I the Great, Fedor I. Soimonov, hydrographer and pioneering explorer of the Caspian Sea charted the until then little known body of water. Soimonov drew a set of four maps and wrote Pilot of the Caspian Sea, the first report and modern maps of the Caspian, that were published in 1720 by the Russian Academy of Sciences.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, oil and gas platforms abound along the edges of the sea.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's first offshore wells and machine-drilled wells were made in Bibi-Heybat Bay, near Baku, Azerbaijan. In 1873, exploration and development of oil began in some of the largest fields known to exist in the world at that time on the Absheron Peninsula near the villages of Balakhanli, Sabunchi, Ramana, and Bibi Heybat. Total recoverable reserves were more than 500 million tons. By 1900, Baku had more than 3,000 oil wells, 2,000 of which were producing at industrial levels. By the end of the 19th century, Baku became known as the \\"black gold capital\\", and many skilled workers and specialists flocked to the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, Baku was the centre of international oil industry. In 1920, when the Bolsheviks captured Azerbaijan, all private property ÿ including oil wells and factories ÿ was confiscated. Afterwards, the republic's entire oil industry came under the control of the Soviet Union. By 1941, Azerbaijan was producing a record 23.5 million tons of oil per year, and the Baku region supplied nearly 72 percent of all oil extracted in the entire Soviet Union.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1994, the \\"Contract of the Century\\" was signed, signalling the start of major international development of the Baku oil fields. The BakuÿTbilisiÿCeyhan pipeline, a major pipeline allowing Azerbaijan oil to flow straight to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, opened in 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the islands along the Azerbaijani coast continue to hold significant geopolitical and economic importance because of the potential oil reserves found nearby. Bulla Island, Pirallah? Island, and Nargin, which is still used as a former Soviet base and is the largest island in the Baku bay, all hold oil reserves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union and subsequent opening of the region has led to an intense investment and development scramble by international oil companies. In 1998, Dick Cheney commented that \\"I can't think of a time when we've had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the Caspian.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nA key problem to further development in the region is the status of the Caspian Sea and the establishment of the water boundaries among the five littoral states. The current disputes along Azerbaijan's maritime borders with Turkmenistan and Iran could potentially affect future development plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch controversy currently exists over the proposed Trans-Caspian oil and gas pipelines. These projects would allow Western markets easier access to Kazakh oil and, potentially, Uzbek and Turkmen gas as well. Russia officially opposes the project on environmental grounds.[42] However, analysts note that the pipelines would bypass Russia completely, thereby denying the country valuable transit fees, as well as destroying its current monopoly on westward-bound hydrocarbon exports from the region.[42] Recently, both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have expressed their support for the Trans-Caspian Pipeline.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks revealed that BP covered up a gas leak and blowout incident in September 2008 at an operating gas field in the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshi area of the Azerbaijan Caspian Sea.[44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2000[update], negotiations related to the demarcation of the Caspian Sea had been going on for nearly a decade among the states bordering the Caspian ÿ Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Iran. The status of the Caspian Sea[46] is the key problem. Access to mineral resources (oil and natural gas), access for fishing, and access to international waters (through Russia's Volga river and the canals connecting it to the Black Sea and Baltic Sea) all depend upon the outcomes of negotiations. Access to the Volga River is particularly important for the landlocked states of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. This concerns Russia, because the potential traffic would use its inland waterways. If a body of water is labelled as a sea, then there would be some precedents and international treaties obliging the granting of access permits to foreign vessels. If a body of water is labelled merely as a lake, then there are no such obligations. Environmental issues are also somewhat connected to the status and borders issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll five Caspian littoral states maintain naval forces on the sea.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a treaty signed between Iran and the Soviet Union, the Caspian Sea is technically a lake and was divided into two sectors (Iranian and Soviet), but the resources (then mainly fish) were commonly shared. The line between the two sectors was considered an international border in a common lake, like Lake Albert. The Soviet sector was sub-divided into the four littoral republics' administrative sectors.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan have bilateral agreements with each other based on median lines. Because of their use by the three nations, median lines seem to be the most likely method of delineating territory in future agreements. However, Iran insists on a single, multilateral agreement between the five nations (as this is the only way for it to achieve a one-fifth share of the sea). Azerbaijan is at odds with Iran over some oil fields that both states claim. Occasionally, Iranian patrol boats have fired at vessels sent by Azerbaijan for exploration into the disputed region. There are similar tensions between Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan (the latter claims that the former has pumped more oil than agreed from a field, recognized by both parties as shared).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Caspian littoral states' meeting in 2007 signed an agreement that bars any ship not flying the national flag of a littoral state from entering the sea.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nNegotiations among the five littoral states have been ongoing, amidst ebbs and flows, for the past 20 years, with some degree of progress being made at the fourth Caspian Summit held in Astrakhan in 2014.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Caspian Summit is a head of state-level meeting of the five littoral states.[50] The fifth Caspian Summit took place on August 12, 2018 in the Kazakh port city of Aktau. [50] The five leaders signed the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe five littoral states build consensus on legally binding governance of the Caspian Sea through Special Working Groups of a Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea.[52] In advance of a Caspian Summit, 51st Special Working Group took place in Astana in May 2018 and found consensus on multiple agreements: Agreements on cooperation in the field of transport; trade and economic cooperation; prevention of incidents on the sea; combating terrorism; fighting against organized crime; and border security cooperation.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Convention grants jurisdiction over 15 miles of territorial waters to each neighboring country, plus additional 10 miles of exclusive fishing rights on the surface, while the rest is international waters. The seabed, on the other hand, remains undefined, subject to bilateral agreements between countries. Thus, the Caspian Sea is legally neither fully a sea nor a lake.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nUNECE recognizes several rivers that cross international borders which flow into the Caspian Sea.[55]\\r\\nThese are:\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Caspian Sea is endorheic, its main tributary, the Volga, is connected by important shipping canals with the Don River (and thus the Black Sea) and with the Baltic Sea, with branch canals to Northern Dvina and to the White Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Caspian tributary, the Kuma River, is connected by an irrigation canal with the Don basin as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral scheduled ferry services (including train ferries) operate on the Caspian Sea, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ferries are mostly used for cargo; only the BakuÿAktau and BakuÿTrkmenba?y routes accept passengers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an endorheic basin, the Caspian Sea basin has no natural connection with the ocean. Since the medieval period, traders reached the Caspian via a number of portages that connected the Volga and its tributaries with the Don River (which flows into the Sea of Azov) and various rivers that flow into the Baltic Sea. Primitive canals connecting the Volga Basin with the Baltic have been constructed as early as the early 18th century. Since then, a number of canal projects have been completed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two modern canal systems that connect the Volga Basin, and hence the Caspian Sea, with the ocean are the VolgaÿBaltic Waterway and the VolgaÿDon Canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposed PechoraÿKama Canal was a project that was widely discussed between the 1930s and 1980s. Shipping was a secondary consideration. Its main goal was to redirect some of the water of the Pechora River (which flows into the Arctic Ocean) via the Kama River into the Volga. The goals were both irrigation and the stabilization of the water level in the Caspian, which was thought to be falling dangerously fast at the time. During 1971, some peaceful nuclear construction experiments were carried out in the region by the U.S.S.R.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2007, in order to boost his oil-rich country's access to markets, Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed a 700-kilometre (435-mile) link between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. It is hoped that the \\"Eurasia Canal\\" (Manych Ship Canal) would transform landlocked Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries into maritime states, enabling them to significantly increase trade volume. Although the canal would traverse Russian territory, it would benefit Kazakhstan through its Caspian Sea ports. The most likely route for the canal, the officials at the Committee on Water Resources at Kazakhstan's Agriculture Ministry say, would follow the KumaÿManych Depression, where currently a chain of rivers and lakes is already connected by an irrigation canal (KumaÿManych Canal). Upgrading the VolgaÿDon Canal would be another option.[56]","input":"What five countries border on the caspian sea?"},{"output":"Whernside","context":"The mountains of Whernside (736?m or 2,415?ft), Ingleborough (723?m or 2,372?ft) and Pen-y-ghent (694?m or 2,277?ft) are collectively known as the Three Peaks. The peaks, which form part of the Pennine range, encircle the heads of the valleys of the River Ribble and of Chapel-le-Dale in the Yorkshire Dales National Park in the North of England.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long-standing designation \\"The Three Peaks\\" is well known locally, and in past times nationally. However, there are now a number of \\"National\\" Three Peaks adventure challenges involving Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Scafell Pike (respectively the highest summits in Scotland, Wales and England). The epithet \\"Yorkshire\\" is therefore now commonly added to differentiate Yorkshire's Three Peaks from those (although Whernside is partially in Cumbria, with the summit trig point being narrowly on the Cumbria side).\\r\\nIn common with neighbouring fells, the Three Peaks are carved from an almost flat-lying succession of sedimentary strata of Carboniferous age. The lower slopes of each of the fells are formed from massive limestones assigned to the Visean age Great Scar Group. The upper slopes of each of the fells are formed from alternating bands of limestone, and mudstone grading up into sandstone, all of which are assigned to the Brigantian and early Namurian ages Yoredale Group. These alternations are considered to be a classic British example of cyclothems.[1] Differential weathering and erosion of the various bands has given Ingleborough and Pen-y-ghent a distinctive, stepped appearance. The summits are capped by Grassington Grit, a variety of Millstone Grit.[2]\\r\\nConsiderable areas of the flanks of each of the fells are covered by peat whilst other areas are blanketed by glacial till notably across the southern and eastern slopes of Pen-y-ghent. The Ribblehead drumlin field is considered to be one of the finest in England.[3] Fringing Ingleborough on each side however are impressive areas of limestone pavement.\\r\\nExtensive networks of caves have developed within the limestone strata such as the White Scar Caves, and potholes which attract cavers from all over the country. It is home to England's highest waterfall at Gaping Gill, where the Fell Beck drops 110?m (361?ft) vertically down a pothole, into Britain's second largest cavern. The beck re-emerges further down the mountain adjacent to Ingleborough Cave, where visitors can take a guided tour of a floodlit part of the cave system. Whernside, being more rounded, is visually less imposing than its neighbours, but its summit is the highest point in North Yorkshire.[note 1]\\r\\nThe area is rich in historical interest. The summit of Ingleborough has the remains of a huge Iron Age hill fort, while the Settle-Carlisle Railway runs between the mountains, crossing Ribblehead Viaduct at the foot of Whernside.\\r\\nThe Three Peaks walk of Pen-y-ghent, Whernside and Ingleborough is probably the original three peak walk within the UK.[citation needed] The first recorded ascent of the three hills was in July 1887 by J. R. Wynne-Edwards and D. R. Smith in a time of 10 hours.[4] The walk covers a distance of 37.5?km (23.3?mi) to 42?km (26.1?mi) (depending on route) circuit of all three peaks with nearly 1,600?m (5,249?ft) of ascent and descent. A challenge that many walkers aim for when undertaking the walk is to complete the walk in under 12 hours, though as Alfred Wainwright says in his book Wainwright in the Limestone Dales, \\"Some participants have chosen to regard the walk as a race, and this is to be greatly regretted, walking is a pleasure to be enjoyed in comfort\\" (edited quote).[5] The route most walkers take varies from the fell race in that most traverse the 'nose' of Pen-y-ghent from Brackenbottom Moor and do not ascend from the Pennine Way. Additionally, Whernside is generally traversed along the right-of-way to the east, initially following the railway line, all of which can add extra distance to the route.\\r\\nFor most people the route starts in the village of Horton-in-Ribblesdale, though many start from various points in the circular route, such as Chapel-le-Dale. Historically Chapel-le-Dale was the starting point though this probably changed when the Pen-y-ghent Cafe started running their clocking in and out service for walkers in 1968.[6] The cafe did run a free safety-service for walkers, but that has been temporarily suspended. However, walkers can still register the beginning and end of their walk at Pen-y-ghent Cafe. Those that complete the walk within 12 hours are invited to pay to join the Pen-y-ghent Cafe's privately owned 'Three Peaks of Yorkshire Club'.\\r\\nThe Yorkshire Dales National Park runs a voluntary Friends of the Three Peaks project. The proceeds of this go towards the upkeep of the paths on the route. Certificates, medals and membership forms are awarded by local participating businesses.\\r\\nUnderstandably the Three Peaks Walk is seen by many as a challenge and it has become very popular for charity sponsored walks and Saturdays in early summer can see several hundred walkers make their way round the route.\\r\\nIn addition to it being seen as a walking challenge it has also become a race for fell runners and cyclo-cross cyclists. However, there is no bridleway access to the peaks (except Ingleborough from the Ingleton side only) so any bicycle access is on a permissive basis on race days only.\\r\\nThe Three Peaks were featured on the TV programme Seven Natural Wonders as one of the wonders of Yorkshire.\\r\\nCoordinates: 540957N 22351W? / ?54.165922N 2.397506W? / 54.165922; -2.397506","input":"What are the 3 peaks in yorkshire called?"},{"output":"52 miles per hour","context":"Cheetah is a wooden roller coaster by Custom Coasters International, located in the African Pridelands Section of the Wild Adventures theme park, in Valdosta, Georgia.

Since opening in 1959, it has been the home of the Daytona 500, the most prestigious race in NASCAR. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosts races of ARCA, AMA Superbike, USCC, SCCA, and Motocross. The track features multiple layouts including the primary 2.5-mile (4.0?km) high-speed tri-oval, a 3.56-mile (5.73?km) sports car course, a 2.95-mile (4.75?km) motorcycle course, and a 1,320-foot (400?m) karting and motorcycle flat-track. The track's 180-acre (73?ha) infield includes the 29-acre (12?ha) Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\\r\\nThe track was built in 1959 by NASCAR founder William \\"Bill\\" France, Sr. to host racing that was held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course. His banked design permitted higher speeds and gave fans a better view of the cars. Lights were installed around the track in 1998, and today it is the third-largest single lit outdoor sports facility. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004 and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010.\\r\\nOn January 22, 2013, the track unveiled artist depictions of a renovated speedway. On July 5, 2013, ground was broken on the project that removed backstretch seating and completely redevelop the frontstretch seating. The renovation to the speedway was constructed by Design-Builder Barton Malow Company in partnership with Rossetti Architects. The project, named \\"Daytona Rising\\", was completed in January 2016, and cost US $400 million, placing emphasis on improving fan experience with five expanded and redesigned fan entrances (called \\"injectors\\"), as well as wider and more comfortable seating with more restrooms and concession stands. After the renovations were completed, the track's grandstands include 101,000 permanent seats with the ability to increase permanent seating to 125,000.[1][2] The project was finished before the start of Speedweeks in 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNASCAR founder William France Sr. began planning for the track in 1953 as a way to promote the series, which at the time was racing on the Daytona Beach Road Course.[3] France met with Daytona Beach engineer Charles Moneypenny to discuss his plans for the speedway. He wanted the track to have the highest banking possible to allow the cars to reach high speeds and to give fans a better view of the cars on track. Moneypenny traveled to Detroit, Michigan to visit the Ford Proving Grounds which had a high-speed test track with banked corners. Ford shared their engineering reports of the track with Moneypenny, providing the needed details of how to transition the pavement from a flat straightaway to a banked corner. France took the plans to the Daytona Beach city commission, who supported his idea and formed the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority.[4]\\r\\nThe city commission agreed to lease the 447-acre (181?ha) parcel of land adjacent to Daytona Beach Municipal Airport to France's corporation for $10,000 a year over a 50-year period. France then began working on building funding for the project and found support from a Texas oil millionaire, Clint Murchison. Murchison loaned France $600,000 along with the construction equipment necessary to build the track. France was also able to secure funding from Pepsi-Cola, General Motors designer Harley Earl, a second mortgage on his home and selling 300,000 stock shares to local residents. Ground broke on construction of the 2.5-mile (4.0?km) speedway on November 25, 1957.[4]\\r\\nTo build the high banking, crews had to excavate over a million square yards of soil from the track's infield.[5] Because of the high water table in the area, the excavated hole filled with water to form what is now known as Lake Lloyd, named after Joseph \\"Sax\\" Lloyd, one of the original six members of the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority. (The lake would be stocked with 65,000 fish, and France would arrange speedboat races on it.)[6] 22 tons of lime mortar had to be brought in to form the track's binding base, over which asphalt would be laid. Because of the extreme degree of banking, Moneypenny had to come up with a way to pave the incline. He connected the paving equipment to bulldozers anchored at the top of the banking. This would allow the paving equipment to pave the banking without slipping or rolling down the incline. Moneypenny subsequently patented his construction method and later designed Talladega Superspeedway and Michigan International Speedway. By December 1958, France had begun to run out of money and started relying on race ticket sales to complete construction.[4]\\r\\nThe first practice run on the new track began on February 6, 1959. On February 22, 1959, 42,000 people attended the inaugural Daytona 500,[4] and its finish was as startling as the track itself: Lee Petty beat Johnny Beauchamp in a photo finish that took three days to adjudicate.[7] When the track opened it was the fastest race track to ever host a stock car race, until Talladega Superspeedway opened 10 years later.[citation needed] April 4, it would host a 100?mi (160?km) Champ Car event, also, which saw Jim Rathmann beat Dick Rathmann and Rodger Ward, and, with an average speed 170.26?mph (274.01?km/h), was at the time the fastest motor race ever.[7] It was also the occasion of Daytona's first fatality: George Amick, attempting to overtake for third late in the race, hit a wall and was killed.[7] April 5, a scheduled 1,000?km (620?mi) sports car event (shortened to 560?mi (900?km) by darkness) was won by Roberto Mieres and Fritz d'Orey, who shared a Porsche RSK, which proved more durable than more potent competition.[7]\\r\\nLights were installed around the track in 1998 to run NASCAR's July race, the Coke Zero 400 at night. The track was the world's largest single lighted outdoor sports facility until being surpassed by Losail International Circuit in 2008.[citation needed] Musco Lighting installed the lighting system, which took into account glare and visibility for aircraft arriving and departing nearby Daytona Beach International Airport, and costs about $240 per hour when in operation.[8]\\r\\nDaytona's tri-oval is 2.5 miles (4.0?km) long with 31 banking in the turns and 18 banking at the start/finish line. The front straight is 3,800 feet (1,200?m) long and the back straight (or \\"superstretch\\") is 3,000 feet (910?m) long. The tri-oval shape was revolutionary at the time as it greatly improved sight lines for fans. It is one of the two tracks on the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series circuit that uses restrictor plates to slow the cars down due to the high speeds, the other being Talladega Superspeedway.[9]\\r\\nOn July 15, 2010, repaving of the track began. This came almost a year earlier than planned due to the track coming apart during the 2010 Daytona 500. The project used an estimated 50,000 tons[vague] of asphalt to repave 1,400,000 square feet (130,000?m2) including the racing surface, apron, skid pads and pit road. Because of good weather, the project was completed ahead of schedule.[10]\\r\\nOn October 9, 2013, Colin Braun drove a Daytona Prototype car prepared by Michael Shank Racing to set a single-lap record on the tri-oval configuration of 222.971 miles per hour (358.837?km/h).[11]During NASCAR Events, it takes less than a minute for the cars to complete a lap around the 2.5 mile tri-oval course.\\r\\nThe 3.81-mile (6.13?km) road course was built in 1959 and first hosted a three-hour sports car race called the Daytona Continental in 1962.[12] The race length became 2,000?km (1,200?mi) in 1964,[7] and in 1966 was extended to a 24-hour endurance race known as the Rolex 24 at Daytona. It was shortened again to six hours in 1972 and cancelled entirely in 1974.[7]\\r\\nIn 1973, a sharp chicane was added at the end of the backstretch, approaching oval turn three.\\r\\nIn 1984[13] and 1985,[14] the layout was modified, re-profiling turns 1 and 2, and moving what is now turn 3 closer to its adjacent turns. In addition, the chicane on the backstretch was modified. A new entry leg was constructed approximately 400 feet (120?m) earlier, resulting in a longer, three-legged, \\"bus stop\\" shape. Cars would now enter in the first leg, bypass the second leg, and exit out of the existing third leg. Passing would now be possible inside the longer chicane. The construction resulted in a final length of 3.56 miles (5.73?km) for the complete road course.\\r\\nIn 2003, the chicane was modified once again. The middle leg was repaved and widened, and now cars would enter through the first leg, and exit out of the second leg. The existing third leg was abandoned. This allowed cars a cleaner entry into oval turn three. After favorable results, in 2010 the third leg was dug up, and removed permanently.\\r\\nWhile the more famous 24 Hours of Le Mans is held near the summer solstice, Daytona's endurance race is held in winter (meaning more of the race is run at night). The track's lighting system is limited to 20% of its maximum output for the race to keep cars dependent on their headlights.[15]\\r\\nIn 2005, a second infield road course configuration was constructed, primarily for motorcycles. Due to fears of tire wear on the banked oval sections, oval turns 1 and 2 were bypassed giving the new course a length of 2.95 miles (4.75?km). The Daytona SportBike that runs the Daytona 200 however, uses the main road course except for the motorcycle Pedro Rodrguez Hairpin (tighter than the one used for cars; the car version is used as an acceleration lane for motorcycles).[16]\\r\\nOn September 26 and 27, 2006, the IndyCar Series held a compatibility test on the 10-turn, 2.73-mile (4.39?km) modified road course, and the 12-turn 2.95-mile (4.75?km) motorcycle road course with 5 drivers. The drivers who tested at the track were Vitor Meira, Sam Hornish Jr., Tony Kanaan, Scott Dixon and Dan Wheldon. This marked the first time since 1984 that open wheel cars have taken to the track at Daytona.[17] On January 31?ÿ February 1, 2007, IndyCar returned for a full test involving 17 cars.[18]\\r\\nDuring Daytona Beach Bike Week, a supercross track is built between pit road and the tri-oval section of the track. Historically the track has used more sand than dirt, providing unique challenges to riders.[citation needed] The 2008-2013 track configurations were designed by former champion, Ricky Carmichael.[19]\\r\\nDaytona has hosted an AMA Supercross Championship round uninterruptedly since 1971.[20]\\r\\nPopular dirt-track races in karting and flat-track motorcycle racing had been held at Daytona Beach Municipal Stadium but in 2009, the city announced the stadium was replacing its entire surface with FieldTurf, and thereby eliminating the flat-track racing at the stadium. To continue racing, speedway officials built the Daytona Flat Track, a new quarter-mile dirt track outside of turns 1 & 2 of the main superspeedway. It seats 5,000 in temporary grandstands and opened in December 2009 for WKA KartWeek. From 2010 to 2016, it also hosted the AMA Grand National Championship, before it was moved in 2017 to the tri-oval section and became a TT course.[21]\\r\\nThere is also a short paved kart/autocross track in the infield just inside of turn 3. The SCCA holds autocross on this track in addition to hosting sprint karting races during KartWeek.\\r\\nIn February 2012, it was announced that a 0.4-mile (0.64?km) short track would be constructed along the backstretch of the Speedway's main course, for NASCAR's lower-tier series to compete at during Speedweeks called the UNOH Battle at the Beach, which is similar to the Toyota All-Star Showdown, formerly held at Irwindale Speedway.[22] The first races were held on that track in February 2013. The track was shorten to 1,980-foot (0.60?km) oval in 2014 by shorter straightaways. The future of racing at the short track is unknown after 2015 with the grandstands on the back straightaway being demolished as a part of the Daytona Rising project.\\r\\nIn the fall of 1959, the track hosted several high school football games for the Father Lopez Green Wave in their first year of their football program.\\r\\nThe track hosted four college football games featuring the Daytona-based Bethune-Cookman Wildcats in 1974 and 1975. In early 2014 track president Joie Chitwood expressed a desire to bring football back to the track.[23]\\r\\nIn 1994, Sega released an arcade game called Daytona USA, using their Model 2 hardware. It was developed by their famed \\"AM2\\" development team. The soundtrack for the game included vocals by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi. It is widely considered to be one of the most successful and influential racing games of all time.\\r\\niRacing.com have laser-scanned the facility twice.

Daytona USA 3 is currently in the BETA phase so changes to the track could be made as complaints were made by early players that got to try the game at IAAPA said that the track is too similar to the classic beginner course from Daytona USA. The theme that plays in Daytona International Speedway is the extended lyrics version of \\"Let's Go Away!\\". The current difficulty for the track right now is set to BEGINNER and the amount of laps is 6.\\r\\nA total of 40 people have been fatally injured in on-track incidents: 23 car drivers, twelve motorcyclists, three go-kart drivers, one powerboat racer, and one track worker. The most notable death may have been that of Dale Earnhardt, who was killed on the last lap of the 2001 Daytona 500 on February 18, 2001.[25]\\r\\nThe UNOH Fanzone is an access package similar to pit passes for fans to get closer to drivers and race teams. The fanzone was built in 2004 as part of a renovation of the track's infield.[26] Fans are able to walk on top of the garages, known as the \\"fandeck\\", and view track and garage activity. Fans can also view race teams working in the garage, including NASCAR technical inspection, through windows. The garage windows also include slots for fans to hand merchandise to drivers for autographs. The fanzone also includes a live entertainment stage, additional food and drink areas and various other activities and displays.[27]\\r\\nThe 2004 renovation of the infield, headed by design firm HNTB,[28] was the first major renovation of the infield in the history of the track.[29] In addition to the fanzone, a new vehicle and pedestrian tunnel was built under turn 1. The tunnel posed a challenge to engineers because it was to be built under the water table. Another challenge came during construction when three named hurricanes passed by the track, flooding much of the excavation work. The infield renovation involved landscaping and hardscaping, such as a new walkway along the shore of Lake Lloyd, and the construction of 34 new buildings, including garages and fueling stations, offices and inspection facilities, and a club. The renovation project received a 2005 Award for Excellence from Design-Build Institute of America.[29] Following the success of the UNOH Fanzone at Daytona, Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Kansas Speedway each built a similar infield fanzone.[citation needed] On December 9, 2016, the speedway announced that the University of Northwestern Ohio purchased entitlement rights to the fanzone, and that the area will be named 'UNOH Fanzone'.[30]\\r\\nThe Budweiser Party Porch was a 46-foot-high (14?m) porch located along the backstretch of the track. It was built on top of a portion of the backstretch grandstands and includes a 277-foot-wide (84?m), 33-foot-tall (10?m) sign, the largest sign in motorsports.[citation needed] The porch featured tables, food and drinks, offering fans a \\"fun-filled\\" atmosphere that breaks fans away from the confines of grandstand seating without sacrificing on the view. Below the porch was an interactive fan zone featuring amusement rides, a go-kart track, show cars and merchandise trailers.[31] After the 2015 racing season, the Party Porch was torn down with the backstretch grandstands as part of the DAYTONA Rising project.\\r\\nAs of February 2015, track records on the 2.5 miles (4.0?km) tri-oval are as follows.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nMain Entrance at night (prior to renovation)\\r\\nCars practicing in 2004\\r\\nOld Flagstand\\r\\nGrandstand (prior to renovation)\\r\\nPaul Revere 250 restart after a caution\\r\\nView from the former backstretch grandstands at night\\r\\nEndurance kart race\\r\\nRacetrack skidmarks and view of old grandstand\\r\\nView of Lake Lloyd\\r\\nInfield garages\\r\\nInfield view from President's Row\\r\\nView of Victory Lane from a skybox\\r\\nStatue of Dale Earnhardt Sr. holding his winner's trophy\\r\\nCoordinates: 29118N 81410W? / ?29.18556N 81.06944W? / 29.18556; -81.06944","input":"How many seats are there at daytona speedway?"},{"output":"Shah Rukh Khan","context":"Cape Town Knight Riders [3] is a professional franchise Twenty20 cricket team of the T20 Global League in South Africa, which represents the city of Cape Town.

Shah Rukh Khan, the owner of the Kolkata Knight Riders (who have won the Indian Premier League twice) and the Trinbago knight riders (who have won the Caribbean Premier League twice), will now hope for a similar success from his new investment in the Cape Town franchise.[7] The performance of his side in the IPL has been quite impressive, and that has been possible owing to a well balanced squad.\\r\\nFormer South African great, all-rounder and Kolkata Knight Riders coach Jacques Kallis will be the Cape Town sides's coach for the first season.[1]\\r\\nThe following players were named in the squad for the 2017 tournament:[5] However, in October 2017, Cricket South Africa postponed the tournament until November 2018.[8]\\r\\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.","input":"Who is the owner of cape town knight riders?"},{"output":"13 per 100,000","context":"Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to deliver one or more babies.[2] A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk.[2] This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord.[2][3] A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section.[2][3] A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible.[2] The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.[3][4] However, some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.[2]\\r\\nA C-section typically takes 45 minutes to an hour.[2] It may be done with a spinal block such that the woman is awake or under general anesthesia.[2] A urinary catheter is used to drain the bladder and the skin of the abdomen is then cleaned with an antiseptic.[2] An incision of about 15?cm (6 inches) is then typically made through the mother's lower abdomen.[2] The uterus is then opened with a second incision and the baby delivered.[2] The incisions are then stitched closed.[2] A woman can typically begin breastfeeding as soon as she is awake and out of the operating room.[5] Often a number of days are required in hospital to recover sufficiently to return home.[2]\\r\\nC-sections result in a small overall increase in poor outcomes in low risk pregnancies.[3] They also typically take longer to heal from, about six weeks, than vaginal birth.[2] The increased risks include breathing problems in the baby and amniotic fluid embolism and postpartum bleeding in the mother.[3] Established guidelines recommend that caesarean sections not be used before 39 weeks of pregnancy without a medical reason.[6] The method of delivery does not appear to have an effect on subsequent sexual function.[7]\\r\\nIn 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally.[8] The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections.[4] Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8] More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5% while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%. There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section.[8] In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section.[2][3] The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother with the occasional baby surviving. Descriptions of mothers surviving date back to the 1500s. With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 1800s survival of both the mother and baby became common.[9]\\r\\nCaesarean section is recommended when vaginal delivery might pose a risk to the mother or baby. C-sections are also carried out for personal and social reasons. Systematic reviews have found no strong evidence about the impact of caesareans for non-medical reasons.[10][11] Recommendations encourage counseling to identify the reasons for the request, addressing anxieties and information, and encouraging vaginal birth.[10][12] Elective caesareans at 38 weeks showed increased health complications in the newborn.[13] For this reason, planned caesarean sections (also known as elective caesarean sections) should not be scheduled before 39 weeks gestation unless there is medical reason to do so.\\r\\nComplications of labour and factors increasing the risk associated with vaginal delivery, such as:\\r\\nOther complications of pregnancy, pre-existing conditions and concomitant disease, such as:\\r\\nOther\\r\\nIt is generally agreed that the prevalence of caesarean section is higher than needed in many countries and physicians are encouraged to actively lower the rate, as a caesarean rate higher than 10-15% is not associated with reductions in maternal or infant mortality rates.[4] Some evidence supports a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8]\\r\\nSome of these efforts are: emphasizing a long latent phase of labor is not abnormal and not a justification for C-section; a new definition of the start of active labor from a cervical dilatation of 4?cm to a dilatation of 6?cm; and allowing at least 2 hours of pushing for women who have previously given birth and 3 hours of pushing for women who have not previously given birth before labor arrest is considered.[3] Physical exercise during pregnancy also decreases the risk.[17]\\r\\nAdverse outcomes in low risk pregnancies occur in 8.6% of vaginal deliveries and 9.2% of caesarean section deliveries.[3]\\r\\nIn those who are low risk, the risk of death for caesarean sections is 13 per 100,000 and for vaginal birth 3.5 per 100,000 in the developed world.[3] The United Kingdom National Health Service gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth [18] but it is important to remember the actual risk of death in either situation is extremely small in resource-rich settings.\\r\\nIn Canada the difference in serious morbidity or mortality for the mother (e.g. cardiac arrest, wound hematoma, or hysterectomy) was 1.8 additional cases per 100 or three times the risk.[19]\\r\\nA caesarean section is associated with risks of postoperative adhesions, incisional hernias (which may require surgical correction) and wound infections.[20] If a caesarean is performed in an emergency, the risk of the surgery may be increased due to a number of factors. The patient's stomach may not be empty, increasing the risk of anaesthesia.[21] Other risks include severe blood loss (which may require a blood transfusion) and postdural-puncture spinal headaches.[20]\\r\\nWound infections occur after caesarean sections at a rate of 3-15%.[22]\\r\\nWomen who had caesarean sections are more likely to have problems with later pregnancies, and it is recommended that women who want larger families should not seek an elective caesarean unless there are medical indications to do so. The risk of placenta accreta, a potentially life-threatening condition which is more likely to develop where a woman has had a previous caesarean section, is 0.13% after two caesarean sections, but increases to 2.13% after four and then to 6.74% after six or more. Along with this is a similar rise in the risk of emergency hysterectomies at delivery.[23]\\r\\nMothers can experience increased incidence of postnatal depression, and can experience significant psychological trauma and ongoing birth-related post-traumatic stress disorder after obstetric intervention during the birthing process.[24] Factors like pain in first stage of labor, feelings of powerlessness, intrusive emergency obstetric intervention are important in the subsequent development of psychological issues related to labour and delivery.[24]\\r\\nWomen who have had a caesarean for any reason are somewhat less likely to become pregnant again as compared to women who have previously delivered only vaginally, but the effect is small.[25]\\r\\nWomen who had just one previous caesarean section are more likely to have problems with their second birth.[3] Delivery after previous Caesarean section is by either of two main options:\\r\\nBoth have higher risks than a vaginal birth with no previous caesarean section. There are many issues which must be taken into account when planning the mode of delivery for every pregnancy, not just those complicated by a previous caesarean section and there is a list of some of these issues in the list of indications for section in the first part of this article. A vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) confers a higher risk of uterine rupture (5 per 1,000), blood transfusion or endometritis (10 per 1,000), and perinatal death of the child (0.25 per 1,000).[26] Furthermore, 20% to 40% of planned VBAC attempts end in caesarean section being needed, with greater risks of complications in an emergency repeat caesarean section than in an elective repeat caesarean section.[27][28] On the other hand, VBAC confers less maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than elective repeat caesarean section.[29]\\r\\nThere are number of steps that can be taken during abdominal or pelvic surgery to minimize postoperative complications, such as the formation of adhesions. Such techniques and principles may include:\\r\\nHowever, despite these proactive measures, adhesion formation is a recognized complication of any abdominal or pelvic surgery. To prevent adhesions from forming after caesarean section, adhesion barrier can be put during surgery to minimize the risk of adhesions between the uterus and ovaries, the small bowel, and almost any tissue in the abdomen or pelvis. This is not current UK practice though as there is no compelling evidence to support the benefit of this intervention.\\r\\nAdhesions can cause long term problems, such as:\\r\\nThe risk of adhesion formation is one reason why vaginal delivery is usually considered safer than elective caesarean section where there is no medical indication for section for either maternal or fetal reasons.\\r\\nNon-medically indicated (elective) childbirth before 39 weeks gestation \\"carry significant risks for the baby with no known benefit to the mother.\\" Complications from elective caesarean before 39 weeks include: newborn mortality at 37 weeks may be up to 3 times the number at 40 weeks, and was elevated compared to 38 weeks gestation. These early term births were associated with more death during infancy, compared to those occurring at 39 to 41 weeks (\\"full term\\").[30] Researchers in one study and another review found many benefits to going full term, but no adverse effects in the health of the mothers or babies.[30][31]\\r\\nThe American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and medical policy makers review research studies and find more incidence of suspected or proven sepsis, RDS, hypoglycemia, need for respiratory support, need for NICU admission, and need for hospitalization > 4ÿ5 days. In the case of caesarean sections, rates of respiratory death were 14 times higher in pre-labor at 37 compared with 40 weeks gestation, and 8.2 times higher for pre-labor caesarean at 38 weeks. In this review, no studies found decreased neonatal morbidity due to non-medically indicated (elective) delivery before 39 weeks.[30]\\r\\nFor otherwise healthy twin pregnancies where both twins are head down a trial of vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks.[10][32] Vaginal delivery in this case does not worsen the outcome for either infant as compared with caesarean section.[32] There is some controversy on the best method of delivery where the first twin is head first and the second is not, but most obstetricians will recommend normal delivery unless there are other reasons to avoid vaginal birth.[32] When the first twin is not head down, a caesarean section is often recommended.[32] Regardless of whether the twins are delivered by section or vaginally, the medical literature recommends delivery of dichorionic twins at 38 weeks, and monochorionic twins (identical twins sharing a placenta) by 37 weeks due to the increased risk of stillbirth in monochorionic twins who remain in utero after 37 weeks.[33][34] The consensus is that late preterm delivery of monochorionic twins is justified because the risk of stillbirth for post-37 week delivery is significantly higher than the risks posed by delivering monochorionic twins near term (i.e., 36ÿ37 weeks).[35] The consensus concerning monoamniotic twins (identical twins sharing an amniotic sac), the highest risk type of twins, is that they should be delivered by caesarean section at or shortly after 32 weeks, since the risks of intrauterine death of one or both twins is higher after this gestation than the risk of complications of prematurity.[36][37][38]\\r\\nIn a research study widely publicized, singleton children born earlier than 39 weeks may have developmental problems, including slower learning in reading and math.[39]\\r\\nOther risks include:\\r\\nBirth by caesarean section also seems to be associated with worse health outcomes later in life, including overweight or obesitas and problems in the immune system.[43]\\r\\nCaesarean sections have been classified in various ways by different perspectives.[44] One way to discuss all classification systems is to group them by their focus either on the urgency of the procedure, characteristics of the mother, or as a group based on other, less commonly discussed factors.[44]\\r\\nIt is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.[44]\\r\\nConventionally, caesarean sections are classified as being either an elective surgery or an emergency operation.[45] Classification is used to help communication between the obstetric, midwifery and anaesthetic team for discussion of the most appropriate method of anaesthesia. The decision whether to perform general anesthesia or regional anesthesia (spinal or epidural anaesthetic) is important and is based on many indications, including how urgent the delivery needs to be as well as the medical and obstetric history of the woman.[45] Regional anaesthetic is almost always safer for the woman and the baby but sometimes general anaesthetic is safer for one or both, and the classification of urgency of the delivery is an important issue affecting this decision.\\r\\nA planned caesarean (or elective/scheduled caesarean), arranged ahead of time, is most commonly arranged for medical indications which have developed before or during the pregnancy, and ideally after 39 weeks of gestation.[citation needed] In the UK, this is classified as a 'grade 4' section (delivery timed to suit the needs of the service) since the need for delivery is not urgent. Emergency caesarean sections are performed in pregnancies in which a vaginal delivery was planned initially, but an indication for caesarean delivery has since developed. In the UK they are further classified as grade 3 (delivery within 4 hours of the decision, no maternal or fetal compromise), grade 2 (delivery required within 90 minutes of the decision but no immediate threat to the life of the woman or the fetus) or grade 1 (delivery required within 30 minutes of the decision: immediate threat to the life of the mother or the baby or both.)\\r\\nElective caesarean sections may be performed on the basis of an obstetrical or medical indication, or because of a medically non-indicated maternal request.[10] Among women in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia, about 7% preferred caesarean section as a method of delivery.[10] In cases without medical indications the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend a planned vaginal delivery.[46] The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that if after a women has been provided information on the risk of a planned caesarean section and she still insists on the procedure it should be provided.[10] If provided this should be done at 39 weeks of gestation or later.[46]\\r\\nCaesarean delivery on maternal request (CDMR) is a medically unnecessary caesarean section, where the conduct of a childbirth via a caesarean section is requested by the pregnant patient even though there is not a medical indication to have the surgery.[47]\\r\\nMothers who have previously had a caesarean section are more likely to have a caesarean section for future pregnancies than mothers who have never had a caesarean section. There is discussion about the circumstances under which women should have a vaginal birth after a previous caesarean.\\r\\nVaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) is the practice of birthing a baby vaginally after a previous baby has been delivered by caesarean section (surgically).[48] According to The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), successful VBAC is associated with decreased maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies.[49] According to the American Pregnancy Association, 90% of women who have undergone caesarean deliveries are candidates for VBAC.[27] Approximately 60-80% of women opting for VBAC will successfully give birth vaginally, which is comparable to the overall vaginal delivery rate in the United States in 2010.[27][28][50]\\r\\nFor otherwise healthy twin pregnancies where both twins are head down a trial of vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks.[10][32] Vaginal delivery in this case does not worsen the outcome for either infant as compared with caesarean section.[32] There is controversy on the best method of delivery where the first twin is head first and the second is not.[32] When the first twin is not head down at the point of labour starting, a caesarean section should be recommended.[32] Although the second twin typically has a higher frequency of problems, it is not known if a planned caesarean section affects this.[10] It is estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by caesarean section in 2008.[51]\\r\\nA breech birth is the birth of a baby from a breech presentation, in which the baby exits the pelvis with the buttocks or feet first as opposed to the normal head-first presentation. In breech presentation, fetal heart sounds are heard just above the umbilicus.\\r\\nThe bottom-down position presents some hazards to the baby during the process of birth, and the mode of delivery (vaginal versus caesarean) is controversial in the fields of obstetrics and midwifery.\\r\\nThough vaginal birth is possible for the breech baby, certain fetal and maternal factors influence the safety of vaginal breech birth. The majority of breech babies born in the United States and the UK are delivered by caesarean section as studies have shown increased risks of morbidity and mortality for vaginal breech delivery, and most obstetricians counsel against planned vaginal breech birth for this reason. As a result of reduced numbers of actual vaginal breech deliveries, obstetricians and midwives are at risk of de-skilling in this important skill. All those involved in delivery of obstetric and midwifery care in the UK undergo mandatory training in conducting breech deliveries in the simulation environment (using dummy pelvises and mannequins to allow practice of this important skill) and this training is carried out regularly to keep skills up to date.\\r\\nA resuscitative hysterotomy, also known as a peri-mortem caesarean delivery, is an emergency caesarean delivery carried out where maternal cardiac arrest has occurred, to assist in resuscitation of the mother by removing the aortocaval compression generated by the gravid uterus. Unlike other forms of caesarean section, the welfare of the fetus is a secondary priority only, and the procedure may be performed even prior to the limit of fetal viability if it is judged to be of benefit to the mother.\\r\\nThere are several types of caesarean section (CS). An important distinction lies in the type of incision (longitudinal or transverse) made on the uterus, apart from the incision on the skin: the vast majority of skin incisions are a transverse suprapubic approach known as a Pfannenstiel incision but there is no way of knowing from the skin scar which way the uterine incision was conducted.\\r\\nThe EXIT procedure is a specialized surgical delivery procedure used to deliver babies who have airway compression.\\r\\nThe Misgav Ladach method is a modified caesarean section which has been used nearly all over the world since the 1990s. It was described by Michael Stark, the president of the New European Surgical Academy, at the time he was the director of Misgav Ladach, a general hospital in Jerusalem. The method was presented during a FIGO conference in Montral in 1994[52] and then distributed by the University of Uppsala, Sweden, in more than 100 countries. This method is based on minimalistic principles. He examined all steps in caesarean sections in use, analyzed them for their necessity and, if found necessary, for their optimal way of performance. For the abdominal incision he used the modified Joel Cohen incision and compared the longitudinal abdominal structures to strings on musical instruments. As blood vessels and muscles have lateral sway, it is possible to stretch rather than cut them. The peritoneum is opened by repeat stretching, no abdominal swabs are used, the uterus is closed in one layer with a big needle to reduce the amount of foreign body as much as possible, the peritoneal layers remain unsutured and the abdomen is closed with two layers only. Women undergoing this operation recover quickly and can look after the newborns soon after surgery. There are many publications showing the advantages over traditional caesarean section methods. However, there is an increased risk of abruptio placentae and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies for women who underwent this method in prior deliveries.[53][54]\\r\\nAntibiotic prophylaxis is used before an incision.[55] The uterus is incised, and this incision is extended with blunt pressure along a cephalad-caudad axis.[55] The infant is delivered, and the placenta is then removed.[55] The surgeon then makes a decision about uterine exteriorization.[55] Single-layer uterine closure is used when the mother does not want a future pregnancy.[55] When subcutaneous tissue is 2?cm thick or more, surgical suture is used.[55] Discouraged practices include manual cervical dilation, any subcutaneous drain, or supplemental oxygen therapy with intent to prevent infection.[55]\\r\\nCaesarean section can be performed with single or double layer suturing of the uterine incision.[56] Single layer closure compared with double layer closure has been observed to result in reduced blood loss during the surgery. It is uncertain whether this is the direct effect of the suturing technique or if other factors such as the type and site of abdominal incision contribute to reduced blood loss.[57] Standard procedure includes the closure of the peritoneum. However, research questions this may not be needed, with some studies indicating peritoneal closure is associated with longer operative time and hospital stay.[58] The Misgave Ladach method is a surgery technical that may have fewer secondary complications and faster healing, due to the insertion into the muscle.[59]\\r\\nIn many hospitals the mother's partner is encouraged to attend the surgery to support the mother and share the experience. The anaesthetist will usually lower the drape temporarily as the child is delivered so the parents can see their newborn.[citation needed]\\r\\nBoth general and regional anaesthesia (spinal, epidural or combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia) are acceptable for use during Caesarean section. Evidence does not show a difference between regional anaesthesia and general anaesthesia with respect to major outcomes in the mother or baby.[60] Regional anaesthesia may be preferred as it allows the mother to be awake and interact immediately with her baby.[61] Other advantages of regional anesthesia may include the absence of typical risks of general anesthesia: pulmonary aspiration (which has a relatively high incidence in patients undergoing anesthesia in late pregnancy) of gastric contents and esophageal intubation.[60] However, one trial found no difference in satisfaction when general anaesthesia was compared with either spinal anaesthesia.[60]\\r\\nRegional anaesthesia is used in 95% of deliveries, with spinal and combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia being the most commonly used regional techniques in scheduled Caesarean section.[62] Regional anaesthesia during Caesarean section is different from the analgesia (pain relief) used in labor and vaginal delivery. The pain that is experienced because of surgery is greater than that of labor and therefore requires a more intense nerve block.\\r\\nGeneral anesthesia may be necessary because of specific risks to mother or child. Patients with heavy, uncontrolled bleeding may not tolerate the hemodynamic effects of regional anesthesia. General anesthesia is also preferred in very urgent cases, such as severe fetal distress, when there is no time to perform a regional anesthesia.\\r\\nPostpartum infection is one of the main causes of maternal death and may account for 0% of maternal deaths globally.[63][10][64] Caesarean section greatly increases the risk of infection and associated morbidity (estimated to be between 5 and 20 times as high), and routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infections is recommended.[64] Infection can occur in around 8% of women who have caesareans,[10] largely endometritis, urinary tract infections and wound infections. The use of preventative antibiotics in women undergoing cesarean section decreased wound infection, endometritis, and serious infectious complications by about 65%.[64] Side effects and effect on the baby is unclear.[64]\\r\\nWomen who have caesareans can recognize the signs of fever that indicate the possibility of wound infection.[10] Taking antibiotics before skin incision rather than after cord clamping reduces the risk for the mother, without increasing adverse effects for the baby.[10][65] Whether a particular type of skin cleaner improves outcomes is unclear.[66]\\r\\nSome doctors believe that during a caesarean section, mechanical cervical dilation with a finger or forceps will prevent the obstruction of blood and lochia drainage, and thereby benefit the mother by reducing risk of death.[67] The available clinical evidence is not sufficient to draw a conclusion on the effect of this practice.[67]\\r\\nIt is common for women who undergo caesarian section to have reduced or absent bowel movements for hours to days. During this time, women may experience abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting.This usually resolves without treatment.[68] Abdominal, wound and back pain can continue for months after a caesarean section. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be helpful.[10] Women who have had a caesarean are more likely to experience pain that interferes with their usual activities than women who have vaginal births, although by six months there is generally no longer a difference.[69] However, pain during sexual intercourse is less likely than after vaginal birth, although again, by six months there is no difference.[10]\\r\\nThere may be a somewhat higher incidence of postnatal depression in the first weeks after childbirth for women who have caesarean sections, but this difference does not persist.[10] Some women who have had caesarean sections, especially emergency caesareans, experience post-traumatic stress disorder.[10]\\r\\nIn Italy the incidence of Caesarean sections is particularly high, although it varies from region to region.[70] In Campania, 60% of 2008 births reportedly occurred via Caesarean sections.[71] In the Rome region, the mean incidence is around 44%, but can reach as high as 85% in some private clinics.[72][73]\\r\\nWith nearly 1.3 million stays, Caesarean section was one of the most common procedures performed in U.S. hospitals in 2011. It was the second-most common procedure performed for people ages 18 to 44 years old.[74] Caesarean rates in the U.S. have risen considerably since 1996.[75] The procedure increased 60% from 1996 to 2009. In 2010, the Caesarean delivery rate was 32.8% of all births (a slight decrease from 2009's high of 32.9% of all births).[76] A study found that in 2011, women covered by private insurance were 11% more likely to have a caesarean section delivery than those covered by Medicaid.[77]\\r\\nChina has been cited as having the highest rates of C-sections in the world at 46% as of 2008.[78]\\r\\nStudies have shown that continuity of care with a known carer may significantly decrease the rate of Caesarean delivery[79] but there is also research that appears to show that there is no significant difference in Caesarean rates when comparing midwife continuity care to conventional fragmented care.[80]\\r\\nMore emergency Caesareansabout 66%are performed during the day rather than during the night.[81]\\r\\nThe rate has risen to 46% in China and to levels of 25% and above in many Asian, European and Latin American countries.[82] The rate has increased in the United States, to 33% of all births in 2012, up from 21% in 1996.[3] Across Europe, there are differences between countries: in Italy the Caesarean section rate is 40%, while in the Nordic countries it is 14%.[83]\\r\\nIn the United States C-section rates have increased from just over 20% in 1996 to 33% in 2011.[3] This increase has not resulted in improved outcomes resulting in the position that C-sections may be done too frequently.[3]\\r\\nThe World Health Organization officially withdrew its previous recommendation of a 15% C-section rate in June 2010. Their official statement read, \\"There is no empirical evidence for an optimum percentage. What matters most is that all women who need caesarean sections receive them.\\"[84]\\r\\nThe US National Institutes of Health says rises in rates of Caesarean sections are not, in isolation, a cause for concern, but may reflect changing reproductive patterns: \\"The World Health Organization has determined an ideal rate of all caesarean deliveries (such as 15 percent) for a population.[47]\\r\\nSpeculation explaining a relationship between birth weight and maternal pelvis size has been proposed. The explanation, based on Darwinian-inspired logic, states that since the advent of successful Caesarean birth more mothers with small pelvises and babies with large birth weights survive. This hypothesis would predict an increased average birth weight, which has been observed. It is unclear what component contributes more to this effect; evolution or environment.[85]\\r\\nGlobal rates of caesarean section rates are increasing.[22] In the United Kingdom, in 2008, the Caesarean section rate was 24%.[86] In Ireland the rate was 26.1% in 2009.[87] The Canadian rate was 26% in 2005ÿ2006.[88] Australia has a high Caesarean section rate, at 31% in 2007.[89] In the United States the rate of C-section is around 33% and varies from 23% to 40% depending on the state in question.[3]One out three women who gave birth in the US delivered by cesarean in 2011. In 2012, close to 23 million C-sections were done globally in 2012.[8] At one time the rate of 10% and 15% was thought to be ideal.[4] A higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8] More than 50 nations have rates greater than 27%. Another 45 countries have rates less than 7.5%[8] There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section.[8] In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section.[2][3] The rates in the UK and Australia are 26.5% and 32.3% respectively.?In China, the most recent CS rate reported was 41%.[22] Globally, 1% of all cesarean deliveries are done without the medical need for one. Overall, the rate of caesarean section rate was 25.7% during 2004-2008.[90][91]\\r\\nWound infections occur after cesarean sections at a rate of 3-15%.[22] Some women are at greater risk for developing a surgical site infection after delivery. The presence of choriamnionitis and obesity predisposes the woman to developing a surgical site infection.[22]\\r\\nThe mother of Bindusara (born c. 320 BC, ruled 298?ÿ c. 272 BC), the second Mauryan Samrat (emperor) of India, accidentally consumed poison and died when she was close to delivering him. Chanakya, the Chandragupta's teacher and adviser, made up his mind that the baby should survive. He cut open the belly of the queen and took out the baby, thus saving the baby's life.[92][93]\\r\\nAccording to the ancient Chinese Records of the Grand Historian, Luzhong, a sixth-generation descendant of the Yellow Emperor, had six sons, all born by \\"cutting open the body\\". The sixth son Jilian founded the House of Mi that ruled the State of Chu (c. 1030ÿ223 BC).[94]\\r\\nIn the Irish mythological text the Ulster Cycle, the character Furbaide Ferbend is said to have been born by posthumous caesarean section, after his mother was murdered by his evil aunt Medb.\\r\\nThe Babylonian Talmud, an ancient Jewish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed yotzei dofen. It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother. [93]\\r\\nPliny the Elder theorized that Julius Caesar's name came from an ancestor who was born by caesarean section, but the truth of this is debated (see the discussion of the etymology of Caesar). The Ancient Roman caesarean section was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth. Julius Caesar's mother, Aurelia, lived through childbirth and successfully gave birth to her son, ruling out the possibility the Roman ruler and general was born by caesarean section. His first wife however died in childbirth, giving birth to a stilborn son who might have lived had a caesarean taken place.\\r\\nThe Catalan saint Raymond Nonnatus (1204ÿ1240), received his surnamefrom the Latin non-natus (\\"not born\\")because he was born by caesarean section. His mother died while giving birth to him.[95]\\r\\nAn early account of caesarean section in Iran is mentioned in the book of Shahnameh, written around 1000 AD, and relates to the birth of Rostam, the national legendary hero of Iran.[96][97] According to the Shahnameh, the Simurgh instructed Zal upon how to perform a Caesarean section, thus saving Rudaba and the child Rostam.[98]\\r\\nCaesarean section usually resulted in the death of the mother. In an account from the 1580s, in Siegershausen, Switzerland, Jakob Nufer a pig gelder, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour.[99] However, there is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.[100] For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high mortality rate. However, it was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:\\r\\nEuropean travelers in the Great Lakes region of Africa during the 19th century observed Caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.[101] The expectant mother was normally anesthetized with alcohol, and herbal mixtures were used to encourage healing. From the well-developed nature of the procedures employed, European observers concluded they had been employed for some time.[101] James Barry carried out the first successful Caesarean by a European doctor in Africa in Cape Town, while posted there between 1817 and 1828.[102]\\r\\nThe first successful Caesarean section to be performed in America took place in Mason County, Virginia (now Mason County, West Virginia), in 1794. The procedure was performed by Dr. Jesse Bennett on his wife Elizabeth.[103]\\r\\nOn March 5, 2000, in Mexico, Ins Ramrez performed a Caesarean section on herself and survived, as did her son, Orlando Ruiz Ramrez.[104]\\r\\nThe patron saint of Caesarean section is Caesarius of Africa, a young deacon martyred at Terracina, who has replaced and Christianized the pagan figure of Caesar.[105] The martyr (Saint Cesareo, in italian) is invoked for the good success of this surgical procedure.\\r\\nThe Roman Lex Regia (royal law), later the Lex Caesarea (imperial law), of Numa Pompilius (715ÿ673 BC),[106] required the child of a mother dead in childbirth to be cut from her womb.[107] There was a cultural taboo that mothers not be buried pregnant,[108] that may have reflected a way of saving some fetuses. Roman practice requiring a living mother to be in her tenth month of pregnancy before resorting to the procedure, reflecting the knowledge that she could not survive the delivery.[109] Speculation that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar was born by the method now known as C-section is apparently false.[110] Although Caesarean sections were performed in Roman times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery.[107][111] As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician Maimonides expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant.[112] The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb caedere, \\"to cut\\", with children delivered this way referred to as caesones. Pliny the Elder refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as ab utero caeso, \\"cut from the womb\\" giving this as an explanation for the cognomen \\"Caesar\\" which was then carried by his descendants.[107] Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a false etymology, it has been widely believed. For example, the Oxford English Dictionary defines Caesarean birth as \\"the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar\\".[113] Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th edition) leaves room for etymological uncertainty with the phrase, \\"from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen Caesar\\"[114]\\r\\nSome link with Julius Caesar or with Roman emperors exists in other languages as well. For example, the modern German, Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, Swedish, Turkish and Hungarian terms are respectively Kaiserschnitt, keisersnitt, kejsersnit, keizersnede, kejsarsnitt, sezaryen and csszrmetszs (literally: \\"emperor's cut\\").[115] The German term has also been imported into Japanese (tَP teisekkai) and Korean (?? ?? jewang jeolgae), both literally meaning \\"emperor incision\\". Similarly, in western Slavic (Polish) ci?cie cesarskie, (Czech) csa?sky ?ez and (Slovak) cisrsky rez means \\"emperor's cut\\", whereas the south Slavic term is Serbian Ѷ ѿ and Slovenian crski rz, literally tzar's cut. The Russian term kesarevo secheniye (椿ѿ־ ۿҿ ksarevo se?nije) literally means Caesar's section. The Arabic term (????? ?????? wilaada qaySaryya) also means \\"Caesarean birth.\\" The Hebrew term ????? ????? (nit~akh Keisri) translates literally as Caesarean surgery. In Romania and Portugal,[116] it is usually called cesariana, meaning from (or related to) Caesar.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to Shahnameh ancient Persian book, the hero Rostam was the first person who was born with this method and term ??????? (rostamineh) is corresponded to Caesarean.[citation needed] Also, Hindu mythical monkey god Hanuman was born through a similar procedure on his mother Anjani.\\r\\nFinally, the Roman praenomen (given name) Caeso was said to be given to children who were born via C-section. While this was probably just folk etymology made popular by Pliny the Elder, it was well known by the time the term came into common use.[117]\\r\\nThe term \\"caesarean\\" is spelled in various accepted ways, as discussed at Wiktionary. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) uses \\"cesarean section\\".\\r\\nIn Judaism there is a dispute among the poskim (Rabbinic authorities) as to whether a first-born son from a Caesarean section has the laws of a bechor.[118] Traditionally, a male child delivered by Caesarean is not eligible for the Pidyon HaBen dedication ritual.[119][120]\\r\\nIn rare cases, caesarean sections can be used to remove a dead fetus. A late-term abortion using Caesarean section procedures is termed a hysterotomy abortion and is very rarely performed.[121]\\r\\nSelf-inflicted caesarean section is the concept of a mother alone performing her own caesarean section. There have apparently been a few successful cases, notably Ins Ramrez Prez of Mexico who in March 2000, performed a successful Caesarean section on herself.[122][123][124]","input":"What is the mortality rate for c sections?"},{"output":"3 September 1939","context":"The Declaration of war by France and the United Kingdom was given on 3 September 1939, after German forces invaded Poland.

Yet I cannot believe that there is anything more or anything different that I could have done and that would have been more successful.\\r\\nUp to the very last it would have been quite possible to have arranged a peaceful and honourable settlement between Germany and Poland, but Hitler would not have it.\\r\\nHe had evidently made up his mind to attack Poland whatever happened; and although he now says he put forward reasonable proposals which were rejected by the Poles, that is not a true statement.\\r\\nThe proposals were never shown to the Poles nor to us; and though they were announced in a German broadcast on Thursday night, Hitler did not wait to hear comments on them, but ordered his troops to cross the Polish frontier the next morning.\\r\\nHis action shows convincingly that there is no chance of expecting that this man will ever give up his practice of using force to gain his will. He can only be stopped by force, and we and France are today, in fulfilment of our obligations, going to the aid of Poland, who is so bravely resisting this wicked and unprovoked attack upon her people. We have a clear conscience. We have done all that any country could do to establish peace. The situation in which no word given by Germanys ruler could be trusted and no people or country could feel itself safe has become intolerable.\\r\\nAnd now that we have resolved to finish it, I know that you will all play your part with calmness and courage.\\r\\nAt such a moment as this the assurances of support that we have received from the Empire are a source of profound encouragement to us.\\r\\nWhen I have finished speaking certain detailed announcements will be made on behalf of the Government.

It is the evil things that we shall be fighting against ÿ brute force, bad faith, injustice, oppression and persecution ÿ and against them I am certain that the right will prevail.\\r\\nAt the conclusion of the First World War, the German Empire signed the First Armistice at Compigne on 11 November 1918 as an end to hostilities with France, the British Empire, and the United States during the convoluted German Revolution of 1918ÿ19, which began 29 October 1918.\\r\\nNegotiations between the Allied powers regarding post-war Europe started on 18 January 1919 in the Salle de l'Horloge at the French Foreign Ministry on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris. Seventy delegates from 27 nations participated in the negotiations. The opposing nations of the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were excluded from the negotiations. At first a \\"Council of Ten\\" comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy and Japan met officially to decide the peace terms. It became the \\"Big Four\\" when Japan dropped out and the top person from each of the other four nations met in 145 closed sessions to make all the major decisions to be ratified by the entire assembly. In June 1919, the Allies declared that war would resume if the German government did not sign the treaty they had agreed to among themselves. The government headed by Philipp Scheidemann was unable to agree on a common position, and Scheidemann himself resigned rather than agree to sign the treaty. Gustav Bauer, the head of the new government, sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn, including articles 227, 230 and 231. In response, the Allies issued an ultimatum stating that Germany would have to accept the treaty or face an invasion of Allied forces across the Rhine within 24 hours. On 23 June 1919, Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty.\\r\\nOn 28 June 1919, Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, a peace treaty which ended the formal state of war and imposed various punitive measures upon Germany, including military restriction, loss of territory and colonies, war debt, and effective acceptance of blame for the initiation of hostilities in World War I. At the time of the armistice, an attempted Communist revolution transpired (October 1918-August 1919), resulting in the abdication of the Emperor of Germany in November 1918, and what became known as the Weimar Republic was subsequently established in the wake of the uprising. The transition from monarchy to republic was difficult, and many in the new government were not supportive of the democratic system of government. The officer class gave little support to the Republic, and Germany was forced to borrow money from the United States and others to pay its war debt, imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. In the early 1920s a period of hyperinflation made the Reichsmark almost worthless. In January 1922, one US dollar was worth 191 Marks, but by November of the same year it was equal to 4,200,000,000 Marks.[2]\\r\\nIn 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of the Reich following a contentious election. Under Hitler's leadership, the Reichstag turned the government into an effective dictatorship under Hitler's oversight on 21 March 1933 with the passage of the Enabling Act of 1933, and the economic hardships were significantly diminished via implementation of new economic and social policies. After five years in power, Hitler annexed Austria, former component of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (allies of the former German Empire), into Germany, despite such an act (specifically, \\"prohibition on the merging of Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations\\") being banned by both the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the Treaty of Versailles. In early November 1938, the First Vienna Award was signed, allowing Germany to seize the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia which had been a part of the German Empire-allied Austro-Hungarian Empire. Soon after, Germany invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia and also gained Memelland (part of the former German Empire from 1871-1920) through the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania.\\r\\nWhile some sources claim Hitler still wanted more, to create Lebensraum, or \\"living space\\", for Germany, other sources claim evidence of hostility on behalf of Polish partisans toward ethnic Germans in the Danzig Corridor (territory lost to Germany as a result of the Treaty of Versailles) which may have served as a motivating factor for the German invasion (often portrayed as propaganda to justify German expansionism).\\r\\nTwo Western powers, the United Kingdom and France, gave guarantees to Poland that they would declare war if Polish independence came under threat, as presented in a statement to the House of Commons by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 31 March 1939 (formalized by the British 6 April 1939; not ratified until 4 September 1939 by the French):\\r\\n... in the event of any action which clearly threatened Polish independence, and which the Polish Government accordingly considered it vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty's Government would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Polish Government all support in their power. They have given the Polish Government an assurance to this effect.\\r\\nI may add that the French Government have authorised me to make it plain that they stand in the same position in this matter as do His Majesty's Government.[3]\\r\\nAlthough they honoured these guarantees by declaring war soon after Germany's Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939,[4] and although the dominions of the British Empire quickly followed suit, so little practical assistance was given to Poland, which was soon defeated, that in its early stages the war declared by Britain and France was described as a \\"Phoney War\\".\\r\\nFurther, neither the British Empire, nor the French, ever declared war upon the Soviet Union, which invaded Poland on 17 September 1939 (17 days after Nazi Germany invaded from the West) and held sway over the former-Polish territory at the war's conclusion, having become a part of the Allied front in the course of World War II. At the insistence of Joseph Stalin, the post-war Yalta Conference in 1945 sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the Polish government-in-exile based in London.\\r\\nThe following excerpts of the speech were sampled by the drum and bass artist S.P.Y. in his remix of Black Sun Empire's track \\"Potemkin\\":[5]\\r\\n- \\"that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us\\"\\r\\n- \\"I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany\\",","input":"When did britain declare war on germany ww2?"},{"output":"set the peace terms for the defeated Central Powers","context":"The Paris Peace Conference, also known as Versailles Peace Conference, was the meeting of the victorious Allied Powers following the end of World War I to set the peace terms for the defeated Central Powers.\\r\\nInvolving diplomats from 32 countries and nationalities, the major or main decisions were the creation of the League of Nations, as well as the five peace treaties with the defeated states; the awarding of German and Ottoman overseas possessions as \\"mandates\\", chiefly to Britain and France; reparations imposed on Germany; and the drawing of new national boundaries (sometimes with plebiscites) to better reflect ethnic boundaries.\\r\\nThe main result was the Treaty of Versailles with Germany, which in section 231 laid the guilt for the war on \\"the aggression of Germany and her allies\\". This provision proved humiliating for Germany and set the stage for the expensive reparations Germany was intended to pay (it paid only a small portion before reparations ended in 1931). The five major powers (France, Britain, Italy, Japan and the United States of America) controlled the Conference. And the \\"Big Four\\" were the Prime Minister of France, Georges Clemenceau; the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George; the President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson; and the Prime Minister of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele Orlando. They met together informally 145 times and made all the major decisions, which in turn were ratified by the others.[1] The conference began on January 18, 1919 and with respect to its end date Professor Michael Neiberg has noted:\\r\\nAlthough the senior statesmen stopped working personally on the conference in June 1919, the formal peace process did not really end until July 1923, when the Treaty of Lausanne was signed\\".[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Conference opened on 18 January 1919.[3] This date was symbolic, as it was the anniversary of the proclamation of William I as German Emperor in 1871, in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles, shortly before the end of the Siege of Paris[4] - a day itself imbued with significance in its turn in Germany as the anniversary of the establishment of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.[5] The Delegates from 27 nations (delegates representing 5 nationalities were for the most part ignored) were assigned to 52 commissions, which held 1,646 sessions to prepare reports, with the help of many experts, on topics ranging from prisoners of war to undersea cables, to international aviation, to responsibility for the war. Key recommendations were folded into the Treaty of Versailles with Germany, which had 15 chapters and 440 clauses, as well as treaties for the other defeated nations.\\r\\nThe five major powers (France, Britain, Italy, the U.S., and Japan) controlled the Conference. Amongst the \\"Big Five\\", in practice Japan only sent a former prime minister and played a small role; and the \\"Big Four\\" leaders dominated the conference.[6] The four met together informally 145 times and made all the major decisions, which in turn were ratified by other attendees.[1] The open meetings of all the delegations approved the decisions made by the Big Four. The conference came to an end on 21 January 1920 with the inaugural General Assembly of the League of Nations.[7][8]\\r\\nFive major peace treaties were prepared at the Paris Peace Conference (with, in parentheses, the affected countries):\\r\\nThe major decisions were the establishment of the League of Nations; the five peace treaties with defeated enemies; the awarding of German and Ottoman overseas possessions as \\"mandates\\", chiefly to members of the British Empire and to France; reparations imposed on Germany, and the drawing of new national boundaries (sometimes with plebiscites) to better reflect the forces of nationalism. The main result was the Treaty of Versailles, with Germany, which in section 231 laid the guilt for the war on \\"the aggression of Germany and her allies\\". This provision proved humiliating for Germany and set the stage for very high reparations Germany was supposed to pay (it paid only a small portion before reparations ended in 1931).\\r\\nAs the conference's decisions were enacted unilaterally, and largely on the whims of the Big Four, for its duration Paris was effectively the center of a world government, which deliberated over and implemented the sweeping changes to the political geography of Europe. Most famously, the Treaty of Versailles itself weakened Germany's military and placed full blame for the war and costly reparations on Germany's shoulders?ÿ the humiliation and resentment in Germany is sometimes considered[by whom?] one of the causes of Nazi electoral successes and indirectly a cause of World War II. The League of Nations proved controversial in the United States as critics said it subverted the powers of Congress to declare war; the U.S. Senate did not ratify any of the peace treaties and the U.S. never joined the League?ÿ instead, the Harding administration of 1921-1923 concluded new treaties with Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Republican Germany was not invited to attend the conference at Versailles. Representatives of White Russia (but not Communist Russia) were present. Numerous other nations did send delegations in order to appeal for various unsuccessful additions to the treaties; parties lobbied for causes ranging from independence for the countries of the South Caucasus to Japan's unsuccessful demand for racial equality amongst the other Great Powers.\\r\\nA central issue of the Conference was the disposition of the overseas colonies of Germany. (Austria did not have colonies and the Ottoman Empire presented a separate issue.)[9][10]\\r\\nThe British dominions wanted their reward for their sacrifice. Australia wanted New Guinea, New Zealand wanted Samoa, and South Africa wanted South West Africa (modern Namibia). Wilson wanted the League of Nations to administer all the German colonies until such time as they were ready for independence. Lloyd George realized he needed to support his dominions, and he proposed a compromise that there be three types of mandates. Mandates for the Turkish provinces were one category; they would be divided up between Britain and France.\\r\\nThe second category, comprising New Guinea, Samoa, and South West Africa, were located so close to responsible supervisors that the mandates could hardly be given to anyone except Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Finally, the African colonies would need the careful supervision as \\"Class B\\" mandates that could only be provided by experienced colonial powers Britain, France, and Belgium; Italy and Portugal received small bits of territory. Wilson and the others finally went along with the solution.[11] The dominions received \\"Class C Mandates\\"to the colonies they wanted. Japan obtained mandates over German possessions north of the equator.[12][13][14]\\r\\nWilson wanted no mandates for the United States; his top advisor Colonel House was deeply involved in awarding the others.[15] Wilson was especially offended by Australian demands. He and Hughes had some memorable clashes, with the most famous being:\\r\\nWilson: \\"But after all, you speak for only five million people.\\" Hughes: \\"I represent sixty thousand dead.\\" (The much larger the United States had suffered 50,000 deaths.)[16]\\r\\nMaintenance of the British Empire's unity, holdings and interests were an overarching concern for the British delegates to the conference, but it entered the conference with the more specific goals of:\\r\\nThe Racial Equality Proposal put forth by the Japanese did not directly conflict with any of these core British interests. However, as the conference progressed the full implications of the Racial Equality Proposal, regarding immigration to the British Dominions (with Australia taking particular exception), would become a major point of contention within the delegation.\\r\\nUltimately, Britain did not see the Racial Equality proposal as being one of the fundamental aims of the conference. The delegation was therefore willing to sacrifice this proposal in order to placate the Australian delegation and thus help satisfy its overarching aim of preserving the unity of the British Empire.[18]\\r\\nAlthough Britain reluctantly consented to the attendance of separate Dominion delegations, the British did manage to rebuff attempts by the envoys of the newly proclaimed Irish Republic to put its case to the Conference for self-determination, diplomatic recognition and membership of the proposed League of Nations. The Irish envoys' final \\"Demand for Recognition\\" in a letter to Clemenceau, the Chairman, was not answered.[19] Britain had planned to legislate for two Irish Home Rule states (without Dominion status), and did so in 1920. In 1919 Irish nationalists were unpopular with the Allies because of the Conscription Crisis of 1918[citation needed].\\r\\nDavid Lloyd George commented that he did \\"not do badly\\" at the peace conference, \\"considering I was seated between Jesus Christ and Napoleon.\\" This was a reference to the very idealistic views of Wilson on the one hand and the stark realism of Clemenceau, who was determined to see Germany punished.[20]\\r\\nThe Dominion governments were not originally given separate invitations to the conference, but rather were expected to send representatives as part of the British delegation.[21]\\r\\nConvinced that Canada had become a nation on the battlefields of Europe, its Prime Minister, Sir Robert Borden, demanded that it have a separate seat at the conference. This was initially opposed not only by Britain but also by the United States, which saw a dominion delegation as an extra British vote. Borden responded by pointing out that since Canada had lost nearly 60,000 men, a far larger proportion of its men compared to the 50,000 American losses, at least had the right to the representation of a \\"minor\\" power. The British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, eventually relented, and convinced the reluctant Americans to accept the presence of delegations from Canada, India, Australia, Newfoundland, New Zealand and South Africa. They also received their own seats in the League of Nations.[22]\\r\\nCanada, although it too had sacrificed nearly 60,000 men in the war, asked for neither reparations nor mandates.[23]\\r\\nThe Australian delegation, led by the Australian Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, fought hard for its demands: reparations, the annexation of German New Guinea and rejection of the Japanese racial equality proposal. Hughes said that he had no objection to the equality proposal provided it was stated in unambiguous terms that it did not confer any right to enter Australia. Hughes was concerned by the rise of Japan. Within months of the declaration of the War in 1914, Japan, Australia and New Zealand had seized all German possessions in the Far East and Pacific. Though Japan occupied German possessions with the blessings of the British, Hughes was alarmed by this policy.[24]\\r\\nThe French Prime Minister, Georges Clemenceau, controlled his delegation and his chief goal was to weaken Germany militarily, strategically and economically.[25][26] Having personally witnessed two German attacks on French soil in the last forty years, he was adamant that Germany should not be permitted to attack France again. In particular, Clemenceau sought an American and British guarantee of French security in the event of another German attack.\\r\\nClemenceau also expressed skepticism and frustration with Wilson's Fourteen Points: \\"Mr. Wilson bores me with his fourteen points\\", complained Clemenceau. \\"Why, God Almighty has only ten!\\" Wilson won a few points by signing a mutual defense treaty with France, but back in Washington he did not present it to the Senate for ratification and it never took effect.[27]\\r\\nAnother alternative French policy was to seek a rapprochement with Germany. In May 1919 the diplomat Ren Massigli was sent on several secret missions to Berlin. During his visits Massigli offered on behalf of his government to revise the territorial and economic clauses of the upcoming peace treaty.[28] Massigli spoke of the desirability of \\"practical, verbal discussions\\" between French and German officials that would lead to a \\"collaboration Franco-allemande\\".[28] Furthermore, Massagli told the Germans that the French thought of the \\"Anglo-Saxon powers\\", namely the United States and British Empire, to be the major threat to France in the post-war world. He argued that both France and Germany had a joint interest in opposing \\"Anglo-Saxon domination\\" of the world and warned that the \\"deepening of opposition\\" between the French and the Germans \\"would lead to the ruin of both countries, to the advantage of the Anglo-Saxon powers\\".[29]\\r\\nThe Germans rejected the French offers because they considered the French overtures to be a trap to trick them into accepting the Versailles treaty \\"as is\\" and because the German foreign minister, Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau thought that the United States was more likely to reduce the severity of the peace terms than France.[29] In the final event it proved to be Lloyd George who pushed for more favourable terms for Germany.\\r\\nIn 1914 Italy remained neutral despite its alliance with Germany and Austria. In 1915 it joined the Allies. It was motivated by gaining the territories promised by the Allies in the secret Treaty of London: the Trentino, the Tyrol as far as Brenner, Trieste and Istria, most of the Dalmatian coast except Fiume, Valona and a protectorate over Albania, Antalya in Turkey and possibly colonies in Africa or Asia.\\r\\nThe Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando tried, therefore, to get full implementation of the Treaty of London, as agreed by France and Great Britain before the war. He had popular support, for the loss of 700,000 soldiers and a budget deficit of 12,000,000,000 Lire during the war made the Italian government and people feel entitled to all these territories and even more not mentioned in the Treaty of London, in particular the city of Fiume, which many Italians believed should be annexed to Italy because of the Italian population.[30]\\r\\nIn the meetings of the \\"Big Four\\", in which Orlando's powers of diplomacy were inhibited by his lack of English, the others were only willing to offer Trentino to the Brenner, the Dalmatian port of Zara and some of the Dalmatian islands. All other territories were promised to other nations and the great powers were worried about Italy's imperial ambitions. Even though Italy did get most of its demands, Orlando was refused Fiume, most of Dalmatia and any colonial gain, so he left the conference in a rage.[31]\\r\\nThere was a general disappointment in Italy, which the nationalist and fascist parties used to build the idea that Italy was betrayed by the Allies and refused what was due (Mutilated victory). This led to the general rise of Italian fascism.\\r\\nPrior to Wilson's arrival in Europe in December 1918, no American president had ever visited Europe while in office.[32] Wilson's Fourteen Points, of a year earlier, had helped win the hearts and minds of many as the war ended; these included Americans and Europeans generally, as well as Germany, its allies and the former subjects of the Ottoman Empire specifically.\\r\\nWilson's diplomacy and his Fourteen Points had essentially established the conditions for the armistices that had brought an end to World War I. Wilson felt it was his duty and obligation to the people of the world to be a prominent figure at the peace negotiations. High hopes and expectations were placed on him to deliver what he had promised for the post-war era. In doing so, Wilson ultimately began to lead the foreign policy of the United States toward interventionism, a move strongly resisted in some domestic circles.\\r\\nOnce Wilson arrived, however, he found \\"rivalries, and conflicting claims previously submerged\\".[33] He worked mostly trying to sway the direction that the French (Georges Clemenceau) and British (Lloyd George) delegations were taking towards Germany and its allies in Europe, as well as the former Ottoman lands in the Middle East. Wilson's attempts to gain acceptance of his Fourteen Points ultimately failed, after France and Britain refused to adopt some specific points and its core principles.\\r\\nIn Europe, several of his Fourteen Points conflicted with the other powers. The United States did not encourage or believe that the responsibility for the war that Article 231 placed on Germany was fair or warranted.[34] It would not be until 1921 that the United States finally signed separate peace treaties with Germany, Austria, and Hungary.\\r\\nIn the Middle East, negotiations were complicated by competing aims, claims, and the new mandate system. The United States hoped to establish a more liberal and diplomatic world, as stated in the Fourteen Points, where democracy, sovereignty, liberty and self-determination would be respected. France and Britain, on the other hand, already controlled empires, wielded power over their subjects around the world and still aspired to be dominant colonial powers.\\r\\nIn light of the previously secret SykesÿPicot Agreement, and following the adoption of the mandate system on the Arab province of the former Ottoman lands, the conference heard statements from competing Zionist and Arab claimants. President Woodrow Wilson then recommended an international commission of inquiry to ascertain the wishes of the local inhabitants. The Commission idea, first accepted by Great Britain and France, was later rejected. Eventually it became the purely American KingÿCrane Commission, which toured all Syria and Palestine during the summer of 1919, taking statements and sampling opinion.[33] Its report, presented to President Wilson, was kept secret from the public until The New York Times broke the story in December 1922.[35] A pro-Zionist joint resolution on Palestine was passed by Congress in September 1922.[36]\\r\\nFrance and Britain tried to appease the American President by consenting to the establishment of his League of Nations. However, because isolationist sentiment was strong and some of the articles in the League's charter conflicted with the United States Constitution, the United States never ratified the Treaty of Versailles nor joined the League of Nations,[37] which President Wilson had helped create, to further peace through diplomacy rather than war and conditions which can breed it.\\r\\nUnder President Warren Harding the United States signed separate treaties with Germany,[38] Austria,[39] and Hungary[40] in 1921.\\r\\nJapan sent a large delegation headed by the former Prime Minister, Marquis Saionji Kinmochi. It was originally one of the \\"big five\\" but relinquished that role because of its slight interest in European affairs. Instead it focused on two demands: the inclusion of their racial equality proposal in the League's Covenant and Japanese territorial claims with respect to former German colonies, namely Shantung (including Kiaochow) and the Pacific islands north of the Equator (the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, the Mariana Islands, and the Carolines). The former Foreign Minister Baron Makino Nobuaki was de facto chief while Saionji's role was symbolic and limited by his ill health. The Japanese delegation became unhappy after receiving only one-half of the rights of Germany, and walked out of the conference.[41]\\r\\nJapan proposed the inclusion of a \\"racial equality clause\\" in the Covenant of the League of Nations on 13 February as an amendment to Article 21.[42] It read:\\r\\nThe equality of nations being a basic principle of the League of Nations, the High Contracting Parties agree to accord as soon as possible to all alien nationals of states, members of the League, equal and just treatment in every respect making no distinction, either in law or in fact, on account of their race or nationality.\\r\\nBecause he knew that Great Britain was critical to the decision, President Wilson, as Conference chairman, ruled that a unanimous vote was required. On 11 April 1919, the commission held a final session and the proposal received a majority of votes, but Great Britain and Australia opposed it. The Australians had lobbied the British to defend Australia's White Australia policy. The defeat of the proposal influenced Japan's turn from cooperation with the West toward more nationalistic policies.[43]\\r\\nThe Japanese claim to Shantung was disputed by the Chinese. In 1914 at the outset of World War I Japan had seized the territory granted to Germany in 1897. They also seized the German islands in the Pacific north of the equator. In 1917, Japan had made secret agreements with Britain, France, and Italy that guaranteed their annexation of these territories. With Britain, there was a mutual agreement, Japan also agreeing to support British annexation of the Pacific islands south of the equator. Despite a generally pro-Chinese view on behalf of the American delegation, Article 156 of the Treaty of Versailles transferred German concessions in Jiaozhou Bay, China to Japan rather than returning sovereign authority to China. The leader of the Chinese delegation, Lou Tseng-Tsiang, demanded that a reservation be inserted before he would sign the treaty. The reservation was denied, and the treaty was signed by all the delegations except that of China. Chinese outrage over this provision led to demonstrations known as the May Fourth Movement. The Pacific islands north of the equator became a class C mandate administered by Japan.[44]\\r\\nPrime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos took part in the Paris Peace Conference as Greece's chief representative. President Woodrow Wilson was said to have placed Venizelos first in point of personal ability among all delegates gathered in Paris to settle the terms of Peace.[45]\\r\\nVenizelos proposed the Greek expansion on Thrace and Asia Minor (lands of the defeated Kingdom of Bulgaria and Ottoman Empire), Northern Epirus, Imvros and Tenedos, aiming to the realization of the Megali Idea. He also reached an agreement with the Italians on the cession of the Dodecanese (VenizelosÿTittoni agreement). For the Greeks of Pontus he proposed a common Pontic-Armenian State.\\r\\nAs a liberal politician, Venizelos was a strong supporter of the Fourteen Points and of the League of Nations.\\r\\nThe Chinese delegation was led by Lou Tseng-Tsiang, accompanied by Wellington Koo and Cao Rulin. Before the Western powers, Koo demanded that Germany's concessions on Shandong be returned to China. He further called for an end to imperialist institutions such as extraterritoriality, legation guards, and foreign leaseholds. Despite American support and the ostensible spirit of self-determination, the Western powers refused his claims, transferring the German concessions to Japan instead. This sparked widespread student protests in China on 4 May, later known as the May Fourth Movement, eventually pressuring the government into refusing to sign the Treaty of Versailles. Thus the Chinese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference was the only one not to sign the treaty at the signing ceremony.[46]\\r\\nWhile Russia was formally excluded from the Conference,[47] despite having fought the Central Powers for three years, the Russian Provincial Council (chaired by Prince Lvov[48]), the successor to the Russian Constituent Assembly and the political arm of the Russian White movement attended the conference. It was represented by the former Tsarist minister Sergey Sazonov[3] who, ironically, if the Tsar had not been overthrown would most likely have attended the conference anyway. The Council maintained the position of an indivisible Russia, but some were prepared to negotiate over the loss of Poland and Finland.[49] The Council suggested all matters relating to territorial claims, or demands for autonomy within the former Russian Empire, be referred to a new All-Russian Constituent Assembly.\\r\\nUkraine had its best opportunity to win recognition and support from foreign powers at the Conference of 1919.[50] At a meeting of the Big Five on 16 January, Lloyd George called Ukrainian leader Symon Petliura (1874ÿ1926) an adventurer and dismissed Ukraine as an anti-Bolshevik stronghold. Sir Eyre Crowe, British undersecretary of state for foreign affairs, spoke against a union of East Galicia and Poland. The British cabinet never decided whether to support a united or dismembered Russia. The United States was sympathetic to a strong, united Russia as a counterpoise to Japan, but Britain feared a threat to India. Petliura appointed Count Tyshkevich his representative to the Vatican, and Pope Benedict XV recognized Ukrainian independence. Ukraine was effectively ignored.[51]\\r\\nA Delegation of the Belarusian Democratic Republic under Prime Minister Anton ?uckievi? also participated in the conference, attempting to gain international recognition of the independence of Belarus. On the way to the conference, the delegation was received by Czechoslovak president Tom? Masaryk in Prague. During the conference, ?uckievi? had meetings with the exiled Foreign Minister of admiral Kolchak's Russian government Sergey Sazonov and the Prime Minister of Poland Ignacy Jan Paderewski.[52]\\r\\nAt the insistence of President Wilson, the Big Four required Poland to sign a treaty on 28 June 1919 that guaranteed minority rights in the new nation. Poland signed under protest and made little effort to enforce the specified rights for Germans, Jews, Ukrainians, and other minorities. Similar treaties were signed by Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and later by Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. Estonia had already given cultural autonomy to minorities in its declaration of independence. Finland and Germany were not asked to sign a minority rights treaty.[53]\\r\\nIn Poland, the key provisions were to become fundamental laws that overrode any national legal codes or legislation. The new country pledged to assure \\"full and complete protection of life and liberty to all individuals...without distinction of birth, nationality, language, race, or religion.\\" Freedom of religion was guaranteed to everyone. Most residents were given citizenship, but there was considerable ambiguity on who was covered. The treaty guaranteed basic civil, political, and cultural rights, and required all citizens to be equal before the law and enjoy identical rights of citizens and workers. Polish was of the national language, but the treaty provided that minority languages could be freely used privately, in commerce, religion, the press, at public meetings, and before all courts. Minorities were to be permitted to establish and control at their own expense private charities, churches and social institutions, as well as schools, without interference from the government. The government was required to set up German-language public schools in those districts that had been German territory before the war. All education above the primary level was to be conducted exclusively in the national language. Article 12 was the enforcement clause; it gave the Council of the League of Nations responsibility for monitoring and enforcing each treaty.[54][55]\\r\\nThe three South Caucasian republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia as well as the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus each sent a delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Their attempts to gain protection from threats posed by the ongoing Russian Civil War largely failed as none of the major powers was interested in taking a mandate over the Caucasian territories. After a series of delays, the three South Caucasian countries ultimately gained de facto recognition from the Supreme Council of the Allied powers, but only when all European troops had been withdrawn from the Caucasus except for a British contingent in Batumi. Georgia was recognized de facto on 12 January 1920, followed by Azerbaijan on the same day and Armenia on 19 January 1920. The Allied leaders decided to limit their assistance to the Caucasian republics to arms, munitions, and food supply.[56]\\r\\nThe Armenian delegation was represented by Avetis Aharonyan, Hamo Ohanjanyan, Armen Garo and others. Azerbaijan's mission was headed by Alimardan Topchubashev. The delegation from Georgia included Nikolay Chkheidze, Irakli Tsereteli, Zurab Avalishvili, and others.\\r\\nA delegation of Koreans from China and Hawaii did make it to Paris. Included in this delegation, was a representative from the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai, Kim Kyu-sik.[57] They were aided by the Chinese, who were eager for the opportunity to embarrass Japan at the international forum. Several top Chinese leaders at the time, including Sun Yat-sen, told U.S. diplomats that the peace conference should take up the question of Korean independence. Beyond that, however, the Chinese, locked in a struggle against the Japanese themselves, could do little for Korea.[58] Apart from China, no nation took the Koreans seriously at the Paris conference because of its status as a Japanese colony.[59] The failure of the Korean nationalists to gain support from the Paris Peace Conference ended the possibility of foreign support.[60]\\r\\nFollowing the Conference's decision to separate the former Arab provinces from the Ottoman Empire and to apply the newly conceived mandate-system to them, the Zionist Organization submitted their draft resolutions for consideration by the Peace Conference on 3 February 1919.\\r\\nThe statement included five main points:[61]\\r\\nHowever, despite these attempts to influence the conference, the Zionists were instead constrained by Article 7 of the resulting Palestine Mandate to merely having the right of obtaining Palestinian citizenship: \\"The Administration of Palestine shall be responsible for enacting a nationality law. There shall be included in this law provisions framed so as to facilitate the acquisition of Palestinian citizenship by Jews who take up their permanent residence in Palestine.\\"[62]\\r\\nCiting the Balfour Declaration, the Zionists suggested that the British had already recognized the historic title of the Jews to Palestine in 1917.[61] The preamble of the British Mandate of 1922, in which the Balfour Declaration was incorporated, stated: \\"Whereas recognition has thereby been given to the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine and to the grounds for reconstituting their national home in that country ...\\".[63]\\r\\nThe remaking of the world map at these conferences gave birth to a number of critical conflict-prone international contradictions, which would become one of the causes of World War II.[64] The British historian Eric Hobsbawm claimed:\\r\\n[N]o equally systematic attempt has been made before or since, in Europe or anywhere else, to redraw the political map on national lines. [...] The logical implication of trying to create a continent neatly divided into coherent territorial states each inhabited by separate ethnically and linguistically homogeneous population, was the mass expulsion or extermination of minorities. Such was and is the reductio ad absurdum of nationalism in its territorial version, although this was not fully demonstrated until the 1940s.[65]\\r\\nIt has long been argued that Wilson's Fourteen Points, in particular, the principle of national self-determination, were primarily anti-Left measures, designed to tame the revolutionary fever sweeping across Europe in the wake of the October Revolution and the end of the war by playing the nationalist card.[66]\\r\\nFrom the other side of the political spectrum, John Lewis Gaddis likewise writes: \\"When Woodrow Wilson made the principle of self-determination one of this Fourteen Points his intent had been to undercut the appeal of Bolshevism\\" (Gaddis 2005, p.?121).\\r\\nThis view has a long history, and can be summarised by Ray Stannard Baker's famous remark that \\"Paris cannot be understood without Moscow.\\" See McFadden 1993, p.?191.","input":"What was the intent of the paris peace talks?"},{"output":"1 July 1997","context":"The transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China, referred to as \\"the Handover\\" or \\"the Return\\" internationally, took place on 1 July 1997. The landmark event marked the end of British administration in Hong Kong, and is often regarded as marking the end of the British Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHong Kong's territory was acquired from three separate treaties: the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, the Convention of Peking in 1860, and The Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory in 1898, which gave the UK the control of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon (area south of Boundary Street), and the New Territories (area north of Boundary Street and south of the Sham Chun River, and outlying islands), respectively.\\r\\nAlthough Hong Kong Island and Kowloon had been ceded to the United Kingdom in perpetuity, the control on the New Territories was a 99-year lease. The finite nature of the 99-year lease did not hinder Hong Kong's development as the New Territories were combined as a part of Hong Kong.\\r\\nHowever, by 1997, it was impractical to separate the three territories and only return the New Territories. In addition, with the scarcity of land and natural resources in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, the New Territories were being developed with large-scale infrastructures and other developments, with the break-even day lying well past 30 June 1997. Thus, the status of the New Territories after the expiry of the 99-year lease became important for Hong Kong's economic development.[1]\\r\\nWhen the People's Republic of China obtained its seat in the United Nations as a result of the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 in 1971, it began to act diplomatically on the sovereignty issues of Hong Kong and Macau. In March 1972, the Chinese UN representative, Huang Hua, wrote to the United Nations Decolonization Committee to state the position of the Chinese government:\\r\\nThe same year, on 8 November, the United Nations General Assembly passed the resolution on removing Hong Kong and Macau from the official list of colonies.[2]\\r\\nIn March 1979 the Governor of Hong Kong, Murray MacLehose, paid his first official visit to the People's Republic of China (PRC), taking the initiative to raise the question of Hong Kong's sovereignty with Deng Xiaoping.[3] Without clarifying and establishing the official position of the PRC government, the arranging of real estate leases and loans agreements in Hong Kong within the next 18 years would become difficult.[1]\\r\\nIn response to concerns over land leases in the New Territories, MacLehose proposed that British administration of the whole of Hong Kong, as opposed to sovereignty, be allowed to continue after 1997.[4] He also proposed that contracts include the phrase \\"for so long as the Crown administers the territory\\".[5]\\r\\nIn fact, as early as the mid-1970s, Hong Kong had faced additional risks raising loans for large-scale infrastructure projects such as its Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system and a new airport. Caught unprepared, Deng asserted the necessity of Hong Kong's return to China, upon which Hong Kong would be given special status by the PRC government.\\r\\nMacLehose's visit to the PRC raised the curtain on the issue of Hong Kong's sovereignty: Britain was made aware of the PRC's aspiration to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong and began to make arrangements accordingly to ensure the sustenance of her interests within the territory, as well as initiating the creation of a withdrawal plan in case of emergency.\\r\\nThree years later, Deng received the former British Prime Minister Edward Heath, who had been dispatched as the special envoy of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to establish an understanding of the PRC's view with regards to the question of Hong Kong; during their meeting, Deng outlined his plans to make the territory a special economic zone, which would retain its capitalist system under Chinese sovereignty.[6]\\r\\nIn the same year, Edward Youde, who succeeded MacLehose as the 26th Governor of Hong Kong, led a delegation of five Executive Councillors to London, including Chung Sze-yuen, Lydia Dunn, and Roger Lobo.[7] Chung presented their position on the sovereignty of Hong Kong to Thatcher, encouraging her to take into consideration the interests of the native Hong Kong population in her upcoming visit to China.[7]\\r\\nIn light of the increasing openness of the PRC government and economic reforms on the mainland, the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sought the PRC's agreement to a continued British presence in the territory.[8]\\r\\nHowever, the PRC took a contrary position: not only did the PRC wish for the New Territories, on lease until 1997, to be placed under the PRC's jurisdiction, it also refused to recognize the \\"unfair and unequal treaties\\" under which Hong Kong Island and Kowloon had been ceded to Britain in perpetuity.[9] Consequently, the PRC recognized only the British administration in Hong Kong, but not British sovereignty.[9]\\r\\nIn the wake of Governor MacLehose's visit, Britain and the PRC established initial diplomatic contact for further discussions of the Hong Kong question, paving the way for Thatcher's first visit to the PRC in September 1982.[10]\\r\\nMargaret Thatcher, in discussion with Deng Xiaoping, reiterated the validity of an extension of the lease of Hong Kong territory, particularly in light of binding treaties, including the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, the Convention of Peking in 1856, and the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory signed in 1890.\\r\\nIn response, Deng Xiaoping cited clearly the lack of room for compromise on the question of sovereignty over Hong Kong; the PRC, as the successor of Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China on the mainland, would recover the entirety of the New Territories, Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. China considered treaties about Hong Kong as unequal and ultimately refused to accept any outcome that would indicate permanent loss of sovereignty over Hong Kong's area, whatever wording the former treaties had.[11]\\r\\nDuring talks with Thatcher, China planned to invade and seize Hong Kong if the negotiations set off unrest in the colony. Thatcher later said that Deng told her bluntly that China could easily take Hong Kong by force, stating that \\"I could walk in and take the whole lot this afternoon\\", to which she replied that \\"there is nothing I could do to stop you, but the eyes of the world would now know what China is like\\".[12]\\r\\nAfter her visit with Deng in Beijing, Thatcher was received in Hong Kong as the first British Prime Minister to set foot on the territory whilst in office. At a press conference, Thatcher re-emphasised the validity of the three treaties, asserting the need for countries to respect treaties on universal terms: \\"There are three treaties in existence; we stick by our treaties unless we decide on something else. At the moment, we stick by our treaties.\\".[8]\\r\\nAt the same time, at the 5th session of the 5th National People's Congress, the constitution was amended to include a new Article 31 which stated that the country might establish Special Administrative Regions (SARs) when necessary.[13]\\r\\nThe additional Article would hold tremendous significance in settling the question of Hong Kong and later Macau, putting into social consciousness the concept of \\"One country, two systems\\". The concept would prove useful to deploy until the territories were secured and conditions were ripe for its gradual abrogation.\\r\\nA few months after Thatcher's visit to Beijing, the PRC government had yet to open negotiations with the British government regarding the sovereignty of Hong Kong.\\r\\nShortly before the initiation of sovereignty talks, Governor Youde declared his intention to represent the population of Hong Kong at the negotiations. This statement sparked a strong response from the PRC, prompting Deng Xiaoping to denounce talk of \\"the so-called 'three-legged stool'\\", which implied that Hong Kong was a party to talks on its future, alongside Beijing and London.[14]\\r\\nAt the preliminary stage of the talks, the British government proposed an exchange of sovereignty for administration and the implementation of a British administration post-handover.[8]\\r\\nThe PRC government refused, contending that the notions of sovereignty and administration were inseparable, and although it recognised Macau as a \\"Chinese territory under Portuguese administration\\", this was only temporary.[15]\\r\\nIn fact, during informal exchanges between 1979 and 1981, the PRC had proposed a \\"Macau solution\\" in Hong Kong, under which it would remain under British administration at China's discretion.[3]\\r\\nHowever, this had previously been rejected following the 1967 Leftist riots, with the then Governor, David Trench, claiming the leftists' aim was to leave the UK without effective control, or \\"to Macau us\\".[16]\\r\\nThe conflict that arose at that point of the negotiations ended the possibility of further negotiation. During the reception of former British Prime Minister Edward Heath during his sixth visit to the PRC, Deng Xiaoping commented quite clearly on the impossibility of exchanging sovereignty for administration, declaring an ultimatum: the British government must modify or give up its position or the PRC will announce its resolution of the issue of Hong Kong sovereignty unilaterally.[17]\\r\\nIn 1983, Typhoon Ellen ravaged Hong Kong, causing great amounts of damage to both life and property.[18] The Hong Kong dollar plummeted on Black Saturday, and the Financial Secretary John Bremridge publicly associated the economic uncertainty with the instability of the political climate.[19] In response, the PRC government condemned Britain through the press for \\"playing the economic card\\" in order to achieve their ends: to intimidate the PRC into conceding to British demands.[20]\\r\\nGovernor Youde with nine members of the Hong Kong Executive Council travelled to London to discuss with Prime Minister Thatcher the crisis of confidencethe problem with morale among the people of Hong Kong arising from the ruination of the Sino-British talks. The session concluded with Thatcher's writing of a letter addressed to the PRC Premier Zhao Ziyang.\\r\\nIn the letter, she expressed Britain's willingness to explore arrangements optimising the future prospects of Hong Kong while utilising the PRC's proposals as a foundation. Furthermore, and perhaps most significantly, she expressed Britain's concession on its position of a continued British presence in the form of an administration post-handover.\\r\\nTwo rounds of negotiations were held in October and November. On the sixth round of talks in November, Britain formally conceded its intentions of either maintaining a British administration in Hong Kong or seeking some form of co-administration with the PRC, and showed its sincerity in discussing PRC's proposal on the 1997 issue. Obstacles were cleared.\\r\\nSimon Keswick, chairman of Jardine Matheson & Co., said they were not pulling out of Hong Kong, but a new holding company would be established in Bermuda instead.[21] The PRC took this as yet another plot by the British. The Hong Kong government explained that it had been informed about the move only a few days before the announcement. The government would not and could not stop the company from making a business decision.\\r\\nJust as the atmosphere of the talks was becoming cordial, members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong felt impatient at the long-running secrecy over the progress of Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue. A motion, tabled by legislator Roger Lobo, declared \\"This Council deems it essential that any proposals for the future of Hong Kong should be debated in this Council before agreement is reached\\", was passed unanimously.[22]\\r\\nThe PRC attacked the motion furiously, referring to it as \\"somebody's attempt to play the three-legged stool trick again\\".[23] At length, the PRC and Britain initiated the Joint Declaration on the question of Hong Kong's future in Beijing. Zhou Nan, the then PRC Deputy Foreign Minister and leader of the negotiation team, and Sir Richard Evans, British Ambassador to Beijing and leader of the team, signed respectively on behalf of the two governments.[24]\\r\\nThe Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed by the Prime Ministers of the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom governments on 19 December 1984 in Beijing. The Declaration entered into force with the exchange of instruments of ratification on 27 May 1985 and was registered by the People's Republic of China and United Kingdom governments at the United Nations on 12 June 1985.\\r\\nIn the Joint Declaration, the People's Republic of China Government stated that it had decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong (including Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories) with effect from 1 July 1997 and the United Kingdom Government declared that it would restore Hong Kong to the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997. In the document, the People's Republic of China Government also declared its basic policies regarding Hong Kong.\\r\\nIn accordance with the \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" principle agreed between the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China, the socialist system of the People's Republic of China would not be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and Hong Kong's previous capitalist system and its way of life would remain unchanged for a period of 50 years. This would have left Hong Kong unchanged until 2047.\\r\\nThe Joint Declaration provided that these basic policies should be stipulated in the Hong Kong Basic Law. The ceremony of the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration took place at 18:00, 19 December 1984 at the Western Main Chamber of the Great Hall of the People. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office at first proposed a list of 60-80 Hong Kong people to attend the ceremony. The number was finally extended to 101.\\r\\nThe list included Hong Kong government officials, members of the Legislative and Executive Councils, chairmen of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered Bank, prominent businessmen such as Li Ka-shing, Pao Yue-kong and Fok Ying-tung, and also Martin Lee Chu-ming and Szeto Wah.\\r\\nThe Basic Law was drafted by a Drafting Committee composed of members from both Hong Kong and mainland China. A Basic Law Consultative Committee formed purely by Hong Kong people was established in 1985 to canvas views in Hong Kong on the drafts.\\r\\nThe first draft was published in April 1988, followed by a five-month public consultation exercise. The second draft was published in February 1989, and the subsequent consultation period ended in October 1989.\\r\\nThe Basic Law was formally promulgated on 4 April 1990 by the NPC, together with the designs for the flag and emblem of the HKSAR. Some members of the Basic Law drafting committee were ousted by Beijing following the 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, after voicing views supporting the students.\\r\\nThe Basic Law was said to be a mini-constitution drafted with the participation of Hong Kong people. The political system had been the most controversial issue in the drafting of the Basic Law. The special issue sub-group adopted the political model put forward by Louis Cha. This \\"mainstream\\" proposal was criticised for being too conservative.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to Clauses 158 and 159 of the Basic Law, powers of interpretation and amendment of the Basic Law are vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the National People's Congress, respectively. Hong Kong's people have limited influence.\\r\\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Executive Councillors and the Legislative Councillors unexpectedly held an urgent meeting, in which they agreed unanimously that the British Government should give the people of Hong Kong the right of abode in the United Kingdom.[25]\\r\\nMore than 10,000 Hong Kong residents rushed to Central in order to get an application form for residency in the United Kingdom. On the eve of the deadline, over 100,000 lined up overnight for a BN(O) application form. While mass migration did begin well before 1989, the event did lead to the peak migration year in 1992 with 66,000 leaving.[26]\\r\\nMany citizens were pessimistic towards the future of Hong Kong and the transfer of the region's sovereignty. A tide of emigration, which was to last for no less than five years, broke out. At its peak, citizenship of small countries, such as Tonga, was also in great demand.[27]\\r\\nSingapore, which also had a predominantly Chinese population, was another popular destination, with the country's Commission (now Consulate-General) being besieged by anxious Hong Kong residents.[28] By September 1989, 6000 applications for residency in Singapore had been approved by the Commission.[29]\\r\\nSome consul staff were suspended or arrested for their corrupt behaviour in granting immigration visas. In April 1997, the acting immigration officer at the US Consulate-General, James DeBates, was suspended after his wife was arrested for smuggling of Chinese migrants into the United States.[30] The previous year, his predecessor, Jerry Stuchiner, had been arrested for smuggling forged Honduran passports into the territory before being sentenced to 40 months in prison.[31]\\r\\nCanada (Vancouver and Toronto), United Kingdom (London, Glasgow, and Manchester), Australia (Sydney and Melbourne), and the United States (San Francisco and New York) were, by and large, the most popular destinations. The United Kingdom devised the British Nationality Selection Scheme, granting 50,000 families British citizenship under the British Nationality Act (Hong Kong) 1990.[32]\\r\\nVancouver was among the most popular destinations, earning the nickname of \\"Hongcouver\\".[33] Richmond, a suburb of Vancouver, was nicknamed \\"Little Hong Kong\\".[34] Other popular settlements are found in Auckland, New Zealand and Dublin, Ireland. All in all, from the start of the settlement of the negotiation in 1984 to 1997, nearly 1 million people emigrated; consequently, Hong Kong suffered serious loss of capital.[35]\\r\\nChris Patten became the last governor of Hong Kong. This was regarded as a turning point in Hong Kong's history. Unlike his predecessors, Patten was not a diplomat, but a career politician and former Member of Parliament. He introduced democratic reforms which pushed PRCÿBritish relations to a standstill and affected the negotiations for a smooth handover.\\r\\nPatten introduced a package of electoral reforms in the Legislative Council. These reforms proposed to enlarge the electorate, thus making voting in the Legislative Council more democratic. This move posed significant changes because Hong Kong citizens would have the power to make decisions regarding their future.\\r\\nThe handover ceremony was held at the new wing of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on the night of 30 June 1997.\\r\\nThe principal British guest was Prince Charles, who read a farewell speech on behalf of the Queen. The newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, the Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, the departing Governor Chris Patten and General Sir Charles Guthrie, Chief of the Defence Staff, also attended.\\r\\nRepresenting the People's Republic of China were the President, Jiang Zemin, the Premier, Li Peng, and the first Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. The event was broadcast around the world.[36][37]\\r\\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Hong Kong government proposed a grand \\"Rose Garden Project\\" to restore faith and solidarity among the residents.[124] As the construction of the new Hong Kong International Airport would extend well after the handover, Governor Wilson met PRC Premier Li Peng in Beijing to ease the mind of the PRC government.[125]\\r\\nThe communist press published stories that the project was an evil plan to bleed Hong Kong dry before the handover, leaving the territory in serious debt.[126] After three years of negotiations, Britain and the PRC finally reached an agreement over the construction of the new airport, and signed a Memorandum of Understanding.[127] Removing hills and reclaiming land, it took only a few years to construct the new airport.\\r\\nThe Walled City was originally a single fort built in the mid-19th century on the site of an earlier 17th century watch post on the Kowloon Peninsula of Hong Kong.[128] After the ceding of Hong Kong Island to Britain in 1842 (Treaty of Nanjing), Manchu Qing Dynasty authorities of China felt it necessary for them to establish a military and administrative post to rule the area and to check further British influence in the area.\\r\\nThe 1898 Convention which handed additional parts of Hong Kong (the New Territories) to Britain for 99 years excluded the Walled City, with a population of roughly 700. It stated that China could continue to keep troops there, so long as they did not interfere with Britain's temporary rule.\\r\\nBritain quickly went back on this unofficial part of the agreement, attacking Kowloon Walled City in 1899, only to find it deserted. They did nothing with it, or the outpost, and thus posed the question of Kowloon Walled City's ownership squarely up in the air. The outpost consisted of a yamen, as well as buildings which grew into low-lying, densely packed neighbourhoods from the 1890s to 1940s.\\r\\nThe enclave remained part of Chinese territory despite the turbulent events of the early 20th century that saw the fall of the Qing government, the establishment of the Republic of China and later, a Communist Chinese government (PRC).\\r\\nSquatters began to occupy the Walled City, resisting several attempts by Britain in 1948 to drive them out. The Walled City became a haven for criminals and drug addicts, as the Hong Kong Police had no right to enter the City and China refused maintainability. The 1949 foundation of the People's Republic of China added thousands of refugees to the population, many from Guangdong; by this time, Britain had had enough, and simply adopted a \\"hands-off\\" policy.\\r\\nA murder that occurred in Kowloon Walled City in 1959 set off a small diplomatic crisis, as the two nations each tried to get the other to accept responsibility for a vast tract of land now virtually ruled by anti-Manchurian Triads.\\r\\nAfter the Joint Declaration in 1984, the PRC allowed British authorities to demolish the City and resettle its inhabitants. The mutual decision to tear down the walled city was made in 1987.[129] The government spent up to HK$ 3 billion to resettle the residents and shops.\\r\\nSome residents were not satisfied with the compensation, and some even obstructed the demolition in every possible way.[130] Ultimately, everything was settled, and the Walled City became a park.[131]\\r\\nRennie's Mill got its name from a Canadian businessman named Alfred Herbert Rennie, who established a flour mill at Junk Bay. The business failed, and Rennie hanged himself there in 1908. The incident gave the Chinese name for the site Tiu Keng Leng (?X), meaning \\"Hanging (neck) Ridge\\". The name was later formally changed to similar-sounding Tiu King Leng (?X) because it was regarded as inauspicious.\\r\\nIn the 1950s the (British) Government of Hong Kong settled a considerable number of refugees from Chinaformer Nationalist soldiers and other Kuomintang supportersat Rennie's Mill, following the Chinese civil war. For many years the area was a Kuomintang enclave known as \\"Little Taiwan\\", with the flag of the Republic of China flying, its own school system and practically off-limits to the Royal Hong Kong Police Force.\\r\\nIn 1996 the Hong Kong government finally forcibly evicted Rennie's Mill's residents, ostensibly to make room for new town developments, as part of the Tseung Kwan O New Town, but widely understood to be a move to please the Communist Chinese government before Hong Kong reverted to Communist Chinese rule in 1997.\\r\\nBefore the eviction, Rennie's Mill could be reached by the winding, hilly and narrow Po Lam Road South. At that time, Rennie's Mill's only means of public transport were the routes 90 and 290 of Kowloon Motor Bus, which were operated by minibuses, and by water transport.\\r\\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan promulgated the Laws and Regulations Regarding Hong Kong & Macao Affairs on 2 April 1997 by Presidential Order, and the Executive Yuan on 19 June 1997 ordered the provisions pertaining to Hong Kong to take effect on 1 July 1997.[132]\\r\\nThe United StatesÿHong Kong Policy Act or more commonly known as the Hong Kong Policy Act (P.L no. 102-383m 106 Stat. 1448) is a 1992 act enacted by the United States Congress. It allows the United States to continue to treat Hong Kong separately from China for matters concerning trade export and economics control after the handover.[133]\\r\\nThe United States was represented by then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at the Hong Kong handover ceremony.[134] However, she partially boycotted it in protest of China's dissolution of the democratically elected Hong Kong legislature.[135]\\r\\nScholars have begun to study the complexities of the transfer as shown in the popular media, such as films, television and video and online games. For example, Hong Kong director Fruit Chan made a sci-fi thriller The Midnight After (2014) that stressed the sense of loss and alienation represented by survivors in an apocalyptic Hong Kong. Chan infuses a political agenda in the film by playing on Hong Kongers' collective anxiety towards communist China.[136] Yiman Wang has argued that America has viewed China through the prisms of films from Shanghai and Hong Kong, with a recent emphasis on futuristic disaster films set in Hong Kong after the transfer goes awry.[137]","input":"When did china take control of hong kong?"},{"output":"Karl Landsteiner","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ABO blood group system is used to denote the presence of one, both, or neither of the A and B antigens on erythrocytes.[1] In human blood transfusions it is the most important of the 36 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized.[2] A very rare (in modern medicine) mismatch in this, or any other serotype, can cause a serious, potentially fatal, adverse reaction after a transfusion, or a contra-indicated immune response to an organ transplant.[3] The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM antibodies, which are produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances, such as food, bacteria, and viruses. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe ABO blood types were discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. ABO blood types are also present in some other animals such as rodents and apes, including chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ABO blood types were first discovered by an Austrian Physician Karl Landsteiner working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now Medical University of Vienna). In 1900, he found that blood sera from different persons would clump together (agglutinate) when mixed in test tubes, and not only that some human blood also agglutinated with animal blood.[5] He wrote a two-sentence footnote:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe serum of healthy human beings not only agglutinates animal red cells, but also often those of human origin, from other individuals. It remains to be seen whether this appearance is related to inborn differences between individuals or it is the result of some damage of bacterial kind.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the first evidence that blood variation exists in humans ÿ it was believed that all humans have similar blood. The next year, in 1901, he made a definitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate with only those of certain individuals. Based on this he classified human bloods into three groups, namely group A, group B, and group C. He defined that group A blood agglutinates with group B, but never with its own type. Similarly, group B blood agglutinates with group A. Group C blood is different in that it agglutinates with both A and B.[7] This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. In his paper, he called the specific blood group interactions as isoagglutination, and also introduced the concept of agglutinins (antibodies), which is the actual basis of antigen-antibody reaction in ABO system.[8] He asserted:\\r\\n\\r\\n[It] may be said that there exist at least two different types of agglutinins, one in A, another one in B, and both together\\r\\n\\r\\nin C. The red blood cells are inert to the agglutinins which are present in the same serum.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, he discovered two two antigens (agglutinogens A and B) and two antibodies (agglutinins - anti-A and anti-B). His third group (C) indicated absence of both A and B antigens, but contains anti-A and anti-B.[8] The following year, his students Adriano Sturli and Alfred von Decastello discovered the fourth type (but not naming it, and simply referred to it as \\"no particular type).[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1910, Ludwik Hirszfeld and Emil Freiherr von Dungern introduced the term 0 (null) for the group Landsteiner designated as C, and AB for the type discovered by Sturli and von Decastello. They were also the first to explain the genetic inheritance of the blood groups.[11]) \\r\\n\\r\\nCzech serologist Jan Jansky independently introduced blood type classification in 1907 in a local journal.[12] He used the Roman numerical I, II, III, and IV (corresponding to modern O, A, B, and AB). Unbeknown to Jansky, an American physician William L. Moss devised a slightly different classification using the same numerical;[13] his I, II, III, and IV corresponding to modern AB, A, B, and O.[10] These two systems created confusion and potential danger in medical practice. Moss's system was adopted in Britain, France, and US, while Jansky's was preferred in most European countries and some parts of US. To resolve the chaos, the American Association of Immunologists, the Society of American Bacteriologists, and the Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists made a joint recommendation in 1921 that the Jansky classification be adopted based on priority.[14] But it was not followed particularly where Moss's system had been used. In 1927, Landsteiner, who had moved to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York, and as a member of a committee of the National Research Council concerned with blood grouping suggested to substitute Jansky's and Moss's systems with the letters 0, A, B, and AB. (There was another confusion on the use of figure 0 for German null as introduced by Hirszfeld and von Dungern, because others used the letter O for ohne, meaning without or zero; Landsteiner chose the latter.[15]) This classification was adopted by the National Research Council and became variously known as the National Research Council classification, the International classification, and most popularly the \\"new\\" Landsteiner classification. The new system was gradually accepted and by the early 1950s, it was universally followed.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first practical use of blood typing in transfusion was by an American physician Reuben Ottenberg in 1907. And the large-scale application started during the First World War (1914-1915) when citric acid was developed as blood clot prevention.[8] Felix Bernstein demonstrated the correct blood group inheritance pattern of multiple alleles at one locus in 1924.[17] Watkins and Morgan, in England, discovered that the ABO epitopes were conferred by sugars, to be specific, N-acetylgalactosamine for the A-type and galactose for the B-type.[18][19][20] After much published literature claiming that the ABH substances were all attached to glycosphingolipids, Finne et al. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains[21] that contains ABH substances attached and represent the majority of the antigens.[22][23][24] The main glycoproteins carrying the ABH antigens were identified to be the Band 3 and Band 4.5 proteins and glycophorin.[25] Later, Yamamoto's group showed the precise glycosyl transferase set that confers the A, B and O epitopes.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2007, an international team of researchers announced in the journal Nature Biotechnology an inexpensive and efficient way to convert types A, B, and AB blood into type O.[28] This is done by using glycosidase enzymes from specific bacteria to strip the blood group antigens from red blood cells. The removal of A and B antigens still does not address the problem of the Rh blood group antigen on the blood cells of Rh positive individuals, and so blood from Rh negative donors must be used. Patient trials will be conducted before the method can be relied on in live situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother approach to the blood antigen problem is the manufacture of artificial blood, which could act as a substitute in emergencies.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlood groups are inherited from both parents. The ABO blood type is controlled by a single gene (the ABO gene) with three types of alleles inferred from classical genetics: i, IA, and IB. The I designation stands for isoagglutinogen, another term for antigen.[30] The gene encodes a glycosyltransferasethat is, an enzyme that modifies the carbohydrate content of the red blood cell antigens. The gene is located on the long arm of the ninth chromosome (9q34).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IA allele gives type A, IB gives type B, and i gives type O. As both IA and IB are dominant over i, only ii people have type O blood. Individuals with IAIA or IAi have type A blood, and individuals with IBIB or IBi have type B. IAIB people have both phenotypes, because A and B express a special dominance relationship: codominance, which means that type A and B parents can have an AB child. A couple with type A and type B can also have a type O child if they are both heterozygous (IBi,IAi) The cis-AB phenotype has a single enzyme that creates both A and B antigens. The resulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen at the same level that would be expected on common group A1 or B red blood cells, which can help solve the problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood group.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table above summarizes the various blood groups that children may inherit from their parents.[32][33] Genotypes are shown in the second column and in small print for the offspring: AO and AA both test as type A; BO and BB test as type B. The four possibilities represent the combinations obtained when one allele is taken from each parent; each has a 25% chance, but some occur more than once.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, ABO blood tests were used in paternity testing, but in 1957 only 50% of American men falsely accused were able to use them as evidence against paternity.[34] Occasionally, the blood types of children are not consistent with expectationsfor example, a type O child can be born to an AB parentdue to rare situations, such as Bombay phenotype and cis AB.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A blood type contains about 20 subgroups, of which A1 and A2 are the most common (over 99%). A1 makes up about 80% of all A-type blood, with A2 making up almost all of the rest.[36] These two subgroups are not always interchangeable as far as transfusion is concerned, as some A2 individuals produce antibodies against the A1 antigen. Complications can sometimes arise in rare cases when typing the blood.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the development of DNA sequencing, it has been possible to identify a much larger number of alleles at the ABO locus, each of which can be categorized as A, B, or O in terms of the reaction to transfusion, but which can be distinguished by variations in the DNA sequence. There are six common alleles in white individuals of the ABO gene that produce one's blood type:[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same study also identified 18 rare alleles, which generally have a weaker glycosylation activity. People with weak alleles of A can sometimes express anti-A antibodies, though these are usually not clinically significant as they do not stably interact with the antigen at body temperature.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nCis AB is another rare variant, in which A and B genes are transmitted together from a single parent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe distribution of the blood groups A, B, O and AB varies across the world according to the population. There are also variations in blood type distribution within human subpopulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, the distribution of blood type frequencies through the population still shows some correlation to the distribution of placenames and to the successive invasions and migrations including Norsemen, Danes, Saxons, Celts, and Normans who contributed the morphemes to the placenames and the genes to the population.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two common O alleles, O01 and O02, share their first 261 nucleotides with the group A allele A01.[41] However, unlike the group A allele, a guanosine base is subsequently deleted. A premature stop codon results from this frame-shift mutation. This variant is found worldwide, and likely predates human migration from Africa. The O01 allele is considered to predate the O02 allele.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome evolutionary biologists theorize that there are four main lineages of the ABO gene and that mutations creating type O have occurred at least three times in humans.[42] From oldest to youngest, these lineages comprise the following alleles: A101/A201/O09, B101, O02 and O01. The continued presence of the O alleles is hypothesized to be the result of balancing selection.[42] Both theories contradict the previously held theory that type O blood evolved first.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible that food and environmental antigens (bacterial, viral, or plant antigens) have epitopes similar enough to A and B glycoprotein antigens. The antibodies created against these environmental antigens in the first years of life can cross-react with ABO-incompatible red blood cells that it comes in contact with during blood transfusion later in life. Anti-A antibodies are hypothesized to originate from immune response towards influenza virus, whose epitopes are similar enough to the ϫ-D-N-galactosamine on the A glycoprotein to be able to elicit a cross-reaction. Anti-B antibodies are hypothesized to originate from antibodies produced against Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, cross-reacting with the ϫ-D-galactose on the B glycoprotein.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it is more likely that the force driving evolution of allele diversity is simply negative frequency-dependent selection; cells with rare variants of membrane antigens are more easily distinguished by the immune system from pathogens carrying antigens from other hosts. Thus, individuals possessing rare types are better equipped to detect pathogens. The high within-population diversity observed in human populations would, then, be a consequence of natural selection on individuals.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nHIV can be neutralized in in vitro experiments using antibodies against blood group antigens specifically expressed on the HIV-producing cell lines.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carbohydrate molecules on the surfaces of red blood cells have roles in cell membrane integrity, cell adhesion, membrane transportation of molecules, and acting as receptors for extracellular ligands, and enzymes. ABO antigens are found having similar roles on epithelial cells as well as red blood cells.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ABO antigen is also expressed on the von Willebrand factor (vWF) glycoprotein,[49] which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, having type O blood predisposes to bleeding,[50] as 30% of the total genetic variation observed in plasma vWF is explained by the effect of the ABO blood group,[51] and individuals with group O blood normally have significantly lower plasma levels of vWF (and Factor VIII) than do non-O individuals.[52][53] In addition, vWF is degraded more rapidly due to the higher prevalence of blood group O with the Cys1584 variant of vWF (an amino acid polymorphism in VWF):[54] the gene for ADAMTS13 (vWF-cleaving protease) maps to the ninth chromosome (9q34), the same locus as ABO blood type. Higher levels of vWF are more common amongst people who have had ischemic stroke (from blood clotting) for the first time.[55] The results of this study found that the occurrence was not affected by ADAMTS13 polymorphism, and the only significant genetic factor was the person's blood group.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompared to O group individuals, non-O group (A, AB, and B) individuals have a 14% reduced risk of squamous cell carcinoma and 4% reduced risk of basal cell carcinoma.[56] Conversely, type O blood is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer.[57][58] The B antigen links with increased risk of ovarian cancer.[59] Gastric cancer has reported to be more common in blood group A and least in group O.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Glass, Holmgren, et al., those in the O blood group have an increased risk of infection with cholera, and those O-group individuals who are infected have more severe infections. The mechanisms behind this association with cholera are unclear in the literature.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nABO blood group incompatibilities between the mother and child does not usually cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) because antibodies to the ABO blood groups are usually of the IgM type, which do not cross the placenta. However, in an O-type mother, IgG ABO antibodies are produced and the baby can potentially develop ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn human cells, the ABO alleles and their encoded glycosyltransferases have been described in several oncologic conditions.[62] Using anti-GTA/GTB monoclonal antibodies, it was demonstrated that a loss of these enzymes was correlated to malignant bladder and oral epithelia.[63][64] Furthermore, the expression of ABO blood group antigens in normal human tissues is dependent the type of differentiation of the epithelium. In most human carcinomas, including oral carcinoma, a significant event as part of the underlying mechanism is decreased expression of the A and B antigens.[65] Several studies have observed that a relative down-regulation of GTA and GTB occurs in oral carcinomas in association with tumor development.[65][66] More recently, a genome wide association study (GWAS) has identified variants in the ABO locus associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nA multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the ABO gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1930s, connecting blood groups to personality types became popular in Japan and other areas of the world.[69] Studies of this association have yet to confirm its existence definitively.[70][71]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther popular but unsupported ideas include the use of a blood type diet, claims that group A causes severe hangovers, group O is associated with perfect teeth, and those with blood group A2 have the highest IQs. Scientific evidence in support of these concepts is nonexistent.[72]","input":"Who is responsible for the abo classification system?"},{"output":"September 2, 1945","context":"North Vietnam, officially the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) (Vietnamese: Vi?t Nam Dan Ch? C?ng Ha), was a country in Southeast Asia from 1954 to 1975. \\r\\n\\r\\nVietnamese revolutionary leader H? Ch Minh declared independence from French Indochina on 2 September 1945 and announced the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. France reasserted its colonial dominance and a war ensued between France and the Viet Minh, led by President Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh (\\"League for the Independence of Vietnam\\") was a coalition of nationalist groups, mostly led by communists. In February 1951, the communists announced the creation of the Lao ??ng Party (Labor Party), gradually marginalizing non-communists in the Vi?t Minh.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1946 and 1954, the Vi?t Minh captured and controlled most of the rural areas of Vietnam. In 1954, after the French were defeated, the negotiation of the Geneva Accords ended the war between France and the Vi?t Minh and granted Vietnam independence. The Geneva Accords divided the country provisionally into northern and southern zones, and stipulated general elections in July 1956 to \\"bring about the unification of Viet-Nam\\".[3] The northern zone was commonly called North Vietnam, and the southern zone was commonly called South Vietnam.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupervision of the implementation of the Geneva Accords was the responsibility of an international commission consisting of India, Canada, and Poland. The United States did not sign the Geneva Accords, which stated that the United States \\"shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly\\".[4] In July 1955, the prime minister of the Republic of Vietnam, Ng? ?nh Di?m, announced that the Republic of Vietnam would not participate in elections to unify the country. He said that South Vietnam had not signed the Geneva Accords and was not bound by it.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the failure to reunify Vietnam by elections, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attempted to unify the country by force in the Vietnam War (1955ÿ75). North Vietnam and the Vi?t C?ng insurgents supported by their communist allies, including the Soviet Union and China, fought against the military of South Vietnam, the United States and other anti-communist military forces, including South Korea, Australia, Thailand, and smaller players. North Vietnam also supported indigenous communist rebels in Cambodia and Laos against their respective U.S.-backed governments. The war ended when North Vietnamese forces and the Vi?t C?ng defeated the Republic of Vietnam and in 1976 united the two parts of the country into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The expanded Democratic Republic retained North Vietnam's political culture under Soviet influence and continued its existing memberships in international organisations such as Comecon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter about 300 years of partition by feudal dynasties, Vietnam was again under one single authority in 1802 when Gia Long founded the Nguy?n dynasty, but the country became a French protectorate after 1883 and under Japanese occupation after 1940 during World War II. Soon after Japan surrendered on September 2, 1945, the Vi?t Minh in the August Revolution entered Hanoi, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed on September 2, 1945: a government for the entire country, replacing the Nguy?n dynasty.[6] H? Ch Minh became leader of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt had spoken against French rule in Indochina, and U.S.A. was supportive of the Viet Minh at this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Democratic Republic of Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh claimed dominion over all of Vietnam, but during this time South Vietnam was in profound political disorder. The successive collapse of French, then Japanese power, followed by the dissension among the political factions in Saigon had been accompanied by widespread violence in the countryside.[7][8] On August 16, 1945, H? Ch Minh organized the National Congress in Tan Tro. The Congress adopted 10 major policies of the Vi?t Minh, passed the General Uprising Order, decided the National Flag, in the middle with 5-pointed gold star, selected the national anthem and selected the National Committee for the Liberation of Vietnam, later becoming the Provisional Revolutionary Government, led by H? Ch Minh. On September 12, 1945, the first British troops arrived in Saigon. On September 23, 28 days after the people of Saigon seized political power, French troops occupied the police stations, the post office, and other public buildings. The salient political fact of life in Northern Vietnam was Chinese Nationalist army of occupation, and the Chinese presence had forced Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh to accommodate Chinese-backed Viet Nationalists. In June 1946, Chinese Nationalist troops evacuated Hanoi, and on the 15th of June, the last detachments embarked at Haiphong. After the departure of the British in 1946, the French controlled a part of Cochinchina, South Central Coast, Central Highlands since the end Southern Resistance War. In January 1946, the Viet Minh held an election to establish a National Assembly. Public enthusiasm for this event suggests that the Viet Minh enjoyed a great deal of popularity at this time, although there were few competitive races and the party makeup of the Assembly was determined in advance of the vote.[a]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 18 and 19, 1945, the Vi?t Minh held secret meetings with Vi?t Cch (September 18, 1945) and Vi?t Qu?c (September 19, 1945). In these two meetings, Nguy?n H?i Th?n represented Vi?t Cch and Nguy?n T??ng Tam represent Vi?t Qu?c. H? Ch Minh agree to unite the Vi?t Minh with Vi?t Cch and Vi?t Qu?c. Thus, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam led by the Vi?t Minh will receive the financial and political support of the Republic of China. For this proposal, within the Vi?t Minh there are many different opinions. V? Nguyn Gip disagrees with the suggestion that the proposals are not valid and not honest, as if replacing French colonialism with Chinese domination, but Hong Minh Gim thought that the unification of Vietnam With the Nationalist parties will reduce the opposition and strengthen the power of the Vi?t Minh, as the Chinese are relieved and the French have to worry. Eventually the Vi?t Minh under H? Ch Minh refused to merge with the Pro-Chinese Vi?t Cch and the Vi?t Qu?c League.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 6, 1946, President H? Ch Minh held the nationwide General Election which voted for the first time and passed the Constitution. Many parties did not have the right to participate in General Elections seeking to undermine . These parties claimed to be the only Vi?t Minh communist, the government in the hands of the Vi?t Minh want anyone to win it. The two opposition parties in the government are the Vietnams Nationalist Party (Vi?t Qu?c) and the Vietnam Cch m?nh ??ng minh (Vi?t Cch) did not participate in the election although H? Ch Minh previously sent a letter to Nguy?n H?i Th?n leader of Vi?t Cch and V? H?ng Khanh leader of Vi?t Qu?c. H? Ch Minh invites Vi?t Qu?c and Vi?t Cch to attend the General Election and urges the two sides not to attack each other with words or actions until the Congress opens. Former Prime Minister Tr?n Tr?ng Kim said there were places where people were forced to vote for the Vi?t Minh.[13] According to the Vi?t Minh, the election was fair.[14] Despite being campaigned by many parties to campaign for the people to boycott the election and block the election in some places, where there are self-nominated candidates, publicly run, free elections are taking place everywhere. After the election results are announced, the truth is not the same as the propaganda parties. Many prestigious delegates of classes, classes, religions and ethnic groups were elected in the First National Assembly, most of them not party members.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of Chiang Kai-shek's army up to that time ensured the survival of Vietnams Nationalist Party and Vi?t Cch. These two parties did not have a cohesive program to enlist the people like the Vi?t Minh[16] The leaders of the Vietnams Nationalist Party and the Vi?t Cch Revolutionary Party are far from having comparable qualities with H? Ch Minh, V? Nguyn Gip, and other responsible Vi?t Minh members. When the Chinese nationalist army withdrawal from Vietnam on June 15, 1946, in one way or another, V? Nguy?n Gip, decided that the Vi?t Minh had to completely control the government. V? Nguy?n Gip is in immediate action with the goal of spreading Vi?t Minh leadership: the Allied Powers are supported by the Vietnams Nationalist Party (according to Cecil B. Currey, this organization borrows the revolutionary name of Vietnams Nationalist Party of 1930 was founded by Nguy?n Thi H?c and, according to David G. Marr, the Vietnamese Communist Party under H? Ch Minh tried to banned the Pro-Chinese Nationalist Party in Vietnam[17] betraying the revolutionary cause of Nguy?n Thi H?c in 1930. By the end of 1945, many people still did not believe in it.) The pro-Japan nationalist group, the Trotskyists, the anti-French nationalists, the Catholic group called \\"Catholic soldiers.\\" V? Nguy?n Gip has gradually sought to phase out these parties. On June 19, 1946, the Vi?t Minh Journal reportedly vehemently criticized \\"reactionaries sabotage the Franco-Vietnamese preliminary agreement on 6 March\\". Shortly thereafter, V? Nguy?n Gip began a campaign to pursue opposition parties by police and military forces controlled by the Vi?t Minh with the help of the French authorities. He also used soldiers, Japanese officers volunteered to stay in Vietnam and some of the supplies provided by France (in Hn Gai French troops provided the Vi?t Minh with cannons to kill some of the positions commanded by the Great Occupation) in this campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen France declared Cochinchina, the southern third of Vietnam, a separate state as the \\"Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina\\" in June 1946, Vietnamese nationalists reacted with fury. In November, the National Assembly adopted the first Constitution of the Republic.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French reoccupied Hanoi and the First Indochina War (1946ÿ54) followed. Following the Chinese Communist Revolution (1946?50), Chinese communist forces arrived on the border in 1949. Chinese aid revived the fortunes of the Viet Minh and transformed it from a guerrilla militia into a standing army. The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 transformed what had been an anti-colonial struggle into a Cold War battleground, with the U.S. providing financial support to the French.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the partition of Vietnam in 1954 at the end of the First Indochina War, more than one million North Vietnamese migrated to South Vietnam,[19] under the U.S.-led evacuation campaign named Operation Passage to Freedom,[20] with an estimated 60% of the north's one million Catholics fleeing south.[21][22] The Catholic migration is attributed to an expectation of persecution of Catholics by the North Vietnamese government, as well as publicity employed by the Saigon government of the President Ngo Dinh Diem.[23] The CIA ran a propaganda campaign to get Catholics to come to the south. However Colonel Edward Lansdale, the man credited with the campaign, rejected the notion that his campaign had much effect on popular sentiment.[24]  The Viet Minh sought to detain or otherwise prevent would-be refugees from leaving, such as through intimidation through military presence, shutting down ferry services and water traffic, or prohibiting mass gatherings.[25] Concurrently, between 14,000 and 45,000 civilians and approximately 100,000 Viet Minh fighters moved in the opposite direction.[21][26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nLand reform was an integral part of the Viet Minh and communist Democratic Republic of Vietnam.  A Viet Minh Land Reform Law of 4 December 1953 called for (1) confiscation of land belonging to landlords who were enemies of the regime; (2) requisition of land from landlords not judged to be enemies; and (3) purchase with payment in bonds.  The land reform was carried out from 1953 to 1956. Some farming areas did not undergo land reform but only rent reduction and the highland areas occupied by minority peoples were not substantially impacted.  Some land was retained by the government but most was distributed without payment with priority given to Viet Minh fighters and their families.[28]  The total number of rural people impacted by the land reform program was more than 4 million.  The rent reduction program impacted nearly 8 million people.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land reform program was a success in terms of distributing much land to poor and landless peasants and reducing or eliminating the land holdings of landlords and rich peasants.  However it was carried out with violence and repression primarily directed against large landowners identified, sometimes incorrectly, as landlords.[30] On 18 August 1956, North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh acknowledged the serious errors the government had made in the land reform program. Too many farmers, he said, had been incorrectly classified as \\"landlords\\" and executed or imprisoned and too many mistakes had been made in redistributing land. Severe rioting protesting the excesses of the land reform program broke out in November 1956 in one largely Catholic rural district.  About 1,000 people were killed or injured and several thousand imprisoned. Democratic Republic of Vietnam initiated a \\"correction campaign\\" which by 1958 had resulted in the return of land to many of those harmed by the land reform.[31]  As part of the correction campaign as many as 23,748 political prisoners were released by North Vietnam by September 1957.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nExecutions and imprisonment of persons classified as \\"landlords\\" or enemies of the state were contemplated from the beginning of the land reform program.  A Politburo document dated 4 May 1953 said that executions were \\"fixed in principle at the ratio of one per one thousand people of the total population.\\" .[33]  The number of persons actually executed by communist cadre carrying out the land reform program has been variously estimated. Some estimates of those killed range up to 200,000.[34]  Other scholarship has concluded that the higher estimates were based on political propaganda emanating from South Vietnam and that the actual total of those executed was probably much lower.  Scholar Edwin E. Moise estimated the total number of executions at between 3,000 and 15,000 and later came up with a more precise figure of 13,500.[35]  Moise's conclusions were supported by documents of Hungarian diplomats living in Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the time of the land reform.[36] Author Michael Lind in a 2013 book gives a similar estimate of \\"at least ten or fifteen thousand\\" executed.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ultimate objective of the land reform program of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government was not to achieve equitable distribution of farmland but rather the organization of all farmers into co-operatives in which land and other factors of agricultural production would be owned and used collectively.[38]\\r\\nThe first steps after the 1953-1956 land reform were the encouragement by the government of labor exchanges in which farmers would unite to exchange labor; secondly in 1958 and 1959 was the formation of \\"low level cooperatives\\" in which farmers cooperated in production.  By 1961, 86 percent of farmers were members of low-level cooperatives. The third step beginning in 1961 was to organize \\"high level cooperatives\\", true collective farming in which land and resources were utilized collectively without individual ownership of land.[39] By 1971, the great majority of farmers in North Vietnam were organized into high-level cooperatives. Collective farms were abandoned gradually in the 1980s and 1990s.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam, or Vietcong, alongside the North Vietnamese Army, governed South Vietnam during the period before reunification. However it was seen as a vassal government of North Vietnam.[41][42][43] North and South Vietnam were officially reunited under one state on 2 July 1976, forming the Socialist Republic of Vietnam which continues to administer the country today.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1960, the North Vietnamese government went to war with Republic of Vietnam via its proxy the Viet Cong, in an attempt to annex South Vietnam and reunify Vietnam under a communist party.[44] North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces and supplies were sent along the Ho Chi Minh trail. In 1964 the United States sent combat troops to South Vietnam to support the South Vietnamese government, but the U.S. had advisors there since 1950. Other nations, including Australia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand and New Zealand also contributed troops and military aid to South Vietnam's war effort. China and the Soviet Union provided aid to and troops in support of North Vietnamese military activities. This was known as the Vietnam War, or the American War in Vietnam itself (1955ÿ75). In addition to the Viet Cong in South Vietnam, other communist insurgencies also operated within neighboring Kingdom of Laos and Khmer Republic, both formerly part of the French colonial territory of Indochina. These were the Pathet Lao and the Khmer Rouge, respectively. These insurgencies were aided by the North Vietnamese government, which sent troops to fight alongside them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemocratic Republic of Vietnam was diplomatically isolated by many Western states, and many other anti-communist states worldwide throughout most of the North's history, as these states only extended recognition to the anti-communist government of South Vietnam. North Vietnam however, was recognized by almost all Communist countries, such as the Soviet Union and other Socialist countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, China, North Korea, and Cuba, and received aid from these nations. North Vietnam refused to establish diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia from 1950 to 1957, perhaps reflecting Hanoi's deference to the Soviet line on the Yugoslav government of Josip Broz Tito, and North Vietnamese officials continued to be critical of Tito after relations were established.[45][46] Several non-aligned countries also recognized North Vietnam, mostly, similar to India, according North Vietnam de facto rather than de jure (formal) recognition.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1969, Sweden became the first Western country to extend full diplomatic recognition to North Vietnam.[48] Many other Western countries followed suit in the 1970s, such as the government of Australia under Gough Whitlam.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 2102N 10551E? / ?21.033N 105.850E? / 21.033; 105.850","input":"When was the democratic republic of vietnam formed?"},{"output":"Microsoft Windows, version 1.0","context":"On November 10, 1983,[1] Microsoft announced Windows, a graphical user interface (GUI) for MS-DOS and a competitor to the Macintosh operating system. The product line eventually changed from a mere GUI for DOS into a fully complete, modern operating system over two lines of development, each with their own separate codebase.\\r\\nThe first versions of Windows (1.0 through to 3.11) were actually just programs run from MS-DOS which then took over the screen and launched an application called Program Manager; later on, Windows 95, though still being based on MS-DOS, was its own operating system, using a 16-bit DOS-based kernel and a 32-bit user space. Windows 95 introduced many staple features that remain in current versions of Windows today, including the Start menu, the taskbar, and Windows Explorer (renamed File Explorer in Windows 8). In 1997, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 4 which included the (at the time) controversial Windows Desktop Update, which aimed to integrate Internet Explorer and the web into the user interface and also brought many new features into Windows, such as the ability to display JPEG images as the desktop wallpaper and single window navigation in Windows Explorer, all of which still exist in Windows today. In 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98, which also included the Windows Desktop Update and Internet Explorer 4 by default. The inclusion of Internet Explorer 4 and the Desktop Update led to an infamous anti-trust case. Windows 98 also included plug and play, which allowed devices to simply work when plugged in instead of requiring a system reboot, and USB support out of the box, which was previously only available in specially updated versions of Windows 95 which were only shipped to OEMs and not available to the general public. Windows ME, the last DOS-based version of Windows, was aimed at consumers and released in 2000. It introduced the Help and Support Center, System Restore, and updated user-friendly versions of the Disk Defragmenter and other system tools.\\r\\nIn 1993, Microsoft released Windows NT 3.1, the first version of the newly developed Windows NT operating system. It was not based on DOS and, as a result, was a fully 32-bit operating system, unlike the hybrid 16-bit kernel, 32-bit applications model used in Windows 95, 98 and Me. At the same time, it introduced NTFS, a file system designed to replace the inferior File Allocation Table (FAT) which was used by DOS and the DOS-based Windows operating systems. In 1996, Windows NT 4.0 was released, which included a fully 32-bit version of Windows Explorer written specifically for it, making the operating system work just like Windows 95. Windows NT was originally designed to be used on high-end systems and servers, however with the release of Windows 2000 (codenamed NT 5.0), many consumer-oriented features from Windows 95 and Windows 98 were included, such as the Windows Desktop Update, Internet Explorer 5, USB support and Windows Media Player. These consumer-oriented features were continued and further extended in Windows XP, which introduced a new theme called Luna, a more user-friendly interface, updated versions of Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer, and extended features from Windows Me, such as the Help and Support Center and System Restore, all while retaining the robustness and stability of Windows 2000's kernel. Windows Vista focused on securing the Windows operating system against computer viruses and other malicious software by introducing features such as User Account Control, while also including many consumer features such as Windows Aero, updated versions of the standard games (Solitaire, etc.) to show off the 3D capabilities of Vista, Windows Movie Maker, and Windows Mail to replace Outlook Express. Despite this, Windows Vista was critically panned for its poor performance on older hardware and its at-the-time high system requirements. Windows 7, as such, was focused on simplifying Windows Vista. Despite technically having higher system requirements,[2][3] reviewers noted that it ran better than Windows Vista did.[4] Windows 7 also removed many extra features, such as Windows Movie Maker, Windows Photo Gallery and Windows Mail, instead requiring users download a separate Windows Live Essentials to gain those features and other online services. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, a free upgrade for Windows 8, introduced many controversial features, such as the removal of the Start menu and the introduction of the Start Screen, the removal of the Aero glass interface in favor of a flat, colored interface as well as the introduction of \\"Metro\\" apps (later renamed Universal Windows Platform apps) and the Charms Bar user interface element, all of which were criticized.[5][6][7]\\r\\nThe current version of Windows, Windows 10, reintroduced the Start menu, while retaining the Universal Platform apps, but instead allowing them to run in a window instead of always in full screen. Windows 10 was very well received, with many reviewers stating that Windows 10 is what Windows 8 should have been.[8][9][10] Windows 10 also marks the last version of Windows to be traditionally released. For the future, Microsoft will no longer release new versions of Windows and instead introduce major updates to the operating system that add new features, so far 3 of which have been released (see Windows 10 section below).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first independent version of Microsoft Windows, version 1.0, released on November 20, 1985, achieved little popularity. The project was briefly codenamed \\"Interface Manager\\" before the windowing system was developed - contrary to popular belief that it was the original name for Windows and Rowland Hanson, the head of marketing at Microsoft, convinced the company that the name Windows would be more appealing to customers.[11]\\r\\nWindows 1.0 was not a complete operating system, but rather an \\"operating environment\\" that extended MS-DOS, and shared the latter's inherent flaws and problems.\\r\\nThe first version of Microsoft Windows included a simple graphics painting program called Windows Paint; Windows Write, a simple word processor; an appointment calendar; a card-filer; a notepad; a clock; a control panel; a computer terminal; Clipboard; and RAM driver. It also included the MS-DOS Executive and a game called Reversi.\\r\\nMicrosoft had worked with Apple Computer to develop applications for Apple's new Macintosh computer, which featured a graphical user interface. As part of the related business negotiations, Microsoft had licensed certain aspects of the Macintosh user interface from Apple; in later litigation, a district court summarized these aspects as \\"screen displays\\". In the development of Windows 1.0, Microsoft intentionally limited its borrowing of certain GUI elements from the Macintosh user interface, to comply with its license. For example, windows were only displayed \\"tiled\\" on the screen; that is, they could not overlap or overlie one another.\\r\\nMicrosoft Windows version 2 came out on December 9, 1987, and proved slightly more popular than its predecessor. Much of the popularity for Windows 2.0 came by way of its inclusion as a \\"run-time version\\" with Microsoft's new graphical applications, Excel and Word for Windows. They could be run from MS-DOS, executing Windows for the duration of their activity, and closing down Windows upon exit.\\r\\nMicrosoft Windows received a major boost around this time when Aldus PageMaker appeared in a Windows version, having previously run only on Macintosh. Some computer historians[who?] date this, the first appearance of a significant and non-Microsoft application for Windows, as the start of the success of Windows.\\r\\nVersions 2.0x used the real-mode memory model, which confined it to a maximum of 1 megabyte of memory. In such a configuration, it could run under another multitasker like DESQview, which used the 286 protected mode.\\r\\nLater, two new versions were released: Windows/286 2.1 and Windows/386 2.1. Like prior versions of Windows, Windows/286 2.1 used the real-mode memory model, but was the first version to support the High Memory Area. Windows/386 2.1 had a protected mode kernel with LIM-standard EMS emulation. All Windows and DOS-based applications at the time were real mode, running over the protected mode kernel by using the virtual 8086 mode, which was new with the 80386 processor.\\r\\nVersion 2.03, and later 3.0, faced challenges from Apple over its overlapping windows and other features Apple charged mimicked the ostensibly copyrighted \\"look and feel\\" of its operating system and \\"embodie[d] and generated a copy of the Macintosh\\" in its OS. Judge William Schwarzer dropped all but 10 of Apple's 189 claims of copyright infringement, and ruled that most of the remaining 10 were over uncopyrightable ideas.\\r\\nWindows 3.0, released in May 1990, improved capabilities given to native applications. It also allowed users to better multitask older MS-DOS based software compared to Windows/386, thanks to the introduction of virtual memory.\\r\\nWindows 3.0's user interface finally resembled a serious competitor to the user interface of the Macintosh computer. PCs had improved graphics by this time, due to VGA video cards, and the protected/enhanced mode allowed Windows applications to use more memory in a more painless manner than their DOS counterparts could. Windows 3.0 could run in real, standard, or 386 enhanced modes, and was compatible with any Intel processor from the 8086/8088 up to the 80286 and 80386. This was the first version to run Windows programs in protected mode, although the 386 enhanced mode kernel was an enhanced version of the protected mode kernel in Windows/386.\\r\\nWindows 3.0 received two updates. A few months after introduction, Windows 3.0a was released as a maintenance release, resolving bugs and improving stability. A \\"multimedia\\" version, Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions 1.0, was released in October 1991. This was bundled with \\"multimedia upgrade kits\\", comprising a CD-ROM drive and a sound card, such as the Creative Labs Sound Blaster Pro. This version was the precursor to the multimedia features available in Windows 3.1 (first released in April 1992) and later, and was part of Microsoft's specification for the Multimedia PC.\\r\\nThe features listed above and growing market support from application software developers made Windows 3.0 wildly successful, selling around 10 million copies in the two years before the release of version 3.1. Windows 3.0 became a major source of income for Microsoft, and led the company to revise some of its earlier plans. Support was discontinued on December 31, 2001.[12]\\r\\nDuring the mid to late 1980s, Microsoft and IBM had cooperatively been developing OS/2 as a successor to DOS. OS/2 would take full advantage of the aforementioned protected mode of the Intel 80286 processor and up to 16?MB of memory. OS/2 1.0, released in 1987, supported swapping and multitasking and allowed running of DOS executables.\\r\\nA GUI, called the Presentation Manager (PM), was not available with OS/2 until version 1.1, released in 1988. Its API was incompatible with Windows. Version 1.2, released in 1989, introduced a new file system, HPFS, to replace the FAT file system.\\r\\nBy the early 1990s, conflicts developed in the Microsoft/IBM relationship. They cooperated with each other in developing their PC operating systems, and had access to each other's code. Microsoft wanted to further develop Windows, while IBM desired for future work to be based on OS/2. In an attempt to resolve this tension, IBM and Microsoft agreed that IBM would develop OS/2 2.0, to replace OS/2 1.3 and Windows 3.0, while Microsoft would develop a new operating system, OS/2 3.0, to later succeed OS/2 2.0.\\r\\nThis agreement soon fell apart however, and the Microsoft/IBM relationship was terminated. IBM continued to develop OS/2, while Microsoft changed the name of its (as yet unreleased) OS/2 3.0 to Windows NT. Both retained the rights to use OS/2 and Windows technology developed up to the termination of the agreement; Windows NT, however, was to be written anew, mostly independently (see below).\\r\\nAfter an interim 1.3 version to fix up many remaining problems with the 1.x series, IBM released OS/2 version 2.0 in 1992. This was a major improvement: it featured a new, object-oriented GUI, the Workplace Shell (WPS), that included a desktop and was considered by many to be OS/2's best feature. Microsoft would later imitate much of it in Windows 95. Version 2.0 also provided a full 32-bit API, offered smooth multitasking and could take advantage of the 4?gigabytes of address space provided by the Intel 80386. Still, much of the system had 16-bit code internally which required, among other things, device drivers to be 16-bit code also. This was one of the reasons for the chronic shortage of OS/2 drivers for the latest devices. Version 2.0 could also run DOS and Windows 3.0 programs, since IBM had retained the right to use the DOS and Windows code as a result of the breakup.\\r\\nIn response to the impending release of OS/2 2.0, Microsoft developed Windows 3.1 (first released in April 1992), which included several improvements to Windows 3.0, such as display of TrueType scalable fonts (developed jointly with Apple), improved disk performance in 386 Enhanced Mode, multimedia support, and bugfixes. It also removed Real Mode, and only ran on an 80286 or better processor. Later Microsoft also released Windows 3.11, a touch-up to Windows 3.1 which included all of the patches and updates that followed the release of Windows 3.1 in 1992.\\r\\nIn 1992 and 1993, Microsoft released Windows for Workgroups (WfW), which was available both as an add-on for existing Windows 3.1 installations and in a version that included the base Windows environment and the networking extensions all in one package. Windows for Workgroups included improved network drivers and protocol stacks, and support for peer-to-peer networking. There were two versions of Windows for Workgroups, WfW 3.1 and WfW 3.11. Unlike prior versions, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 ran in 386 Enhanced Mode only, and needed at least an 80386SX processor. One optional download for WfW was the \\"Wolverine\\" TCP/IP protocol stack, which allowed for easy access to the Internet through corporate networks.\\r\\nAll these versions continued version 3.0's impressive sales pace. Even though the 3.1x series still lacked most of the important features of OS/2, such as long file names, a desktop, or protection of the system against misbehaving applications, Microsoft quickly took over the OS and GUI markets for the IBM PC. The Windows API became the de facto standard for consumer software.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Microsoft continued to develop Windows NT. The main architect of the system was Dave Cutler, one of the chief architects of VMS at Digital Equipment Corporation (later acquired by Compaq, now part of Hewlett-Packard).[13] Microsoft hired him in October 1988 to create a successor to OS/2, but Cutler created a completely new system instead. Cutler had been developing a follow-on to VMS at DEC called Mica, and when DEC dropped the project he brought the expertise and around 20 engineers with him to Microsoft. DEC also believed he brought Mica's code to Microsoft and sued.[14] Microsoft eventually paid US$150 million and agreed to support DEC's Alpha CPU chip in NT.\\r\\nWindows NT Workstation (Microsoft marketing wanted Windows NT to appear to be a continuation of Windows 3.1) arrived in Beta form to developers at the July 1992 Professional Developers Conference in San Francisco.[15] Microsoft announced at the conference its intentions to develop a successor to both Windows NT and Windows 3.1's replacement (Windows 95, codenamed Chicago), which would unify the two into one operating system. This successor was codenamed Cairo. In hindsight, Cairo was a much more difficult project than Microsoft had anticipated and, as a result, NT and Chicago would not be unified until Windows XPalbeit Windows 2000, oriented to business, had already unified most of the systems bolts and gears, it was XP that was sold to home consumers like Windows 95 and came to be viewed as the final unified OS. Parts of Cairo have still not made it into Windows as of 2017 - most notably, the WinFS file system, which was the much touted Object File System of Cairo. Microsoft announced that they have discontinued the separate release of WinFS for Windows XP and Windows Vista[16] and will gradually incorporate the technologies developed for WinFS in other products and technologies, notably Microsoft SQL Server.\\r\\nDriver support was lacking due to the increased programming difficulty in dealing with NT's superior hardware abstraction model. This problem plagued the NT line all the way through Windows 2000. Programmers complained that it was too hard to write drivers for NT, and hardware developers were not going to go through the trouble of developing drivers for a small segment of the market. Additionally, although allowing for good performance and fuller exploitation of system resources, it was also resource-intensive on limited hardware, and thus was only suitable for larger, more expensive machines.\\r\\nHowever, these same features made Windows NT perfect for the LAN server market (which in 1993 was experiencing a rapid boom, as office networking was becoming common). NT also had advanced network connectivity options and NTFS, an efficient file system. Windows NT version 3.51 was Microsoft's entry into this field, and took away market share from Novell (the dominant player) in the following years.\\r\\nOne of Microsoft's biggest advances initially developed for Windows NT was a new 32-bit API, to replace the legacy 16-bit Windows API. This API was called Win32, and from then on Microsoft referred to the older 16-bit API as Win16. The Win32 API had three levels implementations: the complete one for Windows NT, a subset for Chicago (originally called Win32c) missing features primarily of interest to enterprise customers (at the time) such as security and Unicode support, and a more limited subset called Win32s which could be used on Windows 3.1 systems. Thus Microsoft sought to ensure some degree of compatibility between the Chicago design and Windows NT, even though the two systems had radically different internal architectures. Windows NT was the first Windows operating system based on a hybrid kernel.\\r\\nAs released, Windows NT 3.x went through three versions (3.1, 3.5, and 3.51); changes were primarily internal and reflected back end changes. The 3.5 release added support for new types of hardware and improved performance and data reliability; the 3.51 release was primarily to update the Win32 APIs to be compatible with software being written for the Win32c APIs in what became Windows 95.\\r\\nAfter Windows 3.11, Microsoft began to develop a new consumer oriented version of the operating system codenamed Chicago. Chicago was designed to have support for 32-bit preemptive multitasking like OS/2 and Windows NT, although a 16-bit kernel would remain for the sake of backward compatibility. The Win32 API first introduced with Windows NT was adopted as the standard 32-bit programming interface, with Win16 compatibility being preserved through a technique known as \\"thunking\\". A new object oriented GUI was not originally planned as part of the release, although elements of the Cairo user interface were borrowed and added as other aspects of the release (notably Plug and Play) slipped.\\r\\nMicrosoft did not change all of the Windows code to 32-bit; parts of it remained 16-bit (albeit not directly using real mode) for reasons of compatibility, performance, and development time. Additionally it was necessary to carry over design decisions from earlier versions of Windows for reasons of backwards compatibility, even if these design decisions no longer matched a more modern computing environment. These factors eventually began to impact the operating system's efficiency and stability.\\r\\nMicrosoft marketing adopted Windows 95 as the product name for Chicago when it was released on August 24, 1995. Microsoft had a double gain from its release: first, it made it impossible for consumers to run Windows 95 on a cheaper, non-Microsoft DOS; secondly, although traces of DOS were never completely removed from the system and MS DOS 7 would be loaded briefly as a part of the booting process, Windows 95 applications ran solely in 386 enhanced mode, with a flat 32-bit address space and virtual memory. These features make it possible for Win32 applications to address up to 2 gigabytes of virtual RAM (with another 2?GB reserved for the operating system), and in theory prevented them from inadvertently corrupting the memory space of other Win32 applications. In this respect the functionality of Windows 95 moved closer to Windows NT, although Windows 95/98/ME did not support more than 512 megabytes of physical RAM without obscure system tweaks.\\r\\nIBM continued to market OS/2, producing later versions in OS/2 3.0 and 4.0 (also called Warp). Responding to complaints about OS/2 2.0's high demands on computer hardware, version 3.0 was significantly optimized both for speed and size. Before Windows 95 was released, OS/2 Warp 3.0 was even shipped preinstalled with several large German hardware vendor chains. However, with the release of Windows 95, OS/2 began to lose market share.\\r\\nIt is probably impossible to choose one specific reason why OS/2 failed to gain much market share. While OS/2 continued to run Windows 3.1 applications, it lacked support for anything but the Win32s subset of Win32 API (see above). Unlike with Windows 3.1, IBM did not have access to the source code for Windows 95 and was unwilling to commit the time and resources to emulate the moving target of the Win32 API. IBM later introduced OS/2 into the United States v. Microsoft case, blaming unfair marketing tactics on Microsoft's part.\\r\\nMicrosoft went on to release five different versions of Windows 95:\\r\\nOSR2, OSR2.1, and OSR2.5 were not released to the general public; rather, they were available only to OEMs that would preload the OS onto computers. Some companies sold new hard drives with OSR2 preinstalled (officially justifying this as needed due to the hard drive's capacity).\\r\\nThe first Microsoft Plus! add-on pack was sold for Windows 95.\\r\\nWindows NT 4.0 was the successor of 3.51 (1995) and 3.5 (1994). Microsoft released Windows NT 4.0 to manufacturing in July 1996, one year after the release of Windows 95. Major new features included the new Explorer shell from Windows 95, scalability and feature improvements to the core architecture, kernel, USER32, COM and MSRPC.[17]\\r\\nWindows NT 4.0 came in four versions:\\r\\nOn June 25, 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98 (codenamed Memphis). It included new hardware drivers and the FAT32 file system which supports disk partitions that are larger than 2?GB (first introduced in Windows 95 OSR2). USB support in Windows 98 is marketed as a vast improvement over Windows 95. The release continued the controversial inclusion of the Internet Explorer browser with the operating system that started with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1. The action eventually led to the filing of the United States v. Microsoft case, dealing with the question of whether Microsoft was introducing unfair practices into the market in an effort to eliminate competition from other companies such as Netscape.[18]\\r\\nIn 1999, Microsoft released Windows 98?Second Edition, an interim release. One of the more notable new features was the addition of Internet Connection Sharing, a form of network address translation, allowing several machines on a LAN (Local Area Network) to share a single Internet connection. Hardware support through device drivers was increased and this version shipped with Internet Explorer 5. Many minor problems that existed in the first edition were fixed making it, according to many, the most stable release of the Windows 9x family.[citation needed]\\r\\nMicrosoft released Windows 2000 on February 17, 2000. It has the version number Windows NT 5.0. Windows 2000 has had four official service packs. It was successfully deployed both on the server and the workstation markets. Amongst Windows 2000's most significant new features was Active Directory, a near-complete replacement of the NT 4.0 Windows Server domain model, which built on industry-standard technologies like DNS, LDAP, and Kerberos to connect machines to one another. Terminal Services, previously only available as a separate edition of NT 4, was expanded to all server versions. A number of features from Windows 98 were incorporated also, such as an improved Device Manager, Windows Media Player, and a revised DirectX that made it possible for the first time for many modern games to work on the NT kernel. Windows 2000 is also the last NT-kernel Windows operating system to lack product activation.\\r\\nWhile Windows 2000 upgrades were available for Windows 95 and Windows 98, it was not intended for home users.[19]\\r\\nWindows 2000 was available in four editions:\\r\\nIn September 2000, Microsoft released a successor to Windows 98 called Windows ME, short for \\"Millennium Edition\\". It was the last DOS-based operating system from Microsoft. Windows ME introduced a new multimedia-editing application called Windows Movie Maker, came standard with Internet Explorer 5.5 and Windows Media Player 7, and debuted the first version of System Restore ÿ a recovery utility that enables the operating system to revert system files back to a prior date and time. System Restore was a notable feature that would continue to thrive in later versions of Windows, including XP, Vista, and Windows 7.\\r\\nWindows ME was conceived as a quick one-year project that served as a stopgap release between Windows 98 and Windows XP. Many of the new features were available from the Windows Update site as updates for older Windows versions (System Restore and Windows Movie Maker were exceptions). Windows ME was criticized for stability issues, as well as for lacking real mode DOS support, to the point of being referred to as the \\"Mistake Edition\\"[20] or \\"Many Errors.\\" Windows ME was the last operating system to be based on the Windows 9x (monolithic) kernel and MS-DOS.\\r\\nOn October 25, 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP (codenamed \\"Whistler\\"). The merging of the Windows NT/2000 and Windows 95/98/Me lines was finally achieved with Windows XP. Windows XP uses the Windows NT 5.1 kernel, marking the entrance of the Windows NT core to the consumer market, to replace the aging 16/32-bit branch. The initial release met with considerable criticism, particularly in the area of security, leading to the release of three major Service Packs. Windows XP SP1 was released in September 2002, SP2 came out in August 2004 and SP3 came out in April 2008. Service Pack 2 provided significant improvements and encouraged widespread adoption of XP among both home and business users. Windows XP lasted longer as Microsoft's flagship operating system than any other version of Windows, from October 25, 2001 to January 30, 2007 when it was succeeded by Windows Vista.\\r\\nWindows XP is available in a number of versions:\\r\\nOn April 25, 2003 Microsoft launched Windows Server 2003, a notable update to Windows 2000 Server encompassing many new security features, a new \\"Manage Your Server\\" wizard that simplifies configuring a machine for specific roles, and improved performance. It has the version number NT 5.2. A few services not essential for server environments are disabled by default for stability reasons, most noticeable are the \\"Windows Audio\\" and \\"Themes\\" services; users have to enable them manually to get sound or the \\"Luna\\" look as per Windows XP. The hardware acceleration for display is also turned off by default, users have to turn the acceleration level up themselves if they trust the display card driver.\\r\\nDecember 2005, Microsoft released Windows Server 2003 R2, which is actually Windows Server 2003 with SP1 (Service Pack 1) plus an add-on package. Among the new features are a number of management features for branch offices, file serving, printing and company-wide identity integration.\\r\\nWindows Server 2003 is available in six editions:\\r\\nWindows Server 2003 R2, an update of Windows Server 2003, was released to manufacturing on December 6, 2005. It is distributed on two CDs, with one CD being the Windows Server 2003 SP1 CD. The other CD adds many optionally installable features for Windows Server 2003. The R2 update was released for all x86 and x64 versions, except Windows Server 2003 R2 Enterprise Edition, which was not released for Itanium.\\r\\nOn April 25, 2005, Microsoft released Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows Server 2003, x64 Editions in Standard, Enterprise and Datacenter SKUs. Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is an edition of Windows XP for x86-64 personal computers. It is designed to use the expanded 64-bit memory address space provided by the x86-64 architecture.[21]\\r\\nWindows XP Professional x64 Edition is based on the Windows Server 2003 codebase; with the server features removed and client features added. Both Windows Server 2003 x64 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition use identical kernels.[22]\\r\\nWindows XP Professional x64 Edition is not to be confused with Windows XP 64-bit Edition, as the latter was designed for Intel Itanium processors.[23][24] During the initial development phases, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition was named Windows XP 64-Bit Edition for 64-Bit Extended Systems.[25]\\r\\nIn July 2005, Microsoft released a thin-client version of Windows XP Service Pack 2, called Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs (WinFLP). It is only available to Software Assurance customers. The aim of WinFLP is to give companies a viable upgrade option for older PCs that are running Windows 95, 98, and ME that will be supported with patches and updates for the next several years. Most user applications will typically be run on a remote machine using Terminal Services or Citrix.\\r\\nWindows Home Server (codenamed Q, Quattro) is a server product based on Windows Server 2003, designed for consumer use. The system was announced on January 7, 2007 by Russel Adolfo. Windows Home Server can be configured and monitored using a console program that can be installed on a client PC. Such features as Media Sharing, local and remote drive backup and file duplication are all listed as features. The release of Windows Home Server Power Pack 3 added support for Windows 7 to Windows Home Server.\\r\\nWindows Vista was released on November 30, 2006 to business customers - consumer versions followed on January 30, 2007. Windows Vista intended to have enhanced security by introducing a new restricted user mode called User Account Control, replacing the \\"administrator-by-default\\" philosophy of Windows XP. Vista was the target of much criticism and negative press, and in general was not well regarded; this was seen as leading to the relatively swift release of Windows 7.\\r\\nOne major difference between Vista and earlier versions of Windows, Windows 95 and later, is that the original start button was replaced with the Windows icon in a circle (called the Start Orb). Vista also features new graphics features, the Windows Aero GUI, new applications (such as Windows Calendar, Windows DVD Maker and some new games including Chess, Mahjong, and Purble Place),[26] Internet Explorer 7, Windows Media Player 11, and a large number of underlying architectural changes including Windows Powershell being shipped with the operating system, which many believed to have taken place in Windows 7's architecture and later. Windows Vista has the version number NT 6.0. Since its release, Windows Vista has had two service packs.\\r\\nWindows Vista ships in six editions:[27]\\r\\nAll editions (except Starter edition) are currently available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. The biggest advantage of the 64-bit version is breaking the 4?gigabyte memory barrier, which 32-bit computers cannot fully access.\\r\\nWindows Server 2008, released on February 27, 2008, was originally known as Windows Server Codename \\"Longhorn\\". Windows Server 2008 builds on the technological and security advances first introduced with Windows Vista, and is significantly more modular than its predecessor, Windows Server 2003.\\r\\nWindows Server 2008 ships in ten editions:\\r\\nWindows 7 was released to manufacturing on July 22, 2009, and reached general retail availability on October 22, 2009.[28][29] It was previously known by the codenames Blackcomb and Vienna. Windows 7 has the version number NT 6.1. Since its release, Windows 7 has had one service pack.\\r\\nSome features of Windows 7 are faster booting, Device Stage, Windows PowerShell, less obtrusive User Account Control, multi-touch, and improved window management.[30] Features included with Windows Vista and not in Windows 7 include the sidebar (although gadgets remain) and several programs that were removed in favor of downloading their Windows Live counterparts.\\r\\nWindows 7 ships in six editions:[31]\\r\\nIn some countries (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland)[citation needed], there are other editions that lack some features such as Windows Media Player, Windows Media Center and Internet Explorer - these editions were called names such as \\"Windows 7 N.\\" Microsoft focuses on selling Windows 7 Home Premium and Professional. All editions, except the Starter edition, are available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Unlike the corresponding Vista editions, the Professional and Enterprise editions are supersets of the Home Premium edition.\\r\\nAt the Professional Developers Conference (PDC) 2008, Microsoft also announced Windows Server 2008 R2, as the server variant of Windows 7. Windows Server 2008 R2 ships in 64-bit versions (x64 and Itanium) only.\\r\\nIn 2010, Microsoft released Windows Thin PC or WinTPC, which is a feature- and size-reduced locked-down version of Windows 7 expressly designed to turn older PCs into thin clients. WinTPC is available for software assurance customers and relies on cloud computing in a business network. Wireless operation is supported since WinTPC has full wireless stack integration, but wireless operation may not be as good as the operation on a wired connection.[32][33]\\r\\nWindows Home Server 2011 code named 'Vail'[34] was released on April 6, 2011.[35] Windows Home Server 2011 is built on the Windows Server 2008 R2 code base and removed the Drive Extender drive pooling technology in the original Windows Home Server release.[36] Windows Home Server 2011 is considered a \\"major release\\".[34] Its predecessor was built on Windows Server 2003. WHS 2011 only supports x86-64 hardware.\\r\\nMicrosoft decided to discontinue Windows Home Server 2011 on July 5, 2012 while including its features into Windows Server 2012 Essentials.[37] Windows Home Server 2011 was supported until April 12, 2016.[38]\\r\\nOn October 26, 2012, Microsoft released Windows 8 to the public. One edition, Windows RT, runs on some system-on-a-chip devices with mobile 32-bit ARM (ARMv7) processors. Windows 8 features a redesigned user interface, designed to make it easier for touchscreen users to use Windows. The interface introduced an updated Start menu known as the Start screen, and a new full-screen application platform. The desktop interface is also present for running windowed applications, although Windows RT will not run any desktop applications not included in the system. On the Building Windows 8 blog, it was announced that a computer running Windows 8 can boot up much faster than Windows 7.[39] New features also include USB 3.0 support, the Windows Store, the ability to run from USB drives with Windows To Go, and others. Windows 8 was given the kernel number NT 6.2, with its successor 8.1 receiving the kernel number 6.3. So far, neither has had any service packs yet, although many consider Windows 8.1 to be a service pack for Windows 8.\\r\\nWindows 8 is available in the following editions:\\r\\nThe first public preview of Windows Server 2012 and was also shown by Microsoft at the 2011 Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference.[40]\\r\\nWindows 8 Release Preview and Windows Server 2012 Release Candidate were both released on May 31, 2012.[41] Product development on Windows 8 was completed on August 1, 2012, and it was released to manufacturing the same day.[42] Windows Server 2012 went on sale to the public on September 4, 2012. Windows 8 went on sale October 26, 2012.\\r\\nWindows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 were released on October 17, 2013. Windows 8.1 is available as an update in the Windows store for Windows 8 users only and also available to download for clean installation.[43] The update adds new options for resizing the live tiles on the Start screen.[44]\\r\\nWindows 10, codenamed Threshold, is the current release of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Unveiled on September 30, 2014, it was released on July 29, 2015.[45] It was distributed without charge to Windows 7 and 8.1 users for one year after release. A number of new features like Cortana, the Microsoft Edge web browser, the ability to view Windows Store apps as a window instead of fullscreen, virtual desktops, revamped core apps, Continuum, and a unified Settings app were all features debuted in Windows 10. Microsoft has announced that Windows 10 will be the last major version of its series of operating systems to be released. Instead, Microsoft will release major updates to the operating system via download or in Windows Update, similar to the way updates are delivered in macOS.[46]\\r\\nSo far, three major versions have been released, and one has been announced for release in 2017:\\r\\nWindows Server 2016 is a release of the Microsoft Windows Server operating system that was unveiled on September 30, 2014. Windows Server 2016 was officially released at Microsoft's Ignite Conference, September 26ÿ30, 2016.[53]","input":"What is the oldest version of microsoft windows?"},{"output":"Abraham Lincoln","context":"Assassination attempts and plots on the President of the United States have been numerous, ranging from the early 1800s to the 2010s. More than 30 attempts to kill an incumbent or former president, or a president-elect have been made since the early 1800s. Four sitting presidents have been killed, all of them by gunshot: Abraham Lincoln (1865), James A. Garfield (1881), William McKinley (1901) and John F. Kennedy (1963). Additionally, two presidents have been injured in attempted assassinations, also by gunshot: Theodore Roosevelt (1912; former president at the time) and Ronald Reagan (1981).\\r\\nAlthough the historian James W. Clarke has suggested that most American assassinations were politically motivated actions, carried out by rational men,[1] not all such attacks have been undertaken for political reasons.[2] Some attackers had questionable mental stability, and a few were judged legally insane.[3][4] Since the Vice President of the United States has for more than a century been elected from the same political party as the President, the assassination of the President is unlikely to result in major policy changes. This may explain why political groups typically do not make such attacks.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assassination of President Lincoln took place on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., at approximately 10:15?p.m.. John Wilkes Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate sympathizer from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service.[6] In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy)[7] to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president.[8] Learning that the President would be attending Ford's Theatre, Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Lincoln at the theater, as well as Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward at their homes. Lincoln attended the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre.[9] As the President sat in his state box in the balcony, watching the play, with his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, and two guests, Major Henry Rathbone and his fiance Clara Harris, Booth entered from behind, aimed a .44 caliber Derringer pistol at the back of Lincoln's head, and fired, mortally wounding the President. Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped. The unconscious President was carried across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he remained in a coma for nine hours before dying the following morning at 7:22?a.m. on April 15.[10]\\r\\nBeyond Lincoln's death the plot failed: Seward was only wounded and Johnson's would-be attacker lost his nerve.\\r\\nAfter being on the run for 12 days, Booth was tracked down and found on April 26, 1865 by Union soldiers on a farm in Virginia, some 70 miles (110?km) south of Washington. After refusing to surrender to Union troops, Booth was shot and killed by Sergeant Boston Corbett. Several other conspirators were later hanged.\\r\\nThe assassination of President Garfield took place in Washington, D.C., at 9:30?a.m. on Saturday, July 2, 1881, less than four months after he took office. Charles J. Guiteau shot him twice, once in his right arm and once in his back, with a .442 Webley British Bulldog revolver, as the president was arriving at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station. Garfield died 11 weeks later, on September 19, 1881, at 10:35?p.m., of complications caused by infections.\\r\\nGuiteau was immediately arrested. After a highly publicized trial lasting from November 14, 1881 to January 25, 1882, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. A subsequent appeal was rejected, and he was executed by hanging on June 30, 1882 in the District of Columbia, two days before the first anniversary of the attempt. Guiteau was assessed during his trial as mentally unbalanced and possibly suffered from some kind of bipolar disorder or from the effects of syphilis on the brain. He claimed to have shot Garfield out of disappointment for being passed over for appointment as Ambassador to France. He attributed the president's victory in the election to a speech he wrote in support of Garfield.[11]\\r\\nThe assassination of President McKinley took place at 4:07?p.m. on Friday, September 6, 1901, at the Temple of Music in Buffalo, New York. McKinley, attending the Pan-American Exposition, was shot twice in the abdomen at close range by Leon Czolgosz, a self-proclaimed anarchist, who was armed with a .32 caliber revolver wrapped up in what seemed to be a bandage. The first bullet ricocheted off either a button or an award medal on McKinley's jacket and lodged in his sleeve but the second shot pierced his stomach. McKinley died seven days later, on September 14, 1901, at 2:15?a.m, after his condition rapidly declined.\\r\\nMembers of the crowd captured and subdued Czolgosz. Afterward, the 4th Brigade, National Guard Signal Corps, and police intervened, beating Czolgosz so severely it was initially thought he might not live to stand trial. On September 24, after a rushed, two-day trial in state court, Czolgosz was sentenced to death. He was executed by electric chair in Auburn Prison on October 29, 1901. Czolgosz's actions were politically motivated, although it remains unclear what outcome, if any, he believed the shooting would yield.\\r\\nFollowing the assassination of President William McKinley, Congress directed the Secret Service to protect the President of the United States as part of its mandate.\\r\\nThe assassination of President Kennedy took place on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, at 12:30?p.m. CST (18:30 UTC), while riding in a presidential motorcade in Dealey Plaza.[12] Kennedy was riding with his wife Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, Connally's wife, Nellie, and two Secret Service agents, when he was fatally shot in the neck and head. He was the only assassinated president to die on the same day of his injuries. Governor Connally was seriously wounded in the attack. The motorcade rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital where President Kennedy was pronounced dead about thirty minutes after the shooting; Connally recovered from his injuries.\\r\\nFormer U.S. Marine and Marxist[13] Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested by members of the Dallas Police Department about 70 minutes after the initial shooting. Oswald was charged under Texas state law with the murder of Kennedy as well as that of a Dallas policeman, J. D. Tippit, who had been fatally shot a short time after the assassination. At 11:21?a.m. Sunday, November 24, 1963, as live television cameras covered his transfer to the Dallas County Jail, Oswald was shot in the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters by Jack Ruby, a Dallas nightclub operator. Oswald was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital where he soon died. Ruby was convicted of Oswald's murder and died in prison in 1967.\\r\\nAfter a ten-month investigation, the Warren Commission concluded that Kennedy was assassinated by Oswald, that Oswald had acted entirely alone, and that Ruby had acted alone in killing Oswald. Nonetheless, polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found that up to 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or cover-up.[14][15] Doubts and conspiracy theories continue to persist.\\r\\nOn July 4, 1850, President Zachary Taylor fell ill and was diagnosed by his physicians with cholera morbus, a term that included diarrhea and dysentery but not true cholera. Cholera, typhoid fever and food poisoning have all been indicated as the source of the president's ultimately fatal gastroenteritis. A hasty snack of iced milk, cold cherries and pickles consumed at an Independence Day celebration might have been the culprit.[77] Taylor died five days later in the White House on July 9, 1850, at 10:35?p.m. (22:35).[78]\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, author Clara Rising theorized that Taylor was murdered by poison; she was able to convince Taylor's closest living relative, as well as the coroner of Jefferson County, Kentucky, Dr. Richard Greathouse, to order an exhumation. On June 17, 1991, Taylor's remains were exhumed from the vault at the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. Radiological studies were conducted of the remains before small samples of hair, fingernail, and other tissues were removed. The remains were retinterred with appropriate honors. The samples were sent to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where neutron activation analysis revealed traces of arsenic, but at levels less than one percent of the level expected in a death by poisoning.[79]\\r\\nIn June 1923, President Warren G. Harding set out on a cross-country \\"Voyage of Understanding\\", planning to meet with citizens and explain his policies. During this trip, he became the first president to visit Alaska, which was then a U.S. territory.[80]\\r\\nRumors of corruption in the Harding administration were beginning to circulate in Washington by 1923, and Harding was profoundly shocked by a long message he received while in Alaska, apparently detailing illegal activities by his own cabinet that were allegedly unknown to him. At the end of July, while traveling south from Alaska through British Columbia, he developed what was thought to be a severe case of food poisoning. He gave the final speech of his life to a large crowd at the University of Washington Stadium (now Husky Stadium) at the University of Washington campus in Seattle, Washington. A scheduled speech in Portland, Oregon, was canceled. The President's train proceeded south to San Francisco. Upon arriving at the Palace Hotel, he developed pneumonia. Harding died in his hotel room of either a heart attack or a stroke at 7:35?p.m. (19:35) on August 2, 1923. The formal announcement, printed in The New York Times of that day, stated: \\"A stroke of apoplexy was the cause of death.\\" He had been ill exactly one week.[81]\\r\\nNaval physicians surmised that Harding had suffered a heart attack. The Hardings' personal medical advisor, homeopath and Surgeon General Charles E. Sawyer, disagreed with the diagnosis. His wife, Florence Harding, refused permission for an autopsy, which soon led to speculation that the President had been the victim of a plot, possibly carried out by his wife, as Harding apparently had been unfaithful to the First Lady. Gaston B. Means, an amateur historian and gadfly, noted in his book The Strange Death of President Harding (1930) that the circumstances surrounding his death led to suspicions that he had been poisoned. A number of individuals attached to him, both personally and politically, would have welcomed Harding's death, as they would have been disgraced in association by Means' assertion of Harding's \\"imminent impeachment\\".","input":"Who is the first president to be assassinated?"},{"output":"June 3, 1969","context":"The Original Series films\\r\\nThe Next Generation films\\r\\nReboot films\\r\\nThe Original Series (1966ÿ69)\\r\\nPrequels to The Original Series\\r\\nStar Trek is an American media franchise based on the science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry. The first television series, simply called Star Trek and now referred to as The Original Series, debuted in 1966 and aired for three seasons on the television network NBC. It followed the interstellar adventures of Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and his crew aboard the starship USS Enterprise, a space exploration vessel, built by the interstellar federal republic United Federation of Planets in the twenty-third century. The Star Trek canon of the franchise includes The Original Series, an animated series, five spin-off television series, and its film franchise in addition to further adaptations made in several media since the original.\\r\\nIn creating Star Trek, Roddenberry was inspired by the Horatio Hornblower novels, the satirical book Gulliver's Travels, and by works of western genre such as the television series Wagon Train. These adventures continued in the short-lived Star Trek: The Animated Series and six feature films. Four spin-off television series were eventually produced: Star Trek: The Next Generation followed the crew of a new starship Enterprise set a century after the original series; Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager set contemporaneously with The Next Generation; and Star Trek: Enterprise set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent Star Trek TV series, entitled Star Trek: Discovery, premiered on CBS and later made available exclusively on the digital platform CBS All Access. The adventures of The Next Generation crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a \\"reboot\\" set in an alternate timeline, or \\"Kelvin Timeline,\\" entitled simply Star Trek. This film featured a new cast portraying younger versions of the crew from the original show; their adventures were continued in the sequel film, Star Trek Into Darkness (2013). The thirteenth film feature and sequel, Star Trek Beyond (2016), was released to coincide with the franchise's 50th anniversary.\\r\\nStar Trek has been a cult phenomenon for decades.[1] Fans of the franchise are called Trekkies or Trekkers. The franchise spans a wide range of spin-offs including games, figurines, novels, toys, and comics. Star Trek had a themed attraction in Las Vegas that opened in 1998 and closed in September 2008. At least two museum exhibits of props travel the world. The series has its own full-fledged constructed language, Klingon. Several parodies have been made of Star Trek. In addition, viewers have produced several fan productions. As of July 2016, the franchise had generated $10?billion in revenue,[2] making Star Trek one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\\r\\nStar Trek is noted for its cultural influence beyond works of science fiction.[3] The franchise is also noted for its progressive civil rights stances.[4] The Original Series included one of television's first multiracial casts. Star Trek references may be found throughout popular culture from movies such as the submarine thriller Crimson Tide to the animated series South Park.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as 1964, Gene Roddenberry drafted a proposal for the science-fiction series that would become Star Trek. Although he publicly marketed it as a Western in outer spacea so-called \\"Wagon Train to the Stars\\"[5]he privately told friends that he was modeling it on Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, intending each episode to act on two levels: as a suspenseful adventure story and as a morality tale.[6]\\r\\nMost Star Trek stories depict the adventures of humans[Note 1] and aliens who serve in Starfleet, the space-borne humanitarian and peacekeeping armada of the United Federation of Planets. The protagonists have altruistic values, and must apply these ideals to difficult dilemmas.\\r\\nMany of the conflicts and political dimensions of Star Trek represent allegories of contemporary cultural realities. Star Trek: The Original Series addressed issues of the 1960s,[7] just as later spin-offs have reflected issues of their respective decades. Issues depicted in the various series include war and peace, the value of personal loyalty, authoritarianism, imperialism, class warfare, economics, racism, religion, human rights, sexism, feminism, and the role of technology.[8] Roddenberry stated: \\"[By creating] a new world with new rules, I could make statements about sex, religion, Vietnam, politics, and intercontinental missiles. Indeed, we did make them on Star Trek: we were sending messages and fortunately they all got by the network.\\"[9] \\"If you talked about purple people on a far off planet, they (the TV network) never really caught on. They were more concerned about cleavage. They actually would send a censor down to the set to measure a woman's cleavage to make sure too much of her breast wasn't showing\\"[10]\\r\\nRoddenberry intended the show to have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into, if it would learn from the lessons of the past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations.[11] His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.[12]\\r\\nThe central trio of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy from Star Trek: The Original Series was modeled on classical mythological storytelling.[13]\\r\\nWilliam Shatner said: \\"There is a mythological component [to pop culture], especially with science fiction. It's people looking for answers ÿ and science fiction offers to explain the inexplicable, the same as religion tends to do... If we accept the premise that it has a mythological element, then all the stuff about going out into space and meeting new life ÿ trying to explain it and put a human element to it ÿ it's a hopeful vision. All these things offer hope and imaginative solutions for the future.\\"[14]\\r\\nRichard Lutz wrote: \\"The enduring popularity of Star Trek is due to the underlying mythology which binds fans together by virtue of their shared love of stories involving exploration, discovery, adventure and friendship that promote an egalitarian and peace loving society where technology and diversity are valued rather than feared and citizens work together for the greater good. Thus Star Trek offers a hopeful vision of the future and a template for our lives and our society that we can aspire to.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 1964, Roddenberry presented a brief treatment for a proposed Star Trek TV series to Desilu Productions comparing it to Wagon Train, \\"a Wagon Train to the stars.\\"[16] Desilu worked with Roddenberry to develop the treatment into a script, which was then pitched to NBC.[17]\\r\\nNBC paid to make a pilot, \\"The Cage\\", starring Jeffrey Hunter as Enterprise Captain Christopher Pike. NBC rejected The Cage, but the executives were still impressed with the concept, and made the unusual decision to commission a second pilot: \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\".[17]\\r\\nThe first regular episode (\\"The Man Trap\\") of Star Trek: The Original Series aired on Thursday, September 8, 1966 in the US.[18][Note 2]\\r\\nWhile the show initially enjoyed high ratings, the average rating of the show at the end of its first season dropped to 52nd out of 94 programs. Unhappy with the show's ratings, NBC threatened to cancel the show during its second season.[19] The show's fan base, led by Bjo Trimble, conducted an unprecedented letter-writing campaign, petitioning the network to keep the show on the air.[19][20] NBC renewed the show, but moved it from primetime to the \\"Friday night death slot\\", and substantially reduced its budget.[21] In protest Roddenberry resigned as producer and reduced his direct involvement in Star Trek, which led to Fred Freiberger becoming producer for the show's third and final season.[Note 3] Despite another letter-writing campaign, NBC cancelled the series after three seasons and 79 episodes.[17]\\r\\nAfter the original series was cancelled, Paramount Studios, which had bought the series from Desilu, licensed the broadcast syndication rights to help recoup the production losses. Reruns began in the fall of 1969 and by the late 1970s the series aired in over 150 domestic and 60 international markets. This helped Star Trek develop a cult following greater than its popularity during its original run.[22]\\r\\nOne sign of the series' growing popularity was the first Star Trek convention which occurred on January 21ÿ23, 1972 in New York City. Although the original estimate of attendees was only a few hundred, several thousand fans turned up. Star Trek fans continue to attend similar conventions worldwide.[23]\\r\\nThe series' newfound success led to the idea of reviving the franchise.[24] Filmation with Paramount Television produced the first post original series show, Star Trek: The Animated Series. It ran on NBC for 22 half-hour episodes over two seasons on Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1974.[25] Although short-lived, typical for animated productions in that time slot during that period, the series garnered the franchise's only \\"Best Series\\" Emmy Award as opposed to the franchise's later technical ones. Paramount Pictures and Roddenberry began developing a new series, Star Trek: Phase II, in May 1975 in response to the franchise's newfound popularity. Work on the series ended, however, when the proposed Paramount Television Service folded.\\r\\nFollowing the success of the science fiction movies Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Paramount adapted the planned pilot episode of Phase II into the feature film Star Trek: The Motion Picture. The film opened in North America on December 7, 1979, with mixed reviews from critics. The film earned $139 million worldwide, below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel. The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels.\\r\\nThe success of the critically acclaimed sequel, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, reversed the fortunes of the franchise. While the sequel grossed less than the first movie, The Wrath of Khan's lower production costs made it net more profit. Paramount produced six Star Trek feature films between 1979 and 1991. In response to the popularity of Star Trek feature films, the franchise returned to television with Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) in 1987. Paramount chose to distribute it as a first-run syndication show rather than a network show.[26]\\r\\nFollowing Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Roddenberry's role was changed from producer to creative consultant with minimal input to the films while being heavily involved with the creation of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Roddenberry died on October 24, 1991, giving executive producer Rick Berman control of the franchise.[27][28] Star Trek had become known to those within Paramount as \\"the franchise\\", because of its great success and recurring role as a tent pole for the studio when other projects failed.[29] TNG had the highest ratings of any Star Trek series and became the #1 syndicated show during the last years of its original seven-season run.[30] In response to TNG's success, Paramount released a spin-off series Deep Space Nine in 1993. While never as popular as TNG, the series had sufficient ratings for it to last seven seasons.\\r\\nIn January 1995, a few months after TNG ended, Paramount released a fourth TV series, Voyager. Star Trek saturation reached a peak in the mid-1990s with DS9 and Voyager airing concurrently and three of the four TNG-based feature films released in 1994, 1996, and 1998. By 1998, Star Trek was Paramount's most important property; the enormous profits of \\"the franchise\\" funded much of the rest of the studio's operations.[31]:49ÿ50,54 Voyager became the flagship show of the new United Paramount Network (UPN) and thus the first major network Star Trek series since the original.[32]\\r\\nAfter Voyager ended, UPN produced Enterprise, a prequel TV series to the original show. Enterprise did not enjoy the high ratings of its predecessors and UPN threatened to cancel it after the series' third season. Fans launched a campaign reminiscent of the one that saved the third season of the Original Series. Paramount renewed Enterprise for a fourth season,[33] but moved it to the Friday night death slot.[34] Like the Original Series, Enterprise ratings dropped during this time slot, and UPN cancelled Enterprise at the end of its fourth season. Enterprise aired its final episode on May 13, 2005.[35] Fan groups, \\"Save Enterprise\\", attempted to save the series[36] and tried to raise $30 million to privately finance a fifth season of Enterprise.[36] Though the effort garnered considerable press, the fan drive failed to save the series. The cancellation of Enterprise ended an eighteen-year continuous production run of Star Trek programming on television. The poor box office performance in 2002 of the film Nemesis, cast an uncertain light upon the future of the franchise. Paramount relieved Berman, the franchise producer, of control of Star Trek.\\r\\nParamount turned down several proposals in the mid-2000s to restart the franchise. These included pitches from film director Bryan Singer,[37] Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski,[38] and Trek actors Jonathan Frakes and William Shatner.[39] The studio also turned down an animated web series.[40] Instead, Paramount hired a new creative team to reinvigorate the franchise in 2007. Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and Lost producer, J. J. Abrams, had the freedom to reinvent the feel of Trek.\\r\\nThe team created the franchise's eleventh film, entitled simply Star Trek, releasing it in May 2009. The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. Star Trek was a prequel of the original series set in an alternate timeline, known as the \\"Kelvin Timeline\\". This gave the film and future sequels to it freedom from the need to conform to the franchise's canonical timeline. The eleventh Star Trek film's marketing campaign targeted non-fans, even stating in the film's advertisements that \\"this is not your father's Star Trek\\".[41]\\r\\nThe film earned considerable critical and financial success, grossing in inflation-adjusted dollars more box office sales than any previous Star Trek film.[42] The plaudits include the franchise's first Academy Award (for makeup). The film's major cast members are contracted for two sequels.[43] Paramount's sequel to the 2009 film, Star Trek Into Darkness, premiered in Sydney, Australia, on April 23, 2013, but the film did not release in the United States until May 17, 2013.[44] While the film was not as successful in the North American box office as its predecessor, internationally, in terms of box office receipts, Into Darkness was the most successful of the franchise.[45] A thirteenth film entitled Star Trek Beyond was released on July 22, 2016.[46]\\r\\nThe franchise will return to the small screen in the show Star Trek: Discovery.[47] The series will not be on network TV but it will stream in the United States on CBS All Access and internationally on Netflix.[48] CBS announced a new premiere date of September 24, 2017, and that the season would be split into two chapters, with the first chapter consisting of eight episodes and being released through November 2017, and the second comprising the remaining seven episodes and beginning streaming in January 2018. This break gave more time to complete post-production on the second half of the season.[49]\\r\\nSeven television series make up the bulk of the Star Trek mythos: The Original Series, The Animated Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, Enterprise, and Discovery. All the different versions in total amount to 741 Star Trek episodes across the 31 seasons of the TV series.[Note 4]\\r\\nStar Trek: The Original Series or \\"TOS\\"[Note 5] debuted in the United States on NBC on September 8, 1966.[50] The show tells the tale of the crew of the starship Enterprise and its five-year mission \\"to boldly go where no man has gone before.\\" The original 1966ÿ69 television series featured William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as Spock, DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy, James Doohan as Montgomery \\"Scotty\\" Scott, Nichelle Nichols as Uhura, George Takei as Hikaru Sulu, and Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov.[51] During the series' original run, it earned several nominations for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and won twice: for the two-parter \\"The Menagerie\\" and the Harlan Ellison-written episode \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\".[52]\\r\\nNBC canceled the show after three seasons; the last original episode aired on June 3, 1969.[53][54] The petition near the end of the second season to save the show signed by many Caltech students and its multiple Hugo nominations would, however, indicate that despite low Nielsen ratings, it was highly popular with science fiction fans and engineering students.[55] The series later became popular in reruns and found a cult following.[50]\\r\\nStar Trek: The Animated Series, produced by Filmation, ran for two seasons from 1973 to 1974. Most of the original cast performed the voices of their characters from The Original Series, and many of the writers who worked on The Original Series, D. C. Fontana, David Gerrold, and Paul Schneider, wrote for the series. While the animated format allowed the producers to create more exotic alien landscapes and life forms, animation errors and liberal reuse of shots and musical cues have tarnished the series' reputation.[56] Although it was originally sanctioned by Paramount, which owned the Star Trek franchise following its acquisition of Desilu in 1967, Gene Roddenberry often spoke of TAS as non-canon.[57] Star Trek writers have used elements of the animated series in later live-action series and films, and as of June 2007[update], TAS has references in the library section of the official Startrek.com web site officially bringing the series into the franchise's main canon.\\r\\nThe Animated Series won Star Trek's first Emmy Award on May 15, 1975.[58] Star Trek: TAS briefly returned to television in the mid-1980s on the children's cable network Nickelodeon. Nickelodeon's Evan McGuire greatly admired the show and used its various creative components as inspiration for his short series called Piggly Wiggly Hears a Sound which never aired. Nickelodeon parent Viacom would purchase Paramount in 1994. In the early 1990s, the Sci-Fi Channel also began rerunning TAS. The complete TAS was also released on Laserdisc format during the 1980s.[59] The complete series was first released in the U.S. on eleven volumes of VHS tapes in 1989. All 22 episodes were released on DVD in 2006.\\r\\nStar Trek: The Next Generation, also known as \\"TNG\\", takes place about a century after The Original Series (2364ÿ2370). It features a new starship, Enterprise-D, and a new crew led by Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes). Some crewmembers represent new alien races, including Deanna Troi, a half-Betazoid counselor played by Marina Sirtis. Michael Dorn plays Worf, the first Klingon officer in Starfleet, alongside Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher, LeVar Burton as chief engineer Geordi La Forge, the android Data portrayed by Brent Spiner, and Dr. Crusher's son Wesley Crusher played by Wil Wheaton. The show premiered on September 28, 1987, and ran for seven seasons, ending on May 23, 1994.[60] It had the highest ratings of any of the Star Trek series and became the #1 syndicated show during the last few years of its original run, allowing it to act as a springboard for ideas in other series. Many relationships and races introduced in TNG became the basis of episodes in Deep Space 9 and Voyager.[30] During its run it earned several Emmy awards and nominationsincluding a nomination for Best Dramatic Series during its final seasontwo Hugo Awards and a Peabody Award for Outstanding Television Programming for the episode \\"The Big Goodbye\\".[61]\\r\\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine, also known as \\"DS9\\", takes place during the last years and the immediate post-years of The Next Generation (2369ÿ2375) and aired for seven seasons, debuting the week of January 3, 1993.[62] Like Star Trek: The Next Generation, it aired in syndication in the United States and Canada. Unlike the other Star Trek series, DS9 takes place primarily on a space station rather than aboard a starship.\\r\\nThe show begins after the brutal Cardassian occupation of the planet Bajor. The liberated Bajoran people ask the United Federation of Planets to help run a Cardassian built space station, Deep Space Nine, near Bajor. After the Federation takes control of the station, the protagonists of the show discover a uniquely stable wormhole that provides immediate access to the distant Gamma Quadrant making Bajor and the station one of the most strategically important locations in the galaxy.[63] The show chronicles the events of the station's crew, led by Commander (later Captain) Benjamin Sisko, played by Avery Brooks, and Major (later Colonel) Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor. Recurring plot elements include the repercussions of the Cardassian occupation of Bajor, Sisko's spiritual role for the Bajorans as the Emissary of the Prophets, and in later seasons a war with the Dominion.\\r\\nDeep Space Nine stands apart from earlier Trek series for its lengthy serialized storytelling, conflict within the crew, and religious themesall elements that critics and audiences praised but Roddenberry forbade in the original series and The Next Generation.[64] Nevertheless, he was informed before his death of DS9, making this the last Star Trek series connected to Gene Roddenberry.[65]\\r\\nStar Trek: Voyager ran for seven seasons, airing from January 16, 1995, to May 23, 2001, launching a new Paramount-owned television network UPN. It features Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway,[66] the first female commanding officer in a leading role of a Star Trek series, and Commander Chakotay, played by Robert Beltran.\\r\\nVoyager takes place at about the same time period as Deep Space Nine and the years following that show's end (2371ÿ2378). The premiere episode has the USS Voyager and its crew pursue a Maquis (Federation rebels) ship. Both ships become stranded in the Delta Quadrant about 70,000 light-years from Earth.[67] Faced with a 75-year voyage to Earth, the crew must learn to work together to overcome challenges on their long and perilous journey home while also seeking ways to shorten the voyage. Like Deep Space Nine, early seasons of Voyager feature more conflict between its crewmembers than seen in later episodes. Such conflict often arises from friction between \\"by-the-book\\" Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together on Voyager. Eventually, though, they settle their differences, after which the overall tone becomes more reminiscent of The Original Series. The starship Voyager, isolated from its home, faces new cultures and dilemmas not possible in shows based in the Alpha Quadrant. Later seasons, however, brought an influx of characters and cultures from prior shows, the Borg, Q, the Ferengi, Romulans, Klingons, Cardassians and cast members of The Next Generation.\\r\\nStar Trek: Enterprise, originally entitled Enterprise, is a prequel to the original Star Trek series. It aired from September 26, 2001 to May 13, 2005.[68] Enterprise takes place in the 2150s, some 90 years after the events of Zefram Cochrane's first warp flight and about a decade before the founding of the Federation. The show centers on the voyages of Earth's first warp 5 capable starship, Enterprise, commanded by Captain Jonathan Archer (played by Scott Bakula), and the Vulcan Sub-Commander T'Pol (played by Jolene Blalock).\\r\\nDuring the show's first two seasons, Enterprise featured self-contained episodes, like The Original Series, The Next Generation and Voyager. The third season consisted of one arc, \\"Xindi mission\\", which had a darker tone and serialized nature similar to that of Deep Space 9. Season 4 consisted of several mini-arcs composed of two to three episodes. The final season showed the origins of elements seen in earlier series, and it rectified and resolved some core continuity problems between the various Star Trek series. Ratings for Enterprise started strong but declined rapidly. Although critics received the fourth season well, both fans and the cast reviled the series finale, partly because of the episode's focus on the guest appearance of members of The Next Generation cast.[69] The cancellation of Enterprise ended an 18-year run of back-to-back new Star Trek shows beginning with The Next Generation in 1987.\\r\\nStar Trek: Discovery is a direct prequel to Star Trek: The Original Series, set roughly ten years beforehand.[70] It premiered September 24, 2017 in the United States and Canada on CBS before moving to CBS All Access,[49] while Netflix streams the show outside the United States and is also providing most of the show's funding.[48][71][72]\\r\\nThe show centers on the voyages of the Discovery, commanded by Captain Gabriel Lorca (played by Jason Isaacs), and Lieutenant Commander Michael Burnham (played by Sonequa Martin-Green), with Burnham being the lead character of the series. This marks the first Star Trek series to feature a First Officer as the lead character. The show is to feature the Klingon T'Kuvma attempting to unite the 24 great Klingon houses, leading to a cold war between his race and the United Federation of Planets that involves the crew of the Discovery.[73][74]\\r\\nParamount Pictures has produced thirteen Star Trek feature films, the most recent being released in July 2016.[75] The first six films continue the adventures of the cast of The Original Series; the seventh film, Generations was designed as a transition from that cast to The Next Generation television series; the next three films, 8ÿ10, focused completely on the Next Generation cast.[Note 6] Starting with the eleventh film, the movies take place in an alternate timeline with a new cast playing the original series characters. Leonard Nimoy portrays an elderly Spock in these films, providing a physical link to the original timeline. This alternate timeline has been named by CBS, for the computer game Star Trek Online, the Kelvin Timeline.\\r\\nMany licensed products are based on the Star Trek franchise. Merchandising is very lucrative for both studio and actors; by 1986 Nimoy had earned more than $500,000 from royalties.[76] Products include novels, comic books, video games, and other materials, which are generally considered non-canon. Star Trek merchandise generated $4 billion for Paramount by 2002.[77]\\r\\nSince 1967, hundreds of original novels, short stories, and television and movie adaptations have been published. The first original Star Trek novel was Mission to Horatius by Mack Reynolds, which was published in hardcover by Whitman Books in 1968.[78]\\r\\nThe first publisher of Star Trek fiction aimed at adult readers was Bantam Books. In 1970, James Blish wrote the first original Star Trek novel published by Bantam, Spock Must Die![79] Pocket Books is the publisher of Star Trek novels.\\r\\nProlific Star Trek novelists include Peter David, Diane Carey, Keith R. A. DeCandido, J. M. Dillard, Diane Duane, Michael Jan Friedman, and Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. Several actors from the television series have also written or co-written books featuring their respective characters: William Shatner, John de Lancie, Andrew J. Robinson, J. G. Hertzler and Armin Shimerman. Voyager producer Jeri Taylor wrote two novels featuring back story for Voyager characters, and screen authors David Gerrold, D. C. Fontana, and Melinda Snodgrass have penned books, as well.\\r\\nA scholarly book published by Springer Science+Business Media in 2014 discusses the actualization of Star Trek's holodeck in the future by making extensive use of artificial intelligence and cyborgs.[80]\\r\\nStar Trek-based comics have been almost continuously published since 1967. They have been offered by several companies, including Marvel, DC, Malibu, Wildstorm, and Gold Key. Tokyopop is publishing an anthology of Next Generation-based stories presented in the style of Japanese manga.[81] As of 2006[update], IDW Publishing secured publishing rights to Star Trek comics[82] and published a prequel to the 2009 film, Star Trek: Countdown. In 2012, they published Volume I of Star Trek ÿ The Newspaper Strip featuring the work of Thomas Warkentin.[83]\\r\\nThe Star Trek franchise has numerous games in many formats. Beginning in 1967 with a board game based on the original series and continuing through today with online and DVD games, Star Trek games continue to be popular among fans.\\r\\nVideo games of the series include Star Trek: Legacy and Star Trek: Conquest. An MMORPG based on Star Trek called Star Trek Online was developed by Cryptic Studios and published by Perfect World. It is set in the TNG universe about 30 years after the events of Star Trek: Nemesis.[84] The most recent video game, set in the new timeline debuted in J. J. Abrams's film, was entitled Star Trek.\\r\\nOn June 8, 2010, Wiz Kids Games, which is owned by NECA, announced that they are developing a Star Trek collectible miniatures game using the HeroClix game system.[85]\\r\\nStar Trek has led directly or indirectly to the creation of a number of magazines which focus either on science fiction or specifically on Star Trek. Starlog was a magazine which was founded in the 1970s.[86] Initially, its focus was on Star Trek actors, but then it began to expand its scope.[87]\\r\\nIn 2013, Star Trek Magazine was a significant publication from the U.K. which was sold at newsstands and also via subscription. Other magazines through the years included professional magazines as well as magazines produced by fans, referred to as \\"fanzines\\". Star Trek: The Magazine was a magazine published in the U.S. which ceased publication in 2003.\\r\\nThe Star Trek media franchise is a multibillion-dollar industry, owned by CBS.[88] Gene Roddenberry sold Star Trek to NBC as a classic adventure drama; he pitched the show as \\"Wagon Train to the Stars\\" and as Horatio Hornblower in Space.[13] The opening line, \\"to boldly go where no man has gone before,\\" was taken almost verbatim from a U.S. White House booklet on space produced after the Sputnik flight in 1957.[89] The central trio of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy was modeled on classical mythological storytelling.[13]\\r\\nStar Trek and its spin-offs have proven highly popular in syndication and are shown on TV stations worldwide.[90] The show's cultural impact goes far beyond its longevity and profitability. Star Trek conventions have become popular among its fans, who call themselves \\"trekkies\\" or \\"trekkers\\". An entire subculture has grown up around the show[91] which was documented in the film Trekkies. Star Trek was the highest-ranked cult show by TV Guide.[92] The franchise has also garnered many comparisons of the Star Wars franchise being rivals in the science fiction genre with many fans and scholars.[93][94][95]\\r\\nThe Star Trek franchise inspired some designers of technologies, the Palm PDA and the handheld mobile phone.[96][97] Michael Jones, Chief technologist of Google Earth, has cited the tricorder's mapping capability as one inspiration in the development of Keyhole/Google Earth.[98] The Tricorder X Prize, a contest to build a medical tricorder device was announced in 2012. Ten finalists were selected in 2014, and the winner was to be selected in January 2016. However, no team managed to reach the required criteria. Star Trek also brought teleportation to popular attention with its depiction of \\"matter-energy transport\\", with the famously misquoted phrase \\"Beam me up, Scotty\\" entering the vernacular.[99] The Star Trek replicator is credited in the scientific literature with inspiring the field of diatom nanotechnology.[100] In 1976, following a letter-writing campaign, NASA named its prototype space shuttle Enterprise, after the fictional starship.[101] Later, the introductory sequence to Star Trek: Enterprise included footage of this shuttle which, along with images of a naval sailing vessel called Enterprise, depicted the advancement of human transportation technology. Additionally, some contend that the Star Trek society resembles communism.[102][103]\\r\\nBeyond Star Trek's fictional innovations, its contributions to TV history included a multicultural and multiracial cast. While more common in subsequent years, in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an Enterprise crew that included a Japanese helmsman, a Russian navigator, a black female communications officer, and a humanÿVulcan first officer. Captain Kirk's and Lt. Uhura's kiss, in the episode \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\", was also daring, and is often mis-cited as being American television's first scripted, interracial kiss, even though several other interracial kisses predated this one.[citation needed] In an interview Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told there was a big fan who wanted to meet her. Nichols said,\\r\\nI thought it was a Trekkie, and so I said, 'Sure.' I looked across the room, and there was Dr. Martin Luther King walking towards me with this big grin on his face. He reached out to me and said, 'Yes, Ms. Nichols, I am your greatest fan.' He said that Star Trek was the only show that he, and his wife Coretta, would allow their three little children to stay up and watch. [She told King about her plans to leave the series.] I never got to tell him why, because he said, 'You can't. You're part of history.'\\r\\nWhen she told Roddenberry what King had said, he cried.[104]\\r\\nEarly TV comedy sketch parodies of Star Trek included a famous sketch on Saturday Night Live entitled \\"The Last Voyage of the Starship Enterprise\\", with John Belushi as Kirk, Chevy Chase as Spock and Dan Aykroyd as McCoy.[105] In the 1980s, Saturday Night Live did a sketch with William Shatner reprising his Captain Kirk role in The Restaurant Enterprise, preceded by a sketch in which he played himself at a Trek convention angrily telling fans to \\"Get a Life\\", a phrase that has become part of Trek folklore.[106] In Living Color continued the tradition in a sketch where Captain Kirk is played by a fellow Canadian Jim Carrey.[107]\\r\\nA feature-length film that indirectly parodies Star Trek is Galaxy Quest. This film is based on the premise that aliens monitoring the broadcast of an Earth-based TV series called Galaxy Quest, modeled heavily on Star Trek, believe that what they are seeing is real.[108] Many Star Trek actors have been quoted saying that Galaxy Quest was a brilliant parody.[109][110]\\r\\nStar Trek has been blended with Gilbert and Sullivan at least twice. The North Toronto Players presented a Star Trek adaptation of Gilbert & Sullivan entitled H.M.S. Starship Pinafore: The Next Generation in 1991 and an adaptation by Jon Mullich of Gilbert & Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore that sets the operetta in the world of Star Trek has played in Los Angeles and was attended by series luminaries Nichelle Nichols,[citation needed] D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold.[111] A similar blend of Gilbert and Sullivan and Star Trek was presented as a benefit concert in San Francisco by the Lamplighters in 2009. The show was entitled Star Drek: The Generation After That. It presented an original story with Gilbert and Sullivan melodies.[112]\\r\\nBoth The Simpsons and Futurama television series and others have had many individual episodes parodying Star Trek or with Trek allusions.[113] An entire series of films and novels from Finland entitled Star Wreck also parodies Star Trek.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn August 2010, the members of the Internal Revenue Service created a Star Trek themed training video for a conference. Revealed to the public in 2013, the spoof along with parodies of other media franchises was cited as an example of the misuse of taxpayer funds in a congressional investigation.[114][115]\\r\\nStar Trek has been parodied in several non-English movies, including the German Traumschiff Surprise - Periode 1 which features a gay version of The Original Series bridge crew and a Turkish film that spoofs that same series' episode \\"The Man Trap\\" in one of the series of films based on the character Turist ?mer.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Orville is a comedy-drama science fiction television series that is currently airing on Fox, with the same look and feel as the Star Trek universe, created by noted Trekkie Seth MacFarlane that premiered on September 10, 2017.[116] MacFarlane has made references to Star Trek on his animated series Family Guy, where the Next Generation cast guest-starred in the episode \\"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\\".\\r\\nAlthough Star Trek has been off the air since 2005, CBS and Paramount pictures have allowed fan-produced shows to be created. While not officially part of the Star Trek universe, several veteran Star Trek actors, actresses, and writers have contributed their talents to many of these productions. While none of these films have been created for profit, several fan productions have turned to crowdfunding from sites, such as Kickstarter to help with production costs.[117]\\r\\nTwo series set during the TOS time period are Star Trek Continues and the Hugo award nominated Star Trek: Phase II. Another series, Star Trek: Hidden Frontier, takes place on the Briar Patch, a region of space introduced in Star Trek Insurrection. It has had over 50 episodes produced, and has two spin-off series, Star Trek: Odyssey and Star Trek: The Helena Chronicles. Several standalone fan films have been created including Star Trek: Of Gods and Men. Future fan films include Star Trek: Axanar.[118] Audio only fan productions includes Star Trek: The Continuing Mission. Several fan film parodies have also been created.\\r\\nThe original Star Trek series is also notable for giving rise to slash fiction, a genre of fan-produced in-universe fiction where normally non-romantic same-sex characters are portrayed as being a romantic couple, notably \\"Kirk/Spock\\" stories. These began appearing in the early 1970s, generally written by female fans of the show.[119][120] Over the intervening decades, especially with the advent of the internet, slash fanfiction has become its own thriving fandom.[121][122]\\r\\nIn 2016, Paramount and CBS instituted strict fan guidelines on fan films. Notable guidelines include a maximum length of 15 minutes, a maximum fund limit of $50,000, and a ban on using individuals previously associated with Star Trek productions.[123] This has shut down all of the highly publicized fan film productions ending what has been called a \\"golden age of amateur Star Trek films\\".[124]\\r\\nOf the various science fiction awards for drama, only the Hugo Award dates back as far as the original series.[Note 11] In 1968, all five nominees for a Hugo Award were individual episodes of Star Trek, as were three of the five nominees in 1967.[52][Note 12] The only Star Trek series not even to get a Hugo nomination are the animated series and Voyager, though only the original series and Next Generation ever won the award. No Star Trek feature film has ever won a Hugo, though a few were nominated. In 2008, the fan-made episode of Star Trek: New Voyages entitled \\"World Enough and Time\\" was nominated for the Hugo for Best Short Drama.[125]\\r\\nIn 1996, TV Guide picked the following as the ten best Star Trek episodes for the franchise's 30th anniversary.[126]\\r\\nThe two Star Trek series to win multiple Saturn awards during their run were The Next Generation (twice winning for best television series) and Voyager (twice winning for best actress ÿ Kate Mulgrew and Jeri Ryan).[Note 13] The original series retroactively won a Saturn Award for best DVD release. Several Star Trek films have won Saturns including categories best actor, actress, director, costume design, and special effects. However, Star Trek has never won a Saturn for best make-up.[127]\\r\\nAs for non science fiction specific awards, the Star Trek series have won 31 Emmy Awards.[128] The eleventh Star Trek film won the 2009 Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, the franchise's first Academy Award.[129]\\r\\nAt Star Trek's creation, Norway Productions, Roddenberry's production company, shared ownership with Desilu Productions and, after Gulf+Western acquired Desilu in 1967, with Paramount Pictures, the conglomerate's film studio. Paramount did not want to own the unsuccessful show; net profit was to be shared between Norway, Desilu/Paramount, Shatner, and NBC but Star Trek lost money, and the studio did not expect to syndicate it. In 1970 Paramount offered to sell all rights to Star Trek to Roddenberry, but he could not afford the $150,000 ($925,000 in 2007) price.[17]\\r\\nIn 1989, Gulf+Western renamed itself as Paramount Communications, and in 1994 merged with Viacom.[17] In 2005, Viacom divided into CBS Corporation, whose CBS Television Studios subsidiary retained the Star Trek brand, and Viacom, whose Paramount Pictures subsidiary retained the Star Trek film library and rights to make additional films, along with video distribution rights to the TV series on behalf of CBS.[130][17]","input":"When did star trek go off the air?"},{"output":"Robert McAlpin Williamson","context":"The mental roots of today's Texas Ranger Division trace back to the first days of Anglo-American settlement of what is today the State of Texas, when it was part of the Province of Coahuila y Tejas belonging to the newly independent country of Mexico. The unique characteristics that the Rangers adopted during the force's formative years and that give the division its heritage todaycharacteristics for which the Texas Rangers would become world-renownedhave been accounted for by the nature of the Rangers' duties, which was to protect a thinly populated frontier against protracted hostilities, first with Plains Indian tribes, and after the Texas Revolution, hostilities with Mexico.[1]\\r\\nTexas historian T.R. Fehrenbach explains the Rangers' uniqueness:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the early 1830s, the Mexican War of Independence had subsided, and some 60 to 70 families had settled in Texasmost of them from the United States. Because there was no regular army to protect the citizens against attacks by native tribes and bandits, in 1823, Stephen F. Austin organized small, informal armed groups whose duties required them to range over the countryside, and who thus came to be known as \\"rangers\\". Around August 4, 1823, Austin wrote that he would \\"... employ ten men?... to act as rangers for the common defense?... the wages I will give said ten men is fifteen dollars a month payable in property ...\\"[3] John Jackson Tumlinson Sr., the first alcalde of the Colorado district, is considered by many historians of the Texas Rangers to be the first killed in the line of duty.[4] While there is some discussion as to when Austin actually employed men as \\"rangers\\", Texas Ranger lore dates the anniversary year of their organization to this event.[5]\\r\\nHowever, the Texas Rangers were not formally constituted until 1835. Austin returned to Texas after having been imprisoned in Mexico City and helped organize a council to govern the group. On October 17, at a consultation of the Provisional Government of Texas, Daniel Parker proposed a resolution to establish the Texas Rangers. He proposed creating three companies that would total some 60 men and would be known by \\"uniforms\\" consisting of a light duster (clothing) and an identification badge made from a Mexican Peso. They were instituted by Texan lawmakers on November 24. On November 28, 1835 Robert McAlpin Williamson was chosen to be the first Major of the Texas Rangers. Within two years the Rangers grew to more than 300 men.\\r\\nIn their early days, Rangers performed tasks of protecting the Texas Frontier against Indian attacks on the settlers. During the Texas Revolution, they served mainly as scouts, spies, couriers, and guides for the settlers fleeing before the Mexican Army and performed rear guard during the Runaway Scrape and general support duties. These minor roles continued after independence, when the region became the Republic of Texas under President Sam Houston. Houston, who had lived with the Cherokee for many years (and who had taken a Cherokee wife), favored peaceful coexistence with Indians, a policy that left little space for a force with the Rangers' characteristics.\\r\\nThis situation changed radically when Mirabeau B. Lamar became president of the Republic of Texas in December 1838. Lamar had participated in skirmishes with the Cherokee in his home state of Georgia; like most Texians, he had not forgotten the support the Cherokee had given the Mexicans at the Cordova Rebellion against the Republic. He favored the eradication of Indians in Texasa view that he shared with Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Thomas Rusk. Lamar saw in the Rangers the perfect tool for the task, and he obtained permission from the Texas Legislature to raise a force of 56 Rangers, along with other volunteer companies. During the following three years, he engaged the Rangers in a war against the Cherokee and the Comanche and succeeded in weakening their territorial control.[6]\\r\\nSam Houston was re-elected President of Texas on December 12, 1841. He had taken note of the Rangers' cost-efficiency and increased their number to 150. Under Captain John Coffee \\"Jack\\" Hays' leadership, the force played an important role in the defense against the Mexican invasion led by General Adrian Woll in 1842 and against attacks by Indians. Despite his youth at the time, the charismatic Hays was a rallying figure to his men and is often considered responsible for giving cohesion, discipline and a group mentality to the Rangers. Flacco, a chief of the allied Indian tribe of the Lipan, used to call Hays Bravo too much.[7] The adoption of the state-of-the-art five-shot Colt Paterson revolver (which had been turned down by the U.S. Army) was also his work. Hays trained his men to aim, fire and reload their weapons from horseback, a radical innovation from the usual contemporary technique of dismounting before shooting at enemies and reloading, which was a necessity with more cumbersome weaponry. This tactic was put to devastating effect, and it was imitated shortly afterwards by the military, Texian and American.[8] At the suggestion of one of Hays's officers, Samuel Hamilton Walker, these revolvers soon evolved into the famous, enhanced six-shot version, the Walker Colt; 1,000 of these revolvers were issued to the United States Mounted Rifles engaged in the Mexican-American War.[9] During these years, famous Rangers such as Hays, Walker, Benjamin McCulloch and William \\"Bigfoot\\" Wallace first established their reputation as frontier fighters.\\r\\nWith the annexation of Texas within the United States and the MexicanÿAmerican War in 1846, several companies of Rangers were mustered into federal service and proved themselves at the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. From that moment on, their effectiveness as guerrilla fighters and guides to the federal army through a territory that they were familiar with marked the pace of the American offensive. Rangers played an important role in the battles of Monterrey and Buena Vista. The army, commanded by General Winfield Scott, landed at Veracruz in March 1847, and the Rangers once again provided valuable support at the ensuing Siege of Veracruz and the battles of Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. They were also responsible for the defeat of the fierce Mexican guerrilleros that hindered the advance of the federal troops, which they achieved ruthlessly and efficiently. By then, the Rangers had earned themselves a considerable reputation that approached the legendary among Mexicans, and when Ranger companies entered and occupied Mexico City with the U.S. Army in September 1847, los Diablos Tejanos (the \\"Texas Devils\\") were received with reverence and fear.[10] Their role in the MexicanÿAmerican War also won them nationwide fame in the United States and news of their exploits, in the contemporary press became common, effectively establishing the Rangers as part of American folklore. As the Victoria Advocate reported in the November 16, 1848, issue:\\r\\nDespite these popular stories and their fame, some of their most brutal interventions, such as the massacre of unarmed civilians, elderly men, women and children in Saltillo, ordered by Samuel H. Walker, remained unknown to the American public at large.[citation needed] Most of the Ranger force was disbanded during the years following the end of the MexicanÿAmerican War on February 2, 1848, since the protection of the frontiers was now an official duty of the U.S. Army. But as more settlers sought to establish homesteads in lands traditionally occupied by Indians, the skirmishes with the native peoples became a major political issue. During the 1850s, the Rangers were intermittently called on to deal with this problem, and with the election of Hardin Richard Runnels as governor in 1857, they once again regained their role as defenders of the Texas frontier.\\r\\nOn January 27, 1858, Runnels allocated $70,000 to fund a force of Rangers, and John Salmon \\"Rip\\" Ford, a veteran Ranger of the war with Mexico, was commissioned as senior captain. With a force of some 100 Rangers, Ford began a large expedition against the Comanche and other tribes, whose raids against the settlers and their properties had become common. On May 12, Ford's Rangers, accompanied by Tonkawa, Anadarko and Shawnee scouts from the Brazos Reservation in Texas, crossed the Red River into Indian Territory and attacked a Comanche village in the Canadian River Valley, flanked by the Antelope Hills in what is now Oklahoma. Suffering only four casualties, the force killed a reported 76 Comanche (including a chief by the name of Iron Jacket) and took 18 prisoners and 300 horses.\\r\\nIn December 1859, Ford and his company were assigned to Brownsville, in south Texas, where the local Mexican rancher Juan Cortina had launched an attack and briefly occupied the town and later conducted a series of guerrilla actions and raids against local American landowners. Together with a regiment of the U.S. Army commanded by Major Samuel P. Heintzelman (who later became a notable general of the Union in the Civil War), Ford's Rangers took part in the Cortina War, and on December 27, 1859, they engaged and defeated Cortina's forces in the battle of Rio Grande City. Pursued and defeated by Ford and his Rangers again a few days later, Cortina retreated into Mexico, and although he would continue to promote minor actions against the Texan ranchers, the threat of a large-scale military incursion was effectively ended.\\r\\nThe success of these campaigns marked a turning point in Rangers' history. The U.S. Army could provide only limited and thinly stretched protection in the enormous territory of Texas. In contrast, the Rangers' effectiveness when dealing with these threats convinced both the people of the state and the political leaders that a well-funded and organized local Ranger force was essential. Such a force could use the deep familiarity with the territory and the proximity with the theater of operations as major advantages in its favor. This option was not pursued in the light of the emerging national political problems, and the Rangers dissolved until 1874. However, the conviction of their usefulness had become firmly established, and the agency was eventually reconstituted.[12]\\r\\nAfter Texas seceded from the United States in 1861 during the American Civil War, many Rangers enlisted individually to fight for the Confederacy, such as Walter P. Lane, George W. Baylor, Thomas S. Lubbock, Benjamin McCulloch, Henry Eustace McCulloch, John B. Jones, Leander H. McNelly and John Ford. Although the famous Eighth Texas Cavalry regiment was widely known as Terry's Texas Rangers, neither its leader and founder, Benjamin Franklin Terry, nor the majority of its members had been affiliated with the state agency. The fact that both groups have often been regarded as related (and Terry's men themselves had thus adopted the organization's name) speaks of the widespread fame that the Rangers had achieved by that time. During the Civil War, the duties of scouting the state frontiers for Union troops, hostile Indians and deserters devolved upon those who could not be drafted into the Confederate Army because of their age or other disabilities. This mixed group was never officially considered a Ranger force, although their work was essentially the same. In April 1865 General John A. Wharton of the \\"Terry's Texas Rangers\\" was shot and killed after an argument with George W. Baylor-who served in the Texas Rangers Frontier Battalion after the Civil War until 1882.\\r\\nDuring Reconstruction, the Rangers were replaced by a Union-controlled version of the Rangers aka the Texas State Police. Charged with enforcing unpopular new laws that came with reintegration, that organization fell into disrepute.[13] The TSP only existed from July 22, 1870 to April 22, 1873.\\r\\nThe scenario changed radically for the Rangers with the state election of 1873. When newly elected Governor Richard Coke took office in January 1874, it marked the end of Reconstruction for the Lone Star State, and he vigorously restored order to Texas in pursuit of improvements to both the economy and security. Once again Indians and Mexican bandits were threatening the frontiers, and once again the Rangers were tasked with solving the problem. That same year, the state legislature authorized the recommissioning of the Rangers,[14] and a special force was created within its aegis: the Frontier Battalion, consisting of six companies of 75 men each under the command of Major John B. Jones. This group played a major role in the control of ordinary lawbreakers as well as the defense against hostile Indian tribes, which was particularly necessary in the period of lawlessness and social collapse of the Reconstruction.\\r\\nThe Frontier Battalion was soon augmented with the Special Force, a second military group of 40 men under Captain Leander H. McNelly, with the specific task of bringing order in the area of south Texas between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande, called the Nueces Strip. At this particular region, the general situation of lawlessness was aggravated by the proximity of Texas to Mexico and the conflict between agrarian and cattle interests. Raids along the frontier were common, and not only perpetrated by ordinary bandits but also promoted by local Mexican caudillos. In particular, Juan Cortina's men were again conducting periodic guerrilla operations against local ranchers. In the following two years, McNelly and his group energetically engaged these threats and virtually eradicated them.[15] A second sergeant of J. R. Waller's Company \\"A\\" was Dallas Stoudenmire, later El Paso Police Chief and Deputy U.S. Marshal.\\r\\nIt was at these times that many of the Rangers' myths were born, such as their success in capturing or killing notorious criminals and desperados (including bank robber Sam Bass and gunfighter John Wesley Hardin) and their decisive role in the defeat of the Comanche, the Kiowa and the Apache peoples. It was also during these years that the Rangers suffered the only defeat in their history when they surrendered at the Salinero Revolt in 1877. Despite the fame of their deeds, the conduct of the Rangers during this period was questionable. In particular, McNelly and his men used ruthless methods that often rivaled the brutality of their opponents, such as taking part in summary executions and confessions induced by torture and intimidation.[16] McNelly also made himself famous for disobeying direct orders from his superiors on several occasions, and breaking through the Mexican frontier for self-appointed law enforcement purposes.[17] Arguably, these methods either sowed the seeds of discontent among Mexican-Americans or restored order to the frontier. After McNelly's retirement because of health problems, the Special Force was dissolved in 1877 and their members absorbed into the Frontier Battalion, which continued to function even after Jones's death in the line of duty in 1881. By the last years of the 19th century, a high measure of security within the vast frontier of Texas had been achieved, in which the Rangers had played a primary role. In 1891, Governor James Stephen Hogg named Captain Bill McDonald to succeed Samuel A. McMurry as the captain of Texas Rangers Company B, Frontier Battalion, a position that he retained until 1907. Over the years, McDonald became the best known of the Rangers during his lifetime and the subject of two major biographies.[18]\\r\\nIn 1909, Private C.R. Moore of Company A, \\"performed one of the most important feats in the history of the Texas Rangers\\".[19] William Howard Taft and Porfirio Daz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Jurez, Mexico, an historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico[20] But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security.[21] Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, a nephew of Texas Ranger John Coffee Hays, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908.[22][23] On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route.[24][25] Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and Daz.[19][26]\\r\\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Texas's frontiers had become more settled, thus rendering the 1874 legislation obsolete after the organization had existed as a quasi-military force for more than 25 years. Amidst serious legal troubles that questioned the authority of the Rangers to exert such a role, new resolutions appropriate to the current times were adopted. The Frontier Battalion was disbanded with the passing of new legislation on July 8, 1901, and a new Ranger force was created, consisting of four companies of \\"no more than 20 men each\\" with a captain in command of every unit. The Rangers had evolved into an agency with an exclusive law enforcement focus.\\r\\nThe Mexican Revolution that began in 1910 against Mexican President Daz changed the relatively peaceful state of affairs along the border. Soon after, violence on both sides of the frontier escalated as bands of Mexicans took over border towns and began crossing the Rio Grande on a near-daily basis. Taking over trade routes in Mexico by establishing themselves as road agents, Mexican banditos turned towards attacking the American communities for kidnapping, extortion, and supplies. As Mexican law enforcement disintegrated with the collapse of the Diaz regime, these gangs grouped themselves under the various caudillos on both sides of the border and took sides in the civil war, most simply to take advantage of the turmoil to loot.[27] Then, as the lack of American military forces for defending the border became clearer, the scope of the activities soon turned to outright genocide with the intention of driving Americans out of the Southwest entirely; this became known as the Plan de San Diego in 1915. In several well-rehearsed attacks, Mexicans rose up and in conjunction with raiding Villista guerrillas, within weeks had killed over 500 Texan women, children, and men.[28]\\r\\nThe political decision of the Texans was to restore control and order by any necessary means. As Governor Oscar Branch Colquitt instructed Ranger Captain John R. Hughes, \\"...you and your men are to keep Mexican raiders off of Texas territory if possible, and if they invade the State let them understand they do so at the risk of their lives.\\"[29] Hundreds of new special Rangers were appointed by order of the state, which neglected to carefully screen aspiring members. Rather than conduct themselves as law enforcement officers, many of these groups acted more like vigilante squads. Reports of Rangers abusing their authority and breaking the law themselves increased.[30] The situation grew even more dramatic when on March 9, 1916, Pancho Villa led 500 Mexican raiders in a cross-border attack against Columbus, New Mexico, increasing the high tension that had already existed between the communities. Villa and General Ramon Banda Quesada, in an attack against the town that was garrisoned by a detachment of the 13th Cavalry Regiment (United States), seized 100 horses and mules, burned the town, killed 14 soldiers and 10 residents, and took ammunition and weaponry before retreating back into Mexico. Quesada had five men captured and suffered the loss of 80 dead or mortally wounded, mostly from the U.S. machine gun emplacements.\\r\\nThe final straw was the Porvenir Massacre, involving the killing of innocent villagers wrongly accused of raiding the Brite Ranch Store on Christmas Day in 1917. In January 1918 a heavily armed group of Texas Rangers, ranchmen and members a troop of U.S. Cavalry descended upon the tiny community of Porvenir, Texas on the Mexican border in western Presidio County. The Rangers and company rounded up the inhabitants of the village and searched their homes. They then proceeded to gather all the men in Porvenir (fifteen Mexican men and boys ranging in age from 16 to 72 years) and march them off into the darkness. A short distance from Porvenir, the men were lined up against a rock bluff and shot to death.[31]\\r\\nBefore the decade was over, thousands of lives were lost, Texans and Mexicans alike. In January 1919, at the initiative of Representative Jos T. Canales of Brownsville, the Texas Legislature launched a full investigation of Rangers' actions throughout these years. The investigation found that from 300 up to 5,000 people, mostly of Hispanic descent, had been killed by Rangers from 1910 to 1919, and that members of the Rangers had been involved in many acts of brutality and injustice.[32]\\r\\nThese were the most turbulent times in the history of the Rangers, and with the objective of recycling the force's membership, putting it back in tune with its past and restoring the public's trust, the Legislature passed on March 31, 1919, a resolution to purge it and enhance it and its procedures. All special Ranger groups were disbanded; the four official companies were kept, albeit their members were reduced from 20 to 15 each; better payment was offered in order to attract men of higher personal standards; and a method for citizens to articulate complaints against any further misdeeds or abuses was established.\\r\\nThe reforms proved positive, and the new Ranger force eventually regained the status of a respectable agency. Under the command of captains such as Frank Hamer (who later became famous for leading the party that killed the outlaws Bonnie and Clyde), the Rangers displayed remarkable activity in the following years, including the continuous fighting of cattle rustlers, intervening in the violent labor disputes of the time and protecting the citizenry involved in Ku Klux Klan's public displays from violent mob reaction. With the passage of the Volstead Act and the beginning of nationwide prohibition on January 16, 1920, their duties extended to scouting the border for tequila smugglers and detecting and dismantling the illegal stills that abounded along Texas's territory.\\r\\nOne of the Rangers' highest-profile interventions during this period was taming Texas's oil boomtowns (beginning with Spindletop's discovery in 1901), which had developed into lawless territories. During the 1920s, martial law was decreed on several of these towns, such as Mexia and Borger; at others, like Desdemona, Wink, Ranger, Kilgore and Burkburnett, the situation was also very serious, and the Rangers were called in to quell agitated locals and terminate all illegal activities. This trouble continued until well in the 1950s, but the Rangers prevented it from growing into an even more dramatic problem. At Borger, a total of ten officers were sent on April 7, 1927, including Captain Hamer. The balance of the Rangers' activities upon their arrival as reported was:\\r\\nThe Great Depression forced both the federal and state governments to cut down on personnel and funding of their organizations, and the Rangers were no exception. The number of commissioned officers was reduced to 45, and the only means of transportation afforded to Rangers were free railroad passes, or using their personal horses. The situation worsened for the agency when its members entangled themselves in politics in 1932 by publicly supporting Governor Ross Sterling in his re-election campaign, over his opponent Miriam Amanda \\"Ma\\" Ferguson. Ferguson was elected, and immediately after taking office in January 1933, she proceeded to discharge all serving Rangers. The force also saw its salaries and funds slashed by the Texas Legislature, and their numbers reduced further to 32 men. The result was that Texas became a safe hideout for the many Depression-era gangsters escaping from the law, such as Bonnie and Clyde, George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly, Pretty Boy Floyd and Raymond Hamilton. The hasty appointment of many unqualified Rangers to stop the increasing criminality proved ineffective.[33]\\r\\nThe general disorganization of law enforcement in the state convinced the members of the Legislature that a thorough revision of the public security system was in order, and with that purpose it hired the services of a consulting firm from Chicago. The resulting report yielded many worrying conclusions, but the basic underlying facts were simple: the criminality levels in Texas were extremely high, and the state's means to fight them were underfunded, undermanned, loose, disorganized and obsolete. The consultants' recommendation, besides increasing funding, was to introduce a whole reorganization of state security agencies; especially, to merge the Rangers with the Texas Highway Patrol under a new agency called the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). After deliberating, the Legislature agreed with the suggestion. The resolution that created the new state law enforcement agency was passed in 1935, and with an initial budget of $450,000, the DPS became operational on August 10.\\r\\nWith minor rearrangements over the years, the 1935 reforms have ruled the Texas Rangers' organization until present day. Hiring new members, which had been largely a political decision, was achieved through a series of examinations and merit evaluations. Promotion relied on seniority and performance in the line of duty. More sophisticated means of crime fighting were put at their disposal, like automobiles, advanced weaponry and forensics. By the late 1930s, the Rangers had one of the best crime labs in the United States at the Headquarters Division in Austin. The appointment of Colonel Homer Garrison in September 1938 as director of the DPS proved decisive as well. Under his leadership, many respected captains such as Manuel T. Gonzaullas worked extensively to restore the good name of the force that had been compromised in the previous decades, keeping it in line with its traditions within a modern and civilized society and regaining its high status.[27] The number of commissioned officers grew and the Rangers developed a clear detective function, while the Highway Patrol took charge of direct law enforcement duties.\\r\\nThe quality of the force in terms of training, funding, modernization and number strength has continued to improve. In the last few decades, the Rangers have intervened in several thousand cases with a high level of effectiveness,[34] including many high-profile ones such as the pursuit and capture of serial killer ngel Maturino Resndiz. The agency is also fully integrated with modern Texan ethnic groups, counting numerous officers of Hispanic and African American origin among its members. Today, the historical importance and symbolism of the Texas Rangers is such that they are protected by statute from being disbanded.[35]","input":"Who was the leader of the texas rangers?"},{"output":"the red cross of St George for the Kingdom of England","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack,[note 1][2][3] or Union Flag, is the national flag of the United Kingdom. The flag also has an official or semi-official status in some other Commonwealth realms: for example, it is a ceremonial flag in Canada by parliamentary resolution, and known there as the Royal Union Flag.[4] Further, it is used as an official flag in some of the smaller British overseas territories. The Union Flag also appears in the canton (upper left-hand quarter) of the flags of several nations and territories that are former British possessions or dominions, as well as the state flag of Hawaii.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe claim that the term Union Jack properly refers only to naval usage has been disputed, following historical investigations by the Flag Institute in 2013.[5][6][note 2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origins of the earlier flag of Great Britain date back to 1606. James VI of Scotland had inherited the English and Irish thrones in 1603 as James I, thereby uniting the crowns of England, Scotland, and Ireland in a personal union, although the three kingdoms remained separate states. On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the flag of England (a red cross on a white background, known as St George's Cross), and the flag of Scotland (a white saltire on a blue background, known as the Saltire or St Andrew's Cross), would be joined together, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes. King James also began to refer to a \\"Kingdom of Great Britaine\\", although the union remained a personal one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present design of the Union Flag dates from a Royal proclamation following the union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801.[8] The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of St George for the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of St Andrew for Scotland (which two were united in the first Union Flag), and the red saltire of St Patrick to represent Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotably, the home country of Wales is not represented separately in the Union Flag, as the flag was designed after the invasion of Wales in 1282. Hence Wales as a home country today has no representation on the flag; it appears under the cross of St George, which represents the former Kingdom of England (which included Wales).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe terms Union Jack and Union Flag are both historically correct for describing the de facto national flag of the United Kingdom. Whether the term Union Jack applies only when used as a jack flag on a ship is a modern matter of debate.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Parliament of the United Kingdom:[10][11] \\"Until the early 17th century England and Scotland were two entirely independent kingdoms. This changed dramatically in 1603 on the death of Elizabeth I of England. Because the Queen died unmarried and childless, the English crown passed to the next available heir, her cousin James VI, King of Scotland.  England and Scotland now shared the same monarch under what was known as a union of the crowns.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1606, James VI gave orders for a British flag to be created which bore the combined crosses of St. George and of St. Andrew.  The result was the Union Jack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Flag Institute, a membership-run vexillological charity,[12] \\"the national flag of the United Kingdom, the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories is the Union Flag, which may also be called the Union Jack.\\"[13] The institute also notes: \\r\\nit is often stated that the Union Flag should only be described as the Union Jack when flown in the bows of a warship, but this is a relatively recent idea. From early in its life the Admiralty itself frequently referred to the flag as the Union Jack, whatever its use, and in 1902 an Admiralty circular announced that Their Lordships had decided that either name could be used officially. In 1908, a government minister stated, in response to a parliamentary question, that \\"the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag\\".[9][14]\\r\\n\\r\\n Notwithstanding Their Lordships' circular of 1902, by 1913 the Admiralty described the \\"Union Flag\\" and added in a foot note that 'A Jack is a Flag to be flown only on the \\"Jack\\" Staff'.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the authoritative A Complete Guide to Heraldry published in 1909 by Arthur Charles Fox-Davies uses the term \\"Union Jack\\".[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"Union Flag\\" is used in King Charles I's 1634 proclamation:\\r\\n\\r\\n... none of Our Subjects, of any of Our Nations and Kingdoms shall from henceforth presume to carry the Union Flag in the Main top, or other part of any of their Ships (that is) St Georges cross and St Andrew's Cross joined together upon pain of Our high displeasure, but that the same Union Flag be still reserved as an ornament proper for Our own Ships and Ships in our immediate Service and Pay, and none other.\\"[17]\\r\\n and in King George III's proclamation of 1 January 1801 concerning the arms and flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland:\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that the Union Flag shall be Azure, the Crosses Saltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick Quarterly per Saltire, counterchanged Argent and Gules; the latter fimbriated of the Second, surmounted by the Cross of St. George of the Third, fimbriated as the Saltire?: ...[18]\\r\\nWhen the first flag representing Britain was introduced on the proclamation of King James I in 1606,[19] it became known simply as the \\"British flag\\" or the \\"flag of Britain\\". The royal proclamation gave no distinctive name to the new flag. The word \\"jack\\" was in use before 1600 to describe the maritime bow flag.[9] By 1627 a small Union Jack was commonly flown in this position. One theory goes that for some years it would have been called just the \\"Jack\\", or \\"Jack flag\\", or the \\"King's Jack\\", but by 1674, while formally referred to as \\"His Majesty's Jack\\", it was commonly called the \\"Union Jack\\", and this was officially acknowledged.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the proclamations issued by King George III at the time of the Union of 1801 was a proclamation concerning flags at sea, which repeatedly referred to \\"Ensigns, Flags, Jacks, and Pendants\\" and forbade merchant vessels from wearing \\"Our Jack, commonly called the Union Jack\\" nor any pendants or colours used by the King's ships.[20]  Reinforcing the distinction the King's proclamation of the same day concerning the arms and flag of the United Kingdom (not colours at sea) called the new flag \\"the Union Flag\\".[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe size and power of the Royal Navy internationally at the time could also explain why the flag was named the \\"Union Jack\\"; considering the navy was so widely utilised and renowned by the United Kingdom and colonies, it is possible that the term jack occurred because of its regular use on all British ships using the jack staff (a flag pole attached to the bow of a ship). The term Union Jack possibly dates from Queen Anne's time (r. 1702ÿ14), but its origin is uncertain. It may come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603. Even if the term \\"Union Jack\\" does derive from the jack flag, after three centuries, it is now sanctioned by use and has appeared in official use, confirmed as the national flag by Parliament and remains the popular term.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nWinston Churchill was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and he referred to the flag of the United Kingdom as the Union Jack. In March 1899 Churchill wrote to his mother from India about her plans to produce a new trans-Atlantic magazine, to be called The Anglo-Saxon Review. The drawing at the end of this letter was deliberately mischievous, teasing her for going down-market, and in the accompanying letter he wrote, \\"Your title 'The Anglo Saxon' with its motto 'Blood is thicker than water' only needs the Union Jack & the Star Spangled Banner crossed on the cover to be suited to one of Harmsworths [a leading British newspaper owner] cheap Imperialist productions.\\"[23][relevant?  ÿ discuss]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recently, Reed's Nautical Almanac (1990 edition) unambiguously stated: \\"The Union Flag, frequently but incorrectly referred to as the Union Jack, ...\\" and later: \\"8. The Jack ÿ A small flag worn on a jackstaff on the stem of Naval Vessels.  The Royal Navy wears the Union Flag ... This is the only occasion when it correct to describe the flag as the Union Jack\\".[24] However, this assertion does not appear in any Reed's Nautical Almanac since 1993.  In  the 2016 Reeds Nautical Almanac  the only entry where this might appear, section 5.21, covering Flag Etiquette,  does not include this statement. Within the Almanac, neither the Union Flag or the Union Jack are  included  pictorially or mentioned by name.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor comparison with another anglophone country with a large navy: the Jack of the United States specifically refers to the flag flown from the jackstaff of a warship, auxiliary or other U.S. governmental entity.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current flag's design has been in use since 1801.  Its original blazon, as decreed by George III of the United Kingdom on 1 January 1801, reads: \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack is normally twice as long as it is tall, a ratio of 1:2. In the United Kingdom, land flags are normally a ratio of 3:5; the Union Jack can also be made in this shape, but is 1:2 for most purposes. In 2008, MP Andrew Rosindell proposed a Ten Minute Rule bill to standardise the design of the flag at 3:5, but the bill did not proceed past the first reading.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlags that have the Union Jack in the canton should always be 1:2 to preserve the square fly area.[clarification needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three component crosses that make up the Union Flag are sized as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag's height whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century.[28]\\r\\nIn the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions,[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour specifications for the colours Union Jack (royal) blue, Union Flag red and white are:[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll HEX, CMYK and RGB specifications for the Pantone colours are taken from the official Pantone website on the webpages of the corresponding colours. Keep in mind that although the colour schemes are official, not all of the colours are completely congruent. This is due to different specifications for different types of media (for example, screen and print).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag does not have reflection symmetry due to the slight pinwheeling of the St Patrick's and St Andrew's crosses, technically the counterchange of saltires. Thus, there is a right side up.  The original specification of the Union Flag in the Royal Proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply \\"counterchanged\\" and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer's left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is above the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases wide white top and broad side up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the red ensign (also to be used as a red jack by privateers).  As it appears in the London Gazette, the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult. In the case of the Union Flag, the difference is subtle and is easily missed by the uninformed. It is often displayed upside down inadvertentlyeven on commercially-made hand waving flags.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 February 2009, the BBC reported that the flag had been inadvertently flown upside-down by the UK government at the signing of a trade agreement with Chinese premier Wen Jiabao. The error had been spotted by readers of the BBC news website who had contacted the BBC after seeing a photograph of the event.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1603, James VI of Scotland inherited the English and Irish thrones (as James I), thereby uniting the crowns of England, Scotland and Ireland (which remained separate states) in a personal union.[22] On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the flag of England (a red cross on a white background, known as St George's Cross), and the flag of Scotland (a white saltire on a blue background, known as the saltire or St Andrew's Cross), would be joined together,[8] forming the flag of Great Britain and first union flag:\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the King: Whereas, some differences hath arisen between Our subjects of South and North Britaine travelling by Seas, about the bearing of their Flagges: For the avoiding of all contentions hereafter. We have, with the advice of our Council, ordered: That from henceforth all our Subjects of this Isle and Kingdome of Great Britaine, and all our members thereof, shall beare in their main-toppe the Red Crosse, commonly called St George's Crosse, and the White Crosse, commonly called St Andrews Crosse, joyned together according to the forme made by our heralds, and sent by Us to our Admerall to be published to our Subjects: and in their fore-toppe our Subjects of South Britaine shall weare the Red Crosse onely as they were wont, and our Subjects of North Britaine in their fore-toppe the White Crosse onely as they were accustomed.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis royal flag was, at first, to be used only at sea on civil and military ships of both England and Scotland, whereas land forces continued to use their respective national banners.[35] In 1634, King Charles I restricted its use to the royal ships.[17] After the Acts of Union 1707, the flag gained a regularised status as \\"the ensign armorial of the Kingdom of Great Britain\\", the newly created state. It was then adopted by land forces as well, although the blue field used on land-based versions more closely resembled that of the blue of the flag of Scotland.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious shades of blue have been used in the saltire over the years. The ground of the current Union Flag is a deep \\"navy\\" blue (Pantone 280), which can be traced to the colour used for the Blue Ensign of the Royal Navy's historic \\"Blue Squadron\\". (Dark shades of colour were used on maritime flags on the basis of durability.) In 2003 a committee of the Scottish Parliament recommended that the flag of Scotland use a lighter \\"royal\\" blue, (Pantone 300). (The Office of the Lord Lyon does not detail specific shades of colour for use in heraldry.)\\r\\n\\r\\nA thin white stripe, or fimbriation, separates the red cross from the blue field, in accordance with heraldry's rule of tincture where colours (like red and blue) must be separated from each other by metals (like white, i.e. argent or silver). The blazon for the old union flag, to be compared with the current flag, is azure, the cross saltire of St Andrew argent surmounted by the Cross of St George gules, fimbriated of the second.\\r\\n\\r\\nWales had no explicit recognition in the Union Jack as it had been a part of the Kingdom of England since being annexed by Edward I of England in 1282 and its full integration by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535ÿ1542, and was therefore represented by the flag of England.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Ireland, which had existed as a personal union with England since 1541, was likewise unrepresented in the original versions of the Union Jack.[35] However, the flag of the Protectorate from 1658 to 1660 was inescutcheoned with the arms of Ireland. These were removed at the Restoration, because Charles II disliked them.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original flag appears in the canton of the Commissioners' Ensign of the Northern Lighthouse Board. This is the only contemporary official representation of the pre-1801 Union Jack in the United Kingdom[37] and can be seen flying from their George Street headquarters in Edinburgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis version of the Union Jack is also shown in the canton of the Grand Union Flag (also known as the Congress Flag, the First Navy Ensign, the Cambridge Flag and the Continental Colours), the first widely used flag of the United States, slowly phased out after 1777.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June, painted in 1795, shows a Union flying from HMS?Queen Charlotte on the \\"Glorious First of June\\" 1794. The actual flag, preserved in the National Maritime Museum, is a cruder approximation of the proper specifications; this was common in 18th and early 19th century flags.[38][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag is also flown beside Customs House in Loftus Street, Sydney, to mark the approximate location at which Captain Phillip first raised the Union Jack, and claimed New South Wales in 1788. On the plaque it is referred to as the \\"Jack of Queen Anne\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Army's flag is the Union Jack, but in 1938, a \\"British Army Non-Ceremonial Flag\\" was devised, featuring a lion on crossed blades with the St Edward's Crown on a red background. This is not the equivalent of the ensigns of the other armed services, but is used at recruiting and military or sporting events, when the army needs to be identified but the reverence and ceremony due to the regimental flags and the Union Jack would be inappropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious other designs for a common flag were drawn up following the union of the two Crowns in 1603, but were rarely, if ever, used.[40] One version showed St George's cross with St Andrew's cross in the canton, and another version placed the two crosses side by side. A painted wooden ceiling boss from Linlithgow Palace, dated to about 1617, depicts the Scottish royal unicorn holding a flag where a blue Saltire surmounts the red cross of St. George.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn objecting to the design of Union Flag adopted in 1606, whereby the cross of Saint George surmounted that of Saint Andrew, a group of Scots took up the matter with John Erskine, 18th Earl of Mar, and were encouraged by him to send a letter of complaint to James VI, via the Privy Council of Scotland, which stated that the flag's design \\"will breid some heit and miscontentment betwix your Majesties subjectis, and it is to be feirit that some inconvenientis sail fall oute betwix thame, for our seyfaring men cannot be inducit to resave that flage as it is set down\\".[41] Although documents accompanying this complaint which contained drafts for alternative designs have been lost, evidence exists, at least on paper, of an unofficial Scottish variant, whereby the Scottish cross was uppermost. There is reason to think that cloth flags of this design were employed during the 17th century for unofficial use on Scottish vessels at sea.[42][43][44] This flag's design is also described in the 1704 edition of The Present State of the Universe by John Beaumont, which contains as an appendix The Ensigns, Colours or Flags of the Ships at Sea: Belonging to The several Princes and States in the World.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn land, evidence confirming the use of this flag appears in the depiction of Edinburgh Castle by John Slezer, in his series of engravings entitled Theatrum Scotiae, c. 1693. Appearing in later editions of Theatrum Scotiae, the North East View of Edinburgh Castle engraving depicts the Scotch (to use the appropriate adjective of that period) version of the Union Flag flying from the Palace block of the Castle.[47] On the North Prospect of the City of Edenburgh engraving, the flag is indistinct.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 April 1707, just two weeks prior to the Acts of Union coming into effect, and with Sir Henry St George, Garter King of Arms, having presented several designs of flag to Queen Anne and her Privy Council for consideration, the flag for the soon to be unified Kingdom of Great Britain was chosen. At the suggestion of the Scots representatives, the designs for consideration included that version of Union Jack showing the Cross of Saint Andrew uppermost; identified as being the \\"Scotts union flagg as said to be used by the Scotts\\".[49] However, the Queen and her Council approved Sir Henry's original effort, numbered \\"one\\".[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nA manuscript compiled in 1785 by William Fox and in possession of the Flag Research Center includes a full plate showing \\"the scoth  [sic] union\\" flag. This could imply that there was still some use of a Scottish variant before the addition of the cross of St Patrick to the Union Flag in 1801.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current and second Union Jack dates from 1 January 1801 with the Act of Union 1800, which merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The new design added a red saltire, the cross of Saint Patrick, for Ireland. This is counterchanged with the saltire of St Andrew, such that the white always follows the red clockwise. The arrangement has introduced a requirement to display the flag \\"the right way up\\"; see specifications for flag use, below. As with the red cross, so too the red saltire is separated by a white fimbriation from the blue field.[22] This fimbriation is repeated for symmetry on the white portion of the saltire, which thereby appears wider than the red portion. The fimbriation of the cross of St George separates its red from the red of the saltire.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from the Union Jack, Saint Patrick's cross has seldom been used to represent Ireland, and with little popular recognition or enthusiasm; it is usually considered to derive from the arms of the powerful FitzGerald family rather than any association with the saint.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Anglo-Irish Treaty was concluded on 6 December 1921 and the creation of the new Irish Free State was an imminent prospect, the question arose as to whether the cross of Saint Patrick should remain in the Union Jack. The New York Times reported that on 22 January 1922:\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the College of Arms it was stated that certain modifications were under consideration and that if any action were taken it would be done by the King in Council. No parliamentary action would be necessary. Heraldry experts say that alterations in arms are very expensive. Some years ago there was a demand from Irish quarters that the blue ground of the golden harp on the royal standard should be changed to green. It was then estimated that the alteration would cost at least S2,000,000. To remove all reference to Ireland from the present Union Jack and Royal Arms would be vastly more expensive.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was some speculation on the matter in British dominions also, with one New Zealand paper reporting that:\\r\\n\\r\\n...the removal of the cross of St. Patrick Cross after 120 years will transform the appearance of the flag. It will certainly become a flag under which great victories were won in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but to most minds the sentimental loss will be great. Probably it will be found that the deletion is not absolutely necessary. Other possible changes include the abolition of the title of the United Kingdom, and the removal of the harp from the Royal Standard and the Coat of Arms, and the substitution of the Ulster emblem.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the fact that it was likely that Northern Ireland would choose not to remain part of the Irish Free State after its foundation and remain in the United Kingdom, gave better grounds for keeping the cross of St. Patrick in the Union Jack. In this regard, Sir James Craig, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland remarked in December 1921 that he and his government were \\"glad to think that our decision [to remain part of United Kingdom] will obviate the necessity of mutilating the Union Jack.\\"[53] Though remaining within the United Kingdom, the new government of Northern Ireland dispensed with the St Patrick's Saltire in favour of a new flag derived from the coat-of-arm of the Burkes, Earls of Ulster, and quite similar to England's St George's Cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, when the British home secretary was asked on 7 December 1922 (the day after the Irish Free State was established) whether the Garter King of Arms was to issue any regulations with reference to the Union Jack, the response was no and the flag has never been changed.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Dil question in 1961 mooted raising the removal of the cross of St Patrick with the British government; Frank Aiken, the Irish minister for external affairs, declined to \\"waste time on heraldic disputations\\".[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, a private individual started a campaign?ÿ dubbed \\"reflag\\" or \\"Union Black\\"?ÿ to interpret the Union Flag in a racial context, and introduce black stripes in it. The proposal was universally met with opposition and was denounced by MSP Phil Gallie as \\"ridiculous tokenism [that] would do nothing to stamp out racism\\".[56] The campaign is now defunct.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince there is no uniquely Welsh element in the Union Jack, Wrexham's Labour MP Ian Lucas proposed on 27 November 2007 in a House of Commons debate that the Union Flag be combined with the Welsh flag to reflect Wales' status within the UK, and that the red dragon be added to the Union Flag's red, white, and blue pattern.[57] He said the Union Jack currently only represented the other three UK nations, and Minister for Culture, Creative Industries and Tourism Margaret Hodge conceded that Lucas had raised a valid point for debate. She said, \\"the Government is keen to make the Union Flag a positive symbol of Britishness reflecting the diversity of our country today and encouraging people to take pride in our flag.\\" This development sparked design contests with entries from all over the world; some of the entries incorporated red dragons and even anime characters and leeks.[58][59] The lack of any Welsh symbol or colours in the flag is due to Wales already being part of the Kingdom of England when the flag of Great Britain was created in 1606.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, various non-official suggestions were made for how the flag could be redesigned without the St Andrew's Cross in the event that Scotland left the Union. However, as Scotland voted against independence the issue did not arise.[60][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the UK referendum on membership of the European Union which resulted in a vote to leave, the Union Flag became a symbol of euroscepticism in Italy in August 2016 as hundreds of local businesses along the Italian riviera hoisted the flags as a protest against the implementation of the Services in the Internal Market Directive 2006.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2016, anti-Brexit campaigners planned to fly 5,000 European Union flags on the last night of the BBC Proms, in response, Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks announced he planned to fund and give away 10,000 Union Flags to concert-goers.[63][64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack is used as a jack by commissioned warships and submarines of the Royal Navy, and by commissioned army and Royal Air Force vessels. When at anchor or alongside, it is flown from the jackstaff at the bow of the ship. When a ship is underway, the Union Jack is only flown from the jackstaff when the ship is dressed for a special occasion, such as the Queen's official birthday.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack is worn at the masthead of a ship to indicate the presence of the Sovereign or an Admiral of the Fleet.[65] The Union Flag may also be flown from the yardarm to indicate that a court-martial is in progress, though these are now normally held at shore establishments.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo law has been passed making the Union Jack the national flag of the United Kingdom: it has become one through precedent. Its first recorded recognition as a national flag came in 1908, when it was stated in Parliament that \\"the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag\\".[66] A more categorical statement was made by Home Secretary Sir John Gilmour, in 1933 when he stated that \\"the Union Flag is the national flag and may properly be flown by any British subject on land.\\"[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nCivilian use is permitted on land, but use of the unmodified flag at sea is restricted to military vessels. Unauthorised use of the flag in the 17th century to avoid paying harbour duties?ÿ a privilege restricted to naval ships?ÿ caused James's successor, Charles I, to order that use of the flag on naval vessels be restricted to His Majesty's ships \\"upon pain of Our high displeasure.\\"[citation needed] It remains a criminal offence under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995[68] to display the Union Flag (other than the \\"pilot jack\\"?ÿ see below) from a British ship. Naval ships will fly the white ensign, merchant and private boats can fly the red ensign, others with special permission such as naval yacht clubs can fly the blue ensign. All of the coloured ensigns contain the union flag as part of the design.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Court of the Lord Lyon, which has legal jurisdiction in heraldic matters in Scotland, confirms that the Union Jack \\"is the correct flag for all citizens and corporate bodies of the United Kingdom to fly to demonstrate their loyalty and their nationality.\\"[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia, the current national flag gradually replaced the Union Flag. When it formally created the national flag in the Flags Act 1953, section 8 of that Act specified that \\"this Act does not affect the right or privilege of a person to fly the Union Jack.\\" The Union Jack continued to be used for a period thereafter as a national flag.[70] The current national flag of New Zealand was given official standing under the New Zealand Ensign Act in 1902, but similarly to Australia the Union Jack continued to be used in some contexts as a national flag.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 February 2008, Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell introduced the 'Union Flag Bill' as a private member's bill under the 10 Minute Rule in the House of Commons. The Bill sought to formalise the position of the Union Flag as the national flag of the UK in law, to remove legal obstacles to its regular display and to officially recognise the name 'Union Jack' as having equal status with 'Union Flag'. However the Bill did not receive its second reading by the end of that parliamentary session.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack was introduced into South Africa in 1795, and except for the period 1803-06, it was an official flag until 1957.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Union of South Africa was established in 1910, the Union Jack was treated as its official flag. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe continued use of the Union Jack as national flag became an issue in the 1920s, when the government proposed to introduce a National Flag of the Union.  A compromise was reached in which both flags were flown on official buildings.  The Union Nationality and Flags Act 1927 provided that the flags of the Union were (a) the Union Jack, to denote the association with the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and (b) the new  National Flag.  The Union Jack was to be flown alongside the National Flag at the  Houses of Parliament, from the principal government buildings in the capitals, at Union ports, on government offices abroad, and at such other places as the government might determine.[73] [74]  This dual arrangement was effective from 31 May 1928.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstructions issued in 1931 confirmed the places where both flags were to be flown.  In addition to those already mentioned, they were the Union Buildings (Pretoria), the head offices of the four provincial administrations, the  supreme courts, certain  magistrates' courts, customs houses, and three buildings in Durban (the general post office, the  railway station, and the local  military district headquarters).[75] [74]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder these arrangements, the Union Jack was subordinate to the National Flag.  As the two flags had to be the same size, it meant that the Union Jack was made in the ratio 2:3 rather than the usual 1:2.[76][74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flying of the Union Jack alongside the National Flag ended on 6 April 1957.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe predecessor of the Union Jack, the flag of Great Britain, came into use in what is now Canada at the time of the Scottish settlement of Nova Scotia in 1621.[78] The Union Flag was also the official flag of the Dominion of Newfoundland and continued in use there after Newfoundland became a Canadian province. The province adopted its own flag in 1980, employing a design based on that of the Union Flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the close of the Great Canadian Flag Debate in 1964, which resulted in the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag as Canada's national flag the following year, a resolution was passed by both houses of the Canadian parliament naming the Union Flag as the Royal Union Flag and designating it as the symbol of Canada's membership of the Commonwealth and its allegiance to the Crown. The move was a concession given to conservatives, who preferred to keep the old flag, with its Union Flag in the canton. A federal directive says the Royal Union Flag is to be flown alongside the Maple Leaf Flag at federal government buildings, federally-operated airports and military bases, and at the masthead of Her Majesty's Canadian ships within Canadian waters[79] on three days of the year: Commonwealth Day, the Canadian monarch's official birthday, and the anniversary of the enactment of the Statute of Westminster 1931.[79] The flag is to be raised only where there is more than one flag pole, to ensure the flag of Canada is not removed. The directive is sometimes followed, sometimes not.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the most common ratio is 1:2, other ratios exist. The Royal Navy's flag code book, BR20 Flags of All Nations, states that both 1:2 and 3:5 versions are official.[81] The 3:5 version is most commonly used by the British Army and is sometimes known as the War flag. In this version the innermost points of the lower left and upper right diagonals of the St Patrick's cross are cut off or truncated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen's Harbour Master's flag, like the Pilot Jack, is a 1:2 flag that contains a white-bordered Union Flag that is longer than 1:2. The jacks of ships flying variants of the Blue Ensign are square and have a square Union Flag in the canton.[81] The Queen's Colours of Army regiments are 36 by 43 inches (910?mm G?1,090?mm); on them, the bars of the cross and saltire are of equal width; so are their respective fimbriations, which are very narrow.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs stated above, the Union Jacks flown alongside the National Flag in South Africa between 1928 and 1957 were 2:3 flags. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Flag was found in the canton (upper left-hand quarter) of the flags of many colonies of Britain, while the field (background) of their flags was the colour of the naval ensign flown by the particular Royal Navy squadron that patrolled that region of the world. Nations and colonies that have used the Union Flag at some stage have included Aden, Barbados, Borneo, Burma, Canada, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Cyprus, British East Africa (Kenya Colony), Gambia, Gold Coast (Ghana), Hong Kong, Jamaica, Lagos, Malta, Mauritius, Nigeria, Palestine, Penang (Malaysia), Rhodesia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Somaliland, British India, Tanganyika, Trinidad, Uganda, the United States, and Weihaiwei. As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former Dependent Territory of Hong Kong was handed over to the People's Republic of China.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of Gibraltar (other than the government ensign) and the Crown Dependencies. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special ensign in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and Tuvalu, which have retained the monarchy; and Fiji, which abolished the monarchy in 1987.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn former British colonies, the Union Jack was used semi-interchangeably with territorial flags for significant parts of their early history. This was the case in Canada until the introduction of the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965, but it is still used in the flags of a number of Canadian provinces such as British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario. Newfoundland and Labrador uses a modified version of the Union Flag, once the flag of the province.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the national flag, many other Australian flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the Royal Australian Navy Ensign (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the Royal Australian Air Force Ensign, the Australian Red Ensign (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the Australian Civil Aviation Ensign. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower Murray River Flags. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Basque Country's flag, the Ikurri?a, is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between Bilbao and Britain at the time the Ikurri?a was designed in 1894. The Miskito people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the Mosquito Coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the Grand Union Flag. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the British East India Company. Hawaii, a state of the United States but located in the central Pacific, incorporates the Union Jack in its state flag. According to one story, the King of Hawaii asked the British mariner, George Vancouver, during a stop in Lahaina, what the piece of cloth flying from his ship was. Vancouver replied that it represented his king's authority. The Hawaiian king then adopted and flew the flag as a symbol of his own royal authority not recognising its national derivation. Hawaii's flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the flag of Baton Rouge, the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the Seven Years' War until the end of the American Revolutionary War, when it was captured by Spanish and American forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. Taunton, Massachusetts, USA, has in recent years[when?] used a flag with the old style Union Flag.  Likewise, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, has been known to fly a flag containing the King's Colours since 1973.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack also appeared on both the 1910ÿ1928 and 1928ÿ1994 flags of South Africa. The 1910ÿ1928 flag was a red ensign with the Union coat of arms in the fly. The 1928ÿ1994 flag, based on the Prinsenvlag and commonly known as the oranje-blanje-blou (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two Boer republics of the Orange Free State and Transvaal. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coat of arms of the Chilean city of Coquimbo features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the ensigns flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the White ensign (Royal Navy), the Red ensign (Merchant and private boats) or the Blue ensign (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as New Zealand and Australia) with the Union Flag in the canton. Other Commonwealth countries (such as India and Jamaica) may follow similar ensign etiquette as the UK, replacing the Union Flag with their own national flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag in a white border occasionally seen on merchant ships was sometimes referred to as the Pilot Jack. It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, never intended as a civil jack. A book[clarification needed] issued to British consuls in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the Red Ensign for merchant shipping. In 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty's Ships, \\"except the Red Ensign, the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border\\", and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the \\"British flag\\", and states that \\"The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced Red Ensign), no other colours.\\"[84] Many civil vessels continue to fly the white bordered Union Flag without official opposition, making it the de facto Civil Jack.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag. HBC rival North West Company had a similar flag as well.

The version used is the modern flag, whereas the 1707 flag would have been used in colonial Alabama.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2007, the British prime minister at the time, Gordon Brown, unveiled plans to have the Union Flag flown more often from government buildings.[85] While consultation on new guidelines is under way, the decision to fly the flag may be made by each government department.[old info]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously the flag was generally only flown on public buildings on days marking the birthdays of members of the Royal Family, the wedding anniversary of the monarch, Commonwealth Day, Accession Day, Coronation Day, the Queen's Official Birthday, Remembrance Sunday, and on the days of the State Opening and prorogation of Parliament. The Union Flag is flown at half mast from the announcement of the death of the Sovereign (save for Proclamation Day), or upon command of the Sovereign.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current flag days where the Union Flag should be flown from government buildings throughout the UK are:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the Union Flag should be flown in the following areas on specified days:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 November, (St Andrew's Day), the Union Flag can be flown in Scotland only where a building has more than one flagpoleon this day the Saltire will not be lowered to make way for the Union Flag if there is only one flagpole.[88] This difference arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world that could not fly its national flag on its national day. However, on 23 April, St George's Day, it is the Union Flag of the United Kingdom that is flown over United Kingdom's government offices in England.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-government organisations may fly the Union Flag whenever they choose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Flag has no official status in the United Kingdom, and there are no national regulations concerning its use or prohibitions against flag desecration. In Northern Ireland, the Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 provide for the flying of the flag on government buildings on certain occasions, when it is flown half mast, and how it is displayed with other flags.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flags and Heraldry Committee, an all-party parliamentary group lobbying for official standards, cooperated with the Flag Institute in 2010 to publish a set of recommended guidelines for the flag's display and use as a symbol.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no specific way in which the Union Flag should be folded as there is with the United States Flag. It is usually folded rectilinearly, with the hoist on the outside, to be easily reattached to the pole.[91][92]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoyal Navy Stores Duties Instructions, article 447, dated 26 February 1914, specified that flags condemned from further service use were to be torn up into small pieces and disposed of as rags (ADM 1/8369/56), not to be used for decoration or sold. The exception was flags that had flown in action: these could be framed and kept on board, or transferred to a \\"suitable place\\", such as a museum (ADM 1/8567/245).[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 the Australian Flag Society announced a worldwide quest and a A$10,000 reward for information leading to the discovery of the Union Jack which was reportedly hoisted beneath the Eureka flag at the Battle of the Eureka Stockade.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the de facto national flag of the United Kingdom, the Union Jack serves as a patriotic or nationalist symbol, and can also carry associations of militarism and imperialism.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nWinston Churchill wrote about the use of the Union Jack as a symbol connected to British nationalism and imperialism. In March 1899 the young Churchill wrote to his mother from India about her plans to produce a new trans-Atlantic magazine, to be called The Anglo-Saxon Review. The drawing at the end of this letter was deliberately mischievous, teasing her for going down-market, and in the accompanying letter he wrote, 'Your title \\"The Anglo Saxon\\" with its motto \\"Blood is thicker than water\\" only needs the Union Jack & the Star Spangled Banner crossed on the cover to be suited to one of Harmsworth's [a leading British newspaper owner] cheap Imperialist productions.'[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Flag has been a prominent symbol in the sphere of fashion since the British Invasion movement of the 1960s, in a similar manner to the American Stars and Stripes flag. A notable increase in popularity was seen in Cuba following the 2012 summer Olympics, with clothing, nail decoration, tattoos, and hairstyles in youths being observed featuring the pattern.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommonly the Union Flag is used on computer software and Internet pages as an icon representing a choice of the English language where a choice among multiple languages may be presented to the user. The flag has been embroidered on various Reebok equipment as a mark of the brand's British origin,[101] and the Reebok Union Jack has been referred to as a brand icon.[102] Many music artists have used the Union flag ranging from rock artists The Who, Sex Pistols, Freddie Mercury, Morrissey, Oasis, Iron Maiden, and Def Leppard, to the pop girl group the Spice Girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBattle scene from Ray Wenban's The Revolt at Eureka.\\r\\n\\r\\nA folk cartoon inspired by the 1854 Eureka Rebellion entitled Fall back with the Eureka Jack.","input":"What is the uk flag made up of?"},{"output":"Prophets","context":"The Book of Jonah is one of the Prophets in the Bible. It tells of a Hebrew prophet named Jonah son of Amittai who is sent by God to prophesy the destruction of Nineveh but tries to escape the divine mission.[1] Set in the reign of Jeroboam II (786ÿ746?BC), it was probably written in the post-exilic period, some time between the late 5th to early 4th century BC.[2] The story has a long interpretive history and has become well-known through popular children's stories. In Judaism it is the Haftarah, read during the afternoon of Yom Kippur to instill reflection on God's willingness to forgive those who repent;[3] it remains a popular story among Christians. It is also retold in the Quran.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike the other Prophets, the book of Jonah is almost entirely narrative, with the exception of the psalm in chapter 2. The actual prophetic word against Nineveh is given only in passing through the narrative. As with any good narrative, the story of Jonah has a setting, characters, a plot, and themes. It also relies heavily on such literary devices as irony.\\r\\nNineveh, where Jonah preached, was the capital of the ancient Assyrian empire, which fell to the Babylonians and the Medes in 612?BC. The book calls Nineveh a \\"great city\\", referring to its size [Jonah 3:3 + 4:11] and perhaps to its affluence as well.[citation needed] (The story of the city's deliverance from judgment may reflect an older tradition dating back to the 8thÿ7th century BC)[citation needed] Assyria often opposed Israel and eventually took the Israelites captive in 722ÿ721?BC (see History of ancient Israel and Judah). The Assyrian oppression against the Israelites can be seen in the bitter prophecies of Nahum.\\r\\nThe story of Jonah is a drama between a passive man and an active God. Jonah, whose name literally means \\"dove\\", is introduced to the reader in the very first verse. The name is decisive. While many other prophets had heroic names (e.g., Isaiah means \\"God has saved\\"), Jonah's name carries with it an element of passivity.[citation needed]\\r\\nJonah's passive character is contrasted with the other main character: Yahweh. God's character is altogether active. While Jonah flees, God pursues. While Jonah falls, God lifts up. The character of God in the story is progressively revealed through the use of irony. In the first part of the book, God is depicted as relentless and wrathful; in the second part of the book, He is revealed to be truly loving and merciful.\\r\\nThe other characters of the story include the sailors in chapter 1 and the people of Nineveh in chapter 3. These characters are also contrasted to Jonah's passivity. While Jonah sleeps in the hull, the sailors pray and try to save the ship from the storm (1:4ÿ6). While Jonah passively finds himself forced to act under the Divine Will, the people of Nineveh actively petition God to change his mind.\\r\\nThe plot centers on a conflict between Jonah and God. God calls Jonah to proclaim judgment to Nineveh, but Jonah resists and attempts to flee. He goes to Joppa and boards a ship bound for Tarshish. God calls up a great storm at sea, and, at Jonah's insistence, the ship's crew reluctantly cast Jonah overboard in an attempt to appease God. A great sea creature, sent by God, swallows Jonah. For three days and three nights Jonah languishes inside the fish's belly. He says a prayer in which he repents for his disobedience and thanks God for His mercy. God speaks to the fish, which vomits out Jonah safely on dry land.\\r\\nAfter his rescue, Jonah obeys the call to prophesy against Nineveh, causing the people of the city to repent and God to forgive them. Jonah is furious, however, and angrily tells God that this is the reason he tried to flee from Him, as he knew Him to be a just and merciful God. He then beseeches God to kill him, a request which is denied when God causes a tree to grow over him, giving him shade. Initially grateful, Jonah's anger returns the next day, when God sends a worm to eat the plant, withering it, and he tells God that it would be better if he were dead. God then points out: \\"You are concerned about the bush, for which you did not labour and which you did not grow; it came into being in a night and perished in a night. And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left, and also many animals? (NRSV)\\"\\r\\nIronically, the relentless God demonstrated in the first chapter is shown to be the merciful God in the last two chapters (see 3:10). Equally ironic, despite not wanting to go to Nineveh and follow God's calling, Jonah becomes one of the most effective prophets of God. As a result of his preaching, the entire population of Nineveh repents before the Lord and is spared destruction. The author indicates that the city \\"has more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left\\" (4:11a, NIV). While some commentators see this number (120,000) as a somewhat pejorative reference to ignorant or backward Ninevites, most commentators take it to refer to young infants, thus implying a population considerably larger than 120,000.[5]\\r\\nIslam also tells the story of the Prophet Jonah in the Quran. Similar to the Bible, the Quran states that Jonah was sent to his people to deliver a message to worship only one God (the Judeo-Christian God of Abraham) and to refrain from evil behavior. However, Jonah became angry with his people when they refused to listen and ignored him. Jonah gave up on his people and left his community without having instruction from God. And remember when he (Jonah) went off in anger. (Quran 21:87)\\r\\nAccording to Islam, after Jonah left his people the sky turned red as fire and the people were filled with fear. Jonah's people repented to God and prayed that Jonah would return to guide them to the Straight Path. God accepted their repentance and the sky returned to normal.\\r\\nAs told in the Quran, Jonah boarded a ship to be far away from his people. While on the ship the calm sea became violent and was tearing at the boat. After throwing their belongings overboard without any positive change, the passengers cast lots to throw someone overboard to reduce the weight. Twice Jonah's name was drawn to be thrown overboard, which surprised the passengers because Jonah was perceived as a righteous and pious man. Jonah understood this was not a coincidence but his destiny and he jumped into the violent sea and was swallowed by a \\"giant fish.\\" Many believe this fish was a whale.\\r\\nThe strong acid from fish's belly began to eat away at Jonah's skin and he began to repeatedly call out to God for help by saying: \\"None has the right to be worshipped but you oh God, glorified are you and truly I have been one of the wrongdoers! (Quran 21:87)\\r\\nIslam teaches that God accepted Jonah's repentance and commanded the giant fish to spit Jonah out onto the shore. Jonah was in pain and his skin was burned from the acid in the fish's belly. Jonah repeated his prayer and God relieved him by having a vine (gourd) cover his body to protect him and also provided him with food.\\r\\nThe Quran states: \\"And, verily, Jonah was one of the Messengers. When he ran to the laden ship, he agreed to cast lots and he was among the losers, then a big fish swallowed him and he had done an act worthy of blame. Had he not been of them who glorify God, he would have indeed remained inside its belly (the fish) until the Day of Resurrection. But We cast him forth on the naked shore while he was sick and We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him. And We sent him to a hundred thousand people or even more, and they believed, so We gave them enjoyment for a while. (Quran 37:139-148).\\r\\nJonah returned to be with his people and guide them. The prayer made by Jonah while in the fish's belly can be used to help anyone in times of distress: \\"None has the right to be worshipped but you oh God, glorified are you and truly I have been one of the wrongdoers! (Quran 21:87).\\r\\nThe story of Jonah has numerous theological implications, and this has long been recognized. In early translations of the Hebrew Bible, Jewish translators tended to remove anthropomorphic imagery in order to prevent the reader from misunderstanding the ancient texts.[citation needed] This tendency is evidenced in both the Aramaic translations (e.g. the Targums) and the Greek translations (e.g. the Septuagint). As far as the Book of Jonah is concerned, Targum Jonah offers a good example of this.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Jonah 1:6, the Masoretic Text (MT) reads, \\"...perhaps God will pay heed to us....\\" Targum Jonah translates this passage as: \\"...perhaps there will be mercy from the Lord upon us....\\" The captain's proposal is no longer an attempt to change the divine will; it is an attempt to appeal to divine mercy. Furthermore, in Jonah 3:9, the MT reads, \\"Who knows, God may turn and relent [lit. repent]?\\" Targum Jonah translates this as, \\"Whoever knows that there are sins on his conscience let him repent of them and we will be pitied before the Lord.\\" God does not change His mind; He shows pity.[citation needed]\\r\\nFragments of the book were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS), most of which follows the Masoretic Text closely and with Mur XII reproducing a large portion of the text.[6] As for the non-canonical writings, the majority of references to biblical texts were made by argumentum ad verecundiam. The Book of Jonah appears to have served less purpose in the Qumran community than other texts, as the writings make no references to it.[7]\\r\\nThe earliest Christian interpretations of Jonah are found in the Gospel of Matthew[8] and the Gospel of Luke.[9] Both Matthew and Luke record a tradition of Jesus interpretation of the Book of Jonah (notably, Matthew includes two very similar traditions in chapters 12 and 16). As with most Old Testament interpretations found in the New Testament, Jesus interpretation is primarily typological (see Typology (theology)). Jonah becomes a type for Jesus. Jonah spent three days in the belly of the fish; Jesus will spend three days in the grave. Here, Jesus plays on the imagery of Sheol found in Jonahs prayer. While Jonah metaphorically declared, Out of the belly of Sheol I cried, Jesus will literally be in the belly of Sheol. Finally, Jesus compares his generation to the people of Nineveh. Jesus fulfills his role as a type of Jonah, however his generation fails to fulfill its role as a type of Nineveh. Nineveh repented, but Jesus' generation, which has seen and heard one even greater than Jonah, fails to repent. Through his typological interpretation of the Book of Jonah, Jesus has weighed his generation and found it wanting.\\r\\nThe debate over the credibility of the miracle of Jonah is not simply a modern one. The credibility of a human being surviving in the belly of a great fish has long been questioned. In c. 409?AD, Augustine of Hippo wrote to Deogratias concerning the challenge of some to the miracle recorded in the Book of Jonah. He writes:\\r\\nThe last question proposed is concerning Jonah, and it is put as if it were not from Porphyry, but as being a standing subject of ridicule among the Pagans; for his words are: In the next place, what are we to believe concerning Jonah, who is said to have been three days in a whales belly? The thing is utterly improbable and incredible, that a man swallowed with his clothes on should have existed in the inside of a fish. If, however, the story is figurative, be pleased to explain it. Again, what is meant by the story that a gourd sprang up above the head of Jonah after he was vomited by the fish? What was the cause of this gourds growth? Questions such as these I have seen discussed by Pagans amidst loud laughter, and with great scorn.\\r\\nAugustine responds that if one is to question one miracle, then one should question all miracles as well (section 31). Nevertheless, despite his apologetic, Augustine views the story of Jonah as a figure for Christ. For example, he writes: \\"As, therefore, Jonah passed from the ship to the belly of the whale, so Christ passed from the cross to the sepulchre, or into the abyss of death. And as Jonah suffered this for the sake of those who were endangered by the storm, so Christ suffered for the sake of those who are tossed on the waves of this world.\\" Augustine credits his allegorical interpretation to the interpretation of Christ himself (Matt. 12:39,40), and he allows for other interpretations as long as they are in line with Christ's.\\r\\nThe Ordinary Gloss, or Glossa Ordinaria, was the most important Christian commentary on the Bible in the later Middle Ages. \\"The Gloss on Jonah relies almost exclusively on Jeromes commentary on Jonah (c. 396), so its Latin often has a tone of urbane classicism. But the Gloss also chops up, compresses, and rearranges Jerome with a carnivalesque glee and scholastic directness that renders the Latin authentically medieval.\\"[10] \\"The Ordinary Gloss on Jonah\\" has been translated into English and printed in a format that emulates the first printing of the Gloss.[11]\\r\\nThe relationship between Jonah and his fellow Jews is ambivalent, and complicated by the Gloss's tendency to read Jonah as an allegorical prefiguration of Jesus Christ. While some glosses in isolation seem crudely supersessionist (The foreskin believes while the circumcision remains unfaithful), the prevailing allegorical tendency is to attribute Jonahs recalcitrance to his abiding love for his own people and his insistence that Gods promises to Israel not be overridden by a lenient policy toward the Ninevites. For the glossator, Jonahs pro-Israel motivations correspond to Christs demurral in the Garden of Gethsemane (My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me [Matt. 26:39]) and the Gospel of Matthews and Pauls insistence that salvation is from the Jews (Jn. 4:22). While in the Gloss the plot of Jonah prefigures how God will extend salvation to the nations, it also makes abundantly clearas some medieval commentaries on the Gospel of John do notthat Jonah and Jesus are Jews, and that they make decisions of salvation-historical consequence as Jews.\\r\\nNCSY director of education Dovid Bashevkin sees Jonah as a thoughtful prophet who comes to religion out of a search for theological truth and is constantly disappointed by those who come to religion to provide mere comfort in the face of adversity inherit to the human condition. \\"If religion is only a blanket to provide warmth from the cold, harsh realities of life,\\" Bashevkin imagines Jonah asking, \\"[D]id concerns of theological truth and creed even matter?\\"[12] The lesson taught by the episode of the tree at the end of the book is that comfort is a deep human need that religion provides, but this need not obscure the role of God.\\r\\nThe Hebrew text of Jonah[13] (1:17 in English translation), reads dag gadol (Hebrew: ?? ????), which literally means \\"great fish.\\" The Septuagint translates this into Greek as ketos megas, (Greek: ٻҶ? ךϫ?), \\"huge fish\\"; in Greek mythology the term was closely associated with sea monsters.[14] Saint Jerome later translated the Greek phrase as piscis granda in his Latin Vulgate, and as cetus in Matthew.[15] At some point, cetus became synonymous with whale (cf. cetyl alcohol, which is alcohol derived from whales). In his 1534 translation, William Tyndale translated the phrase in Jonah 2:1 as \\"greate fyshe,\\" and he translated the word ketos (Greek) or cetus (Latin) in Matthew as \\"whale\\".[16] Tyndale's translation was later followed by the translators of the King James Version of 1611 and has enjoyed general acceptance in English translations.\\r\\nIn the line 2:1 the book refers to the fish as dag gadol, \\"great fish\\", in the masculine. However, in the 2:2, it changes the gender to daga, meaning female fish. The verses therefore read: \\"And the lord provided a great fish (dag gadol, masculine) for Jonah, and it swallowed him, and Jonah sat in the belly of the fish (still male) for three days and nights; then, from the belly of the (daga, female) fish, Jonah began to pray.\\" The peculiarity of this change of gender led the later rabbis to reason that this means Jonah was comfortable in the roomy male fish, so he didn't pray, but that God then transferred him to a smaller, female fish, in which the prophet was uncomfortable, so that he prayed.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe book closes abruptly Jonah with an epistolary warning[17] based on the emblematic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized in fables such as The Gourd and the Palm-tree during the Renaissance, for example by Andrea Alciato.\\r\\nSt. Jerome differed[18] with St. Augustine in his Latin translation of the plant known in Hebrew as ?????? (qؐqayn), using hedera (from the Greek, meaning \\"ivy\\") over the more common Latin cucurbita, \\"gourd\\", from which the English word gourd (Old French coorde, couhourde) is derived. The Renaissance humanist artist Albrecht Drer memorialized Jerome's decision to use an analogical type of Christ's \\"I am the Vine, you are the branches\\" in his woodcut Saint Jerome in His Study.","input":"What book is the story of jonah in?"},{"output":"11 February 1929","context":"in Europe??(dark grey)? ÿ? [Legend]\\r\\nVatican City (/?v?t?k?n ?s?ti/?(?listen); Italian: Citt del Vaticano [t?it?ta ddel vati?ka?no];[7][8] Latin: Civitas Vaticana),[d] officially Vatican City State or State of Vatican City (Italian: Stato della Citt del Vaticano;[e] Latin: Status Civitatis Vaticanae),[f] is an independent state located within the city of Rome. With an area of 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of about 1,000,[3] it is the smallest state in the world by both area and population. However, formally it is not sovereign, with sovereignty being held by the Holy See.\\r\\nIt is an ecclesiastical[3] or sacerdotal-monarchical[9] state (a type of theocracy) ruled by the Bishop of Rome ÿ the Pope. The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins. Since the return of the popes from Avignon in 1377, they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere.\\r\\nVatican City is distinct from the Holy See (Latin: Sancta Sedes),[g] which dates back to early Christianity and is the main episcopal see of 1.2?billion Latin and Eastern Catholic adherents around the globe. The independent city-state, on the other hand, came into existence in 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy, which spoke of it as a new creation,[10] not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756ÿ1870), which had previously encompassed much of central Italy. According to the terms of the treaty, the Holy See has \\"full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction\\" over the city-state.[11]\\r\\nWithin Vatican City are religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel and the Vatican Museums. They feature some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by the sale of postage stamps and tourist mementos, fees for admission to museums, and the sale of publications.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Vatican city was first used in the Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city-state. The name is taken from Vatican Hill, the geographic location of the state. \\"Vatican\\" is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement, Vatica or Vaticum meaning garden, located in the general area the Romans called vaticanus ager, \\"Vatican territory\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nThe official Italian name of the city is Citt del Vaticano or, more formally, Stato della Citt del Vaticano, meaning \\"Vatican City State\\". Although the Holy See (which is distinct from the Vatican City) and the Catholic Church use Ecclesiastical Latin in official documents, the Vatican City officially uses Italian. The Latin name is Status Civitatis Vatican?;[12][13] this is used in official documents by not just the Holy See, but in most official Church and Papal documents.\\r\\nThe name \\"Vatican\\" was already in use in the time of the Roman Republic for a marshy area on the west bank of the Tiber across from the city of Rome. Under the Roman Empire, many villas were constructed there, after Agrippina the Elder (14 BC?ÿ 18 October AD 33) drained the area and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD. In AD 40, her son, Emperor Caligula (31 August AD 12ÿ24 January AD 41; r. 37ÿ41) built in her gardens a circus for charioteers (AD 40) that was later completed by Nero, the Circus Gaii et Neronis,[14] usually called, simply, the Circus of Nero.[15]\\r\\nEven before the arrival of Christianity, it is supposed that this originally uninhabited part of Rome (the ager vaticanus) had long been considered sacred, or at least not available for habitation.[citation needed] A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her consort Attis remained active long after the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter was built nearby.[16]\\r\\nThe particularly low quality of Vatican water, even after the reclamation of the area, was commented on by the poet Martial (40 ÿ between 102 and 104 AD).[17] Tacitus wrote, that in AD 69, the Year of the Four Emperors, when the northern army that brought Vitellius to power arrived in Rome, \\"a large proportion camped in the unhealthy districts of the Vatican, which resulted in many deaths among the common soldiery; and the Tiber being close by, the inability of the Gauls and Germans to bear the heat and the consequent greed with which they drank from the stream weakened their bodies, which were already an easy prey to disease\\".[18]\\r\\nThe Vatican Obelisk was originally taken by Caligula from Heliopolis in Egypt to decorate the spina of his circus and is thus its last visible remnant.[19] This area became the site of martyrdom of many Christians after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64. Ancient tradition holds that it was in this circus that Saint Peter was crucified upside-down.[20]\\r\\nOpposite the circus was a cemetery separated by the Via Cornelia. Funeral monuments and mausoleums and small tombs as well as altars to pagan gods of all kinds of polytheistic religions were constructed lasting until before the construction of the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter's in the first half of the 4th century. Remains of this ancient necropolis were brought to light sporadically during renovations by various popes throughout the centuries, increasing in frequency during the Renaissance until it was systematically excavated by orders of Pope Pius XII from 1939 to 1941. The Constantinian basilica was built in 326 over what was believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter, buried in that cemetery.[21]\\r\\nFrom then on, the area became more populated in connection with activity at the basilica. A palace was constructed nearby as early as the 5th century during the pontificate of Pope Symmachus (reigned 498ÿ514).[22]\\r\\nPopes gradually came to have a secular role as governors of regions near Rome. They ruled the Papal States, which covered a large portion of the Italian peninsula, for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when all the territory belonging to the papacy was seized by the newly created Kingdom of Italy.\\r\\nFor most of this time the popes did not live at the Vatican. The Lateran Palace, on the opposite side of Rome was their habitual residence for about a thousand years. From 1309 to 1377, they lived at Avignon in France. On their return to Rome they chose to live at the Vatican. They moved to the Quirinal Palace in 1583, after work on it was completed under Pope Paul V (1605ÿ1621), but on the capture of Rome in 1870 retired to the Vatican, and what had been their residence became that of the King of Italy.\\r\\nIn 1870, the Pope's holdings were left in an uncertain situation when Rome itself was annexed by the Piedmont-led forces which had united the rest of Italy, after a nominal resistance by the papal forces. Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the \\"Roman Question\\".\\r\\nItaly made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls. However, it confiscated church property in many places. In 1871 the Quirinal Palace was confiscated by the king of Italy and became the royal palace. Thereafter the popes resided undisturbed within the Vatican walls, and certain papal prerogatives were recognized by the Law of Guarantees, including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they refused to leave the Vatican compound until the dispute was resolved in 1929; Pope Pius IX (1846ÿ1878), the last ruler of the Papal States, was referred to as a \\"prisoner in the Vatican\\". Forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.[23]\\r\\nThis situation was resolved on 11 February 1929, when the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy was signed by Prime Minister and Head of Government Benito Mussolini on behalf of King Victor Emmanuel III and by Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri for Pope Pius XI.[10][11][24] The treaty, which became effective on 7 June 1929, established the independent state of Vatican City and reaffirmed the special status of Catholicism in Italy.[25]\\r\\nThe Holy See, which ruled Vatican City, pursued a policy of neutrality during World War II, under the leadership of Pope Pius XII. Although German troops occupied the city of Rome after the September 1943 Armistice of Cassibile, and the Allies from 1944, they respected Vatican City as neutral territory.[26] One of the main diplomatic priorities of the bishop of Rome was to prevent the bombing of the city; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.[27] The British policy, as expressed in the minutes of a Cabinet meeting, was: \\"that we should on no account molest the Vatican City, but that our action as regards the rest of Rome would depend upon how far the Italian government observed the rules of war\\".[27]\\r\\nAfter the American entry into the war, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, but said that \\"they could not stop the British from bombing Rome if the British so decided\\". The British uncompromisingly said \\"they would bomb Rome whenever the needs of the war demanded\\".[28] In December 1942, the British envoy suggested to the Holy See that Rome be declared an \\"open city\\", a suggestion that the Holy See took more seriously than was probably meant by the British, who did not want Rome to be an open city, but Mussolini rejected the suggestion when the Holy See put it to him. In connection with the Allied invasion of Sicily, 500 American aircraft bombed Rome on 19 July 1943, aiming particularly at the railway hub. Some 1,500 people were killed; Pius XII himself, who had been described in the previous month as \\"worried sick\\" about the possible bombing, went to the scene of the tragedy. Another raid took place on 13 August 1943, after Mussolini had been ousted from power.[29] On the following day, the new government declared Rome an open city, after consulting the Holy See on the wording of the declaration, but the British had decided that they would never recognize Rome as an open city.[30]\\r\\nPius XII had refrained from creating cardinals during the war. By the end of World War II, there were several prominent vacancies: Cardinal Secretary of State, Camerlengo, Chancellor, and Prefect for the Congregation for the Religious among them.[31] Pius XII created 32 cardinals in early 1946, having announced his intentions to do so in his preceding Christmas message.\\r\\nThe Pontifical Military Corps, except for the Swiss Guard, was disbanded by will of Paul VI, as expressed in a letter of 14 September 1970.[32] The Gendarmerie Corps was transformed into a civilian police and security force.\\r\\nIn 1984, a new concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain provisions of the earlier treaty, including the position of Catholicism as the Italian state religion, a position given to it by a statute of the Kingdom of Sardinia of 1848.[25]\\r\\nConstruction in 1995 of a new guest house, Domus Sanctae Marthae, adjacent to St Peter's Basilica was criticised by Italian environmental groups, backed by Italian politicians. They claimed the new building would block views of the Basilica from nearby Italian apartments.[33] For a short while the plans strained the relations between the Vatican and the Italian government. The head of the Vatican's Department of Technical Services robustly rejected challenges to the Vatican State's right to build within its borders.[33]\\r\\nThe name \\"Vatican\\" predates Christianity and comes from the Latin Mons Vaticanus, meaning Vatican Mount.[34] The territory of Vatican City is part of the Mons Vaticanus, and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields. It is in this territory that St. Peter's Basilica, the Apostolic Palace, the Sistine Chapel, and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman rione of Borgo until 1929. Being separated from the city, on the west bank of the Tiber river, the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of Leo IV (847ÿ855), and later expanded by the current fortification walls, built under Paul III (1534ÿ1549), Pius IV (1559ÿ1565) and Urban VIII (1623ÿ1644).\\r\\nWhen the Lateran Treaty of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.\\r\\nThe territory includes St. Peter's Square, distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio?XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the Via della Conciliazione which runs from close to the Tiber River to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by Benito Mussolini after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.\\r\\nAccording to the Lateran Treaty, certain properties of the Holy See that are located in Italian territory, most notably the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo and the major basilicas, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign embassies.[35][36] These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.[36]\\r\\nCastel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by police agents of Vatican City State and not by Italian police. According to the Lateran Treaty (Art. 3) St. Peter's Square, up to but not including the steps leading to the basilica, is normally patrolled by the Italian police.[35]\\r\\nThere are no passport controls for visitors entering Vatican City from the surrounding Italian territory. There is free public access to Saint Peter's Square and Basilica and, on the occasion of papal general audiences, to the hall in which they are held. For these audiences and for major ceremonies in Saint Peter's Basilica and Square, tickets free of charge must be obtained beforehand. The Vatican Museums, incorporating the Sistine Chapel, usually charge an entrance fee. There is no general public access to the gardens, but guided tours for small groups can be arranged to the gardens and excavations under the basilica. Other places are open to only those individuals who have business to transact there.\\r\\nVatican City's climate is the same as Rome's: a temperate, Mediterranean climate Csa with mild, rainy winters from October to mid-May and hot, dry summers from May to September. Some minor local features, principally mists and dews, are caused by the anomalous bulk of St Peter's Basilica, the elevation, the fountains and the size of the large paved square.\\r\\nIn July 2007, the Vatican accepted a proposal by two firms based respectively in San Francisco and Budapest,[39] whereby it would become the first carbon neutral state by offsetting its carbon dioxide emissions with the creation of a Vatican Climate Forest in Hungary,[40] as a purely symbolic gesture[41] to encourage Catholics to do more to safeguard the planet.[42] Nothing came of the project.[43][44]\\r\\nOn 26 November 2008, the Vatican itself put into effect a plan announced in May 2007 to cover the roof of the Paul VI Audience Hall with solar panels.[45][46]\\r\\nWithin the territory of Vatican City are the Vatican Gardens (Italian: Giardini Vaticani),[47] which account for more than half of this territory. The gardens, established during the Renaissance and Baroque era, are decorated with fountains and sculptures.\\r\\nThe gardens cover approximately 23 hectares (57 acres) which is most of the Vatican Hill. The highest point is 60 metres (200?ft) above mean sea level. Stone walls bound the area in the North, South and West.\\r\\nThe gardens date back to medieval times when orchards and vineyards extended to the north of the Papal Apostolic Palace.[48] In 1279 Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, 1277ÿ1280) moved his residence back to the Vatican from the Lateran Palace and enclosed this area with walls.[49] He planted an orchard (pomerium), a lawn (pratellum) and a garden (viridarium).[49]\\r\\nThe politics of Vatican City takes place in an absolute elective monarchy, in which the head of the Roman Catholic Church takes power. The Pope exercises principal legislative, executive, and judicial power over the State of Vatican City (an entity distinct from the Holy See), which is a rare case of a non-hereditary monarchy.[50]\\r\\nVatican City is one of the few widely recognized independent states that has not become a member of the United Nations.[51] The Holy See, which is distinct from Vatican City State, has permanent observer status with all the rights of a full member except for a vote in the UN General Assembly.\\r\\nThe government of Vatican City has a unique structure. The Pope is the sovereign of the state. Legislative authority is vested in the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the President of that commission, assisted by the General Secretary and Deputy General Secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's Secretariat of State and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative and judicial branches over Vatican City. He is currently the only absolute monarch in Europe.\\r\\nThere are specific departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications, etc.[52]\\r\\nThe Cardinal Camerlengo presides over the Apostolic Camera to which is entrusted the administration of the property and protection of other papal temporal powers and rights of the Holy See during the period of the empty throne or Sede Vacante (papal vacancy). Those of the Vatican State remain under the control of the Pontifical Commission for the State of Vatican City. Acting with three other cardinals chosen by lot every three days, one from each order of cardinals (cardinal bishop, cardinal priest, and cardinal deacon), he in a sense performs during that period the functions of head of state of Vatican City.[citation needed] All the decisions these four cardinals take must be approved by the College of Cardinals as a whole.\\r\\nThe nobility that was closely associated with the Holy See at the time of the Papal States continued to be associated with the Papal Court after the loss of these territories, generally with merely nominal duties (see Papal Master of the Horse, Prefecture of the Pontifical Household, Hereditary officers of the Roman Curia, Black Nobility). They also formed the ceremonial Noble Guard. In the first decades of the existence of the Vatican City State, executive functions were entrusted to some of them, including that of Delegate for the State of Vatican City (now denominated President of the Commission for Vatican City). But with the motu proprio Pontificalis Domus of 28 March 1968,[53] Pope Paul VI abolished the honorary positions that had continued to exist until then, such as Quartermaster general and Master of the Horse.[54]\\r\\nVatican City State, created in 1929 by the Lateran Pacts, provides the Holy See with a temporal jurisdiction and independence within a small territory. It is distinct from the Holy See. The state can thus be deemed a significant but not essential instrument of the Holy See. The Holy See itself has existed continuously as a juridical entity since Roman Imperial times and has been internationally recognized as a powerful and independent sovereign entity since Late Antiquity to the present, without interruption even at times when it was deprived of territory (e.g. 1870 to 1929). The Holy See has the oldest active continuous diplomatic service in the world, dating back to at least AD 325 with its legation to the Council of Nicea.[55]\\r\\nThe Pope is ex officio head of state[56] of Vatican City, functions dependent on his primordial function as bishop of the diocese of Rome. The term \\"Holy See\\" refers not to the Vatican state but to the Pope's spiritual and pastoral governance, largely exercised through the Roman Curia.[57] His official title with regard to Vatican City is Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City.\\r\\nPope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was elected on 13 March 2013. His principal subordinate government official for Vatican City is the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, who since 1952 exercises the functions previously belonging to the Governor of Vatican City. Since 2001, the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State also has the title of President of the Governorate of the State of Vatican City. The current President is Italian Cardinal Giuseppe Bertello, who was appointed on 1 October 2011.\\r\\nLegislative functions are delegated to the unicameral Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, led by the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State. Its seven members are cardinals appointed by the Pope for terms of five years. Acts of the commission must be approved by the Pope, through the Holy See's Secretariat of State, and before taking effect must be published in a special appendix of the Acta Apostolicae Sedis. Most of the content of this appendix consists of routine executive decrees, such as approval for a new set of postage stamps.\\r\\nExecutive authority is delegated to the Governorate of Vatican City. The Governorate consists of the President of the Pontifical Commissionusing the title \\"President of the Governorate of Vatican City\\"a general secretary, and a Vice general secretary, each appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. Important actions of the Governorate must be confirmed by the Pontifical Commission and by the Pope through the Secretariat of State.\\r\\nThe Governorate oversees the central governmental functions through several departments and offices. The directors and officials of these offices are appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. These organs concentrate on material questions concerning the state's territory, including local security, records, transportation, and finances. The Governorate oversees a modern security and police corps, the Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Citt del Vaticano.\\r\\nJudicial functions are delegated to a supreme court, an appellate court, a tribunal (Tribunal of Vatican City State), and a trial judge. At the Vatican's request, sentences imposed can be served in Italy (see the section on crime, below).\\r\\nThe international postal country code prefix is SCV, and the only postal code is 00120 ÿ altogether SCV-00120.[58]\\r\\nAs the Vatican City is an enclave within Italy, its military defence is provided by the Italian armed forces. However, there is no formal defence treaty with Italy, as the Vatican City is a neutral state. Vatican City has no armed forces of its own, although the Swiss Guard is a military corps of the Holy See responsible for the personal security of the Pope, and resident in the state. Soldiers of the Swiss Guard are entitled to hold Vatican City State passports and nationality. Swiss mercenaries were historically recruited by Popes as part of an army for the Papal States, and the Pontifical Swiss Guard was founded by Pope Julius II on 22 January 1506 as the pope's personal bodyguard and continues to fulfill that function. It is listed in the Annuario Pontificio under \\"Holy See\\", not under \\"State of Vatican City\\". At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. Recruitment is arranged by a special agreement between the Holy See and Switzerland. All recruits must be Catholic, unmarried males with Swiss citizenship who have completed their basic training with the Swiss Armed Forces with certificates of good conduct, be between the ages of 19 and 30, and be at least 174?cm (5?ft 9?in) in height. Members are equipped with small arms and the traditional halberd (also called the Swiss voulge), and trained in bodyguarding tactics. The Palatine Guard and the Noble Guard, the last armed forces of the Vatican City State, were disbanded by Pope Paul VI in 1970.[32] As Vatican City has listed every building in its territory on the International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection, the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict theoretically renders it immune to armed attack.[59]\\r\\nCivil defence is the responsibility of the Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State, the national fire brigade. Dating its origins to the early nineteenth century, the Corps in its present form was established in 1941. It is responsible for fire fighting, as well as a range of civil defence scenarios including flood, natural disaster, and mass casualty management. The Corps is governmentally supervised through the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence, which is also responsible for the Gendarmerie (see below).\\r\\nThe Gendarmerie Corps (Corpo della Gendarmeria) is the gendarmerie, or police and security force, of Vatican City and the extraterritorial properties of the Holy See.[60] The corps is responsible for security, public order, border control, traffic control, criminal investigation, and other general police duties in Vatican City including providing security for the Pope outside of Vatican City. The corps has 130 personnel and is a part of the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence (which also includes the Vatican Fire Brigade), an organ of the Governorate of Vatican City.[61][62]\\r\\nVatican City State is a recognized national territory under international law, but it is the Holy See that conducts diplomatic relations on its behalf, in addition to the Holy See's own diplomacy, entering into international agreements in its regard. Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.\\r\\nBecause of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies. Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican Cityembassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.\\r\\nThe size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.[63]\\r\\nHowever, Vatican City State itself participates in some international organizations whose functions relate to the state as a geographical entity, distinct from the non-territorial legal persona of the Holy See. These organizations are much less numerous than those in which the Holy See participates either as a member or with observer status. They include the following eight, in each of which Vatican City State holds membership:[64][65]\\r\\nIt also participates in:[64]\\r\\nThe Vatican City State budget includes the Vatican Museums and post office and is supported financially by the sale of stamps, coins, medals and tourist mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications sales.[h] The incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome.[67] Other industries include printing, the production of mosaics, and the manufacture of staff uniforms. There is a Vatican Pharmacy.\\r\\nThe Institute for Works of Religion (IOR, Istituto per le Opere di Religione), also known as the Vatican Bank, and with the acronym IOR (Istituto per le Opere di Religione), is a financial agency situated in the Vatican that conducts worldwide financial activities. It has multilingual ATMs with instructions in Latin, possibly the only ATM in the world with this feature.[68]\\r\\nVatican City issues its own coins and stamps. It has used the euro as its currency since 1 January 1999, owing to a special agreement with the European Union (council decision 1999/98). Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002the Vatican does not issue euro banknotes. Issuance of euro-denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy.[69] Because of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.[70] Until the adoption of the Euro, Vatican coinage and stamps were denominated in their own Vatican lira currency, which was on par with the Italian lira.\\r\\nVatican City State, which employs nearly 2,000 people, had a surplus of 6.7?million euros in 2007 but ran a deficit in 2008 of over 15?million euros.[71]\\r\\nIn 2012, the U.S. State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report listed Vatican City for the first time among the nations of concern for money-laundering, placing it in the middle category, which includes countries such as Ireland, but not among the most vulnerable countries, which include the United States itself, Germany, Italy and Russia.[72]\\r\\nOn 24 February 2014 the Vatican announced it was establishing a secretariat for the economy, to be responsible for all economic, financial and administrative activities of the Holy See and the Vatican City State, headed by Cardinal George Pell. This followed the charging of two senior clerics including a monsignor with money laundering offenses. Pope Francis also appointed an auditor-general authorized to carry out random audits of any agency at any time, and engaged a US financial services company to review the Vatican's 19,000 accounts to ensure compliance with international money laundering practices. The pontiff also ordered that the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See would be the Vatican's central bank, with responsibilities similar to other central banks around the world.[73]\\r\\nAlmost all of Vatican City's more than 450[74] citizens either live inside the Vatican's walls or serve in the Holy See's diplomatic service in embassies (called \\"nunciature\\"; a papal ambassador is a \\"nuncio\\") around the world. The Vatican citizenry consists almost entirely of two groups: clergy, most of whom work in the service of the Holy See, and a very few as officials of the state; and the Swiss Guard. Most of the 2,400 lay workers who comprise the majority of the Vatican workforce reside outside the Vatican and are citizens of Italy, while a few are citizens of other nations. As a result, all of the City's actual citizens are Catholic as are all the places of worship.\\r\\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.[75] Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Romansh or Italian. Vatican City's official website languages are Italian, English, French, German, and Spanish. (This site should not be confused with that of the Holy See, which uses all these languages, along with Portuguese, with Latin since 9 May 2008 and Chinese since 18 March 2009.)\\r\\nUnlike citizenship of other states, which is based either on jus sanguinis (birth from a citizen, even outside the state's territory) or on jus soli (birth within the territory of the state), citizenship of Vatican City is granted jus officii, namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is extended also to the spouse, parents and descendants of a citizen, provided they are living with the person who is a citizen.[76][77] The Holy See, not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City issues normal passports for its citizens.\\r\\nAnyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an Italian citizen as provided in the Lateran Treaty.[35]\\r\\nAs of 31 December 2005, there were, apart from the Pope himself, 557 people with Vatican citizenship, while there were 246 residents in the state who did not have its citizenship.\\r\\nOf the 557 citizens, 74% were clergy:\\r\\nThe 101 members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard constituted 18% of the total, and there were only 55 other lay persons with Vatican citizenship.[78][79]\\r\\nOn 22 February 2011, Pope Benedict XVI promulgated a new \\"Law concerning citizenship, residency and access\\" to Vatican City, which became effective on 1 March. It replaced the 1929 \\"Law concerning citizenship and residence\\".[80] There are 16 articles in the new law, whereas the old law had 33 articles.[79] It updated the old law by incorporating changes made after 1929, such as the 1940 granting of Vatican City citizenship, durante munere, to the members of the Holy See's diplomatic service.[81] It also created a new category, that of official Vatican \\"residents\\", i.e., people living in Vatican City; these are not necessarily Vatican citizens.[79]\\r\\nOn 1 March 2011, only 220 of the over 800 people living in Vatican City were citizens. There was a total of 572 Vatican citizens, of whom 352 were not residents, mainly apostolic nuncios and diplomatic staff.[79]\\r\\nAs of 2013[update], there were about 30 female citizens.[82]\\r\\nVatican City is home to some of the most famous art in the world. St. Peter's Basilica, whose successive architects include Bramante, Michelangelo, Giacomo della Porta, Maderno and Bernini, is a renowned work of Renaissance architecture. The Sistine Chapel is famous for its frescos, which include works by Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Botticelli as well as the ceiling and Last Judgment by Michelangelo. Artists who decorated the interiors of the Vatican include Raphael and Fra Angelico.\\r\\nThe Vatican Apostolic Library and the collections of the Vatican Museums are of the highest historical, scientific and cultural importance. In 1984, the Vatican was added by UNESCO to the List of World Heritage Sites; it is the only one to consist of an entire state.[83] Furthermore, it is the only site to date registered with the UNESCO as a centre containing monuments in the \\"International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection\\" according to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.[83]\\r\\nThere is a football championship, called the Vatican City Championship, with eight teams, including, for example, the Swiss Guard's FC Guardia and police and museum guard teams.[85]\\r\\nVatican City has a reasonably well-developed transport network considering its size (consisting mostly of a piazza and walkways). A state that is 1.05 kilometres (0.65 miles) long and 0.85 kilometres (0.53 miles) wide,[86] it has a small transportation system with no airports or highways. The only aviation facility in Vatican City is the Vatican City Heliport. Vatican City is one of the few independent countries without an airport, and is served by the airports that serve the city of Rome, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport, and to a lesser extent Ciampino Airport.[87]\\r\\nThere is a standard gauge railway, mainly used to transport freight, connected to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station by an 852-metre-long (932?yd) spur, 300 metres (330?yd) of which is within Vatican territory.[87] Pope John XXIII was the first Pope to make use of the railway; Pope John Paul II rarely used it.[87]\\r\\nThe closest metro station is Ottaviano ÿ San Pietro ÿ Musei Vaticani.[88]\\r\\nThe City is served by an independent, modern telephone system named the Vatican Telephone Service,[89] and a postal system that started operating on 13 February 1929. On 1 August, the state started to release its own postal stamps, under the authority of the Philatelic and Numismatic Office of the Vatican City State.[90] The City's postal service is sometimes said to be \\"the best in the world\\",[91] and faster than the postal service in Rome.[91]\\r\\nThe Vatican also controls its own Internet TLD, which is registered as (.va). Broadband service is widely provided within Vatican City. Vatican City has also been given a radio ITU prefix, HV, and this is sometimes used by amateur radio operators.\\r\\nVatican Radio, which was organized by Guglielmo Marconi, broadcasts on short-wave, medium-wave and FM frequencies and on the Internet.[92] Its main transmission antennae are located in Italian territory, and exceed Italian environmental protection levels of emission. For this reason, the Vatican Radio has been sued. Television services are provided through another entity, the Vatican Television Center.[93]\\r\\nL'Osservatore Romano is the multilingual semi-official newspaper of the Holy See. It is published by a private corporation under the direction of Roman Catholic laymen, but reports on official information. However, the official texts of documents are in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis, the official gazette of the Holy See, which has an appendix for documents of the Vatican City State.\\r\\nVatican Radio, the Vatican Television Center, and L'Osservatore Romano are organs not of the Vatican State but of the Holy See, and are listed as such in the Annuario Pontificio, which places them in the section \\"Institutions linked with the Holy See\\", ahead of the sections on the Holy See's diplomatic service abroad and the Diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See, after which is placed the section on the State of Vatican City.\\r\\nIn 2008, the Vatican began an \\"ecological island\\" for renewable waste and has continued the initiative throughout the papacy of Francis.\\r\\nCrime in Vatican City consists largely of purse snatching, pickpocketing and shoplifting by outsiders.[94] The tourist foot-traffic in St. Peter's Square is one of the main locations for pickpockets in Vatican City.[95] If crimes are committed in Saint Peter's Square, the perpetrators may be arrested and tried by the Italian authorities, since that area is normally patrolled by Italian police.[96]\\r\\nUnder the terms of article 22 of the Lateran Treaty,[97] Italy will, at the request of the Holy See, punish individuals for crimes committed within Vatican City and will itself proceed against the person who committed the offense, if that person takes refuge in Italian territory. Persons accused of crimes recognized as such both in Italy and in Vatican City that are committed in Italian territory will be handed over to the Italian authorities if they take refuge in Vatican City or in buildings that enjoy immunity under the treaty.[97][98]\\r\\nVatican City has no prison system, apart from a few detention cells for pre-trial detention.[99] People convicted of committing crimes in the Vatican serve terms in Italian prisons (Polizia Penitenziaria), with costs covered by the Vatican.[100]","input":"When did vatican city become its own country?"},{"output":"July 1892","context":"The Criminal Code[1] (French: Code criminel[2]) is a law that codifies most criminal offences and procedures in Canada. Its official long title is \\"An Act respecting the criminal law\\" (R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, as amended). Section 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 establishes the sole jurisdiction of Parliament over criminal law in Canada.\\r\\nThe Criminal Code contains some defences, but most are part of the common law rather than statute. Important Canadian criminal laws not forming part of the code include the Firearms Act, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the Canada Evidence Act, the Food and Drugs Act, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and the Contraventions Act.\\r\\nOne of the conveniences of the criminal code was that it constituted the principle that no person would be able to be convicted of a crime unless otherwise specifically outlined and stated in a statute. This legal document has played a major part in Canada's history and has also helped form other legal acts and laws, For example the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. [3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Criminal Code was first enacted in July 1892 after being a pet project of the Minister of Justice of the time, Sir John Sparrow David Thompson.[4] It was based on a drafted code called \\"the Stephen Code\\", written by Sir James Fitzjames Stephen as part of a Royal Commission in England in 1879, and influenced by the writings of Canadian Jurist George Burbidge. Canada's criminal code followed much of England's 1878 bill. However Canada wanted to have a more precise legal document that outlined all criminal laws.\\r\\nThe main body of the Criminal Code is divided into the following major components:\\r\\nThe main body is followed by schedules (i.e. appendices) relating to some of the above-mentioned Parts and a series of prescribed legal forms, such as Form 5 which sets out the proper legal wording for a search warrant.\\r\\nThe Criminal Code has been revised numerous times, including the consolidation of federal statutes that occurred during 1955 and 1985. One of the major revisions of the code occurred with the passage of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69, whose provisions included, among other things, the decriminalization of homosexual acts between consenting adults, the legalization of abortion, contraception and lotteries, new gun ownership restrictions as well as the authorization of breathalyzer tests on suspected drunk drivers.\\r\\nThe criminal code has changed as society has advanced. The introduction of technology has pushed for new laws to be passed. For example laws against the use of cellphones while driving as well as cyber crimes. The Criminal Code, in its present form, is part of the 1985 consolidated statutes with further major amendments since that year.\\r\\nBy means of legal challenges under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, numerous sections of the Criminal Code have been struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada as infringing on a constitutional right as defined in this 1982 constitutional document. The offending sections are usually removed altogether, or heavily qualified, when new laws are passed. In other instances, such as Section 287 regarding qualified abortions, the Canadian Parliament does not repeal (i.e. erase) the infringing section from the text of the Criminal Code and so the remaining text is simply null, void and unenforceable by the police and the criminal justice system.\\r\\nBefore the terrorist attack against the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the Criminal Code contained almost no specific reference to terrorism. After that event, the Canadian Parliament passed Bill C-36, the Anti-terrorism Act (S.C. 2001, c.41) which received royal assent on December 18, 2001. This statute added an entire new component to the Criminal Code. Falling between Part II and Part III is now Part II.1 - Terrorism, which contains numerous provisions regarding the financing of terrorism, the establishment of a list of terrorist entities, the freezing of property, the forfeiture of property, and participating, facilitating, instructing and harbouring of terrorism.\\r\\nYoung persons, ages 12 to 17, may be charged with offences under the Criminal Code, are prosecuted in much the same way as adults under the Criminal Code, and are subject to the same laws of evidence. However, sentencing, procedure and evidence law are modified to some extent by the Youth Criminal Justice Act. Depending on the severity of the crime, the Crown Prosecutor may argue for a youth to receive an adult sentence after the age of 14. In this case, the judge will make the decision. Under the Young Offenders Act, the youth would be transferred to adult court in order to receive an adult sentence. This is no longer the case. Under the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) the young person would receive the adult sentence in youth court.[5][6][NB 1]\\r\\nIf the young person is given an adult custody sentence, he/she will attend a youth facility until becoming an adult at the age of 18.

Like the Sierra Nevada mountains themselves, the pass has a steep approach from the east and a gradual approach from the west.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pass has been used by the California Trail, First Transcontinental Railroad, Overland Route, Lincoln Highway (later U.S. Route 40 and still later Donner Pass Road), as well as indirectly by Interstate 80.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday the area is home to a thriving recreational community with several alpine lakes and ski resorts (Donner Ski Ranch, Boreal, and Sugar Bowl). The permanent communities in the area include Kingvale and Soda Springs, as well as the larger community below the pass surrounding Donner Lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo reach California from the East, pioneers had to get their wagons over the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  In 1844 the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party followed the Truckee River into the mountains.  At the head of what is now called Donner Lake, they found a low notch in the mountains and became the first overland settlers to use the pass.[3]\\r\\nThe pass was named after a later group of California-bound settlers.  In early November 1846 the Donner Party found the route blocked by snow and was forced to spend the winter on the east side of the mountains.  Of the 81 settlers, only 45 survived to reach California;[4] some of them resorting to cannibalism to survive.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 13, 1952, 222 passengers and crew aboard a train became stranded about 17 miles (27?km) west of Donner Pass at Yuba Pass, on Track #1 adjacent to Tunnel 35 (on Track #2), at about MP 176.5. Southern Pacific Railroad's passenger train City of San Francisco was en route westbound through the gap when a blizzard dumped so much snow the train was unable to move forward or reverse. The passengers and crew were stranded for three days until the nearby highway could be plowed sufficiently for a caravan of automobiles to carry them the few miles to Nyack Lodge.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1868, the Sierra Nevada were finally \\"conquered\\" by the Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR), after almost five years of sustained construction effort, with the successful completion at Donner Pass of its 1,659-foot (506 m) Tunnel #6[8] and associated grade, thus permitting the establishment of commercial transportation en masse of passengers and freight over the Sierra for the first time. Following a route first surveyed and proposed by CPRR's original Chief Engineer, Theodore D. Judah (1826ÿ1863), the construction of the four tunnels, several miles of snowsheds and two \\"Chinese Walls\\"[9] necessary to breach Donner Summit constituted the most difficult engineering and construction challenge of the original Sacramento-Ogden CPRR route.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipally designed and built under the personal, often on-site direction of CPRR's Chief Assistant Engineer, Lewis M. Clement (1837ÿ1914),[10] the original (Track 1) summit grade remained in daily use from June 18, 1868, when the first CPRR passenger train ran through the Summit Tunnel, until 1993 when the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) (which operated the CPRR-built Oakland-Ogden line until its 1996 merger with the Union Pacific Railroad (UP)) abandoned the 6.7 mile (10.7?km) section of Track #1 over the summit running between the Norden complex (Shed 26, MP 192.1) and the covered crossovers in Shed #47 (MP 198.8), one mile east of the old flyover at Eder. All traffic has since operated over the Track #2 grade crossing the summit 1 mile (1.6?km) south of Donner Pass through the 10,322-foot (3,146?m)-long Tunnel #41 running under Mount Judah between Soda Springs and Eder. SP made this change because the railroad considered Track 2 and Tunnel 41 (which was opened in 1925 when the summit section of the grade was finally double tracked) to be easier and less expensive to maintain during in the harsh Sierra winters than the Track 1 tunnels and snow sheds over the summit.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conjunction with major ongoing upgrades and expansions being made to the Port of Oakland in order to better accommodate the rapidly growing North American trade with Asia and the Pacific, the cooperation of UP, the Port's principal rail partner, has been sought to \\"construct a second track and raise tunnel clearances over Donner Pass for container trains linking California with the rest of the country.\\"[12] This would likely require either a new parallel tunnel next to Tunnel 41 or the replacement of the summit section of Track 1 between the Norden complex and Shed 47; either would increase capacity and effectively eliminate delays currently caused by having to run all east and west bound traffic between Norden and Shed 47 over a single track. (To fully eliminate bottleneck delays the now single track 7.1-mile (11.4?km) section between Switch 9 (MP 171.9) at Emigrant Gap and Shed 10 (MP 179.0) west of Cisco would likely also have to be restored to double track.) Improvements were completed on the Sierra grade in November 2009, including increasing 18,000 lineal feet of tunnel clearances in 15 restricted tunnels between Rocklin and Truckee and upgrading 30 miles of signals to CTC, although the original Donner Pass grade (Track 1) was not restored. Since then trains of full-height (20?ft 2?inch) double-stack container cars have run over Donner Pass; some tunnels on Track 2 between Bowman and Colfax were not enlarged, so stack trains in both directions must use the older, tunnel-free Track 1 between those points.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lincoln Highway, the first road across America, crosses Donner Pass. Interstate 80 was built through this area in the early 1960s. I-80 generally parallels the route of US?40 through the Sierra Nevada, but it crosses the Sierra crest at the Euer Saddle, about 2 miles (3.2?km) north of Donner Pass. Euer Saddle is referred to by CalTrans as \\"Donner Summit\\" at 7,240 feet (2,210?m) (392024N 1202038W? / ?39.339872N 120.343958W? / 39.339872; -120.343958? (Donner Summit)), located on the south side of I-80 at the Castle Peak exit beyond Boreal Inn.[14] Donner Summit is about 150 feet (46?m) higher than Donner Pass, but is wider and has a gentler approach that aided construction to Interstate Highway standards, which do not allow the sharp curves used by the Donner Pass Road. The grade is 3-6% for 30 miles.[15] The 1920s highway has been preserved as a scenic alternative to I-80.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinter weather at Donner Pass can be brutal. Precipitation averages 51.6 inches (1,310?mm) per year, much of which falls as snow.[16]  At an average of 411.5 inches (10.45?m) per year, Donner Pass is one of the snowiest places in the contiguous United States. Four times since 1880 total snowfall at Donner Summit has exceeded 775 inches (19.69?m) and topped 800 inches (20.32?m) in both 1938 and 1952.[17] To take advantage of the heavy snows, the Boreal Ski Resort was built to the north. Ski resorts in the Lake Tahoe area report an average of 300 to 500 inches (7.62 to 12.70?m) of snowfall per season. Winds in the pass can also become extreme and wind gusts in  excess of 100 miles per hour (160?km/h) are common during winter storms.  Winter temperatures in the area drop below 0?F or ?17.8?C several times each year; the all-time record low for California of ?45?F (?42.8?C) was recorded at Boca (east of Truckee) in January 1937.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winter of 1846ÿ47 was especially severe, and this is generally cited as the single most important factor in the disaster of the Donner Party.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummer and winter offer a wide variety of recreation and lifestyle sports such as backpacking, alpine and cross-country skiing, rock and ice climbing.  The region was made world-famous during the early 1990s with snowboarding films by Fall Line Films (FLF) and Standard Films, for its easy access to frontcountry and backcountry terrain.   However, its fame and quick access from Old Highway 40 or nearby Sugar Bowl Ski Resort has led to a large number of avalanche fatalities, including professional snowboarder Jamil Khan.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbert Bierstadt's painting View of Donner Lake (1871ÿ72).[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Donner Pass is featured in the History Channel special episode, America: The Story of Us: \\"Westward\\".\\r\\nIt is featured in the National Geographic Channel series Hell on the Highway, series focuses on the towing and recovery companies working the region.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nPowell, Margie Powell (2003).

Opened on October 1, 1971, the resort is owned and operated by Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products, a division of The Walt Disney Company. It was initially operated by Walt Disney World Company. The property covers nearly 25,000 acres (39?sq?mi; 101?km2),[2] featuring four theme parks, two water parks, twenty-seven themed resort hotels, nine non-Disney hotels, several golf courses, a camping resort, and other entertainment venues, including the outdoor shopping center Disney Springs.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesigned to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955, the complex was developed by Walt Disney in the 1960s. \\"The Florida Project\\", as it was known, was intended to present a distinct vision with its own diverse set of attractions. Walt Disney's original plans also called for the inclusion of an \\"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\\" (EPCOT), a planned community intended to serve as a test bed for new city living innovations. After extensive lobbying, the government of Florida created the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special government district that essentially gave The Walt Disney Company the standard powers and autonomy of an incorporated city. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during construction of the complex. Without Disney spearheading the construction, the company created a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning experimental concepts for a planned community. Magic Kingdom was the first theme park to open in the complex, in 1971, followed by Epcot in 1982, Disney's Hollywood Studios in 1989, and the most recent, Disney's Animal Kingdom in 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Walt Disney World is the most visited vacation resort in the world, with an average annual attendance of over 52 million.[3] The resort is the flagship destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise, and has become a popular staple in American culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1959, Walt Disney Productions began looking for land to house a second resort to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955. Market surveys at the time revealed that only 5% of Disneyland's visitors came from east of the Mississippi River, where 75% of the population of the United States lived. Additionally, Walt Disney disliked the businesses that had sprung up around Disneyland and wanted more control over a larger area of land in the next project.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney flew over a potential site in Orlando, Florida ÿ one of many ÿ in November 1963. After witnessing the well-developed network of roads and taking the planned construction of both Interstate 4 and Florida's Turnpike into account, with McCoy Air Force Base (later Orlando International Airport) to the east, Disney selected a centrally-located site near Bay Lake.[5] To avoid a burst of land speculation, Walt Disney World Company used various dummy corporations to acquire 30,500 acres (48?sq?mi; 123?km2) of land.[5] In May 1965, some of these major land transactions were recorded a few miles southwest of Orlando in Osceola County. In addition, two large tracts totaling $1.5 million were sold, and smaller tracts of flatlands and cattle pastures were purchased by exotically-named companies such as the \\"Ayefour Corporation\\", \\"Latin-American Development and Management Corporation\\" and the \\"Reedy Creek Ranch Corporation\\". Some are now memorialized on a window above Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom. The smaller parcels of land acquired were called \\"outs\\". They were  5-acre (2?ha) lots platted in 1912 by the Munger Land Company and sold to investors. Most of the owners in the 1960s were happy to get rid of the land, which was mostly swamp at the time. Another issue was the mineral rights to the land, which were owned by Tufts University. Without the transfer of these rights, Tufts could come in at any time and demand the removal of buildings to obtain minerals. Eventually, Disney's team negotiated a deal with Tufts to buy the mineral rights for $15,000.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking strictly in secrecy, real estate agents unaware of their client's identity began making offers to landowners in April 1964 in parts of southwest Orange and northwest Osceola counties. The agents were careful not to reveal the extent of their intentions, and they were able to negotiate numerous land contracts with some including large tracts of land for as little as $100 an acre.[7] With the understanding that the recording of the first deeds would trigger intense public scrutiny, Disney delayed the filing of paperwork until a large portion of the land was under contract.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly rumors and speculation about the land purchases assumed possible development by NASA in support of the nearby Kennedy Space Center, as well as references to other famous investors such as Ford, the Rockefellers, and Howard Hughes.[8] An Orlando Sentinel news article published weeks later on May 20, 1965, acknowledged a popular rumor that Disney was building an \\"East Coast\\" version of Disneyland. However, the publication denied its accuracy based on an earlier interview with Disney at Kennedy Space Center, in which he claimed a $50 million investment was in the works for Disneyland, and that he had no interest in building a new park.[8] In October 1965, editor Emily Bavar from the Sentinel visited Disneyland during the park's 10th-anniversary celebration. In an interview with Disney, she asked him if he was behind recent land purchases in Central Florida; Bavar later described that Disney \\"looked like I had thrown a bucket of water in his face\\" before denying the story.[8] His reaction, combined with other research obtained during her Anaheim visit, led Bavar to author a story on October 21, 1965, where she predicted that Disney was building a second theme park in Florida.[8] Three days later after gathering more information from various sources, the Sentinel published another article headlined, \\"We Say: 'Mystery Industry' Is Disney\\".[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney had originally planned to publicly reveal Disney World on November 15, 1965, but in light of the Sentinel story, Disney asked Florida Governor Haydon Burns to confirm the story on October 25. His announcement called the new theme park \\"the greatest attraction in the history of Florida\\".[8] The official reveal was kept on the previously-planned November 15 date, and Disney joined Burns in Orlando for the event.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney died from circulatory collapse caused by lung cancer on December 15, 1966, before his vision was realized. His brother and business partner, Roy O. Disney, postponed his retirement to oversee construction of the resort's first phase.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a press conference at the Park Theatres in Winter Park, Florida. The role of EPCOT was emphasized in the film that was played. After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the Reedy Creek Improvement District with two cities inside it, Bay Lake and Reedy Creek, now Lake Buena Vista. In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be property taxes and elevator inspections.[4] The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967.[9] The Supreme Court of Florida then ruled in 1968 that the district was allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds for public projects within the district, despite the sole beneficiary being Walt Disney Productions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe district soon began construction of drainage canals, and Disney built the first roads and the Magic Kingdom. The Contemporary Resort Hotel and Polynesian Village were also completed in time for the park's opening on October 1, 1971.[10][11] The Palm and Magnolia golf courses near Magic Kingdom had opened a few weeks before, while Fort Wilderness opened a month later. 24 days after the park opened, Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as \\"Walt Disney World\\" in his brother's honor. In his own words: \\"Everyone has heard of Ford cars. But have they all heard of Henry Ford, who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here.\\" After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, Lillian, what she thought of Walt Disney World. According to biographer Bob Thomas, she responded, \\"I think Walt would have approved.\\" Roy Disney died at age 78 on December 20, 1971, less than three months after the property opened.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmission prices in 1971 were $3.50 for adults, $2.50 for juniors under age 18, and one dollar for children under twelve.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of Walt Disney's plans for his Progress City were abandoned after his death and after the company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city. The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, EPCOT Center, which opened in 1982 (renamed EPCOT in 1996). While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, the park is closer to a world's fair than a \\"community of tomorrow\\". One of EPCOT's main attractions is their world's showcase which highlights 11 countries across the globe. Some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of EPCOT would instead be integrated into the community of Celebration much later. The resort's third theme park, Disney-MGM Studios (renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2008), opened in 1989 and is inspired by show business. The resort's fourth theme park, Disney's Animal Kingdom, opened in 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Kalogridis was named president of the resort in December 2012, replacing Meg Crofton, who had overseen the site since 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 21, 2016, the resort's management structure was changed, with general managers within a theme park being in charge of an area or land, instead of on a functional basis as previously. Theme parks have already had a vice-president overseeing them. Disney Springs and Disney Sports were also affected. Now hotel general managers manage a single hotel instead of some managing multiple hotels.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 18, 2017, it was announced that resort visitors could bring dogs to Disney's Yacht Club Resort, Disney Port Orleans Resort ÿ Riverside, Disney's Art of Animation Resort and Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resort has a number of expansion projects planned or ongoing, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Florida resort is not within Orlando city limits but is southwest of Downtown Orlando. Much of the resort is in southwestern Orange County, with the remainder in adjacent Osceola County. The property includes the cities of Lake Buena Vista and Bay Lake which are governed by the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The site is accessible from Central Florida's Interstate 4 via Exits 62B (World Drive), 64B (US 192 West), 65B (Osceola Parkway West), 67B (SR 536 West), and 68 (SR 535 North), and Exit 8 on SR 429, the Western Expressway. At its founding, the resort occupied approximately 30,500 acres (48?sq?mi; 123?km2). Portions of the property have since been sold or de-annexed, including land now occupied by the Disney-built community of Celebration.  Now the resort occupies nearly 25,000 acres (39?sq?mi; 101?km2).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nCinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom\\r\\n\\r\\nSpaceship Earth at Epcot\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chinese Theatre at Disney's Hollywood Studios\\r\\n\\r\\nTree of Life at Disney's Animal Kingdom\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney's property includes four golf courses. The three 18-hole golf courses are Disney's Palm (4.5 stars), Disney's Magnolia (4 stars), and Disney's Lake Buena Vista (4 stars). There is also a nine-hole walking course (no electric carts allowed) called Oak Trail, designed for young golfers. The Magnolia and Palm courses played home to the PGA Tour's Children's Miracle Network Hospitals Classic. Arnold Palmer Golf Management manages the Disney golf courses.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, there are two themed miniature golf complexes, each with two courses, Fantasia Gardens and Winter Summerland.[23] The two courses at Fantasia Gardens are Fantasia Garden and Fantasia Fairways. The Garden course is a traditional miniature-style course based on the \\"Fantasia\\" movies with musical holes, water fountains and characters. Fantasia Fairways is a traditional golf course on miniature scale having water hazards and sand traps.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two courses at Winter Summerland are Summer and Winter, both themed around Santa. Summer is the more challenging of the two 18-hole courses.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the thirty-four resorts and hotels on the Walt Disney World property, twenty-eight are owned and operated by Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products. These are classified into four categories? Deluxe, Moderate, Value, and Disney Vacation Club Villas? and are located in one of five resort areas: the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Wide World of Sports, Animal Kingdom, or Disney Springs resort areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile all of the Deluxe resort hotels have achieved an AAA Four Diamond rating, Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa is considered the highest tier flagship luxury resort on the Walt Disney World Resort complex.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, Walt Disney World's flagship resort\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney's Polynesian Resort, a deluxe level resort\\r\\n\\r\\nCaribbean Beach Resort, the first moderate resort at Walt Disney World\\r\\n\\r\\nFort Wilderness, Disney's campground and cabin resort\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney's All Star Movies Resort, one of five value resorts\\r\\n\\r\\nShades of Green Resort, owned and operated by the United States Military\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Walt Disney World Dolphin\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Walt Disney World Swan\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hilton at Walt Disney World, located at Hotel Plaza Boulevard\\r\\n\\r\\nGuests with a Disney Resort reservation (excluding the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin) that arrive at Orlando International Airport can be transported to their resort from the airport using the complimentary Disney Magical Express service, which is operated by Mears Destination Services. Guests can also have their bags picked up and transported to their resort for them through a contract with BAGS Incorporated on participating airlines. Many resorts feature Airline Check-in counters for guests returning to the airport. Here their bags will be checked all the way through to their final destination and they can also have boarding passes printed for them. Some participating airlines are Delta, United, American, Jet Blue, Southwest and Alaska Airlines.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, the resort's four theme parks all ranked in the top 8 on the list of the 25 most visited theme parks in the world; (1st) Magic Kingdom - 19,332,000 visitors, (6th) Epcot - 11,454,000 visitors, (7th) Disney's Animal Kingdom - 10,402,000 visitors, and (8th) Disney's Hollywood Studios - 10,312,000 visitors.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Walt Disney World Resort is serviced by Disney Transport, a complimentary mass transportation system allowing guest access across the property. The Walt Disney World Monorail System provides free transportation at Walt Disney World. Guests can aboard the monorail from select on property resorts including The Grand Floridian and The Polynesian. The system operates on three routes that interconnect at the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC), adjacent to the Magic Kingdom's parking lot. A fleet of Disney-operated buses on property, branded Disney Transport, is also complimentary for guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney Transport also operates a fleet of watercraft, ranging in size from water taxis, up to the ferries that connect the Magic Kingdom to the Transportation and Ticket Center. Disney Transport is also responsible for maintaining the fleet of parking lot trams that are used for shuttling visitors between the various theme park parking lots and their respective main entrances.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 31, 2017, Walt Disney World Resort partnered with Lyft to offer a different type of transportation service available to anyone that is within the Walt Disney World Resort limits.  This service is called the Minnie Van Service.  These Minnie Vans have the classic Minnie Mouse red and white polka dot design around the car and are owned and operated by Walt Disney World Resort.  Each Minnie Van can accommodate up to 6 people and have 2 carseats.  To take advantage of this service, all that is needed is using the Lyft app within the resort limits, requesting a ride to a resort destination and waiting for a Disney cast member to drive up with the Minnie Van.  Rides cost $25 and operate between 6:30am to 12:30am daily. [42] [43]\\r\\n\\r\\nA gondola lift system, dubbed Disney Skyliner, is under construction as of June 2018.  The system's three lines will connect Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot with four resort hotels.[19]  Completion is expected some time in 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney World previously had its own small airport:  the Walt Disney World Airport which was also known as the Lake Buena Vista STOLport.  During the early 1970s, scheduled passenger service was operated by Shawnee Airlines with small de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter commuter turboprops which had STOL (short take off and landing) capabilities on flights to Tampa and Orlando.[44][45]  The airport is no longer in operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Magic Kingdom opened in 1971, the site employed about 5,500 \\"cast members\\".[46] Today, Walt Disney World employs more than 74,000 cast members,[47] spending more than $1.2 billion on payroll and $474 million on benefits each year. The largest single-site employer in the United States,[48][49] Walt Disney World has more than 3,700 job classifications. The resort also sponsors and operates the Walt Disney World College Program, an internship program that offers American college students (CP's) the opportunity to live about 15 miles (24?km) off-site in four Disney-owned apartment complexes and work at the resort, and thereby provides much of the theme park and resort \\"front line\\" cast members. There is also the Walt Disney World International College Program, an internship program that offers international college students (ICP's) from all over the world the same opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney World's corporate culture uses jargon based on theatrical terminology.[50][51]  For example, park visitors are always \\"guests\\", employees are called \\"cast members\\", rides are \\"attractions\\" or \\"adventures\\", cast members costumed as famous Disney characters in a way that does not cover their faces are known as \\"face characters\\", jobs are \\"roles\\", and public and nonpublic areas are respectively labeled \\"onstage\\" and \\"backstage\\".[50][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney's security personnel are generally dressed in typical security guard uniforms, though some of the personnel are dressed as tourists in plain clothes. Since September 11, 2001, uniformed security has been stationed just outside each Disney park in Florida to search guests' bags as they enter the parks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land where Walt Disney World resides is part of the Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID), a governing jurisdiction created in 1967 by the State of Florida at the request of Disney.  RCID provides 911 services, fire, environmental protection, building code enforcement, utilities and road maintenance but does not provide law enforcement services.  The approximately 800 security staff are instead considered employees of the Walt Disney Company.  Arrests and citations are issued by the Florida Highway Patrol along with the Orange County and Osceola County sheriffs deputies who patrol the roads.  Disney security does maintain a fleet of security vans equipped with flares, traffic cones, and chalk commonly used by police officers. These security personnel are charged with traffic control by the RCID and may only issue personnel violation notices to Disney and RCID employees, not the general public.[52][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the appearance of the uniformed security personnel, they are not considered a legal law enforcement agency. Disney and The Reedy Creek Improvement District were sued for access to Disney Security records by Bob and Kathy Sipkema following the death of their son at the resort in 1994. The court characterized Disney security as a \\"night watchman\\" service not a law enforcement agency and was not subject to Florida's open records laws.  An appeals court later upheld the lower court's ruling.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2015, Disney confirmed the addition of randomized secondary screenings and dogs trained to detect body-worn explosives within parks, in addition to metal detectors at entrances. It has also increased the number of uniformed security personnel at Walt Disney World and Disneyland properties.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney Security personnel in Florida have investigated traffic accidents and issued accident reports. The forms used by Disney Security may be confused with official, government forms by some.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Orange County Sheriff maintains an office on Disney property, but this is primarily to process guests accused of shoplifting by Disney security personnel.[56]","input":"What was made first disneyland or disney world?"},{"output":"13 April, 1919","context":"The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre, took place on 13 April, 1919 when a crowd of non-violent protesters, along with Baishakhi pilgrims, who had gathered in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, were fired upon by troops of the British Indian Army under the command of Colonel Reginald Dyer. The civilians, in the majority Sikhs, had assembled to participate in the annual Baisakhi celebrations, a religious and cultural festival for Punjabi people and also to condemn the arrest and deportation of two national leaders, Satya Pal and Dr Saifuddin Kitchlew. Coming from outside the city, they may have been unaware of the imposition of martial law.\\r\\nThe Jallianwalla Bagh is a public garden of 6?to 7 acres (28,000?m2), walled on all sides with five entrances.[2] To enter, troops first blocked the entry by a tank and locked the exit. On Dyer's orders, his troops fired on the crowd for ten minutes, directing their bullets largely towards the few open gates through which people were trying to flee. The British government released figures stating 379 dead and 1,200 wounded.[1][3] Other sources place the number of dead at well over 1,000.[4] This \\"brutality stunned the entire nation\\",[5] resulting in a \\"wrenching loss of faith\\" of the general public in the intentions of the UK.[6] The ineffective inquiry and the initial accolades for Dyer by the House of Lords fuelled widespread anger, leading to the Non-cooperation Movement of 1920ÿ22.[7]\\r\\nOn Sunday, 13?April 1919, Dyer was convinced of a major insurrection and he banned all meetings; however this notice was not widely disseminated. That was the day of Baisakhi, the main Sikh festival, and many villagers had gathered in the Bagh. On hearing that a meeting had assembled at Jallianwala Bagh, Dyer went with Sikh, Gurkha, Baluchi, Rajput troops from 2-9th Gurkhas, the 54th Sikhs and the 59th Sind Rifles[8] to a raised bank and ordered them to shoot at the crowd. Dyer continued the firing for about ten minutes, until the ammunition supply was almost exhausted. Dyer stated that 1,650 rounds had been fired, a number apparently derived by counting empty cartridge cases picked up by the troops.[9] Official British Indian sources gave a figure of 379 identified dead,[3] with approximately 1,100 wounded. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.[4]\\r\\nDyer was initially lauded by conservative forces in the empire, but in July 1920 he was censured and forced to retire by the House of Commons.[10] He became a celebrated hero in the UK among most of the people connected to the British Raj,[11] for example, the House of Lords,[12] but unpopular in the House of Commons, which voted against Dyer[clarification needed] twice.[13] The massacre caused a re-evaluation of the army's role, in which the new policy became minimum force. The army was retrained and developed less violent tactics for crowd control.[14] Some historians consider the episode a decisive step towards the end of British rule in India.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War I, British India contributed to the British war effort by providing men and resources. Millions of Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the Indian administration and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. However, Bengal and Punjab remained sources of anticolonial activities. Revolutionary attacks in Bengal, associated increasingly with disturbances in Punjab, were significant enough to nearly paralyse the regional administration.[16][17] Of these, a pan-Indian mutiny in the British Indian Army planned for February 1915 was the most prominent amongst a number of plots formulated between 1914 and 1917 by Indian nationalists in India, the United States and Germany. The planned February mutiny was ultimately thwarted when British intelligence infiltrated the Ghadarite movement, arresting key figures. Mutinies in smaller units and garrisons within India were also crushed. In the scenario of the British war effort and the threat from the militant movement in India, the Defence of India Act 1915 was passed limiting civil and political liberties. Michael O'Dwyer, then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, was one of the strongest proponents of the act, in no small part due to the Ghadarite threat in the province.[18]\\r\\nThe costs of the protracted war in money and manpower were great. High casualty rates in the war, increasing inflation after the end, compounded by heavy taxation, the deadly 1918 flu pandemic, and the disruption of trade during the war escalated human suffering in India. The pre-war Indian nationalist sentiment was revived as moderate and extremist groups of the Indian National Congress ended their differences to unify. In 1916, the Congress succeeded in establishing the Lucknow Pact, a temporary alliance with the All-India Muslim League. British political concessions and Whitehall's India Policy after World War I began to change, with the passage of MontaguÿChelmsford Reforms, which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917.[19][20][21] However, this was deemed insufficient in reforms by the Indian political movement. Mahatma Gandhi, recently returned to India, began emerging as an increasingly charismatic leader under whose leadership civil disobedience movements grew rapidly as an expression of political unrest. The recently crushed Ghadar conspiracy, the presence of Mahendra Pratap's Kabul mission in Afghanistan (with possible links to then nascent Bolshevik Russia), and a still-active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal (as well as worsening civil unrest throughout India) led to the appointment of a Sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sidney Rowlatt, an English judge. It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal. On the recommendations of the committee, the Rowlatt Act, an extension of the Defence of India Act 1915, was enforced in India to limit civil liberties.[18][22][23][24][25]\\r\\nThe passage of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 precipitated large scale political unrest throughout India. Ominously, in 1919, the Third Anglo-Afghan War began in the wake of Amir Habibullah's assassination and institution of Amanullah in a system strongly influenced by the political figures courted by Kabul mission during the world war. As a reaction to Rowlatt act Muhammad Ali Jinnah resigned from his Bombay seat, writing to viceroy a letter, \\"I, therefor, as a protest against the passing of the Bill and the manner in which it was passed tender my resignation..................a government that passes or sanctions such a law in times of peace forfeits its claim to be called a civilized Government\\".[26] In India Gandhi's call for protest against the Rowlatt Act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests. The situation especially in Punjab was deteriorating rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph and communication systems. The movement was at its peak before the end of the first week of April, with some recording that \\"practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets, the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20,000.\\"[27] In Amritsar, over 5,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh. This situation deteriorated perceptibly over the next few days. Michael O'Dwyer is said to have been of the firm belief that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated uprising around May, on the lines of the 1857 revolt, at a time when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer. The Amritsar massacre, as well as responses preceding and succeeding it, was the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy.[28]\\r\\nMany officers in the Indian army believed revolt was possible, and they prepared for the worst. In Amritsar, more than 15,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh. The British Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, Michael O'Dwyer, is said to have believed that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated revolt around May, at a time when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer. The Amritsar massacre, as well as responses preceding and succeeding it, have been described by some historians as the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy.[28] James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tense situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre.[29]\\r\\nOn 10 April 1919, there was a protest at the residence of the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar, a city in Punjab, a large province in the northwestern part of India. The demonstration was to demand the release of two popular leaders of the Indian Independence Movement, Satya Pal and Saifuddin Kitchlew, who had been earlier arrested by the government and moved to a secret location. Both were proponents of the Satyagraha movement led by Gandhi. A military picket shot at the crowd, killing several protesters and setting off a series of violent events. Later the same day, several banks and other government buildings, including the Town Hall and the railway station, were attacked and set on fire. The violence continued to escalate, culminating in the deaths of at least five Europeans, including government employees and civilians. There was retaliatory shooting at crowds from the military several times during the day, and between eight and twenty people were killed.\\r\\nOn 11 April, Miss Marcella Sherwood, an English missionary, fearing for the safety of her pupils, was on her way to shut the schools and send the roughly 600 Indian children home.[12][30] While cycling through a narrow street called the Kucha Kurrichhan, she was caught by a mob, pulled to the ground by her hair, stripped naked, beaten, kicked, and left for dead. She was rescued by some local Indians, including the father of one of her pupils, who hid her from the mob and then smuggled her to the safety of Gobindgarh fort.[30][31] After visiting Sherwood on 19 April, the Raj's local commander, Colonel Dyer, issued an order requiring every Indian man using that street to crawl its length on his hands and knees.[12][32] Colonel Dyer later explained to a British inspector: \\"Some Indians crawl face downwards in front of their gods. I wanted them to know that a British woman is as sacred as a Hindu god and therefore they have to crawl in front of her, too.\\"[33] He also authorised the indiscriminate, public whipping of locals who came within lathi length of British policemen. Miss Marcella Sherwood later defended Colonel Dyer, describing him \\"as the 'saviour' of the Punjab\\".[32]\\r\\nFor the next two days, the city of Amritsar was quiet, but violence continued in other parts of the Punjab. Railway lines were cut, telegraph posts destroyed, government buildings burnt, and three Europeans murdered. By 13 April, the British government had decided to put most of the Punjab under martial law. The legislation restricted a number of civil liberties, including freedom of assembly; gatherings of more than four people were banned.[34]\\r\\nOn the evening of 12 April, the leaders of the hartal in Amritsar held a meeting at the Hindu College - Dhab Khatikan. At the meeting, Hans Raj, an aide to Dr. Kitchlew, announced a public protest meeting would be held at 16:30 the following day in the Jallianwala Bagh, to be organised by a Dr. Muhammad Bashir and chaired by a senior and respected Congress Party leader, Lal Kanhyalal Bhatia. A series of resolutions protesting against the Rowlatt Act, the recent actions of the British authorities and the detention of Drs. Satyapal and Kitchlew was drawn up and approved, after which the meeting adjourned.[35]\\r\\nAt 9:00 on the morning of 13 April, the traditional festival of Baisakhi, Colonel Reginald Dyer, the acting military commander for Amritsar and its environs, proceeded through the city with several city officials, announcing the implementation of a pass system to enter or leave Amritsar, a curfew beginning at 20:00 that night and a ban on all processions and public meetings of four or more persons. The proclamation was read and explained in English, Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi, but few paid it any heed or appear to have learned of it later.[36] Meanwhile, the local CID had received intelligence of the planned meeting in the Jallianwala Bagh through word of mouth and plainclothes detectives in the crowds. At 12:40, Dyer was informed of the meeting and returned to his base at around 13:30 to decide how to handle it.[37]\\r\\nBy mid-afternoon, thousands of Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus had gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh (garden) near the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar. Many who were present had earlier worshipped at the Golden Temple, and were passing through the Bagh on their way home. The Bagh was (and is) an open area of six to seven acres, roughly 200 yards by 200 yards in size, and surrounded by walls roughly 10 feet in height. Balconies of houses three to four stories tall overlooked the Bagh, and five narrow entrances opened onto it, several with locked gates. During the rainy season, it was planted with crops, but served as a local meeting-area and playground for much of the year.[38] In the center of the Bagh was a samadhi (cremation site) and a large well partly filled with water and about 20 feet in diameter.[38]\\r\\nApart from pilgrims, Amritsar had filled up over the preceding days with farmers, traders and merchants attending the annual Baisakhi horse and cattle fair. The city police closed the fair at 14:00 that afternoon, resulting in a large number of people drifting into the Jallianwala Bagh. It was estimated that about 20,000 to 25,000 people had gathered in the Bagh by the time of the meeting. Dyer sent an aeroplane to overfly the Bagh and estimate the size of the crowd.[38] By this time, both Colonel Dyer and Deputy Commissioner Irving, the senior civil authority for Amritsar, were well aware of the meeting, but took no actions to prevent it or send police to peacefully disperse the crowds. This would later be a serious criticism levelled at both Dyer and Irving.\\r\\nAn hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 16:30, Colonel Dyer arrived at the Bagh with a group of ninety Sikh, Gurkha, Baluchi, Rajput from 2-9th Gurkhas, the 54th Sikhs and the 59th Sind Rifles soldiers.[8] Fifty of them were armed with .303 LeeÿEnfield bolt-action rifles. It is not clear whether Dyer had specifically chosen troops from that ethnic group due to their proven loyalty to the British or that they were simply the Sikh and non-Sikh units most readily available. He had also brought two armored cars armed with machine guns; however, the vehicles were left outside, as they were unable to enter the Bagh through the narrow entrances. The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had few narrow entrances. Most of them were kept permanently locked. The main entrance was relatively wide, but was guarded heavily by the troops backed by the armoured vehicles.\\r\\nDyerwithout warning the crowd to disperseblocked the main exits. He 'explained' later that this act \\"was not to disperse the meeting but to punish the Indians for disobedience.\\"[39] Dyer ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd. Firing continued for approximately ten minutes. Cease-fire was ordered only when ammunition supplies were almost exhausted, after approximately 1,650 rounds were spent.[9]\\r\\nMany people died in stampedes at the narrow gates or by jumping into the solitary well on the compound to escape the shooting. A plaque, placed at the site after independence states that 120 bodies were removed from the well. The wounded could not be moved from where they had fallen, as a curfew was declared, and many more died during the night.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe number of deaths caused by the shooting is disputed. While the 'official' figure given by the British inquiry into the massacre is 379 deaths, the method used by the inquiry was corrupt. In July 1919, three months after the massacre, officials were tasked with finding who had been killed by inviting inhabitants of the city to volunteer information about those who had died.[40] This information was incomplete due to fear that those who participated would be identified as having been present at the meeting, and some of the dead may not have had close relations in the area.[41] When interviewed by the members of the committee, a senior civil servant in Punjab admitted that the actual figure could be higher.[42]\\r\\nSince the official figures were obviously flawed regarding the size of the crowd (15,000ÿ20,000), the number of rounds fired and the period of shooting, the Indian National Congress instituted a separate inquiry of its own, with conclusions that differed considerably from the British Government's so-called inquiry. The casualty number quoted by the Congress was more than 1,500, with approximately 1,000 being killed.[43] The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.\\r\\nColonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been \\"confronted by a revolutionary army\\", to which Major General William Beynon replied: \\"Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves.\\"[44] O'Dwyer requested that martial law should be imposed upon Amritsar and other areas, and this was granted by Viceroy Lord Chelmsford.[45][46]\\r\\nBoth Secretary of State for War Winston Churchill and former Prime Minister H. H. Asquith however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as \\"monstrous\\", while Asquith called it \\"one of the worst outrages in the whole of our history\\".[47] Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said, \\"The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything When fire had been opened upon it to disperse it, it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides. Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.\\"[48] After Churchill's speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.[49] Cloake reports that despite the official rebuke, many Britons \\"thought him a hero for saving the rule of British law in India.\\"[50]\\r\\nRabindranath Tagore received the news of the massacre by 22 May 1919. He tried to arrange a protest meeting in Calcutta and finally decided to renounce his British knighthood as \\"a symbolic act of protest\\".[51] In the repudiation letter, dated 30 May 1919 and addressed to the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, he wrote \\"I ... wish to stand, shorn, of all special distinctions, by the side of those of my countrymen who, for their so called insignificance, are liable to suffer degradation not fit for human beings.\\"[52]\\r\\nGupta describes the letter written by Tagore as \\"historic\\". He writes that Tagore \\"renounced his knighthood in protest against the inhuman cruelty of the British Government to the people of Punjab\\", and he quotes Tagore's letter to the Viceroy \\"The enormity of the measures taken by the Government in the Punjab for quelling some local disturbances has, with a rude shock, revealed to our minds the helplessness of our position as British subjects in India ... [T]he very least that I can do for my country is to take all consequences upon myself in giving voice to the protest of the millions of my countrymen, surprised into a dumb anguish of terror. The time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring in the incongruous context of humiliation...\\"[53] English Writings of Rabindranath Tagore Miscellaneous Writings Vol# 8 carries a facsimile of this hand written letter.[54]\\r\\nOn 14 October 1919, after orders issued by the Secretary of State for India, Edwin Montagu, the Government of India announced the formation of a committee of inquiry into the events in Punjab. Referred to as the Disorders Inquiry Committee, it was later more widely known as the Hunter Commission. It was named after the chairman, William, Lord Hunter, former Solicitor-General for Scotland and Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland. The stated purpose of the commission was to \\"investigate the recent disturbances in Bombay, Delhi and Punjab, about their causes, and the measures taken to cope with them\\".[55] The members of the commission were:\\r\\nAfter meeting in New Delhi on 29 October, the Commission took statements from witnesses over the following weeks. Witnesses were called in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay and Lahore. Although the Commission as such was not a formally constituted court of law, meaning witnesses were not subject to questioning under oath, its members managed to elicit detailed accounts and statements from witnesses by rigorous cross-questioning. In general, it was felt the Commission had been very thorough in its enquiries.[55] After reaching Lahore in November, the Commission wound up its initial inquiries by examining the principal witnesses to the events in Amritsar.\\r\\nOn 19 November, Dyer was called to appear before the Commission. Although his military superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone.[55] Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, \\"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\\"[56] Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of \\"rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well\\".[55]\\r\\nAfter Mr. Justice Rankin had questioned Dyer, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad enquired:\\r\\nSir Chimanlal: Supposing the passage was sufficient to allow the armoured cars to go in, would you have opened fire with the machine guns?\\r\\nDyer: I think probably, yes.\\r\\nSir Chimanlal: In that case, the casualties would have been much higher?\\r\\nDyer: Yes.[55]\\r\\nDyer further stated that his intentions had been to strike terror throughout the Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral stature of the \\"rebels\\". He said he did not stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd dispersed, and that a little shooting would not do any good. In fact he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted.[57] He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: \\"Certainly not. It was not my job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there.\\"[58]\\r\\nExhausted from the rigorous cross-examination questioning and ill, Dyer was then released. Over the next several months, while the Commission wrote its final report, the British press, as well as many MPs, turned hostile towards Dyer as the extent of the massacre and his statements at the inquiry became widely known.[55] Lord Chelmsford refused to comment until the Commission had been wound up. In the meanwhile, Dyer, seriously ill with jaundice and arteriosclerosis, was hospitalised.[55]\\r\\nAlthough the members of the Commission had been divided by racial tensions following Dyer's statement, and though the Indian members had written a separate, minority report, the final report, comprising six volumes of evidence and released on 8 March 1920, unanimously condemned Dyer's actions.[55] In \\"continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that General Dyer committed a grave error.\\"[59] Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime's use of force was wholly unjustified. \\"General Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Sir Michael O'Dwyer was of the same view\\", they wrote, \\"(but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed.\\" The report concluded that:\\r\\nThe minority report of the Indian members further added that:\\r\\nThe Hunter Commission did not impose any penal or disciplinary action because Dyer's actions were condoned by various superiors (later upheld by the Army Council).[60] The Legal and Home Members on the Viceroy's Council ultimately decided that, though Dyer had acted in a callous and brutal way, military or legal prosecution would not be possible due to political reasons. However, he was finally found guilty of a mistaken notion of duty and relieved of his command on 23 March. He had been recommended for a CBE as a result of his service in the Third Afghan War; this recommendation was cancelled on 29 March 1920.\\r\\nTwo days later, on 15 April, demonstrations occurred in Gujranwala protesting the killings at Amritsar. Police and aircraft were used against the demonstrators, resulting in 12 deaths and 27 injuries. The Officer Commanding the Royal Air Force in India, Brigadier General N D K MacEwen stated later that:\\r\\nI think we can fairly claim to have been of great use in the late riots, particularly at Gujranwala, where the crowd when looking at its nastiest was absolutely dispersed by a machine using bombs and Lewis guns.[61]\\r\\nOn 13 March 1940, at Caxton Hall in London, Udham Singh, an Indian independence activist from Sunam who had witnessed the events in Amritsar and had himself been wounded, shot and killed Michael O'Dwyer, the British Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab at the time of the massacre, who had approved Dyer's action and was believed to have been the main planner. Dyer himself had died in 1927.\\r\\nSome, such as the nationalist newspaper Amrita Bazar Patrika, also made positive statements. The common people and revolutionaries glorified the action of Udham Singh. Much of the press worldwide recalled the story of Jallianwala Bagh and alleged Michael O'Dwyer to have been responsible for the massacre. Singh was termed a \\"fighter for freedom\\" and his action was referred to in The Times newspaper as \\"an expression of the pent-up fury of the down-trodden Indian People\\".[62] In Fascist countries, the incident was used for anti-British propaganda: Bergeret, published in large scale from Rome at that time, while commenting upon the Caxton Hall assassination, ascribed the greatest significance to the circumstance and praised the action of Udham Singh as courageous.[63] The Berliner B?rsen Zeitung termed the event \\"The torch of Indian freedom\\". German radio reportedly broadcast: \\"The cry of tormented people spoke with shots.\\"\\r\\nAt a public meeting in Kanpur, a spokesman had stated that \\"at last an insult and humiliation of the nation had been avenged\\". Similar sentiments were expressed in numerous other places across the country.[64] Fortnightly reports of the political situation in Bihar mentioned: \\"It is true that we had no love lost for Sir Michael. The indignities he heaped upon our countrymen in Punjab have not been forgotten.\\" In its 18 March 1940 issue Amrita Bazar Patrika wrote: \\"O'Dwyer's name is connected with Punjab incidents which India will never forget.\\" The New Statesman observed: \\"British conservativism has not discovered how to deal with Ireland after two centuries of rule. Similar comment may be made on British rule in India. Will the historians of the future have to record that it was not the Nazis but the British ruling class which destroyed the British Empire?\\" Singh had told the court at his trial:\\r\\nI did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to wreak vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of death. I am dying for my country. I have seen my people starving in India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my duty. What a greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the sake of my motherland?[65]\\r\\nSingh was hanged for the murder on 31 July 1940. At that time, many, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi, condemned the action of Udham as senseless but courageous. In 1952, Nehru (by then Prime Minister) honoured Udham Singh with the following statement, which appeared in the daily Partap:\\r\\nI salute Shaheed-i-Azam Udham Singh with reverence who had kissed the noose so that we may be free.\\r\\nSoon after this recognition by the Prime Minister, Udham Singh received the title of Shaheed, a name given to someone who has attained martyrdom or done something heroic on behalf of their country or religion.[citation needed]\\r\\nA trust was founded in 1920 to build a memorial at the site after a resolution was passed by the Indian National Congress. In 1923, the trust purchased land for the project. A memorial, designed by American architect Benjamin Polk, was built on the site and inaugurated by President of India Rajendra Prasad on 13 April 1961, in the presence of Jawaharlal Nehru and other leaders. A flame was later added to the site.\\r\\nThe bullet marks remain on the walls and adjoining buildings to this day. The well into which many people jumped and drowned attempting to save themselves from the bullets is also a protected monument inside the park.\\r\\nShortly following the massacre, the official Sikh clergy of the Harmandir Sahib(Golden Temple) in Amritsar conferred upon Colonel Dyer the Saropa(the mark of distinguished service to the Sikh faith or, in general, humanity), sending shock waves among the Sikh community.[66] On 12 October 1920, students and faculty of the Amritsar Khalsa College called a meeting to demand the immediate removal of the Gurudwaras from the control of Mahants. The result was the formation of the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee on 15 November 1920 to manage and to implement reforms in Sikh shrines.[67]\\r\\nAlthough Queen Elizabeth II had not made any comments on the incident during her state visits in 1961 and 1983, she spoke about the events at a state banquet in India on 13 October 1997:[68]\\r\\nIt is no secret that there have been some difficult episodes in our past ÿ Jallianwala Bagh, which I shall visit tomorrow, is a distressing example. But history cannot be rewritten, however much we might sometimes wish otherwise. It has its moments of sadness, as well as gladness. We must learn from the sadness and build on the gladness.[68]\\r\\nOn 14 October 1997, Queen Elizabeth II visited Jallianwala Bagh and paid her respects with a 30?second moment of silence. During the visit, she wore a dress of a colour described as pink apricot or saffron, which was of religious significance to the Sikhs.[68] She removed her shoes while visiting the monument and laid a wreath at the monument.[68]\\r\\nWhile some Indians welcomed the expression of regret and sadness in the Queen's statement, others criticised it for being less than an apology.[68] The then Prime Minister of India Inder Kumar Gujral defended the Queen, saying that the Queen herself had not even been born at the time of the events and should not be required to apologise.[68]\\r\\nWinston Churchill, on 8 July 1920, urged the House of Commons to punish Colonel Dyer.[48] Churchill succeeded in persuading the House to forcibly retire Colonel Dyer, but Churchill would have preferred to see the colonel disciplined.[49]\\r\\nIn February 2013 David Cameron became the first serving British Prime Minister to visit the site, laid a wreath at the memorial, and described the Amritsar massacre as \\"a deeply shameful event in British history, one that Winston Churchill rightly described at that time as monstrous. We must never forget what happened here and we must ensure that the UK stands up for the right of peaceful protests\\". Cameron did not deliver an official apology.[69]","input":"When did the jallianwala bagh tragedy take place?"},{"output":"Martn de Argelles, Jr.","context":"The birth of the first white child is a widely used concept to mark the establishment of a European colony in the New World, especially in the historiography of the United States.

The first-born child was Mathieu Martin. In part because of this distinction, Mathieu Martin later became the Seigneur of Cobequid (1699).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeebaer van Nieuwelant (born 27 July 1623), son of Willemtgen and Willem Janszoon, was born south of Dirk Hartog Island, in present-day Western Australia. His father, not to be confused with the earlier Dutch explorer of the same name, was a midshipman from Amsterdam. He and his wife were aboard the Leijden, commanded by Claes Hermanszoon, which was charting the coast at the time. Their son's name in Dutch meant \\"sea-born (or sea-birth) of new land\\".[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first European birth in New Zealand was Thomas Holloway King at the Rangihoua Bay settlement on February 21, 1815.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nNovelist Joan Lindsay states [12]that her mother-in-law, Janey Lindsay, was the first white child to be born in Fiji.  She was born Jane Elizabeth Williams to the missionary Thomas Williams, and became the matriarch of an artistic family, including Daryl Lindsay (born 1889).\\r\\n\\r\\nNada Burnham (May 1894 ÿ May 19, 1896), daughter of the celebrated American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, was the first white child born in Bulawayo and died of fever and starvation during the Siege of Bulawayo in the Second Matabele War.[13][14] She was buried in the Pioneer Cemetery, plot #144, in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).[15] Nada is the Zulu word for lily and she was named after the heroine in Sir H. Rider Haggards Zulu tale, Nada the Lily (1892). Three of Haggard's books are posthumously dedicated to her: The Wizard (1896), Elissa: The Doom of Zimbabwe (1899), and Black Heart and White Heart: A Zulu Idyll (1900).[16][17] Haggard's dedication reads: To the Memory of the Child: Nada Burnham, who \\"bound all to her\\" and, while her father cut his way through the hordes of the Ingobo Regiment, perished of the hardships of war at Buluwayo on 19 May 1896, I dedicate these talesand more particularly the last, that of a Faith which triumphed over savagery and death.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first white baby born in Rhodesia was named Unwin Moffat. He was the son of the missionary John Smith Moffat & his wife Emily, nee Unwin. The child was born on the 18th of December 1858. The Moffats had eleven children between 1858 and 1871.  One of their sons, Howard Unwin Moffat, became premier of S. Rhodesia in 1927.","input":"Who was the first white person born in america?"},{"output":"the United States Chesapeake Bay area during the 19th century","context":"The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog belonging to the Retriever, Gundog, and Sporting breed groups.[1][2][3] Members of the breed may also be referred to as a Chessie, CBR, or Chesapeake. The breed was developed in the United States Chesapeake Bay area during the 19th century. Historically used by area market hunters to retrieve waterfowl, it is primarily a family pet and hunting companion. They are often known for their love of water and their ability to hunt. It is a medium to large sized dog similar in appearance to the Labrador Retriever. The Chesapeake has a wavy coat, rather than the Labrador's smooth coat. They are described as having a bright and happy disposition, courage, willingness to work, alertness, intelligence, and love of water as some of their characteristics.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDistinctive features include eyes that are very clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the shoulders, and a double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and loins. The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and is often associated with a slight musky odor. Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear but it must be limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should be straight with good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting.\\r\\nThe coat of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever is given the most consideration of any trait listed on the Positive Scale of Points in the Breed Standard. However the AKC Standard also reads \\"The question of coat and general type of balance takes precedence over any scoring table which could be drawn up. The Chesapeake should be well proportioned, an animal with a good coat and well balanced in other points being preferable to one excelling in some but weak in others.\\" The hair on the face and legs should be very short and straight with a tendency to wave, never curl, on the shoulders, neck, back, and loins only and nowhere over 1.5?inches long. Moderate feathering on the rear of the hindquarters and tail is permissible although not longer than 1.75?inches long.[5] The texture of the thick double-coat is important in protecting the dog from cold water and icy conditions. The oil in the harsh outer coat and woolly undercoat resists water, keeping the dog dry and warm. Maintenance of the coat is minimal and mainly consists of brushing with a short-tooth brush once a week. It is difficult to get a Chesapeake Bay Retriever thoroughly wet, but they should be bathed every 3ÿ4 months using a suitably mild shampoo, then dried thoroughly. Brushing or bathing more often can ruin the texture since it strips the protective oil from the coat and may even remove the undercoat.[6][7][8] The color of the coat must be similar to the working surroundings. Any color of brown, sedge or deadgrass is acceptable and one color is not preferred over another. The American Chesapeake Club includes a discussion on color:\\r\\nA white spot on the breast (not extending above the sternum), belly, toes or back of the feet is permissible, but the smaller the spot the better. White beyond these areas and black anywhere on the body is not allowed in the breed standard.[5]\\r\\nThe quintessential Chesapeake Bay Retriever has a bright and happy disposition, intelligence, quiet good sense, and an affectionate protective nature. Some can be quite vocal when happy, and some will 'smile' by baring their front teeth in a peculiar grin - this is not a threat but a sign of joy or submissiveness.\\r\\nChesapeake Bay Retrievers can make excellent family dogs when socialized properly. Some Chesapeakes are assertive and willful and may be reserved with strangers, but others are passive and outgoing with people.\\r\\nThe Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a versatile breed competing in field trials, hunt tests, conformation, obedience, agility and tracking, yet remains true to its roots as a hunting dog of great stamina and ability. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is an intelligent breed and learns at a high speed. Historically considered stubborn and difficult to train, many trainers thought this breed required more physical discipline than other retriever breeds.[10] Some trainers now recommend that the Chesapeake Bay Retriever owner use consistent, daily obedience training with play time before and after to keep the dog wanting to work with little or no physical discipline required.[11]\\r\\nThe breed is subject to a number of hereditary diseases. These include, but are not limited to:\\r\\nA UK Kennel Club survey puts the median lifespan of the breed at 10.75 years (average 9.85).[17] A US breed club survey puts the average lifespan at 9.4 years. 1 in 4 lived to 13 years or more while 1 in 5 don't live past 5 years.[18]\\r\\nChesapeake Bay Retrievers trace their history to two pups who were rescued from a foundering ship in Maryland in 1807. The male \\"Sailor\\" and female \\"Canton\\" were described as Newfoundland dogs, but were more accurately Lesser Newfoundland or St. John's water dogs. These two lived in different parts of the bay area and there is no record of a litter being produced together. They were bred with area dogs, with more consideration given to ability than to breed, to create the beginnings of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever breed. There are few records of the breeds of these early dogs, but spaniels and hounds were included. Dogs from both Chesapeake Bay shores were recognized as one of three types of Chesapeake Bay Ducking Dog in 1877. In 1918 a single type, called the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, was recognized by the American Kennel Club, and there have been few changes to the breed standard since then.\\r\\nGeorge Law, who rescued the pups, wrote this account in 1845 which appears on the website of the American Chesapeake Bay Retriever Club:\\r\\nMercer is said to have described Sailor:\\r\\nIn 1964, it was declared the official dog of Maryland.[20]\\r\\nIt is the mascot of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\\r\\nMembers of the breed were owned by General George Armstrong Custer, President Theodore Roosevelt, and actors Paul Walker and Tom Felton.","input":"Where did the chesapeake bay retriever originated from?"},{"output":"season six","context":"Dana Katherine Scully is a fictional character in the Fox science fiction-supernatural television series The X-Files, played by Gillian Anderson. Scully is an FBI agent and a medical doctor (M.D.), partnered with fellow Special Agent Fox Mulder for the first seven, and the tenth, seasons, and with John Doggett in the eighth and ninth seasons. In the television series, they work out of a cramped basement office at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. to investigate unsolved cases labeled \\"X-Files\\". In 2002, Scully left government employment, and in 2008 she began working as a surgeon in Our Lady of Sorrows, a private Catholic hospital ÿ where she stayed for seven years, until rejoining the FBI. In contrast to Mulder's credulous \\"believer\\" character, Scully is the skeptic for the first seven seasons, choosing to base her beliefs on what science can prove. She later on becomes a \\"believer\\" after Mulder's abduction at the end of season seven.\\r\\nScully has appeared in all but four episodes of The X-Files, and in the 20th Century Fox films The X-Files, released in 1998, and The X-Files: I Want to Believe, released ten years later. The episodes she does not appear in are \\"3\\", \\"Zero Sum\\", \\"Unusual Suspects\\", and \\"Travelers\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDana Katherine Scully was born on February 23, 1964 in Annapolis, Maryland, to William (Don S. Davis) and Margaret Scully (Sheila Larken), into a close-knit Catholic family with Irish ancestry.[1][2] She has an older brother, Bill Jr., an older sister, Melissa, and a younger brother, Charles, who is never seen on the show except in flashbacks.[3] Scully's father was a navy captain, who died of a heart attack in early January 1994.[4] Dana Scully grew up in Annapolis, Maryland and later in San Diego, California. As a young girl, Scully's favorite book was Moby-Dick and she came to nickname her father \\"Ahab\\" from the book, and in return, he called her \\"Starbuck.\\" Due to this she named her dog Queequeg.[5]\\r\\nScully attended The University of Maryland, and in 1986 received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics. Her undergraduate thesis was titled Einstein's Twin Paradox: A New Interpretation.[6] While in medical school at Stanford University she was recruited by the FBI; she accepted the agency's offer of employment because she felt she could distinguish herself there. After two years in the bureau, Division Chief Scott Blevins assigned her to work with agent Fox Mulder.\\r\\nUpon being partnered with Mulder, Scully maintained her medical skills by acting as a forensic pathologist, often performing or consulting on autopsies of victims on X-Files cases.[7]\\r\\nIn Season 2, Scully was kidnapped by an ex-FBI mental patient named Duane Barry,[8] and then taken from Barry by a military covert operation that were working with the alien conspirators,[9] but was later returned.[2] In Season 3 she found out that a super hi-tech microchip has been implanted in the back of her neck. After having it removed, she developed cancer in the fourth season[10] and was hospitalized after the cancer became terminal. She was saved after Mulder broke into the Department of Defense to retrieve another chip to be implanted back into her neck. At the time, Scully was also undergoing experimental medical treatments and was having a dramatic renewal of her faith.[11]\\r\\nScully was pronounced infertile during the fifth season. In the season five episode \\"Emily\\", Scully discovers that she unknowingly mothered a daughter during her abduction (in season 2). Her daughter Emily was adopted by another family. Emily died shortly afterwards, and they were unable to further investigate after Emily's body went missing. In the seventh season finale, \\"Requiem\\", Scully mysteriously became pregnant.[12] The child, named William, after her own father, as well as Mulder's father, was born at the end of the eighth season.[13] The show did not initially reveal the cause of Scully's pregnancy, but later episodes and movies would see Mulder and Scully call William \\"our son\\"; the pair had unsuccessfully tried for a child through in vitro fertilization. Around this time, Mulder was fired from the FBI by Deputy Director Alvin Kersh,[14] and Scully left the field to teach forensics at Quantico.[15] William was given up for adoption during the end of the ninth season after Scully felt she could no longer provide the safety that William needed.[16] William was a \\"miracle child\\", of some importance to the alien Conspiracy. He demonstrated extraordinary powers, including telekinesis.[17]\\r\\nIn The X-Files: I Want to Believe she is shown working as a medical doctor at the Our Lady of Sorrows, a private Catholic hospital in Virginia. Early on in the film Scully is contacted by the FBI who are looking for Fox Mulder in the hope that he will assist them with the investigation of a missing FBI agent. In exchange for his help the charges against him will be dropped. Unlike Mulder, Scully was apparently not considered a fugitive by the FBI. However, she did continue to maintain her romantic relationship with Mulder throughout the six years that he was on the run from the American government. In the movie, they are shown to be living together in a secluded house.[18]\\r\\nIn the first episode of season 10, \\"My Struggle\\" (2016), it is shown that Scully is still working as a doctor for Our Lady Of Sorrows hospital, now performing surgeries on children with severe birth defects. It is revealed that Scully has extraterrestrial DNA, as the test that she performs on herself confirms. After the FBI reopens the X-Files, fourteen years after their closure, she rejoins the bureau.[19] In \\"Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster\\", Scully jokes that she often enters dangerous situations alone due to the immortality she obtained during \\"Tithonus\\", which was first referenced in \\"Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose\\". At the end of \\"Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster\\", Scully steals a dog from an animal control center, named Daggoo. which is named after yet another character from Moby-Dick.[20] In \\"Home Again\\" Dana's mother, Margaret Scully, dies after suffering a heart attack.[21] In the show's tenth season finale, \\"My Struggle II\\", Scully is in a race against time to save humankind, creating a vaccine from her own extraterrestrial DNA.[22]\\r\\nThroughout the series, her Catholic faith served as a cornerstone, although a contradiction to her otherwise rigid skepticism of the paranormal.[23] Due to her career in science and medicine, she drifted from her Catholic Christian upbringing but remained somewhat entrenched in her religious beliefs. Scully almost always wears a gold cross necklace, given to her by her mother as a Christmas present when she was fifteen. When she was abducted by Duane Barry, a self-proclaimed alien abductee,[9] it was the only item left behind in Barry's getaway car. Mulder wore it as a talisman of her until Scully miraculously reappeared in a Washington, D.C. hospital.[24] After she recovered from the trauma of her abduction, he returned the cross to her.[2]\\r\\nThe abduction visibly tested the limits of her faith  Mulder believes that Scully was taken aboard an alien spaceship and was subjected to tests. However, because of Scully's skepticism, she believes she was kidnapped by men and subjected to tests, not aliens. She believes she could have been brought there by Barry, and she began to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder on a case involving a murdering fetishist named Donnie Pfaster.[25] This psychological re-victimization continued after Pfaster escaped from prison five years later and again attempted to kill her in her home, ending only after she fatally shot him. She struggled with what motivated her actions to kill Pfaster, and questioned whether it was God compelling her to kill him, or \\"something else.\\"[26]\\r\\nSometime after her recovery from cancer, Scully began to regularly attend Mass again. At the request of Father McCue, Scully got involved in a case concerning a paraplegic girl who was found dead in a kneeling position with her palms outstretched and eye sockets charred. After Scully discovered the girl was part of a set of quadruplets and two more were murdered, Father McCue shared with her the story of the seraphim and the nephilim, which Scully interpreted as a possible explanation for the deformations and deaths of the girls. Scully continued to have visions of Emily, and when the last girl died, Scully believed she was returning the girl to God. Upon her return to Washington D.C., she went to confession to gain peace of mind and acceptance for Emily's death.[27] In confession she regretted her decision of letting the girl go. This suggests Scully had doubts about her faith.\\r\\nIn Milagro, the eighteenth episode of the sixth season, Agent Scullys vulnerability is exposed. In this episode, the murderer takes the victims heart out. The suspect, a writer named Phillip Padgett, has a particular interest in Scully and is fascinated by her beauty and personality. When she goes to a church to observe a painting, the writer is there and talks to her about the Sacred Heart of Jesus. During the conversation he says she visits the church because she likes art, but not as place of worship. Scully doesnt say otherwise and later she says to Agent Mulder the writer told her her life story. All this suggests that Scully isnt a devout Roman Catholic, although she attempted to approach again the Catholic community and the Catholic faith to which she was devout in her youth, after handling the strange case presented in \\"Revelations\\" and also after dealing with life-threatening cancer during the fourth season.\\r\\nWhile in medical school, she carried on an affair with her married instructor, Dr. Daniel Waterston who may have been the \\"college boyfriend\\" mentioned in \\"Trust No 1\\". It is never indicated in the show whether or not the relationship became sexual. According to Anderson in the episode's audio commentary, Scully came very close to having an affair with the married Waterston but left before she could break up his marriage. The end of her relationship with Waterston came about following her decision to go into the FBI.[28] After her entrance to the FBI's Academy at Quantico, Scully began a year-long relationship with her Academy instructor, Jack Willis, with whom she shared a birthday.[3]\\r\\nTowards the end of the series, her previously platonic friendship with partner Fox Mulder developed into a romantic relationship. When Mulder was injured in a boat crash, he awakened in a hospital and told Scully that he loved her.[29] In the season six episode \\"How the Ghosts Stole Christmas\\", a ghost that seems to know the inner workings of Scully's mind suggests that her source of intimacy for Mulder comes from her desire to always prove him wrong.[30] By the end of the sixth season, Mulder and Scully were increasingly shown enjoying more light-hearted activities together, such as practicing baseball,[31] using FBI funds for a \\"night out\\" during a movie premiere,[32] and watching a movie at Mulder's apartment.[33] In the season seven episode \\"all things\\", Scully is shown getting dressed in Mulder's bathroom, while Mulder sleeps, apparently naked, in the bedroom.[28] In \\"Trust No 1\\" a man reveals to Scully that he works for a \\"new\\" Syndicate like-organization, and his job requires him and a few other colleagues to spy on her around the clock. Due to this he knows intimate details of Scully's personal life, right down to her \\"natural hair color\\" (Titian, as later confirmed by Chris Carter).[34] It is suggested by this man that Scully ultimately initiated a sexual relationship with Mulder, as he remarked that he was very surprised when she invited Mulder \\"into her bed\\".[35] The last scene of the series finale featured Mulder and Scully holding each other on a bed, facing an uncertain future together in love.[36]\\r\\nIn the film, The X-Files: I Want to Believe, which takes place six years later, Mulder and Scully are still in a relationship. Scully was concerned that Mulder's continuing pursuit of the unknown was taking its toll on their relationship and they could not be together if he couldn't \\"escape the darkness\\". However, the film ends with the couple sharing a passionate kiss, and in the \\"secret ending\\" after the majority of the credits, a happily smiling Scully is seen in a small rowboat with Mulder, both clad in swimwear, in a tropical sea, having taken him up on his offer to run away together.[18] In the tenth season it is revealed that Scully and Mulder are no longer a couple, as she chose to leave him.[19]\\r\\nChris Carter named Scully after his favorite sportscaster, Vin Scully of the Los Angeles Dodgers. John Doggett was likewise named after Vin Scully's longtime broadcasting partner, Jerry Doggett.[37] Scully's character was also inspired by Jodie Foster's portrayal of Clarice Starling in the film The Silence of the Lambs.[38] Scully was a known name in UFO lore. In 1950 the less than credible Behind the Flying Saucers was published, written by Variety columnist Frank Scully. The name Scully was also used in 1976 film All the President's Men, an obvious inspiration for the show, in a list of names who work for the Committee for the Re-Election of the President.\\r\\nThe casting for Scully caused a conflict between Carter and the Fox network. Carter had chosen 24-year-old Gillian Anderson, who Carter felt was perfect for the role.[39] Of her audition, Carter said, \\"she came in and read the part with a seriousness and intensity that I knew the Scully character had to have and I knew [...] she was the right person for the part\\".[40] However, Fox executives had wanted a more glamorous \\"bombshell\\" for the part, hoping that this would lead to the series involving a romantic element. This led Carter to insist that he did not want the roles of Mulder and Scully to become romantically involved.[39] Carter decided Scully would be the skeptic to play against established stereotypes; typically on television the quality was attributed to a male.[40] Because Duchovny was much taller than Anderson, during scenes where Mulder and Scully stand or walk next to each other Anderson stood on \\"the Gilly-Board\\", an apple box named after her.[41]\\r\\nScully appears in every episode of the ten-season series with the exceptions of \\"3\\", \\"Zero Sum\\", \\"Unusual Suspects\\" and \\"Travelers\\". She has appeared outside The X-Files on numerous occasions, the most notable being in the Millennium (also created by Chris Carter) episode \\"Lamentation,\\" in which the main character, Frank Black, visits the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, and Mulder and Scully are briefly seen descending a stairway. In fact, they are Duchovny and Anderson's stand-ins.\\r\\nAn animated version of Scully, which featured the voice acting of Anderson, would appear on season 8 of The Simpsons, in the episode \\"The Springfield Files\\", as well as Canadian animated series Eek! The Cat, on the episode \\"Eek Space 9\\". The animated television series ReBoot featured characters Fax Modem and Data Nully, obvious spoofs of Mulder and Scully, in the episode \\"Trust No One\\". Anderson provided her voice work for the episode, but co-star Duchovny declined.\\r\\nAnderson won many awards for her portrayal of Special Agent Scully during the ten seasons of The X-Files, including an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1997,[43] a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Television Drama Series in 1997,[44] two SAG Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series in 1996 and 1997[45][46] and a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television in 1997. In total, Anderson received for the role, four Emmy nominations,[47] four Golden Globe nominations,[48] nine SAG nominations[49] and eight Saturn nominations.[49]\\r\\nFilm critic Scott Mendelson, writing in The Huffington Post, cited Scully as an example of strong female characters on television, calling her \\"one of the most iconic characters in the science-fiction genre\\".[50] Radio Times's Laura Pledger also named her as a strong TV woman, placing her at #1.[51] Rebecca Traister of Salon.com opined that Scully had a better character arc than Mulder. She wrote, \\"The very fact that her character was such a hard sell made her repeated brushes with the supernatural all the more powerful. Mulder's desire to believe was so expansive, his credulity so flexible, that it's not as though he was ever going to have either shaken from him. But Scully's surety was solid, stable, rigid; every time she saw something she thought she'd never see, we saw it crack, sparks fly from it. She was forced to question herself, grow, change\\".[52] She praised her for being more \\"rational, resilient, [and] mature\\" than her partner and for their mature relationship.[52] In a review of \\"Irresistible\\", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that it was a clich to put Scully in danger, as \\"Scully is [the show's] heart, and any time she's in danger, it feels like the show itself is about to be stabbed through the heart\\".[53]\\r\\nThe character of Scully has become something of a sci-fi heroine due to her intelligence and resilience, frequently appearing on lists of important female science fiction characters, such as Total Sci-Fi Online's list of The 25 Women Who Shook Sci-Fi, where she came in fourth.[54] TV Squad named her the thirteenth greatest woman on television,[55] while the site also listed her among the most memorable female science fiction television characters.[56] She is also often cited as being an unlikely sex symbol, frequently being included in lists of sexy TV characters.[57][58] She was listed in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters.[59] The pairing Mulder/Scully was ranked number 15 on Sleuth Channel's poll of America's Top Sleuths.[60]\\r\\nAngelica Jade Bastin of Vulture emphasized the importance of Scully's character in popular culture by listing all the strong female characters she inspired or may have influenced in some aspects, including: Temperance \\"Bones\\" Brennan of Bones, Peggy Carter of Agent Carter, Veronica Mars of Veronica Mars, Olivia Moore of iZombie, Dr. Maura Isles of Rizzoli & Isles, Olivia Benson of Law and Order: SVU, Joan Watson of Elementary, Sydney Bristow of Alias, Abbie Mills of Sleepy Hollow, Zo? Washburne of Firefly, Stella Gibson (another character portrayed by Anderson) of The Fall and Olivia Dunham of Fringe. Jade Bastin wrote: \\"Do all the characters Scully has influenced live up to her? Definitely not. Gillian Anderson's performance and her chemistry with David Duchovny aren't exactly elements that can be replicated. But these characters prove that Scully isn't only the heart of The X-Files, but also the character who had the most profound influence on popular culture\\".[61]\\r\\nIndiewire's Liz Shannon Miller ranked Scully as the #1 most important character of The X-Files, writing: \\"Scully's legacy is so important in so many ways, from giving us the gift of Gillian Anderson's acting, to inspiring an entire generation of young women to pursue careers in STEM. Intelligent, loyal, flawed and brave, Scully was the show's beating heart and saving grace even in its lowest years. As Chris Carter himself has said: 'It's Scully's show'.\\"[62]\\r\\nThe character is believed to have initiated a phenomenon referred to as \\"The Scully Effect\\"; as the medical doctor and the FBI Special Agent inspired many young women to pursue careers in science, medicine and law enforcement, and as a result brought a perceptible increase in the number of women in those fields.[63][64] At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Anderson noted that she has long been aware of \\"The Scully Effect\\" and stated: \\"We got a lot of letters all the time, and I was told quite frequently by girls who were going into the medical world or the science world or the FBI world or other worlds that I reigned, that they were pursuing those pursuits because of the character of Scully. And I said, 'Yay!'\\"[65] Anne Simon, a biology professor and a science adviser for the series recalls: \\"I asked my Intro Bio class back then how many of them were influenced by the character of Scully on The X-Files to go into science and half of the hands in the room went up. That's huge! That was saying that the show was really having an effect.\\"[66] \\"The Scully Effect\\" remains a subject of academic inquiry.[67]","input":"When did scully fall in love with mulder?"},{"output":"Tanya Tucker","context":"\\"Delta Dawn\\" is a song written by former child rockabilly star Larry Collins and songwriter Alex Harvey,[a] best known as a 1972 top ten country hit for Tanya Tucker[1] and a number one hit for Helen Reddy in 1973.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title character is a faded former Southern belle from Brownsville, Tennessee who, at forty-one, is obsessed to unreason with the long-ago memory of a suitor who jilted her.

The preemption required a marketing change to Midler's single, so the original B-side \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\" was shopped to radio, itself becoming a Top?Ten hit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Midlers recording, Nashville-based producer Billy Sherrill heard her sing \\"Delta Dawn\\" on The Tonight Show and wanted to sign Midler to Epic Records and have her record the song.

In the Roud index of folksongs it is No. 942.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Cotton-Eyed Joe\\" has inspired both a partner dance and more than one line dance that is often danced at country dance venues in the U.S. and around the world. The 1980 film Urban Cowboy sparked a renewed interest in the dance. In 1985, The Moody Brothers' version of the song received a Grammy Award nomination for \\"Best Country Instrumental Performance\\". Irish group The Chieftains received a Grammy nomination for \\"Best Country Vocal Collaboration\\" for their version of the song with lead vocals by Ricky Skaggs on their 1992 album, Another Country. In 1994, a version of the song recorded by the Swedish band Rednex as \\"Cotton Eye Joe\\" became popular worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origins of this song are unclear, although it pre-dates the 1861ÿ1865 American Civil War.[1] American folklorist Dorothy Scarborough (1878ÿ1935) noted in her 1925 book On the Trail of Negro Folk-songs, that several people remember hearing the song before the war. Scarborough's account of the song came from her sister, Mrs. George Scarborough, who learned the song from \\"the Negroes on a plantation in Texas, and other parts from a man in Louisiana.\\" The man in Louisiana knew the song from his earliest childhood and heard slaves singing it on plantations.[2] Both the dance and the song had many variants.[3] The first printed one dates from 1882[4]. American publishing house Harper and Brothers published a version in 1882, heard by author Louise Clarke Pyrnelle (born 1850) on the Alabama plantation of her father when she was a child,[5] that was later republished in 1910:[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Cotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe, \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did make you sarve me so, \\r\\nFur ter take my gal erway fum me, \\r\\nAn' cyar her plum ter Tennessee? \\r\\nEf it hadn't ben fur Cotton-eyed Joe, \\r\\nI'd er been married long ergo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"His eyes wuz crossed, an' his nose wuz flat, \\r\\nAn' his teef wuz out, but wat uv dat? \\r\\nFur he wuz tall, an' he wuz slim, \\r\\nAn' so my gal she follered him. \\r\\nEf it hadn't ben fur Cotton-eyed Joe, \\r\\nI'd er been married long ergo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"No gal so hansum could be foun', \\r\\nNot in all dis country roun', \\r\\nWid her kinky head, an' her eyes so bright, \\r\\nWid her lips so red an' her teef so white. \\r\\nEf it hadn't ben fur Cotton-eyed Joe, \\r\\nI'd been married long ergo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"An' I loved dat gal wid all my heart, \\r\\nAn' she swo' fum me she'd never part; \\r\\nBut den wid Joe she runned away, \\r\\nAn' lef' me hyear fur ter weep all day.\\r\\n\\r\\nO Cotton-eyed Joe, O Cotton-eyed Joe, \\r\\nWhat did make you sarve me so? \\r\\nO Joe, ef it hadn't er ben fur you, \\r\\nI'd er married dat gal fur true.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1884, the same year Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was published, the fiddle-based song was referred to as \\"an old, familiar air.\\"[7] In 1925, another version was recorded by folklorist Dorothy Scarborough and published.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nDon't you remember, don't you know,\\r\\n\\r\\nDon't you remember Cotton-eyed Joe?\\r\\nCotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe,\\r\\nWhat did make you treat me so?\\r\\nI'd 'a' been married forty year ago\\r\\nEf it had n't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe!\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe,\\r\\nHe was de nig dat sarved me so, \\r\\nTuck my gal away fum me,\\r\\nCarried her off to Tennessee.\\r\\nI'd 'a' been married forty year ago\\r\\nIf it had n't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nHi's teeth was out an' his nose was flat,\\r\\nHis eyes was crossed,  but she did n't mind dat.\\r\\nKase he was tall, and berry slim,\\r\\nAn' so my gal she follered him.\\r\\nI'd 'a' been married forty year ago\\r\\nEf it had n't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was de prettiest gal to be found\\r\\nAnywhar in de country round;\\r\\nHer lips was red an' her eyes was bright,\\r\\nHer skin was black but her teeth was white.\\r\\nI'd 'a' been married forty year ago\\r\\nEf it had n't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nDat gal, she sho' had all my love,\\r\\nAn swore fum ne she'd never move,\\r\\nBut Joe hoodooed her, don't you see,\\r\\nAn' she run off wid him to Tennessee,\\r\\nI'd 'a' been married forty years ago,\\r\\nEf it hadn't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScarborough noted that the song seemed to be well known in the South prior to the Civil War, and parts of it had been sent in by various persons.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years, many different versions of the song have been performed and/or recorded with many different versions of the lyrics (and many without lyrics).\\r\\n\\"Cotton-Eyed Joe\\", on occasion referred to as \\"The South Texas National Anthem\\", was played for minstrel-type jigs, and it has long been popular as a square dance hoedown and a couple dance polka.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nA resident of Central Texas who learned the dance in Williamson County in the early 1880s described it as nothing but a heel and toe \\"poker\\" with fringes added. These fringes added to the heel and toe polka were clog steps which required skill and extraversion on the part of the dancer.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, the song was a widely known folk song all over English-speaking North America. \\r\\nOne discography lists 134 recorded versions released since 1950.[11] In more recent decades, the song has waned in popularity in most regions except some parts of the American South, where it is still a popular folk song.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nA list of the possible meanings of the term \\"cotton-eyed\\" that have been proposed includes: to be drunk on moonshine, or to have been blinded by drinking wood alcohol, turning the eyes milky white; a black person with very light blue eyes; someone whose eyes were milky white from bacterial infections of trachoma or syphilis, cataracts or glaucoma; or the contrast of dark skin tone around white eyeballs in black people.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nBob Wills and Adolph Hofner and his San Antonians both recorded the song, and Hofner's version (Columbia 37658), issued in 1941,[14] apparently[clarification needed] was the one that did the most to popularize the song.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1967 instrumental version of the song (KIKR k202) by Al Dean, who recalled the song called \\"The Gingerbread Man\\" in South Texas, inspired a new round dance polka for couples. This dance was adapted into a simplified version as a nonpartner waist-hold, spoke line routine. Heel and toe polka steps were replaced with a cross-lift followed by a kick with two-steps. The lift and kick are sometimes accompanied by shouts of \\"whoops, whoops\\", or the barnyard term \\"bull shit\\", mimicking the act of kicking off barnyard muck.[9] The practice continues to this day. The Kickin album included \\"Cotton-Eyed Joe\\" by Dean.

It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as \\"ice giants\\" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more \\"ices\\" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.[12] It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49?K (?224?C; ?371?F), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds.[12] The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.[11]\\r\\nUranus is the only planet whose name is derived directly from a figure from Greek mythology, from the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky Ouranos. Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration among those of the planets because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators.[16] In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets.[16] Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900?km/h; 560?mph).[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.[18] Sir William Herschel announced its discovery on 13 March 1781, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time in history and making Uranus the first planet discovered with a telescope.\\r\\n\\r\\nUranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet, but it was generally mistaken for a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchos, who in 128 BC might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's Almagest.[19] The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769,[20] including on four consecutive nights.\\r\\nSir William Herschel observed Uranus on 13 March 1781 from the garden of his house at 19 New King Street in Bath, Somerset, England (now the Herschel Museum of Astronomy),[21] and initially reported it (on 26 April 1781) as a comet.[22] Herschel \\"engaged in a series of observations on the parallax of the fixed stars\\",[23] using a telescope of his own design.\\r\\nHerschel recorded in his journal: \\"In the quartile near  Tauri?... either [a] Nebulous star or perhaps a comet.\\"[24] On 17 March he noted: \\"I looked for the Comet or Nebulous Star and found that it is a Comet, for it has changed its place.\\"[25] When he presented his discovery to the Royal Society, he continued to assert that he had found a comet, but also implicitly compared it to a planet:[23]\\r\\nThe power I had on when I first saw the comet was 227. From experience I know that the diameters of the fixed stars are not proportionally magnified with higher powers, as planets are; therefore I now put the powers at 460 and 932, and found that the diameter of the comet increased in proportion to the power, as it ought to be, on the supposition of its not being a fixed star, while the diameters of the stars to which I compared it were not increased in the same ratio. Moreover, the comet being magnified much beyond what its light would admit of, appeared hazy and ill-defined with these great powers, while the stars preserved that lustre and distinctness which from many thousand observations I knew they would retain. The sequel has shown that my surmises were well-founded, this proving to be the Comet we have lately observed.[23]\\r\\nHerschel notified the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne of his discovery and received this flummoxed reply from him on 23 April 1781: \\"I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it.\\"[26]\\r\\nAlthough Herschel continued to describe his new object as a comet, other astronomers had already begun to suspect otherwise. Finnish-Swedish astronomer Anders Johan Lexell, working in Russia, was the first to compute the orbit of the new object.[27] Its nearly circular orbit led him to a conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet. Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode described Herschel's discovery as \\"a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of Saturn\\".[28] Bode concluded that its near-circular orbit was more like a planet than a comet.[29]\\r\\nThe object was soon universally accepted as a new planet. By 1783, Herschel acknowledged this to Royal Society president Joseph Banks: \\"By the observation of the most eminent Astronomers in Europe it appears that the new star, which I had the honour of pointing out to them in March 1781, is a Primary Planet of our Solar System.\\"[30] In recognition of his achievement, King George III gave Herschel an annual stipend of S200 on condition that he move to Windsor so that the Royal Family could look through his telescopes.[31]\\r\\nThe name of Uranus references the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus (Ancient Greek: Ѯ?ϫ??), the father of Cronus (Saturn) and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter), which in Latin became \\"ranus\\" (Latin pronunciation:?[?uran?s]).[1] It is the only planet whose name is derived directly from a figure of Greek mythology. The adjectival form of Uranus is \\"Uranian\\".[32] The pronunciation of the name Uranus preferred among astronomers is /?j??r?n?s/,[2] with stress on the first syllable as in Latin ranus, in contrast to /j???re?n?s/, with stress on the second syllable and a long a, though both are considered acceptable.[f]\\r\\nConsensus on the name was not reached until almost 70 years after the planet's discovery. During the original discussions following discovery, Maskelyne asked Herschel to \\"do the astronomical world the faver  [sic] to give a name to your planet, which is entirely your own, [and] which we are so much obliged to you for the discovery of\\".[34] In response to Maskelyne's request, Herschel decided to name the object Georgium Sidus (George's Star), or the \\"Georgian Planet\\" in honour of his new patron, King George III.[35] He explained this decision in a letter to Joseph Banks:[30]\\r\\nIn the fabulous ages of ancient times the appellations of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were given to the Planets, as being the names of their principal heroes and divinities. In the present more philosophical era it would hardly be allowable to have recourse to the same method and call it Juno, Pallas, Apollo or Minerva, for a name to our new heavenly body. The first consideration of any particular event, or remarkable incident, seems to be its chronology: if in any future age it should be asked, when this last-found Planet was discovered? It would be a very satisfactory answer to say, 'In the reign of King George the Third'.\\r\\nHerschel's proposed name was not popular outside Britain, and alternatives were soon proposed. Astronomer Jr?me Lalande proposed that it be named Herschel in honour of its discoverer.[36] Swedish astronomer Erik Prosperin proposed the name Neptune, which was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet in the course of the American Revolutionary War by calling the new planet even Neptune George III or Neptune Great Britain.[27]\\r\\nIn a March 1782 treatise, Bode proposed Uranus, the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos.[37] Bode argued that the name should follow the mythology so as not to stand out as different from the other planets, and that Uranus was an appropriate name as the father of the first generation of the Titans.[37] He also noted that elegance of the name in that just as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named after the father of Saturn.[31][37][38][39] In 1789, Bode's Royal Academy colleague Martin Klaproth named his newly discovered element uranium in support of Bode's choice.[40] Ultimately, Bode's suggestion became the most widely used, and became universal in 1850 when HM Nautical Almanac Office, the final holdout, switched from using Georgium Sidus to Uranus.[38]\\r\\nUranus has two astronomical symbols. The first to be proposed, ?,[g] was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as \\"un globe surmont par la premire lettre de votre nom\\" (\\"a globe surmounted by the first letter of your surname\\").[36] A later proposal, ?,[h] is a hybrid of the symbols for Mars and the Sun because Uranus was the Sky in Greek mythology, which was thought to be dominated by the combined powers of the Sun and Mars.[41]\\r\\nUranus is called by a variety of translations in other languages. In Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese, its name is literally translated as the \\"sky king star\\" (tx).[42][43][44][45] In Thai, its official name is Dao Yurenat (??????????), as in English. Its other name in Thai is Dao Maritayu (????????, Star of M?tyu), after the Sanskrit word for \\"death\\", Mrtyu (??????). In Mongolian, its name is Tengeriin Van (׸ķ̸İҳ ־), translated as \\"King of the Sky\\", reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the heavens. In Hawaiian, its name is Heleekala. In Mori, its name is Whrangi.[46][47]\\r\\nUranus orbits the Sun once every 84 years. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 20?AU (3?billion?km; 2?billion?mi). The difference between its minimum and maximum distance from the Sun is 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet, though not as large as that of dwarf planet Pluto.[48] The intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of distance, and so on Uranus (at about 20 times the distance from the Sun compared to Earth) it is about 1/400 the intensity of light on Earth.[49] Its orbital elements were first calculated in 1783 by Pierre-Simon Laplace.[50] With time, discrepancies began to appear between the predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841, John Couch Adams first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845, Urbain Le Verrier began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On 23 September 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle located a new planet, later named Neptune, at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.[51]\\r\\nThe rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17?hours, 14?minutes. As on all the giant planets, its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about 60 degrees south, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours.[52]\\r\\nThe Uranian axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the plane of the Solar System, with an axial tilt of 97.77 (as defined by prograde rotation). This gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of the other planets. Near the solstice, one pole faces the Sun continuously and the other faces away. Only a narrow strip around the equator experiences a rapid dayÿnight cycle, but with the Sun low over the horizon. At the other side of Uranus's orbit the orientation of the poles towards the Sun is reversed. Each pole gets around 42?years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42?years of darkness.[53] Near the time of the equinoxes, the Sun faces the equator of Uranus giving a period of dayÿnight cycles similar to those seen on most of the other planets. In contrast to the other planets, whose motions around the Sun resemble that of spinning tops, Uranus's motion can be visualised as that of a ball rolling on the ecliptic plane near solstices and of a spinning rifle bullet near equinoxes.\\r\\nUranus reached its most recent equinox on 7 December 2007.[54][55]\\r\\nOne result of this axis orientation is that, averaged over the Uranian year, the polar regions of Uranus receive a greater energy input from the Sun than its equatorial regions. Nevertheless, Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles. The underlying mechanism that causes this is unknown. The reason for Uranus's unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty, but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized protoplanet collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation.[56] Uranus's south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun at the time of Voyager?2's flyby in 1986. The labelling of this pole as \\"south\\" uses the definition currently endorsed by the International Astronomical Union, namely that the north pole of a planet or satellite is the pole that points above the invariable plane of the Solar System, regardless of the direction the planet is spinning.[57][58] A different convention is sometimes used, in which a body's north and south poles are defined according to the right-hand rule in relation to the direction of rotation.[59]\\r\\nFrom 1995 to 2006, Uranus's apparent magnitude fluctuated between +5.6 and +5.9, placing it just within the limit of naked eye visibility at +6.5.[13] Its angular diameter is between 3.4 and 3.7?arcseconds, compared with 16 to 20?arcseconds for Saturn and 32 to 45?arcseconds for Jupiter.[13] At opposition, Uranus is visible to the naked eye in dark skies, and becomes an easy target even in urban conditions with binoculars.[5] In larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter of between 15 and 23?cm, Uranus appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb darkening. With a large telescope of 25?cm or wider, cloud patterns, as well as some of the larger satellites, such as Titania and Oberon, may be visible.[60]\\r\\nUranus's mass is roughly 14.5 times that of Earth, making it the least massive of the giant planets. Its diameter is slightly larger than Neptune's at roughly four times that of Earth. A resulting density of 1.27?g/cm3 makes Uranus the second least dense planet, after Saturn.[8][9] This value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane.[11] The total mass of ice in Uranus's interior is not precisely known, because different figures emerge depending on the model chosen; it must be between 9.3?and 13.5?Earth masses.[11][61] Hydrogen and helium constitute only a small part of the total, with between 0.5 and 1.5?Earth masses.[11] The remainder of the non-ice mass (0.5 to 3.7?Earth masses) is accounted for by rocky material.[11]\\r\\nThe standard model of Uranus's structure is that it consists of three layers: a rocky (silicate/ironÿnickel) core in the centre, an icy mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope.[11][62] The core is relatively small, with a mass of only 0.55?Earth masses and a radius less than 20% of Uranus's; the mantle comprises its bulk, with around 13.4?Earth masses, and the upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial, weighing about 0.5?Earth masses and extending for the last 20% of Uranus's radius.[11][62] Uranus's core density is around 9?g/cm3, with a pressure in the centre of 8?million?bars (800 GPa) and a temperature of about 5000?K.[61][62] The ice mantle is not in fact composed of ice in the conventional sense, but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water, ammonia and other volatiles.[11][62] This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a waterÿammonia ocean.[63]\\r\\nThe extreme pressure and temperature deep within Uranus may break up the methane molecules, with the carbon atoms condensing into crystals of diamond that rain down through the mantle like hailstones.[64][65] Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of liquid diamond, with floating solid 'diamond-bergs'.[66][67]\\r\\nThe bulk compositions of Uranus and Neptune are different from those of Jupiter and Saturn, with ice dominating over gases, hence justifying their separate classification as ice giants. There may be a layer of ionic water where the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions move freely within the oxygen lattice.[68]\\r\\nAlthough the model considered above is reasonably standard, it is not unique; other models also satisfy observations. For instance, if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, the total mass of ices in the interior will be lower, and, correspondingly, the total mass of rocks and hydrogen will be higher. Presently available data does not allow a scientific determination which model is correct.[61] The fluid interior structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface. The gaseous atmosphere gradually transitions into the internal liquid layers.[11] For the sake of convenience, a revolving oblate spheroid set at the point at which atmospheric pressure equals 1?bar (100 kPa) is conditionally designated as a \\"surface\\". It has equatorial and polar radii of 25,559?I?4?km (15,881.6?I?2.5?mi) and 24,973?I?20?km (15,518?I?12?mi), respectively.[8] This surface is used throughout this article as a zero point for altitudes.\\r\\nUranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low thermal flux.[17][69] Why Uranus's internal temperature is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun,[17] but Uranus radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is 7000106000000000000?1.06I0.08 times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere.[12][70] Uranus's heat flux is only 6998420000000000000?0.042I0.047?W/m2, which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about 6998750000000000000?0.075?W/m2.[70] The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49?K (?224.2?C; ?371.5?F), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.[12][70]\\r\\nOne of the hypotheses for this discrepancy suggests that when Uranus was hit by a supermassive impactor, which caused it to expel most of its primordial heat, it was left with a depleted core temperature.[71] This impact hypothesis is also used in some attempts to explain the planet's axial tilt. Another hypothesis is that some form of barrier exists in Uranus's upper layers that prevents the core's heat from reaching the surface.[11] For example, convection may take place in a set of compositionally different layers, which may inhibit the upward heat transport;[12][70] perhaps double diffusive convection is a limiting factor.[11]\\r\\nAlthough there is no well-defined solid surface within Uranus's interior, the outermost part of Uranus's gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its atmosphere.[12] Remote-sensing capability extends down to roughly 300?km below the 1?bar (100?kPa) level, with a corresponding pressure around 100?bar (10?MPa) and temperature of 320?K (47?C; 116?F).[72] The tenuous thermosphere extends over two planetary radii from the nominal surface, which is defined to lie at a pressure of 1 bar.[73] The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers: the troposphere, between altitudes of ?300 and 50?km (?186 and 31?mi) and pressures from 100 to 0.1?bar (10?MPa to 10?kPa); the stratosphere, spanning altitudes between 50 and 4,000?km (31 and 2,485?mi) and pressures of between 0.1 and 10?10?bar (10?kPa to 10?Pa); and the thermosphere extending from 4,000?km to as high as 50,000?km from the surface.[12] There is no mesosphere.\\r\\nThe composition of Uranus's atmosphere is different from its bulk, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium.[12] The helium molar fraction, i.e. the number of helium atoms per molecule of gas, is 6999150000000000000?0.15I0.03[15] in the upper troposphere, which corresponds to a mass fraction 6999260000000000000?0.26I0.05.[12][70] This value is close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of 6999275000000000000?0.275I0.01,[74] indicating that helium has not settled in its centre as it has in the gas giants.[12] The third-most-abundant component of Uranus's atmosphere is methane (CH\\r\\n4).[12] Methane has prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared (IR), making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour.[12] Methane molecules account for 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction below the methane cloud deck at the pressure level of 1.3?bar (130?kPa); this represents about 20 to 30?times the carbon abundance found in the Sun.[12][14][75] The mixing ratio[i] is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to its extremely low temperature, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out.[76] The abundances of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere are poorly known. They are probably also higher than solar values.[12][77] Along with methane, trace amounts of various hydrocarbons are found in the stratosphere of Uranus, which are thought to be produced from methane by photolysis induced by the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation.[78] They include ethane (C\\r\\n2H\\r\\n6), acetylene (C\\r\\n2H\\r\\n2), methylacetylene (CH\\r\\n3C\\r\\n2H), and diacetylene (C\\r\\n2HC\\r\\n2H).[76][79][80] Spectroscopy has also uncovered traces of water vapour, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere, which can only originate from an external source such as infalling dust and comets.[79][80][81]\\r\\nThe troposphere is the lowest and densest part of the atmosphere and is characterised by a decrease in temperature with altitude.[12] The temperature falls from about 320?K (47?C; 116?F) at the base of the nominal troposphere at ?300?km to 53?K (?220?C; ?364?F) at 50?km.[72][75] The temperatures in the coldest upper region of the troposphere (the tropopause) actually vary in the range between 49 and 57?K (?224 and ?216?C; ?371 and ?357?F) depending on planetary latitude.[12][69] The tropopause region is responsible for the vast majority of Uranus's thermal far infrared emissions, thus determining its effective temperature of 59.1?I?0.3?K (?214.1?I?0.3?C; ?353.3?I?0.5?F).[69][70]\\r\\nThe troposphere is thought to have a highly complex cloud structure; water clouds are hypothesised to lie in the pressure range of 50 to 100?bar (5 to 10?MPa), ammonium hydrosulfide clouds in the range of 20 to 40?bar (2 to 4?MPa), ammonia or hydrogen sulfide clouds at between 3 and 10?bar (0.3 and 1?MPa) and finally directly detected thin methane clouds at 1 to 2?bar (0.1 to 0.2?MPa).[12][14][72][82] The troposphere is a dynamic part of the atmosphere, exhibiting strong winds, bright clouds and seasonal changes.[17]\\r\\nThe middle layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the stratosphere, where temperature generally increases with altitude from 53?K (?220?C; ?364?F) in the tropopause to between 800 and 850?K (527 and 577?C; 980 and 1,070?F) at the base of the thermosphere.[73] The heating of the stratosphere is caused by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and other hydrocarbons,[84] which form in this part of the atmosphere as a result of methane photolysis.[78] Heat is also conducted from the hot thermosphere.[84] The hydrocarbons occupy a relatively narrow layer at altitudes of between 100 and 300?km corresponding to a pressure range of 10 to 0.1?mbar (10.00 to 0.10?hPa) and temperatures of between 75 and 170?K (?198 and ?103?C; ?325 and ?154?F).[76][79] The most abundant hydrocarbons are methane, acetylene and ethane with mixing ratios of around 10?7 relative to hydrogen. The mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is similar at these altitudes.[76][79][81] Heavier hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide have mixing ratios three orders of magnitude lower.[79] The abundance ratio of water is around 7G10?9.[80] Ethane and acetylene tend to condense in the colder lower part of stratosphere and tropopause (below 10?mBar level) forming haze layers,[78] which may be partly responsible for the bland appearance of Uranus. The concentration of hydrocarbons in the Uranian stratosphere above the haze is significantly lower than in the stratospheres of the other giant planets.[76][85]\\r\\nThe outermost layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the thermosphere and corona, which has a uniform temperature around 800 to 850?K.[12][85] The heat sources necessary to sustain such a high level are not understood, as neither the solar UV nor the auroral activity can provide the necessary energy to maintain these temperatures. The weak cooling efficiency due to the lack of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere above 0.1?mBar pressure level may contribute too.[73][85] In addition to molecular hydrogen, the thermosphere-corona contains many free hydrogen atoms. Their small mass and high temperatures explain why the corona extends as far as 50,000?km (31,000?mi), or two Uranian radii, from its surface.[73][85] This extended corona is a unique feature of Uranus.[85] Its effects include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings.[73] The Uranian thermosphere, together with the upper part of the stratosphere, corresponds to the ionosphere of Uranus.[75] Observations show that the ionosphere occupies altitudes from 2,000 to 10,000?km (1,200 to 6,200?mi).[75] The Uranian ionosphere is denser than that of either Saturn or Neptune, which may arise from the low concentration of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere.[85][86] The ionosphere is mainly sustained by solar UV radiation and its density depends on the solar activity.[87] Auroral activity is insignificant as compared to Jupiter and Saturn.[85][88]\\r\\nTemperature profile of the Uranian troposphere and lower stratosphere. Cloud and haze layers are also indicated.\\r\\nZonal wind speeds on Uranus. Shaded areas show the southern collar and its future northern counterpart. The red curve is a symmetrical fit to the data.\\r\\nBefore the arrival of Voyager 2, no measurements of the Uranian magnetosphere had been taken, so its nature remained a mystery. Before 1986, scientists had expected the magnetic field of Uranus to be in line with the solar wind, because it would then align with Uranus's poles that lie in the ecliptic.[89]\\r\\nVoyager's observations revealed that Uranus's magnetic field is peculiar, both because it does not originate from its geometric centre, and because it is tilted at 59 from the axis of rotation.[89][90] In fact the magnetic dipole is shifted from the Uranus's centre towards the south rotational pole by as much as one third of the planetary radius.[89] This unusual geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere, where the magnetic field strength on the surface in the southern hemisphere can be as low as 0.1?gauss (10?T), whereas in the northern hemisphere it can be as high as 1.1?gauss (110?T).[89] The average field at the surface is 0.23?gauss (23?T).[89] Studies of Voyager 2 data in 2017 suggest that this asymmetry causes Uranus's magnetosphere to connect with the solar wind once a Uranian day, opening the planet to the Sun's particles.[91] In comparison, the magnetic field of Earth is roughly as strong at either pole, and its \\"magnetic equator\\" is roughly parallel with its geographical equator.[90] The dipole moment of Uranus is 50?times that of Earth.[89][90] Neptune has a similarly displaced and tilted magnetic field, suggesting that this may be a common feature of ice giants.[90] One hypothesis is that, unlike the magnetic fields of the terrestrial and gas giants, which are generated within their cores, the ice giants' magnetic fields are generated by motion at relatively shallow depths, for instance, in the waterÿammonia ocean.[63][92] Another possible explanation for the magnetosphere's alignment is that there are oceans of liquid diamond in Uranus's interior that would deter the magnetic field.[66]\\r\\nDespite its curious alignment, in other respects the Uranian magnetosphere is like those of other planets: it has a bow shock at about 23 Uranian radii ahead of it, a magnetopause at 18 Uranian radii, a fully developed magnetotail, and radiation belts.[89][90][93] Overall, the structure of Uranus's magnetosphere is different from Jupiter's and more similar to Saturn's.[89][90] Uranus's magnetotail trails behind it into space for millions of kilometres and is twisted by its sideways rotation into a long corkscrew.[89][94]\\r\\nUranus's magnetosphere contains charged particles: mainly protons and electrons, with a small amount of H2+ ions.[90][93] No heavier ions have been detected. Many of these particles probably derive from the thermosphere.[93] The ion and electron energies can be as high as 4 and 1.2?megaelectronvolts, respectively.[93] The density of low-energy (below 1?kiloelectronvolt) ions in the inner magnetosphere is about 2?cm?3.[95] The particle population is strongly affected by the Uranian moons, which sweep through the magnetosphere, leaving noticeable gaps.[93] The particle flux is high enough to cause darkening or space weathering of their surfaces on an astronomically rapid timescale of 100,000?years.[93] This may be the cause of the uniformly dark colouration of the Uranian satellites and rings.[96] Uranus has relatively well developed aurorae, which are seen as bright arcs around both magnetic poles.[85] Unlike Jupiter's, Uranus's aurorae seem to be insignificant for the energy balance of the planetary thermosphere.[88]\\r\\nAt ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, Uranus's atmosphere is bland in comparison to the other giant planets, even to Neptune, which it otherwise closely resembles.[17] When Voyager 2 flew by Uranus in 1986, it observed a total of ten cloud features across the entire planet.[16][97] One proposed explanation for this dearth of features is that Uranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets. The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49?K (?224?C; ?371?F), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.[12][70]\\r\\nIn 1986, Voyager 2 found that the visible southern hemisphere of Uranus can be subdivided into two regions: a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands.[16] Their boundary is located at about ?45 of latitude. A narrow band straddling the latitudinal range from ?45 to ?50 is the brightest large feature on its visible surface.[16][98] It is called a southern \\"collar\\". The cap and collar are thought to be a dense region of methane clouds located within the pressure range of 1.3 to 2?bar (see above).[99] Besides the large-scale banded structure, Voyager?2 observed ten small bright clouds, most lying several degrees to the north from the collar.[16] In all other respects Uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in 1986. Voyager?2 arrived during the height of Uranus's southern summer and could not observe the northern hemisphere. At the beginning of the 21st century, when the northern polar region came into view, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck telescope initially observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in the northern hemisphere.[98] So Uranus appeared to be asymmetric: bright near the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the southern collar.[98] In 2007, when Uranus passed its equinox, the southern collar almost disappeared, and a faint northern collar emerged near 45 of latitude.[100]\\r\\nIn the 1990s, the number of the observed bright cloud features grew considerably partly because new high-resolution imaging techniques became available.[17] Most were found in the northern hemisphere as it started to become visible.[17] An early explanationthat bright clouds are easier to identify in its dark part, whereas in the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them ÿ was shown to be incorrect.[101][102] Nevertheless there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and brighter.[102] They appear to lie at a higher altitude.[102] The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude. Some small clouds live for hours; at least one southern cloud may have persisted since the Voyager 2 flyby.[17][97] Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus have a lot in common with those on Neptune.[17] For example, the dark spots common on Neptune had never been observed on Uranus before 2006, when the first such feature dubbed Uranus Dark Spot was imaged.[103] The speculation is that Uranus is becoming more Neptune-like during its equinoctial season.[104]\\r\\nThe tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds blowing in the upper troposphere of Uranus.[17] At the equator winds are retrograde, which means that they blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from ?360 to ?180?km/h (?220 to ?110?mph).[17][98] Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near I20 latitude, where the troposphere's temperature minimum is located.[17][69] Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with Uranus's rotation. Wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at I60 latitude before falling to zero at the poles.[17] Wind speeds at ?40 latitude range from 540 to 720?km/h (340 to 450?mph). Because the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the southern pole are impossible to measure.[17] In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as 860?km/h (540?mph) are observed near +50 latitude.[17][98][105]\\r\\nFor a short period from March to May 2004, large clouds appeared in the Uranian atmosphere, giving it a Neptune-like appearance.[102][106] Observations included record-breaking wind speeds of 820?km/h (510?mph) and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as \\"Fourth of July fireworks\\".[97] On 23 August 2006, researchers at the Space Science Institute (Boulder, Colorado) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on Uranus's surface, giving scientists more insight into Uranus's atmospheric activity.[103] Why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known, but it appears that Uranus's extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather.[55][104] Determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on Uranus's atmosphere have existed for less than 84 years, or one full Uranian year. Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes.[107] A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s.[108] Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice.[84] The majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in the viewing geometry.[101]\\r\\nThere are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus is known to have a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above.[104] During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim.[107] This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox.[104] Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the meridional albedo patterns.[104] In the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground-based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright),[99] whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity,[97] such as cloud formations and stronger winds, bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon.[102] This indeed happened in 2007 when it passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, and the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric, with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern.[100]\\r\\nThe mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear.[104] Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere.[99] The bright collar at ?45 latitude is also connected with methane clouds.[99] Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers.[99] The variation of the microwave emission from Uranus is probably caused by changes in the deep tropospheric circulation, because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.[109] Now that the spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on Uranus, the dynamics are changing and convection can occur again.[97][109]\\r\\nMany argue that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants extend to their formation.[110][111] The Solar System is hypothesised to have formed from a giant rotating ball of gas and dust known as the presolar nebula. Much of the nebula's gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, formed the Sun, and the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets. As the planets grew, some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to the nebula's leftover gas.[110][111] The more gas they held onto, the larger they became; the larger they became, the more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached, and their size began to increase exponentially. The ice giants, with only a few Earth masses of nebular gas, never reached that critical point.[110][111][112] Recent simulations of planetary migration have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to the Sun than their present positions, and moved outwards after formation (the Nice model).[110]\\r\\nUranus has 27 known natural satellites.[112] The names of these satellites are chosen from characters in the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.[62][113] The five main satellites are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.[62] The Uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the giant planets; the combined mass of the five major satellites would be less than half that of Triton (largest moon of Neptune) alone.[9] The largest of Uranus's satellites, Titania, has a radius of only 788.9?km (490.2?mi), or less than half that of the Moon, but slightly more than Rhea, the second-largest satellite of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System. Uranus's satellites have relatively low albedos; ranging from 0.20 for Umbriel to 0.35 for Ariel (in green light).[16] They are iceÿrock conglomerates composed of roughly 50% ice and 50% rock. The ice may include ammonia and carbon dioxide.[96][114]\\r\\nAmong the Uranian satellites, Ariel appears to have the youngest surface with the fewest impact craters and Umbriel's the oldest.[16][96] Miranda has fault canyons 20?km (12?mi) deep, terraced layers, and a chaotic variation in surface ages and features.[16] Miranda's past geologic activity is thought to have been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently, probably as a result of a former 3:1 orbital resonance with Umbriel.[115] Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are the likely origin of Miranda's 'racetrack'-like coronae.[116][117] Ariel is thought to have once been held in a 4:1 resonance with Titania.[118]\\r\\nUranus has at least one horseshoe orbiter occupying the SunÿUranus L3 Lagrangian pointa gravitationally unstable region at 180 in its orbit, 83982 Crantor.[119][120] Crantor moves inside Uranus's co-orbital region on a complex, temporary horseshoe orbit. 2010 EU65 is also a promising Uranus horseshoe librator candidate.[120]\\r\\nThe Uranian rings are composed of extremely dark particles, which vary in size from micrometres to a fraction of a metre.[16] Thirteen distinct rings are presently known, the brightest being the  ring. All except two rings of Uranus are extremely narrow ÿ they are usually a few kilometres wide. The rings are probably quite young; the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with Uranus. The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon (or moons) that was shattered by high-speed impacts. From numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts, only a few particles survived, in stable zones corresponding to the locations of the present rings.[96][121]\\r\\nWilliam Herschel described a possible ring around Uranus in 1789. This sighting is generally considered doubtful, because the rings are quite faint, and in the two following centuries none were noted by other observers. Still, Herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring's size, its angle relative to Earth, its red colour, and its apparent changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun.[122][123] The ring system was definitively discovered on 10 March 1977 by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. The discovery was serendipitous; they planned to use the occultation of the star SAO 158687 (also known as HD 128598) by Uranus to study its atmosphere. When their observations were analysed, they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind Uranus. They concluded that there must be a ring system around Uranus.[124] Later they detected four additional rings.[124] The rings were directly imaged when Voyager?2 passed Uranus in 1986.[16] Voyager?2 also discovered two additional faint rings, bringing the total number to eleven.[16]\\r\\nIn December 2005, the Hubble Space Telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest is located twice as far from Uranus as the previously known rings. These new rings are so far from Uranus that they are called the \\"outer\\" ring system. Hubble also spotted two small satellites, one of which, Mab, shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring. The new rings bring the total number of Uranian rings to 13.[125] In April 2006, images of the new rings from the Keck Observatory yielded the colours of the outer rings: the outermost is blue and the other one red.[126][127] One hypothesis concerning the outer ring's blue colour is that it is composed of minute particles of water ice from the surface of Mab that are small enough to scatter blue light.[126][128] In contrast, Uranus's inner rings appear grey.[126]\\r\\nAnimation about the discovering occultation in 1977.

This flyby remains the only investigation of Uranus carried out from a short distance and no other visits are planned. Launched in 1977, Voyager 2 made its closest approach to Uranus on 24 January 1986, coming within 81,500?km (50,600?mi) of the cloudtops, before continuing its journey to Neptune. The spacecraft studied the structure and chemical composition of Uranus's atmosphere,[75] including its unique weather, caused by its axial tilt of 97.77. It made the first detailed investigations of its five largest moons and discovered 10 new ones. It examined all nine of the system's known rings and discovered two more.[16][96][129] It also studied the magnetic field, its irregular structure, its tilt and its unique corkscrew magnetotail caused by Uranus's sideways orientation.[89]\\r\\nVoyager 1 was unable to visit Uranus because investigation of Saturn's moon Titan was considered a priority. This trajectory took Voyager 1 out the plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission.[130]:118\\r\\nThe possibility of sending the Cassini spacecraft from Saturn to Uranus was evaluated during a mission extension planning phase in 2009, but was ultimately rejected in favour of destroying it in the Saturnian atmosphere.[131] It would have taken about twenty years to get to the Uranian system after departing Saturn.[131] A Uranus orbiter and probe was recommended by the 2013ÿ2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey published in 2011; the proposal envisages launch during 2020ÿ2023 and a 13-year cruise to Uranus.[132] A Uranus entry probe could use Pioneer Venus Multiprobe heritage and descend to 1ÿ5 atmospheres.[132] The ESA evaluated a \\"medium-class\\" mission called Uranus Pathfinder.[133] A New Frontiers Uranus Orbiter has been evaluated and recommended in the study, The Case for a Uranus Orbiter.[134] Such a mission is aided by the ease with which a relatively big mass can be sent to the systemover 1500?kg with an Atlas 521 and 12-year journey.[135] For more concepts see Proposed Uranus missions.\\r\\nIn astrology, the planet Uranus () is the ruling planet of Aquarius.

A fifth single, a cover of Bruce Springsteen's \\"All That Heaven Will Allow,\\" peaked at number 49.\\r\\nin February 1994, piano player Jerry Dale McFadden joined the band as an auxiliary player and \\"fifth Maverick\\", though he was not at this point an official full member. He would contribute to all live shows and studio recordings from this point forward, beginning with 1995's Music for All Occasions. This album included the single \\"Here Comes the Rain,\\" which won the band a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal the following year.[1] Its follow-up was \\"All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down\\", their highest country chart peak at number 13.\\r\\nDuring 1996 into 1997, the band embarked on the \\"Tour for All Occasions\\" and released a live album, It's Now! It's Live!.\\r\\nTheir 1998 album Trampoline produced a number 4 UK hit in \\"Dance the Night Away\\" - remaining on the UK charts for over ten weeks and becoming one of the most recognizable songs for the Mavericks in the UK. \\"I've Got This Feeling\\" and \\"Someone Should Tell Her\\" also made the UK charts.[2] However, the album was not anywhere near as successful in the US, charting much lower than previous Mavericks album releases and failing to spin off any top 40 country singles.\\r\\nIn 1999, the band issued a \\"best-of\\" album featuring three new tracks, called Super Colossal Smash Hits of the 90s: The Best of The Mavericks. The album was quickly reissued the following year with two additional new tracks. However, the release did not spin off any top 40 hit singles in either the US or the UK, and the band found itself in a financially precarious situation. In February 2000 the band suspended payments to all their salaried employees, and in May they fired guitarist Nick Kane.[3] Malo embarked on a solo career at this time, and the group effectively dissolved for the next few years.\\r\\nIn 2003, the Mavericks were revived, with Eddie Perez added to the line-up in Kane's place. The band recorded a new album The Mavericks, but split up again shortly after the 2004 tour ended.\\r\\nIn October 2011, The Mavericks announced plans to reunite for a tour in 2012.[4] The line-up consisted of Malo, Deakin, Reynolds, Perez, and -- now as a full official member -- McFadden.\\r\\nIn February 2012, the group signed with Valory Music Co., an imprint of Big Machine Records.[5] They released a digital extended play titled Suited Up and Ready, and charted in early 2012 with \\"Born to Be Blue.\\" The full-length album, In Time, was released on Valory Records on 26 February 2013.\\r\\nFounding member Robert Reynolds was dismissed from the band in October 2014 after it was revealed that he had developed an addiction to opiate and was soliciting money from fans (under false pretences) to support his addiction, leaving Malo and Deakin as the two remaining original members. This revelation was not made public until December.[6]\\r\\nReynolds has not been replaced by a permanent band member. As Reynolds' addiction affected his playing, both before Reynolds's firing and after, session players played bass on Mavericks recordings and at live shows (where in recent years Reynolds played a \\"barely audible\\" acoustic guitar that was deliberately buried in the sound mix).[6] In his absence, Ed Friedland is the band's touring bassist.[7]\\r\\nThe Mavericks released a new album, Mono, on 17 February 2015.

Each component in the sample interacts slightly differently with the adsorbent material, causing different flow rates for the different components and leading to the separation of the components as they flow out the column.","context":"High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; formerly referred to as high-pressure liquid chromatography), is a technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. It relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid adsorbent material. Each component in the sample interacts slightly differently with the adsorbent material, causing different flow rates for the different components and leading to the separation of the components as they flow out the column.\\r\\nHPLC has been used for manufacturing (e.g. during the production process of pharmaceutical and biological products), legal (e.g. detecting performance enhancement drugs in urine), research (e.g. separating the components of a complex biological sample, or of similar synthetic chemicals from each other), and medical (e.g. detecting vitamin D levels in blood serum) purposes.[1]\\r\\nChromatography can be described as a mass transfer process involving adsorption. HPLC relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid and a sample mixture through a column filled with adsorbent, leading to the separation of the sample components. The active component of the column, the adsorbent, is typically a granular material made of solid particles (e.g. silica, polymers, etc.), 2ÿ50 m in size. The components of the sample mixture are separated from each other due to their different degrees of interaction with the adsorbent particles. The pressurized liquid is typically a mixture of solvents (e.g. water, acetonitrile and/or methanol) and is referred to as a \\"mobile phase\\". Its composition and temperature play a major role in the separation process by influencing the interactions taking place between sample components and adsorbent. These interactions are physical in nature, such as hydrophobic (dispersive), dipoleÿdipole and ionic, most often a combination.\\r\\nHPLC is distinguished from traditional (\\"low pressure\\") liquid chromatography because operational pressures are significantly higher (50ÿ350 bar), while ordinary liquid chromatography typically relies on the force of gravity to pass the mobile phase through the column. Due to the small sample amount separated in analytical HPLC, typical column dimensions are 2.1ÿ4.6?mm diameter, and 30ÿ250?mm length. Also HPLC columns are made with smaller sorbent particles (2ÿ50 m in average particle size). This gives HPLC superior resolving power (the ability to distinguish between compounds) when separating mixtures, which makes it a popular chromatographic technique.\\r\\nThe schematic of an HPLC instrument typically includes a degasser, sampler, pumps, and a detector. The sampler brings the sample mixture into the mobile phase stream which carries it into the column. The pumps deliver the desired flow and composition of the mobile phase through the column. The detector generates a signal proportional to the amount of sample component emerging from the column, hence allowing for quantitative analysis of the sample components. A digital microprocessor and user software control the HPLC instrument and provide data analysis. Some models of mechanical pumps in a HPLC instrument can mix multiple solvents together in ratios changing in time, generating a composition gradient in the mobile phase. Various detectors are in common use, such as UV/Vis, photodiode array (PDA) or based on mass spectrometry. Most HPLC instruments also have a column oven that allows for adjusting the temperature at which the separation is performed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sample mixture to be separated and analyzed is introduced, in a discrete small volume (typically microliters), into the stream of mobile phase percolating through the column. The components of the sample move through the column at different velocities, which are a function of specific physical interactions with the adsorbent (also called stationary phase). The velocity of each component depends on its chemical nature, on the nature of the stationary phase (column) and on the composition of the mobile phase. The time at which a specific analyte elutes (emerges from the column) is called its retention time. The retention time measured under particular conditions is an identifying characteristic of a given analyte.\\r\\nMany different types of columns are available, filled with adsorbents varying in particle size, and in the nature of their surface (\\"surface chemistry\\"). The use of smaller particle size packing materials requires the use of higher operational pressure (\\"backpressure\\") and typically improves chromatographic resolution (i.e. the degree of separation between consecutive analytes emerging from the column). Sorbent particles may be hydrophobic or polar in nature.\\r\\nCommon mobile phases used include any miscible combination of water with various organic solvents (the most common are acetonitrile and methanol). Some HPLC techniques use water-free mobile phases (see Normal-phase chromatography below). The aqueous component of the mobile phase may contain acids (such as formic, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid) or salts to assist in the separation of the sample components. The composition of the mobile phase may be kept constant (\\"isocratic elution mode\\") or varied (\\"gradient elution mode\\") during the chromatographic analysis. Isocratic elution is typically effective in the separation of sample components that are very different in their affinity for the stationary phase. In gradient elution the composition of the mobile phase is varied typically from low to high eluting strength. The eluting strength of the mobile phase is reflected by analyte retention times with high eluting strength producing fast elution (=short retention times). A typical gradient profile in reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% acetonitrile (in water or aqueous buffer) and progress linearly to 95% acetonitrile over 5ÿ25 minutes. Periods of constant mobile phase composition may be part of any gradient profile. For example, the mobile phase composition may be kept constant at 5% acetonitrile for 1ÿ3 min, followed by a linear change up to 95% acetonitrile.\\r\\nThe chosen composition of the mobile phase (also called eluent) depends on the intensity of interactions between various sample components (\\"analytes\\") and stationary phase (e.g. hydrophobic interactions in reversed-phase HPLC). Depending on their affinity for the stationary and mobile phases analytes partition between the two during the separation process taking place in the column. This partitioning process is similar to that which occurs during a liquidÿliquid extraction but is continuous, not step-wise. In this example, using a water/acetonitrile gradient, more hydrophobic components will elute (come off the column) late, once the mobile phase gets more concentrated in acetonitrile (i.e. in a mobile phase of higher eluting strength).\\r\\nThe choice of mobile phase components, additives (such as salts or acids) and gradient conditions depends on the nature of the column and sample components. Often a series of trial runs is performed with the sample in order to find the HPLC method which gives adequate separation.\\r\\nPrior to HPLC scientists used standard liquid chromatographic techniques. Liquid chromatographic systems were largely inefficient due to the flow rate of solvents being dependent on gravity. Separations took many hours, and sometimes days to complete. Gas chromatography (GC) at the time was more powerful than liquid chromatography (LC), however, it was believed that gas phase separation and analysis of very polar high molecular weight biopolymers was impossible.[3] GC was ineffective for many biochemists because of the thermal instability of the solutes.[4] As a result, alternative methods were hypothesized which would soon result in the development of HPLC.\\r\\nFollowing on the seminal work of Martin and Synge in 1941, it was predicted by Cal Giddings, Josef Huber, and others in the 1960s that LC could be operated in the high-efficiency mode by reducing the packing-particle diameter substantially below the typical LC (and GC) level of 150 m and using pressure to increase the mobile phase velocity.[3] These predictions underwent extensive experimentation and refinement throughout the 60s into the 70s. Early developmental research began to improve LC particles, and the invention of Zipax, a superficially porous particle, was promising for HPLC technology.[5]\\r\\nThe 1970s brought about many developments in hardware and instrumentation. Researchers began using pumps and injectors to make a rudimentary design of an HPLC system.[6] Gas amplifier pumps were ideal because they operated at constant pressure and did not require leak free seals or check valves for steady flow and good quantitation.[4] Hardware milestones were made at Dupont IPD (Industrial Polymers Division) such as a low-dwell-volume gradient device being utilized as well as replacing the septum injector with a loop injection valve.[4]\\r\\nWhile instrumentational developments were important, the history of HPLC is primarily about the history and evolution of particle technology.[4] After the introduction of porous layer particles, there has been a steady trend to reduced particle size to improve efficiency.[4] However, by decreasing particle size, new problems arose. The practical disadvantages stem from the excessive pressure drop needed to force mobile fluid through the column and the difficulty of preparing a uniform packing of extremely fine materials.[7] Every time particle size is reduced significantly, another round of instrument development usually must occur to handle the pressure.[4]\\r\\nPartition chromatography was one of the first kinds of chromatography that chemists developed.[8] The partition coefficient principle has been applied in paper chromatography, thin layer chromatography, gas phase and liquidÿliquid separation applications. The 1952 Nobel Prize in chemistry was earned by Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge for their development of the technique, which was used for their separation of amino acids.[9] Partition chromatography uses a retained solvent, on the surface or within the grains or fibers of an \\"inert\\" solid supporting matrix as with paper chromatography; or takes advantage of some coulombic and/or hydrogen donor interaction with the stationary phase. Analyte molecules partition between a liquid stationary phase and the eluent. Just as in Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC; a sub-technique within HPLC), this method separates analytes based on differences in their polarity. HILIC most often uses a bonded polar stationary phase and a mobile phase made primarily of acetonitrile with water as the strong component. Partition HPLC has been used historically on unbonded silica or alumina supports. Each works effectively for separating analytes by relative polar differences. HILIC bonded phases have the advantage of separating acidic, basic and neutral solutes in a single chromatographic run.[10]\\r\\nThe polar analytes diffuse into a stationary water layer associated with the polar stationary phase and are thus retained. The stronger the interactions between the polar analyte and the polar stationary phase (relative to the mobile phase) the longer the elution time. The interaction strength depends on the functional groups part of the analyte molecular structure, with more polarized groups (e.g. hydroxyl-) and groups capable of hydrogen bonding inducing more retention. Coulombic (electrostatic) interactions can also increase retention. Use of more polar solvents in the mobile phase will decrease the retention time of the analytes, whereas more hydrophobic solvents tend to increase retention times.\\r\\nNormalÿphase chromatography was one of the first kinds of HPLC that chemists developed. Also known as normal-phase HPLC (NP-HPLC) this method separates analytes based on their affinity for a polar stationary surface such as silica, hence it is based on analyte ability to engage in polar interactions (such as hydrogen-bonding or dipole-dipole type of interactions) with the sorbent surface. NP-HPLC uses a non-polar, non-aqueous mobile phase (e.g. Chloroform), and works effectively for separating analytes readily soluble in non-polar solvents. The analyte associates with and is retained by the polar stationary phase. Adsorption strengths increase with increased analyte polarity. The interaction strength depends not only on the functional groups present in the structure of the analyte molecule, but also on steric factors. The effect of steric hindrance on interaction strength allows this method to resolve (separate) structural isomers.\\r\\nThe use of more polar solvents in the mobile phase will decrease the retention time of analytes, whereas more hydrophobic solvents tend to induce slower elution (increased retention times). Very polar solvents such as traces of water in the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the solid surface of the stationary phase forming a stationary bound (water) layer which is considered to play an active role in retention. This behavior is somewhat peculiar to normal phase chromatography because it is governed almost exclusively by an adsorptive mechanism (i.e. analytes interact with a solid surface rather than with the solvated layer of a ligand attached to the sorbent surface; see also reversed-phase HPLC below). Adsorption chromatography is still widely used for structural isomer separations in both column and thin-layer chromatography formats on activated (dried) silica or alumina supports.\\r\\nPartition- and NP-HPLC fell out of favor in the 1970s with the development of reversed-phase HPLC because of poor reproducibility of retention times due to the presence of a water or protic organic solvent layer on the surface of the silica or alumina chromatographic media. This layer changes with any changes in the composition of the mobile phase (e.g. moisture level) causing drifting retention times.\\r\\nRecently, partition chromatography has become popular again with the development of Hilic bonded phases which demonstrate improved reproducibility, and due to a better understanding of the range of usefulness of the technique.\\r\\nThe basic principle of displacement chromatography is: A molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix (the displacer) will compete effectively for binding sites, and thus displace all molecules with lesser affinities.[11] There are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired in order to achieve maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than peaks. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentration.\\r\\nReversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) has a non-polar stationary phase and an aqueous, moderately polar mobile phase. One common stationary phase is a silica which has been surface-modified with RMe2SiCl, where R is a straight chain alkyl group such as C18H37 or C8H17. With such stationary phases, retention time is longer for molecules which are less polar, while polar molecules elute more readily (early in the analysis). An investigator can increase retention times by adding more water to the mobile phase; thereby making the affinity of the hydrophobic analyte for the hydrophobic stationary phase stronger relative to the now more hydrophilic mobile phase. Similarly, an investigator can decrease retention time by adding more organic solvent to the eluent. RP-HPLC is so commonly used that it is often incorrectly referred to as \\"HPLC\\" without further specification. The pharmaceutical industry regularly employs RP-HPLC to qualify drugs before their release.\\r\\nRP-HPLC operates on the principle of hydrophobic interactions, which originates from the high symmetry in the dipolar water structure and plays the most important role in all processes in life science. RP-HPLC allows the measurement of these interactive forces. The binding of the analyte to the stationary phase is proportional to the contact surface area around the non-polar segment of the analyte molecule upon association with the ligand on the stationary phase. This solvophobic effect is dominated by the force of water for \\"cavity-reduction\\" around the analyte and the C18-chain versus the complex of both. The energy released in this process is proportional to the surface tension of the eluent (water: 7.3G10?6?J/cm2, methanol: 2.2G10?6?J/cm2) and to the hydrophobic surface of the analyte and the ligand respectively. The retention can be decreased by adding a less polar solvent (methanol, acetonitrile) into the mobile phase to reduce the surface tension of water. Gradient elution uses this effect by automatically reducing the polarity and the surface tension of the aqueous mobile phase during the course of the analysis.\\r\\nStructural properties of the analyte molecule play an important role in its retention characteristics. In general, an analyte with a larger hydrophobic surface area (CÿH, CÿC, and generally non-polar atomic bonds, such as S-S and others) is retained longer because it is non-interacting with the water structure. On the other hand, analytes with higher polar surface area (conferred by the presence of polar groups, such as -OH, -NH2, COO? or -NH3+ in their structure) are less retained as they are better integrated into water. Such interactions are subject to steric effects in that very large molecules may have only restricted access to the pores of the stationary phase, where the interactions with surface ligands (alkyl chains) take place. Such surface hindrance typically results in less retention.\\r\\nRetention time increases with hydrophobic (non-polar) surface area. Branched chain compounds elute more rapidly than their corresponding linear isomers because the overall surface area is decreased. Similarly organic compounds with single CÿC bonds elute later than those with a C=C or CÿC triple bond, as the double or triple bond is shorter than a single CÿC bond.\\r\\nAside from mobile phase surface tension (organizational strength in eluent structure), other mobile phase modifiers can affect analyte retention. For example, the addition of inorganic salts causes a moderate linear increase in the surface tension of aqueous solutions (ca. 1.5G10?7?J/cm2 per Mol for NaCl, 2.5G10?7?J/cm2 per Mol for (NH4)2SO4), and because the entropy of the analyte-solvent interface is controlled by surface tension, the addition of salts tend to increase the retention time. This technique is used for mild separation and recovery of proteins and protection of their biological activity in protein analysis (hydrophobic interaction chromatography, HIC).\\r\\nAnother important factor is the mobile phase pH since it can change the hydrophobic character of the analyte. For this reason most methods use a buffering agent, such as sodium phosphate, to control the pH. Buffers serve multiple purposes: control of pH, neutralize the charge on the silica surface of the stationary phase and act as ion pairing agents to neutralize analyte charge. Ammonium formate is commonly added in mass spectrometry to improve detection of certain analytes by the formation of analyte-ammonium adducts. A volatile organic acid such as acetic acid, or most commonly formic acid, is often added to the mobile phase if mass spectrometry is used to analyze the column effluent. Trifluoroacetic acid is used infrequently in mass spectrometry applications due to its persistence in the detector and solvent delivery system, but can be effective in improving retention of analytes such as carboxylic acids in applications utilizing other detectors, as it is a fairly strong organic acid. The effects of acids and buffers vary by application but generally improve chromatographic resolution.\\r\\nReversed phase columns are quite difficult to damage compared with normal silica columns; however, many reversed phase columns consist of alkyl derivatized silica particles and should never be used with aqueous bases as these will destroy the underlying silica particle. They can be used with aqueous acid, but the column should not be exposed to the acid for too long, as it can corrode the metal parts of the HPLC equipment. RP-HPLC columns should be flushed with clean solvent after use to remove residual acids or buffers, and stored in an appropriate composition of solvent. The metal content of HPLC columns must be kept low if the best possible ability to separate substances is to be retained. A good test for the metal content of a column is to inject a sample which is a mixture of 2,2'- and 4,4'- bipyridine. Because the 2,2'-bipy can chelate the metal, the shape of the peak for the 2,2'-bipy will be distorted (tailed) when metal ions are present on the surface of the silica.[citation needed]..\\r\\nSize-exclusion chromatography (SEC), also known as gel permeation chromatography or gel filtration chromatography, separates particles on the basis of molecular size (actually by a particle's Stokes radius). It is generally a low resolution chromatography and thus it is often reserved for the final, \\"polishing\\" step of the purification. It is also useful for determining the tertiary structure and quaternary structure of purified proteins. SEC is used primarily for the analysis of large molecules such as proteins or polymers. SEC works by trapping these smaller molecules in the pores of a particle. The larger molecules simply pass by the pores as they are too large to enter the pores. Larger molecules therefore flow through the column quicker than smaller molecules, that is, the smaller the molecule, the longer the retention time.\\r\\nThis technique is widely used for the molecular weight determination of polysaccharides. SEC is the official technique (suggested by European pharmacopeia) for the molecular weight comparison of different commercially available low-molecular weight heparins.\\r\\nIn ion-exchange chromatography (IC), retention is based on the attraction between solute ions and charged sites bound to the stationary phase. Solute ions of the same charge as the charged sites on the column are excluded from binding, while solute ions of the opposite charge of the charged sites of the column are retained on the column. Solute ions that are retained on the column can be eluted from the column by changing the solvent conditions (e.g. increasing the ion effect of the solvent system by increasing the salt concentration of the solution, increasing the column temperature, changing the pH of the solvent, etc...).\\r\\nTypes of ion exchangers include:\\r\\nIn general, ion exchangers favor the binding of ions of higher charge and smaller radius.\\r\\nAn increase in counter ion (with respect to the functional groups in resins) concentration reduces the retention time. A decrease in pH reduces the retention time in cation exchange while an increase in pH reduces the retention time in anion exchange. By lowering the pH of the solvent in a cation exchange column, for instance, more hydrogen ions are available to compete for positions on the anionic stationary phase, thereby eluting weakly bound cations.\\r\\nThis form of chromatography is widely used in the following applications: water purification, preconcentration of trace components, ligand-exchange chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography of proteins, high-pH anion-exchange chromatography of carbohydrates and oligosaccharides, and others.\\r\\nThis chromatographic process relies on the property of biologically active substances to form stable, specific, and reversible complexes. The formation of these complexes involves the participation of common molecular forces such as the Van der Waals interaction, electrostatic interaction, dipole-dipole interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and the hydrogen bond. An efficient, biospecific bond is formed by a simultaneous and concerted action of several of these forces in the complementary binding sites.\\r\\nAqueous normal-phase chromatography (ANP) is a chromatographic technique which encompasses the mobile phase region between reversed-phase chromatography (RP) and organic normal phase chromatography (ONP). This technique is used to achieve unique selectivity for hydrophilic compounds, showing normal phase elution using reversed-phase solvents.[citation needed]\\r\\nA separation in which the mobile phase composition remains constant throughout the procedure is termed isocratic (meaning constant composition). The word was coined by Csaba Horvath who was one of the pioneers of HPLC.[citation needed],\\r\\nThe mobile phase composition does not have to remain constant. A separation in which the mobile phase composition is changed during the separation process is described as a gradient elution.[12] One example is a gradient starting at 10% methanol and ending at 90% methanol after 20 minutes. The two components of the mobile phase are typically termed \\"A\\" and \\"B\\"; A is the \\"weak\\" solvent which allows the solute to elute only slowly, while B is the \\"strong\\" solvent which rapidly elutes the solutes from the column. In reversed-phase chromatography, solvent A is often water or an aqueous buffer, while B is an organic solvent miscible with water, such as acetonitrile, methanol, THF, or isopropanol.\\r\\nIn isocratic elution, peak width increases with retention time linearly according to the equation for N, the number of theoretical plates. This leads to the disadvantage that late-eluting peaks get very flat and broad. Their shape and width may keep them from being recognized as peaks.\\r\\nGradient elution decreases the retention of the later-eluting components so that they elute faster, giving narrower (and taller) peaks for most components. This also improves the peak shape for tailed peaks, as the increasing concentration of the organic eluent pushes the tailing part of a peak forward. This also increases the peak height (the peak looks \\"sharper\\"), which is important in trace analysis. The gradient program may include sudden \\"step\\" increases in the percentage of the organic component, or different slopes at different times ÿ all according to the desire for optimum separation in minimum time.\\r\\nIn isocratic elution, the selectivity does not change if the column dimensions (length and inner diameter) change ÿ that is, the peaks elute in the same order. In gradient elution, the elution order may change as the dimensions or flow rate change.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe driving force in reversed phase chromatography originates in the high order of the water structure. The role of the organic component of the mobile phase is to reduce this high order and thus reduce the retarding strength of the aqueous component.\\r\\nHPLC separations have theoretical parameters and equations to describe the separation of components into signal peaks when detected by instrumentation such as by a UV detector or a mass spectrometer. The parameters are largely derived from two sets of chromatagraphic theory: plate theory (as part of Partition chromatography), and the rate theory of chromatography / Van Deemter equation. Of course, they can be put in practice through analysis of HPLC chromatograms, although rate theory is considered the more accurate theory.\\r\\nThey are analogous to the calculation of retention factor for a paper chromatography separation, but describes how well HPLC separates a mixture into two or more components that are detected as peaks (bands) on a chromatogram. The HPLC parameters are the: efficiency factor(N), the retention factor (kappa prime), and the separation factor (alpha). Together the factors are variables in a resolution equation, which describes how well two components' peaks separated or overlapped each other. These parameters are mostly only used for describing HPLC reversed phase and HPLC normal phase separations, since those separations tend to be more subtle than other HPLC modes (e.g. ion exchange and size exclusion).\\r\\nResolution equations relate the three factors such that high efficiency and separation factors improve the resolution of component peaks in a HPLC separation.\\r\\nThe internal diameter (ID) of an HPLC column is an important parameter that influences the detection sensitivity and separation selectivity in gradient elution. It also determines the quantity of analyte that can be loaded onto the column. Larger columns are usually seen in industrial applications, such as the purification of a drug product for later use. Low-ID columns have improved sensitivity and lower solvent consumption at the expense of loading capacity.\\r\\nMost traditional HPLC is performed with the stationary phase attached to the outside of small spherical silica particles (very small beads). These particles come in a variety of sizes with 5?m beads being the most common. Smaller particles generally provide more surface area and better separations, but the pressure required for optimum linear velocity increases by the inverse of the particle diameter squared.[13][14][15]\\r\\nThis means that changing to particles that are half as big, keeping the size of the column the same, will double the performance, but increase the required pressure by a factor of four. Larger particles are used in preparative HPLC (column diameters 5?cm up to >30?cm) and for non-HPLC applications such as solid-phase extraction.\\r\\nMany stationary phases are porous to provide greater surface area. Small pores provide greater surface area while larger pore size has better kinetics, especially for larger analytes. For example, a protein which is only slightly smaller than a pore might enter the pore but does not easily leave once inside.\\r\\nPumps vary in pressure capacity, but their performance is measured on their ability to yield a consistent and reproducible volumetric flow rate. Pressure may reach as high as 60?MPa (6000?lbf/in2), or about 600?atmospheres. Modern HPLC systems have been improved to work at much higher pressures, and therefore are able to use much smaller particle sizes in the columns (<2?m). These \\"Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography\\" systems or UHPLCs can work at up to 120?MPa (17,405?lbf/in2), or about 1200?atmospheres.[16] The term \\"UPLC\\" is a trademark of the Waters Corporation, but is sometimes used to refer to the more general technique of UHPLC.\\r\\nHPLC most commonly uses a UV-Vis absorbance detector, however, a wide range of other chromatography detectors can be used. A universal detector that complements UV-Vis absorbance detection is the Charged aerosol detector (CAD). A kind of commonly utilized detector includes refractive index detectors, which provide readings by measuring the changes in the refractive index of the effluent as it moves through the flow cell. In certain cases, it is possible to use multiple detectors, for example LCMS normally combines UV-Vis with a mass spectrometer.\\r\\nLarge numbers of samples can be automatically injected onto an HPLC system, by the use of HPLC autosamplers. In addition, HPLC autosamplers have an injection volume and technique which is exactly the same for each injection, consequently they provide a high degree of injection volume precision.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs briefly mentioned, HPLC has many applications in both laboratory and clinical science. It is a common technique used in pharmaceutical development, as it is a dependable way to obtain and ensure product purity.[17] While HPLC can produce extremely high quality (pure) products, it is not always the primary method used in the production of bulk drug materials.[18] According to the European pharmacopoeia, HPLC is used in only 15.5% of syntheses.[19] However, it plays a role in 44% of syntheses in the United States pharmacopoeia.[20] This could possibly be due to differences in monetary and time constraints, as HPLC on a large scale can be an expensive technique. An increase in specificity, precision, and accuracy that occurs with HPLC unfortunately corresponds to an increase in cost.\\r\\nThis technique is also used for detection of illicit drugs in urine. The most common method of drug detection is an immunoassay.[21] This method is much more convenient. However, convenience comes at the cost of specificity and coverage of a wide range of drugs. As HPLC is a method of determining (and possibly increasing) purity, using HPLC alone in evaluating concentrations of drugs is somewhat insufficient. With this, HPLC in this context is often performed in conjunction with mass spectrometry.[22] Using liquid chromatography instead of gas chromatography in conjunction with MS circumvents the necessity for derivitizing with acetylating or alkylation agents, which can be a burdensome extra step.[23] This technique has been used to detect a variety of agents like doping agents, drug metabolites, glucuronide conjugates, amphetamines, opioids, cocaine, BZDs, ketamine, LSD, cannabis, and pesticides[24][25] Performing HPLC in conjunction with Mass spectrometry reduces the absolute need for standardizing HPLC experimental runs.\\r\\nSimilar assays can be performed for research purposes, detecting concentrations of potential clinical candidates like anti-fungal and asthma drugs.[26] This technique is obviously useful in observing multiple species in collected samples, as well, but requires the use of standard solutions when information about species identity is sought out. It is used as a method to confirm results of synthesis reactions, as purity is essential in this type of research. However, mass spectrometry is still the more reliable way to identify species.\\r\\nMedical use of HPLC can include drug analysis, but falls more closely under the category of nutrient analysis. While urine is the most common medium for analyzing drug concentrations, blood serum is the sample collected for most medical analyses with HPLC.[27] Other methods of detection of molecules that are useful for clinical studies have been tested against HPLC, namely immunoassays. In one example of this, competitive protein binding assays (CPBA) and HPLC were compared for sensitivity in detection of vitamin D. Useful for diagnosing vitamin D deficiencies in children, it was found that sensitivity and specificity of this CPBA reached only 40% and 60%, respectively, of the capacity of HPLC.[28] While an expensive tool, the accuracy of HPLC is nearly unparalleled.","input":"How hplc is used as a separation technique?"},{"output":"391,232","context":"\\r\\nCoordinates: 2415N 7600W? / ?24.250N 76.000W? / 24.250; -76.000\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamas (/b??h?m?z/?(?listen)), known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas,[10] is a country within the Lucayan Archipelago.  The archipelagic state consists of more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean, and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands, southeast of the United States state of Florida, and east of the Florida Keys. The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence. The designation of \\"the Bahamas\\" can refer either to the country or to the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands. The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas territory as encompassing 470,000?km2 (180,000?sq?mi) of ocean space.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamas is the site of Columbus's first landfall in the New World in 1492. At that time, the islands were inhabited by the Lucayan, a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Taino people. Although the Spanish never colonised The Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718, when the British clamped down on piracy. After the American War of Independence, the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists in the Bahamas; they brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. Africans constituted the majority of the population from this period. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Subsequently, the Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves; the Royal Navy resettled Africans there liberated from illegal slave ships, North American slaves and Seminoles escaped here from Florida, and the government freed slaves carried on US domestic ships that had reached the Bahamas due to weather. Today, Afro-Bahamians make up nearly 90% of the population.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sovereign state of the Bahamas became an independent Commonwealth realm in 1973, retaining the British monarch, then and currently Queen Elizabeth II, as its head of state. In terms of gross domestic product per capita, The Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the Americas (following the United States and Canada), with an economy based on tourism and finance.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Bahamas is most likely derived from either the Tano ba ha ma (\\"big upper middle land\\"), which was a term for the region used by the indigenous Native Americans,[12] or possibly from the Spanish baja mar (\\"shallow water or sea\\" or \\"low tide\\") reflecting the shallow waters of the area. Alternatively, it may originate from Guanahani, a local name of unclear meaning.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nA peculiarity of the name is that the word The is a formal part of the abbreviated name and is, therefore, capitalised. So in contrast to \\"the Congo\\" and \\"the United Kingdom\\", it is proper to write \\"The Bahamas\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nTaino people moved into the uninhabited southern Bahamas from Hispaniola and Cuba around the 11th century, having migrated there from South America. They came to be known as the Lucayan people. An estimated 30,000 Lucayan inhabited the Bahamas at the time of Christopher Columbus's arrival in 1492.\\r\\n\\r\\nColumbus's first landfall in the New World was on an island he named San Salvador (known to the Lucayan as Guanahani). Some researchers believe this site to be present-day San Salvador Island (formerly known as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas. An alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on Samana Cay, according to calculations made in 1986 by National Geographic writer and editor Joseph Judge, based on Columbus's log. Evidence in support of this remains inconclusive. On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayan and exchanged goods with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish forced much of the Lucayan population to Hispaniola for use as forced labour. The slaves suffered from harsh conditions and most died from contracting diseases to which they had no immunity; half of the Taino died from smallpox alone.[15] The population of the Bahamas was severely diminished.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1648, the Eleutherian Adventurers, led by William Sayle, migrated from Bermuda. These English Puritans established the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named Eleutherathe name derives from the Greek word for freedom. They later settled New Providence, naming it Sayle's Island after one of their leaders. To survive, the settlers salvaged goods from wrecks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1670, King Charles II granted the islands to the Lords Proprietors of the Carolinas in North America. They rented the islands from the king with rights of trading, tax, appointing governors, and administering the country.[17] In 1684 Spanish corsair Juan de Alcon raided the capital, Charles Town (later renamed Nassau). In 1703, a joint Franco-Spanish expedition briefly occupied the Bahamian capital during the War of the Spanish Succession.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring proprietary rule, the Bahamas became a haven for pirates, including the infamous Blackbeard (circa 1680ÿ1718). To put an end to the 'Pirates' republic' and restore orderly government, Great Britain made the Bahamas a crown colony in 1718 under the royal governorship of Woodes Rogers. After a difficult struggle, he succeeded in suppressing piracy.[18] In 1720, Rogers led local militia to drive off a Spanish attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the US War of Independence in the late 18th century, the islands became a target for US naval forces under the command of Commodore Esek Hopkins. US Marines occupied the capital of Nassau for a fortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1782, following the British defeat at Yorktown, a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau. The city surrendered without a fight. Spain returned possession of the Bahamas to Great Britain the following year, under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. Before the news was received, however, the islands were recaptured by a small British force led by Andrew Deveaux.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter US independence, the British resettled some 7,300 Loyalists with their slaves in the Bahamas, including two thousand from New York[19] and at least 1,033 whites, 2,214 blacks and a few Creeks from East Florida. Most of the refugees resettled from New York had fled from other colonies, including West Florida, which the Spanish captured during the war.[20] The government granted land to the planters to help compensate for losses on the continent. These Loyalists, who included Deveaux, established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital. European Americans were outnumbered by the African-American slaves they brought with them, and ethnic Europeans remained a minority in the territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1807, the British abolished the slave trade, followed by the United States the next year. During the following decades, the Royal Navy intercepted the trade; they resettled in the Bahamas thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1820s during the period of the Seminole Wars in Florida, hundreds of North American slaves and African Seminoles escaped from Cape Florida to the Bahamas. They settled mostly on northwest Andros Island, where they developed the village of Red Bays. From eyewitness accounts, 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823, aided by Bahamians in 27 sloops, with others using canoes for the journey. This was commemorated in 2004 by a large sign at Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park.[21][22] Some of their descendants in Red Bays continue African Seminole traditions in basket making and grave marking.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States' National Park Service, which administers the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, is working with the African Bahamian Museum and Research Center (ABAC) in Nassau on development to identify Red Bays as a site related to North American slaves' search for freedom. The museum has researched and documented the African Seminoles' escape from southern Florida. It plans to develop interpretive programs at historical sites in Red Bay associated with the period of their settlement in the Bahamas.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1818,[25] the Home Office in London had ruled that \\"any slave brought to the Bahamas from outside the British West Indies would be manumitted.\\" This led to a total of nearly 300 slaves owned by US nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835.[26] The American slave ships Comet and Encomium used in the United States domestic coastwise slave trade, were wrecked off Abaco Island in December 1830 and February 1834, respectively. When wreckers took the masters, passengers and slaves into Nassau, customs officers seized the slaves and British colonial officials freed them, over the protests of the Americans. There were 165 slaves on the Comet and 48 on the Encomium. The United Kingdom finally paid an indemnity to the United States in those two cases in 1855, under the Treaty of Claims of 1853, which settled several compensation cases between the two countries.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nSlavery was abolished in the British Empire on 1 August 1834. After that British colonial officials freed 78 North American slaves from the Enterprise, which went into Bermuda in 1835; and 38 from the Hermosa, which wrecked off Abaco Island in 1840.[29] The most notable case was that of the Creole in 1841: as a result of a slave revolt on board, the leaders ordered the US brig to Nassau. It was carrying 135 slaves from Virginia destined for sale in New Orleans. The Bahamian officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the islands. The Creole case has been described as the \\"most successful slave revolt in U.S. history\\".[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese incidents, in which a total of 447 slaves belonging to US nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842, increased tension between the United States and the United Kingdom. They had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade. However, worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value, the United States argued that the United Kingdom should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress, as part of the international trade. The United States worried that the success of the Creole slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1940, the Duke of Windsor was appointed Governor of the Bahamas. He arrived in the colony with his wife, the Duchess. Although disheartened at the condition of Government House, they \\"tried to make the best of a bad situation\\".[31] He did not enjoy the position, and referred to the islands as \\"a third-class British colony\\".[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe opened the small local parliament on 29 October 1940. The couple visited the \\"Out Islands\\" that November, on Axel Wenner-Gren's yacht, which caused controversy;[33] the British Foreign Office strenuously objected because they had been advised (mistakenly) by United States intelligence that Wenner-Gren was a close friend of the Luftwaffe commander Hermann G?ring of Nazi Germany.[33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke was praised at the time for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands. A 1991 biography by Philip Ziegler, however, described him as contemptuous of the Bahamians and other non-European peoples of the Empire. He was praised for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in Nassau in June 1942, when there was a \\"full-scale riot\\".[35] Ziegler said that the Duke blamed the trouble on \\"mischief makers ÿ communists\\" and \\"men of Central European Jewish descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft\\".[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke resigned from the post on 16 March 1945.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern political development began after the Second World War. The first political parties were formed in the 1950s. The British Parliament authorised the islands as internally self-governing in 1964, with Sir Roland Symonette, of the United Bahamian Party, as the first Premier.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new constitution granting the Bahamas internal autonomy went into effect on 7 January 1964.[39] In 1967, Lynden Pindling of the Progressive Liberal Party, became the first native born Premier of the majority native Bahamian colony; in 1968 the title of the position was changed to Prime Minister. In 1968, Pindling announced that the Bahamas would seek full independence.[40] A new constitution giving the Bahamas increased control over its own affairs was adopted in 1968.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British House of Lords voted to give the Bahamas its independence on 22 June 1973.[42] Prince Charles delivered the official documents to Prime Minister Lynden Pindling, officially declaring the Bahamas a fully independent nation on 10 July 1973.[43] It joined the Commonwealth of Nations on the same day.[44] Sir Milo Butler was appointed the first Governor-General of the Bahamas (the official representative of Queen Elizabeth II) shortly after independence. The Bahamas joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on 22 August 1973,[45] and it joined the United Nations on 18 September 1973.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the twin pillars of tourism and offshore finance, the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s. Significant challenges in areas such as education, health care, housing, international narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration from Haiti continue to be issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of The Bahamas (UB) is the national higher education/tertiary system. Offering baccalaureate, masters and associate degrees, UB has three campuses, and teaching and research centres throughout the Bahamas. The University of The Bahamas was chartered on 10 November 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country lies between latitudes 20 and 28N, and longitudes 72 and 80W.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1864, the Governor of the Bahamas reported that there were 29 islands, 661 cays, and 2,387 rocks in the colony.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe closest island to the United States is Bimini, which is also known as the gateway to the Bahamas. The island of Abaco is to the east of Grand Bahama. The southeasternmost island is Inagua. The largest island is Andros Island. Other inhabited islands include Eleuthera, Cat Island, Rum Cay, Long Island, San Salvador Island, Ragged Island, Acklins, Crooked Island, Exuma, Berry Islands and Mayaguana. Nassau, capital city of the Bahamas, lies on the island of New Providence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the islands are low and flat, with ridges that usually rise no more than 15 to 20?m (49 to 66?ft). The highest point in the country is Mount Alvernia (formerly Como Hill) on Cat Island. It has an elevation of 63 metres (207?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the southeast, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and three more extensive submarine features called Mouchoir Bank, Silver Bank and Navidad Bank, are geographically a continuation of the Bahamas.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney has its own private island in the Bahamas called Castaway Cay. It is located near Great Abaco Island and was formerly known as Gorda Cay. In 1997, The Walt Disney Company purchased a 99-year land lease for the cay from the Bahamian government, set to expire in 2096.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe climate of the Bahamas is tropical savannah climate or Aw according to K?ppen climate classification. The low latitude, warm tropical Gulf Stream, and low elevation give the Bahamas a warm and winterless climate. As such, there has never been a frost or freeze reported in the Bahamas, although every few decades low temperatures can fall below 10?C (50?F) for a few hours when a severe cold outbreak comes off the North American mainland. There is only an 8?C difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama islands. As with most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is the wettest season. The Bahamas are often sunny and dry for long periods of time, and average more than 3,000 hours or 340 days[48] of sunlight annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nTropical storms and hurricanes can on occasion impact the Bahamas. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew passed over the northern portions of the islands, and Hurricane Floyd passed near the eastern portions of the islands in 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\n73?F\\r\\n\\r\\n73?F\\r\\n\\r\\n75?F\\r\\n\\r\\n79?F\\r\\n\\r\\n81?F\\r\\n\\r\\n82?F\\r\\n\\r\\n82?F\\r\\n\\r\\n82?F\\r\\n\\r\\n82?F\\r\\n\\r\\n81?F\\r\\n\\r\\n79?F\\r\\n\\r\\n75?F\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamas is part of the Lucayan Archipelago, which continues into the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Mouchoir Bank, the Silver Bank, and the Navidad Bank.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamas Platform, which includes the Bahamas, Southern Florida, Northern Cuba, the Turks and Caicos, and the Blake Plateau, formed about 150 Ma, not long after the formation of the North Atlantic.  The 6.4?km thick limestones, which predominately make up The Bahamas, date back to the Cretaceous.  These limestones would have been deposited in shallow seas, assumed to be a stretched and thinned portion of the North American continental crust.  Sediments were forming at about the same rate as the crust below was sinking due to the added weight.  Thus, the entire area consisted of a large marine plain with some islands.  Then, at about 80 Ma, the area became flooded by the Gulf Stream.  This resulted in the drowning of the Blake Plateau, the separation of The Bahamas from Cuba and Florida, the separation of the southeastern Bahamas into separate banks, the creation of the Cay Sal Bank, plus the Little and Great Bahama Banks.  Sedimentation from the \\"carbonate factory\\" of each bank, or atoll, continues today at the rate of about 2?cm per kyr. Coral reefs form the \\"retaining walls\\" of these atolls, within which oolites and pellets form.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoral growth was greater through the Tertiary, until the start of the Ice Ages, and hence those deposits are more abundant below a depth of 36 m.  In fact, an ancient extinct reef exists half a km seaward of the present one, 30 m below sea level.  Oolites form when oceanic water penetrate the shallow banks, increasing the temperature about 3?C and the salinity by 0.5 per cent. Cemented ooids are referred to as grapestone.  Additionally, giant stromatolites are found off the Exuma Cays.[52]:22,29ÿ30\\r\\n\\r\\nSea level changes resulted in a drop in sea level, causing wind blown oolite to form sand dunes with distinct cross-bedding.  Overlapping dunes form oolitic ridges, which become rapidly lithified through the action of rainwater, called eolianite.  Most islands have ridges ranging from 30 to 45 m, though Cat Island has a ridge 60 m in height.  The land between ridges is conducive to the formation of lakes and swamps.[52]:41ÿ59,61ÿ64\\r\\n\\r\\nSolution weathering of the limestone results in a \\"Bahamian Karst\\" topography.  This includes potholes, Blue holes such as Dean's Blue Hole, sinkholes, beachrock such as the Bimini Road (\\"pavements of Atlantis\\"), limestone crust, caves due to the lack of rivers, and sea caves.  Several blue holes are aligned along the South Andros Fault line. Tidal flats and tidal creeks are common, but the more impressive drainage patterns are formed by troughs and canyons such as Great Bahama Canyon with the evidence of turbidity currents and turbidite deposition.[52]:33ÿ40,65,72ÿ84,86\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stratigraphy of the islands consists of the Middle Pleistocene Owl's Hole Formation, overlain by the Late Pleistocene Grotto Beach Formation, and then the Holocene Rice Bay Formation.  However, these units are not necessarily stacked on top of each other but can be located laterally.  The oldest formation, Owl's Hole, is capped by a terra rosa paleosoil, as is the Grotto Beach, unless eroded.  The Grotto Beach Formation is the most widespread.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamas is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy headed by Queen Elizabeth II in her role as Queen of the Bahamas. Political and legal traditions closely follow those of the United Kingdom and the Westminster system. The Bahamas is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations as a Commonwealth realm, retaining the Queen as head of state (represented by a Governor-General).\\r\\n\\r\\nLegislative power is vested In a bicameral parliament, which consists of a 38-member House of Assembly (the lower house), with members elected from single-member districts, and a 16-member Senate, with members appointed by the Governor-General, including nine on the advice of the Prime Minister, four on the advice of the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, and three on the advice of the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. The House of Assembly carries out all major legislative functions. As under the Westminster system, the Prime Minister may dissolve Parliament and call a general election at any time within a five-year term.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prime Minister is the head of government and is the leader of the party with the most seats in the House of Assembly. Executive power is exercised by the Cabinet, selected by the Prime Minister and drawn from his supporters in the House of Assembly. The current Governor-General is Dame Marguerite Pindling, and the current Prime Minister is The Rt. Hon. Hubert Minnis MP.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement and association. The Judiciary of the Bahamas is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on English law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamas has a two-party system dominated by the centre-left Progressive Liberal Party and the centre-right Free National Movement. A handful of splinter parties have been unable to win election to parliament. These parties have included the Bahamas Democratic Movement, the Coalition for Democratic Reform, Bahamian Nationalist Party and the Democratic National Alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamas has strong bilateral relationships with the United States and the United Kingdom, represented by an ambassador in Washington and High Commissioner in London. The Bahamas also associates closely with other nations of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamanian military is the Royal Bahamas Defence Force (RBDF), the navy of the Bahamas which includes a land unit called Commando Squadron (Regiment) and an Air Wing (Air Force). Under the Defence Act, the RBDF has been mandated, in the name of the Queen, to defend the Bahamas, protect its territorial integrity, patrol its waters, provide assistance and relief in times of disaster, maintain order in conjunction with the law enforcement agencies of the Bahamas, and carry out any such duties as determined by the National Security Council. The Defence Force is also a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)'s Regional Security Task Force.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe RBDF came into existence on 31 March 1980. Their duties include defending the Bahamas, stopping drug smuggling, illegal immigration and poaching, and providing assistance to mariners. The Defence Force has a fleet of 26 coastal and inshore patrol craft along with 3 aircraft and over 1,100 personnel including 65 officers and 74 women.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe districts of the Bahamas provide a system of local government everywhere except New Providence (which holds 70% of the national population), whose affairs are handled directly by the central government. In 1996, the Bahamian Parliament passed the \\"Local Government Act\\" to facilitate the establishment of Family Island Administrators, Local Government Districts, Local District Councillors and Local Town Committees for the various island communities. The overall goal of this act is to allow the various elected leaders to govern and oversee the affairs of their respective districts without the interference of Central Government. In total, there are 32 districts, with elections being held every five years. There are 110 Councillors and 281 Town Committee members are elected to represent the various districts.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach Councillor or Town Committee member is responsible for the proper use of public funds for the maintenance and development of their constituency.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamas uses drive-on-the-Left traffic rules throughout the Commonwealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe districts other than New Providence are:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamian flag was adopted in 1973. Its colours symbolise the strength of the Bahamian people; its design reflects aspects of the natural environment (sun and sea) and economic and social development. The flag is a black equilateral triangle against the mast, superimposed on a horizontal background made up of three equal stripes of aquamarine, gold and aquamarine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coat of arms of the Bahamas contains a shield with the national symbols as its focal point. The shield is supported by a marlin and a flamingo, which are the national animals of the Bahamas. The flamingo is located on the land, and the marlin on the sea, indicating the geography of the islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn top of the shield is a conch shell, which represents the varied marine life of the island chain. The conch shell rests on a helmet. Below this is the actual shield, the main symbol of which is a ship representing the Santa Mara of Christopher Columbus, shown sailing beneath the sun. Along the bottom, below the shield appears a banner upon which is the national motto:[55]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Forward, Upward, Onward Together.\\" \\r\\nThe yellow elder was chosen as the national flower of the Bahamas because it is native to the Bahama islands, and it blooms throughout the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelection of the yellow elder over many other flowers was made through the combined popular vote of members of all four of New Providence's garden clubs of the 1970sthe Nassau Garden Club, the Carver Garden Club, the International Garden Club and the YWCA Garden Club.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey reasoned that other flowers grown theresuch as the bougainvillea, hibiscus and poincianahad already been chosen as the national flowers of other countries. The yellow elder, on the other hand, was unclaimed by other countries (although it is now also the national flower of the United States Virgin Islands) and also the yellow elder is native to the family islands.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the terms of GDP per capita, the Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the Americas.[57] It was revealed in the Panama Papers that The Bahamas is the jurisdiction with the most offshore entities or companies.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamas relies on tourism to generate most of its economic activity. Tourism as an industry not only accounts for over 60% of the Bahamian GDP, but provides jobs for more than half the country's workforce.[59] The Bahamas attracted 5.8 million visitors in 2012, more than 70% of whom were cruise visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter tourism, the next most important economic sector is banking and offshore international financial services, accounting for some 15% of GDP.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government has adopted incentives to encourage foreign financial business, and further banking and finance reforms are in progress. The government plans to merge the regulatory functions of key financial institutions, including the Central Bank of the Bahamas (CBB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.[citation needed] The Central Bank administers restrictions and controls on capital and money market instruments. The Bahamas International Securities Exchange consists of 19 listed public companies. Reflecting the relative soundness of the banking system (mostly populated by Canadian banks), the impact of the global financial crisis on the financial sector has been limited.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economy has a very competitive tax regime (classified as a tax haven). The government derives its revenue from import tariffs, VAT, licence fees, property and stamp taxes, but there is no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer.[60] In 2010, overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.2%.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAgriculture is the third largest sector of the Bahamian economy, representing 5ÿ7% of total GDP. An estimated 80% of the Bahamian food supply is imported. Major crops include onions, okra, tomatoes, oranges, grapefruit, cucumbers, sugar cane, lemons, limes, and sweet potatoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamas has an estimated population of 391,232, of which 25.9% are under 14, 67.2% 15 to 64 and 6.9% over 65. It has a population growth rate of 0.925% (2010), with a birth rate of 17.81/1,000 population, death rate of 9.35/1,000, and net migration rate of ?2.13 migrant(s)/1,000 population.[61] The infant mortality rate is 23.21 deaths/1,000 live births. Residents have a life expectancy at birth of 69.87 years: 73.49 years for females, 66.32 years for males. The total fertility rate is 2.0 children born/woman (2010).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most populous islands are New Providence, where Nassau, the capital and largest city, is located;[62] and Grand Bahama, home to the second largest city of Freeport.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the 99% response rate obtained from the race question on the 2010 Census questionnaire, 90.6% of the population identified themselves as being Black, 4.7% White and 2.1% of a mixed race (Black and White).[64] Three centuries prior, in 1722 when the first official census of the Bahamas was taken, 74% of the population was White and 26% Black.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the colonial era of plantations, Africans or Afro-Bahamians have been the largest ethnic group in the Bahamas, whose primary ancestry was based in West Africa. The first Africans to arrive to the Bahamas were freed slaves from Bermuda; they arrived with the Eleutheran Adventurers looking for new lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Haitian community in the Bahamas is also largely of African descent and numbers about 80,000. Due to an extremely high immigration of Haitians to the Bahamas, the Bahamian government started deporting illegal Haitian immigrants to their homeland in late 2014.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White Bahamian population are mainly the descendants of the English Puritans looking to flee religious persecution in England and American Loyalists escaping the American Revolution who arrived in 1649 and 1783, respectively.[66] Many Southern Loyalists went to the Abaco Islands, half of whose population was of European descent as of 1985.[67] The term white is usually used to identify Bahamians with Anglo ancestry, as well as \\"light-skinned\\" Afro-Bahamians. Sometimes Bahamians use the term Conchy Joe to describe people of Anglo descent.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nA small portion of the Euro-Bahamian population is descended from Greek labourers who came to help develop the sponging industry in the 1900s. They make up less than 1% of the nation's population, but have still preserved their distinct Greek Bahamian culture.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBahamians typically identify themselves simply as either black or white.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official language of the Bahamas is English. Many people speak an English-based creole language called Bahamian dialect (known simply as \\"dialect\\") or  \\"Bahamianese.\\" [69] Laurente Gibbs, a Bahamian writer and actor, was the first to coin the latter name in a poem and has since promoted its usage.[70][71] Both are used as autoglossonyms.[72] Haitian Creole, a French-based creole language is spoken by Haitians and their descendants, who make up of about 25% of the total population. It is known simply as Creole[1] to differentiate it from Bahamian English.[73] Also note that the Bahamas was once under British rule and therefore the English taught in the Bahamian schools is still \\"British-based\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nReligion in the Bahamas (2010)[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to International Religious Freedom Report 2008 prepared by United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, the islands' population is predominantly Christian. Protestant denominations are widespread and collectively account for more than 70% of the population, with Baptists representing 35% of the population, Anglicans 15%, Pentecostals 8%, Church of God 5%, Seventh-day Adventists 5% and Methodists 4%. There is also a significant Roman Catholic community accounting for about 14%.[75] There are also smaller communities of Jews, Muslims, Baha'is, Hindus, Rastafarians and practitioners of Obeah.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the less developed outer islands (or Family Islands), handicrafts include basketry made from palm fronds. This material, commonly called \\"straw\\", is plaited into hats and bags that are popular tourist items. Another use is for so-called \\"Voodoo dolls\\", even though such dolls are the result of foreign influences and not based in historic fact.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nA form of folk magic (obeah) is practised by some Bahamians, mainly in the Family Islands (out-islands) of the Bahamas.[77] The practice of obeah is illegal in the Bahamas and punishable by law.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nJunkanoo is a traditional Afro-Bahamian street parade of 'rushing', music, dance and art held in Nassau (and a few other settlements) every Boxing Day and New Year's Day. Junkanoo is also used to celebrate other holidays and events such as Emancipation Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegattas are important social events in many family island settlements. They usually feature one or more days of sailing by old-fashioned work boats, as well as an onshore festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany dishes are associated with Bahamian cuisine, which reflects Caribbean, African and European influences. Some settlements have festivals associated with the traditional crop or food of that area, such as the \\"Pineapple Fest\\" in Gregory Town, Eleuthera or the \\"Crab Fest\\" on Andros. Other significant traditions include story telling.\\r\\n\\r\\nBahamians have created a rich literature of poetry, short stories, plays and short fictional works. Common themes in these works are (1) an awareness of change, (2) a striving for sophistication, (3) a search for identity, (4) nostalgia for the old ways and (5) an appreciation of beauty. Some contributing writers are Susan Wallace, Percival Miller, Robert Johnson, Raymond Brown, O.M. Smith, William Johnson, Eddie Minnis and Winston Saunders.[79][80]\\r\\n\\r\\nBahamas culture is rich with beliefs, traditions, folklore and legend. The most well-known folklore and legends in the Bahamas includes Lusca in Andros Bahamas, Pretty Molly on Exuma Bahamas, the Chickcharnies of Andro Bahamas, and the Lost City of Atlantis on Bimini Bahamas.\\r\\n\\r\\nSport is a significant part of Bahamian culture. The national sport is cricket. Cricket has been played in the Bahamas from 1846,[81] the oldest sport being played in the country today. The Bahamas Cricket Association was formed in 1936, and from the 1940s to the 1970s, cricket was played amongst many Bahamians. Bahamas is not a part of the West Indies Cricket Board, so players are not eligible to play for the West Indies cricket team. The late 1970s saw the game begin to decline in the country as teachers, who had previously come from the United Kingdom with a passion for cricket, were replaced by teachers who had been trained in the United States. The Bahamian physical education teachers had no knowledge of the game and instead taught track and field, basketball, baseball, softball,[82] volleyball[83] and football[84] where primary and high schools compete against each other. Today cricket is still enjoyed by a few locals and immigrants in the country usually from Jamaica, Guyana, Haiti and Barbados. Cricket is played on Saturdays and Sundays at Windsor Park and Haynes Oval.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only other sporting event that began before cricket was horse racing, which started in 1796. The most popular spectator sports are those imported from United States, such as basketball,[85] American football[86] and baseball,[87] rather than from Great Britain, due to the country's close proximity to the United States, unlike their other Caribbean counterparts, where cricket, rugby, and netball have proven to be more popular.\\r\\n\\r\\nDexter Cambridge, Rick Fox, Ian Lockhart, Magnum Rolle, Buddy Hield and Deandre Ayton are a few Bahamians who joined Bahamian Mychal Thompson of the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA ranks.[88][89] Over the years American football has become much more popular than soccer, though not implemented in the high school system yet. Leagues for teens and adults have been developed by the Bahamas American Football Federation.[90] However soccer, as it is commonly known in the country, is still a very popular sport amongst high school pupils. Leagues are governed by the Bahamas Football Association. Recently the Bahamian government has been working closely with Tottenham Hotspur of London to promote the sport in the country as well as promoting the Bahamas in the European market. In 2013 'Spurs' became the first Premier League club to play an exhibition match in the Bahamas, facing the Jamaican national team. Joe Lewis, the owner of the club, is based in the Bahamas.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther popular sports are swimming,[92] tennis[93] and boxing,[94] where Bahamians have enjoyed some degree of success at the international level. Other sports such as golf,[95] rugby league,[96] rugby union,[97] beach soccer,[98] and netball are considered growing sports. Athletics, commonly known as 'track and field' in the country, is the most successful sport by far amongst Bahamians. Bahamians have a strong tradition in the sprints and jumps. Track and field is probably the most popular spectator sport in the country next to basketball due to their success over the years. Triathlons are gaining popularity in Nassau and the Family Islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nBahamians have gone on to win numerous track and field medals at the Olympic Games, IAAF World Championships in Athletics, Commonwealth Games and Pan American Games. Frank Rutherford is the first athletics olympic medallist for the country. He won a bronze medal for triple jump during the 1992 Summer Olympics.[99] Pauline Davis-Thompson, Debbie Ferguson, Chandra Sturrup, Savatheda Fynes and Eldece Clarke-Lewis teamed up for the first athletics Olympic Gold medal for the country when they won the 4 G 100 m relay at the 2000 Summer Olympics. They are affectionately known as the \\"Golden Girls\\".[100] Tonique Williams-Darling became the first athletics individual Olympic gold medallist when she won the 400m sprint in 2004 Summer Olympics.[101]  In 2007, with the disqualification of Marion Jones, Pauline Davis-Thompson was advanced to the gold medal position in the 200 metres at the 2000 Olympics, predating William-Darling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bahamas were hosts of the first men's senior FIFA tournament to be staged in the Caribbean, the 2017 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to 1995 estimates, 98.2% of the Bahamian adult population is literate.[citation needed]","input":"What is the current population of the bahamas?"},{"output":"Dhahran","context":"Saudi Arabian oil was first discovered by the Americans in commercial quantities at Dammam oil well No. 7 in 1938 in what is now modern day Dhahran.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 15, 1902, Ibn Saud took Riyadh from the Rashid tribe. In 1913, his forces captured the province of al-Hasa from the Ottoman Turks. In 1922, he completed his conquest of the Nejd, and in 1925, he conquered the Hijaz. In 1932, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was proclaimed with Ibn Saud as king.[2] Without stability in the region, the search for oil would have been difficult, as evidenced by early oil exploration in neighbouring countries such as Yemen and Oman.[3]\\r\\nPrior to 1938, there were three main factors that triggered the search for oil in Arabia:\\r\\nIn 1922, Ibn Saud met a New Zealand mining engineer named Major Frank Holmes. During World War I, Holmes had been to Gallipoli and then Ethiopia, where he first heard rumours of the oil seeps of the Persian Gulf region.[2] He was convinced that much oil would be found throughout the region. After the war, Holmes helped to set up Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd in order, among other things, to seek oil concessions in the region.\\r\\nIn 1923, the king signed a concession with Holmes allowing him to search for oil in eastern Saudi Arabia. Eastern and General Syndicate brought in a Swiss geologist to evaluate the land but he claimed that searching for oil in Arabia would be a pure gamble.[2] This discouraged the major banks and oil companies from investing in Arabian oil ventures.\\r\\nIn 1925, Holmes signed a concession with the sheikh of Bahrain, allowing him to search for oil there. He then proceeded to the United States to find an oil company that might be interested in taking on the concession. He found help from Gulf Oil. In 1927, Gulf Oil took control of the concessions that Holmes made years ago. But Gulf Oil was a partner in the Iraq Petroleum Company, which was jointly owned by Royal Dutch/Shell, Anglo-Persian, the Compagnie Fran?aise des Ptroles, and \\"the Near East Development Company, representing the interests of the American companies.[4] The partners had signed up to the Red Line Agreement which meant that Gulf Oil was precluded from taking up the Bahrain concession without the consent of the other partners; and they declined.[2] Despite a promising survey in Bahrain, Gulf Oil was forced to transfer its interest to another company, Standard Oil of California (SOCAL), which was not a bound by the Red Line Agreement.[5]\\r\\nMeanwhile Ibn Saud had dispatched American mining engineer Karl Twitchell to examine eastern Arabia. Twitchell found encouraging signs of oil, asphalt seeps in the vicinity of Qatif, but advised the king to await the outcome of the Bahrain No.1 well before inviting bids for a concession for al-Hasa.[6] To the American engineers working in Bahrain, standing on the Jebel Dukhan and gazing across a twenty-mile (32?km) stretch of the Persian Gulf at the Arabian Peninsula in the clear light of early morning, the outline of the low Dhahran hills in the distance were an obvious oil prospect.\\r\\nOn 31 May 1932, the SOCAL subsidiary, the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) struck oil on Bahrain.[2] The discovery brought fresh impetus to the search for oil on the Arabian peninsula.\\r\\nNegotiations for an oil concession for al-Hasa province opened at Jeddah in March, 1933. Twitchell attended with lawyer Lloyd Hamilton on behalf of SOCAL. The Iraq Petroleum Company represented by Stephen Longrigg competed in the bidding but SOCAL was granted the concession on 23 May 1933. Under the agreement, SOCAL was given exploration rights to some 930,000 square kilometers of land for 60 years.[2] Soon after the agreement, geologists arrived in al-Hasa and the search for oil was underway.\\r\\nSOCAL set up a subsidiary company, the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC) to develop the oil concession. SOCAL also joined forces with the Texas Oil Company when together they formed CALTEX in 1936 to take advantage of the latters formidable marketing network in Africa and Asia.\\r\\nWhen CASOC geologists surveyed the concession area, they identified a promising site and named it Dammam No. 7, after a nearby village. Over the next three years, the drillers were unsuccessful in making a commercial strike, but chief geologist Max Steineke persevered. He urged the team to drill deeper, even when Dammam No. 7 was plagued by cave-ins, stuck drill bits and other problems, before the drillers finally struck oil on 3 March 1938.[7] This discovery would turn out to be first of many, eventually revealing the largest source of crude oil in the world.[8] For the king, oil revenues became a crucial source of wealth since he no longer had to rely on receipts from pilgrimages to Mecca. This discovery would alter Middle Eastern political relations forever.\\r\\nIn 1943, the name of the company in control in Saudi Arabia was changed to Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO). In addition, numerous changes were made to the original concession after the striking of oil. In 1939, the first modification gave the Arabian American Oil Company a greater area to search for oil and extended the concession until 1949, increasing the original deal by six years. In return, ARAMCO agreed to provide the Saudi Arabian government with large amounts of free kerosene and gasoline, and to pay higher payments than originally stipulated.\\r\\nBeginning in 1950, the Saudi Arabian government began a pattern of trying to increase government shares of revenue from oil production. In 1950, a fifty-fifty profit-sharing agreement was signed, whereby a tax was levied by the government. This tax considerably increased government revenues. The government continued this trend well into the 80s. By 1982, ARAMCOs concession area was reduced to 220,000 square kilometers, down from the original 930,000 square kilometers. By 1988, ARAMCO was officially bought out by Saudi Arabia and became known as Saudi Aramco.\\r\\nDue to the quantity of the oil in Saudi Arabia, construction of pipelines became necessary to increase efficiency of production and transport. ARAMCO soon realized that advantages of a pipeline to the Mediterranean Sea seemed obvious, saving about 3,200 kilometers of sea travel and the transit fees of the Suez Canal.[9] In 1945, the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company (Tapline) was started and was completed in 1950. The pipeline greatly increased efficiency of oil transport, but also had its shortcomings. Issues concerning taxes and damages plagued it for years. It had to be shut down numerous times for repairs, and by 1983 was officially shut down.[9]\\r\\nThis conflict was also known as the Yom Kippur War. This was a conflict between Egypt, Syria and their backers versus Israel. The conflict was the continuation of a troubling historical pattern of conflict between Israel and the Arab world. Because the United States was a supporter of Israel, the Arab countries participated in an oil boycott of Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[10] This boycott later includes Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. This was one of the major causes of the 1973 energy crisis that occurred in the United States.[11] After the completion of the war, the price of oil increased drastically allowing Saudi Arabia to gain much wealth and power.[12]","input":"Where was oil first discovered in middle east?"},{"output":"European","context":"The people and culture of New Orleans have made  New Orleans, Louisiana, unique among and distinct from other cities in the United States, including other Southern U.S. cities.  New Orleans in modern times has been described as being not a Southern city but a Caribbean city.[1][2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a locale once used by Choctaw, Houmas, and other Indians,[4][5] prominent cultural influences date to the French and Spanish colonial periods and the introduction of African slaves in the 18th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican English, with significant variations, is the dominant language in New Orleans. Despite the city's French colonial history, French is rarely used in daily life. However, its expressions and pronunciation have influenced various dialects in New Orleans, and it was still in significant use at the start of the 20th century. There are nine French immersion schools in the Greater New Orleans area and French is still spoken among elites in the city.  The city has a long tradition of Hispanic immigrants dating back to the 18th century. Louisiana French, Spanish and  Vietnamese are also heard in the city; Louisiana French speakers from southeast Louisiana entered the city during the 1970sÿ1980s oil boom, and a sizable Vietnamese community established itself in the city in the last third of the 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe distinctive local accent is unlike either Creole or the stereotypical Southern accent so often misportrayed by film and television actors. It does, like earlier Southern Englishes, feature frequent deletion of post-vocalic \\"r\\".  There are many theories of the origin of the accent, but it likely results from New Orleans' geographic isolation by water, and the fact that New Orleans was a major port of entry into the United States throughout the 19th century [1].  Many of the immigrant groups who reside in Brooklyn also reside in New Orleans, with the largest groups being Irish, Germans, and Italians (with Sicilians predominating in the last group).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prestige associated with being from New Orleans by many residents is likely a factor in the linguistic assimilation of the ethnically divergent population. This distinctive accent is dying out generation by generation in the city (but remains very strong in the surrounding parishes). As with many sociolinguistic artifacts, it is usually attested much more strongly by older members of the population. One subtype of the New Orleans accent is sometimes identified as Yat (from \\"Where y'at). This word is not used as a generalized term for the New Orleans accent, and is generally reserved for the strongest varieties.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Orleans is usually pronounced by locals as \\"noo-AW-lyenz\\", \\"noo-AW-linz\\", \\"noo-OR-linz\\", or \\"noo-OR-lyenz\\".  The tendency among people around the world to say \\"noo-or-LEENZ\\" stems from the use of that pronunciation by singers and songwriters, who find it easy to rhyme.[citation needed]  The pronunciation \\"NAW-linz\\" is likewise not generally used nor liked by locals but has been popularized by the tourist trade.[6][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso notable are lexical items specific to the city, such as lagniappe /?l?nj?p/ meaning \\"a little something extra,\\" makin' groceries for grocery shopping, or neutral ground for a street median.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Orleans has always been a significant center for music with its intertwined European, Latin American, and African-American cultures. It was the site of the first opera house in the United States.[9]  The city engendered jazz with its brass bands.[10][11] Decades later it was home to a distinctive brand of rhythm and blues that contributed greatly to the growth of rock and roll. In addition, the nearby countryside is the home of Creole music, Zydeco music, Jazz, and Delta blues.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Orleans has consistently experienced a high homicide rate during the previous two to three decades. Its average annual per-capita homicide rate (59 per 100,000) ranks highest of large cities in the country from 1990ÿ2010 based on Bureau Of Justice Statistics from FBI Uniform Crime Reports. In 1994, 421 people were killed (85.8 per 100,000 people), a homicide rate which has not been matched by any major city to date.[12] The homicide rate rose and fell year to year throughout the late 1990s, but the overall trend from 1994 to 1999 was a steady reduction in homicides.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 2000, the homicide rate again increased. New Orleans had the highest homicide rate of any major American city in 2000 (42.1 per 100,000 people) 2001 (44.0 per 100,000) 2002 (53.1 per 100,000) 2003 (57.7 per 100,000) 2004 (56.0 per 100,000) In 2005, there were 202 murders after 8 months a rate of 47 per 100,000, which was still a higher rate than any other major city's 12 month rate, but was not official because there was still 1 month left until the end of 3rd quarter crime data was to be released.In 2006,(70 per 100,000) 2007 (81 per 100,000) 2008 (64 per 100,000) 2009 (52 per 100,000) 2010 (51 per 100,000) and 2011 (58 per 100,000) it was more of the same as the previous years with New Orleans posting the highest per capta homicide rate of any major American city, or 12 years in a row annually until 2012,when the rate (53 per 100,000) was the 2nd highest among major U.S. cities. In 2004,2006,2007,2008,2009, and 2011 New Orleans' per capita homicide rate led cities with populations of 100,000 or more residents, which made it the nation's murder capital of the above-mentioned years with annual per capita homicide rates that were at least ten times the U.S. average in each of those years, according to Bureau of Justice Statistics from FBI Uniform Crime Reports, NOLA.com, and criminologist Dr.Peter Scharf {[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Hurricane Katrina (2005), news media attention focused on the reduced violent-crime rate following the exodus of many New Orleanians. That trend began to reverse itself as people returned to the city, although calculating the homicide rate remained difficult when no authoritative source could cite a total population figure.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, most victims in New Orleans were killed within three months of their last arrest.[15] The homicide rate for the New Orleans metropolitan statistical area, which includes the suburbs, was 24.4 per 100,000 in 2002.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major newspaper is The Times-Picayune, publishing since 1837. It publishes six days a week and delivers to homes three days a week. The New Orleans Advocate, an edition of The Advocate of Baton Rouge, publishes and delivers to homes in the New Orleans area daily. Alternative weekly publications include The Louisiana Weekly and Gambit Weekly.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreater New Orleans is well served by television and radio. The market is the 51st largest Designated Market Area (DMA) in the U.S., serving 633,140 homes and 0.559% of the U.S. Major television network affiliates serving the area include WWL 4 (CBS), WGNO 26 (ABC), WDSU 6 (NBC), WVUE 8 (FOX), WNOL 38 (WB), WUPL 54 (UPN), and WPXL 49 (ION). PBS stations include WYES 12 and WLAE 32. WHNO 20 also operates as an independent station in the area, providing mainly religious programming.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio stations serving Greater New Orleans include:\\r\\n\\r\\nGreater New Orleans has many visitor attractions, including Uptown's St. Charles Avenue, home of Tulane University, Loyola University, many stately 19th-century mansions, and the St. Charles Streetcar Line.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French Quarter (known locally as \\"the Quarter\\"), which dates from the French and Spanish eras, is probably the main tourist destination. The neighborhood contains many hotels, restaurants, and bars, most notably around Bourbon Street. Other attractions in the quarter include Jackson Square, St. Louis Cathedral, the French Market (including the Caf du Monde, famous for caf au lait and beignets), and Preservation Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso located near the French Quarter is the old New Orleans Mint, formerly a branch of the United States Mint (and the only mint of the Confederacy), which now operates as a museum. The National WWII Museum is relatively new, having opened in 2000 as the National D-Day Museum. The Natchez is an authentic steamboat with a calliope, which cruises the Mississippi River twice daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several locations of the Louisiana State Museum in the city, as well as the National Park Service's Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve, a multi-site development. The city has a number of additional historical museums and house museums, such as the Historic New Orleans Collection, the Hermann-Grima House, Gallier House, a pharmacy museum, and the nation's second-largest (after Richmond, Virginia) Confederate museum, Confederate Memorial Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt museums in the city include the New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA) in City Park and the Ogden Museum of Southern Art. Audubon Park and the Audubon Zoo are also located in the city of New Orleans, as is the Aquarium of the Americas. New Orleans is noted for its historic cemeteries. Two of the oldest and largest cemeteries are Saint Louis Cemetery and Metairie Cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant gardens include Longue Vue House and Gardens and the New Orleans Botanical Garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreater New Orleans is home to numerous annual celebrations, including Mardi Gras, New Year's Eve celebrations, and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. New Orleans' most famous celebration is its Carnival Season. The Carnival season is often known (especially by out-of-towners) by the name of the last and biggest day, Mardi Gras (literally, \\"Fat Tuesday\\"), held just before the beginning of the Catholic liturgical season of Lent. Mardi Gras celebrations include parades and floats; participants toss strings of cheap colorful beads and doubloons to the crowds. The Mardi Gras season is kicked off with the only parade allowed through the French Quarter (Vieux Carr, translated Old Square), a walking parade aptly named Krewe du Vieux.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest of the city's many musical festivals is the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Commonly referred to simply as, \\"Jazz Fest\\", it is one of the largest music festivals in the nation, and features crowds coming from all over the world to experience music, food, arts, and crafts. Despite the name, it features not only jazz but a large variety of music, including both native Louisiana music and nationally-known popular music artists.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouthern Decadence is a New Orleans-style celebration of the gay community. It is a six-day event that attracts over 160,000 locals and visitors.  The annual event began in 1972 to empower the gay community of South Louisiana and has grown to be one of the largest gay events in the nation.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city also hosts two college football bowl games annually: the New Orleans Bowl and the Sugar Bowl. The city also holds the Bayou Classic, which is an annual college football game between Grambling State University and Southern University. Nine Super Bowls have been contested in New Orleans.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, many teams have been formerly located in the city, including the New Orleans Pelicans baseball team (1887ÿ1959), the New Orleans Breakers of the United States Football League, the New Orleans Night of the Arena Football League (1991ÿ1992), and the New Orleans Brass ice hockey team (1997ÿ2003). Former basketball teams were the New Orleans Buccaneers (c.?1967ÿ1970), and the New Orleans Jazz (1974ÿ1980) which became the Utah Jazz.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Orleans is also home to Southern Yacht Club, located at West End on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain. Established in 1849, it is the second oldest yacht club in the United States. The building was severely damaged, first by storm surge and then by fire, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Orleans Square, a replica of the French Quarter, was built in Disneyland in 1966, with buildings and landscaping meant to evoke 19th-century New Orleans. When it opened, Walt Disney had then-New Orleans mayor Victor H. Schiro made honorary mayor of New Orleans Square.  Schiro, in turn, made Disney an honorary citizen of the real New Orleans.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMovie sets have been built in different parts of the world purporting to resemble the French Quarter or other parts of New Orleans.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Orleans is world-famous for its food. The indigenous cuisine is distinctive and influential. From centuries of amalgamation of local Creole, haute Creole, Cajun, and New Orleans French cuisines, New Orleans food has developed. Local ingredients combined with French, Spanish, Italian, African, Native American, and a hint of Cuban food traditions combine to produce a truly unique and easily recognizable Louisiana flavor.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnique specialties include beignets, square-shaped fried pastries that could be called \\"French doughnuts\\" (served with coffee and chicory, known as caf au lait); po' boy and Italian muffuletta sandwiches; Gulf oysters on the half-shell, boiled crawfish, and other seafood; touffe, jambalaya, gumbo, and other Creole dishes; and the Monday favorite of red beans and rice (Louis Armstrong often signed his letters, \\"Red beans and ricely yours\\"). New Orleans residents enjoy some of the best restaurants in the United States that cater specifically to locals, and visitors are encouraged to try the local establishments recommended by their hosts.","input":"What are the different cultures in new orleans?"},{"output":"at least five or six years","context":"The ministerial orders of the Roman Catholic Church (for similar but different rules among Eastern Catholics see Eastern Catholic Church) are those of bishop, presbyter (more commonly called priest in English), and deacon. The ordained priesthood and the common priesthood (or priesthood of all the baptized faithful) are different in function and essence.[1][2] The Catholic Church teaches that when a man participates in priesthood, he participates in the priesthood of Christ Himself. All men who, through the Sacrament of Holy Orders, have become priests participate in Christ's priesthood; they act in persona Christi Capitis, in the person of Christ, the Head of His Body, the Church.[3]\\r\\nUnlike usage in English, \\"the Latin words sacerdos and sacerdotium are used to refer in general to the ministerial priesthood shared by bishops and presbyters. The words presbyter, presbyterium and presbyteratus refer to priests in the English use of the word or presbyters.\\"[4] According to the Annuario Pontificio 2016, as of December 31, 2014, there were 415,792 Catholic priests worldwide, including both diocesan priests and priests in the religious orders.[5] A priest of the regular clergy is commonly addressed with the title \\"Father\\" (abbreviated Fr., in the Roman Catholic and some other Christian churches).[6]\\r\\nThe state of consecrated life or monasticism is a separate, third distinct vocational state from the clergy and the laity. As an overview, there are the members of the laitywho are married or unmarried, and the clergythe bishops, priests, and deacons. Deacons are male and usually belong to the diocesan clergy, but, unlike almost all Latin-rite (Western Catholic) priests and all bishops from Eastern or Western Catholicism, they may marry as laymen before their ordination as clergy.[7]\\r\\nMembers of institutes of consecrated life, or monks, can be either clergy or non-ordained members of the religious order (male or female non-ordained religious are not to be considered laypersons in the strict sensethey take certain vows and are not free to marry once they have made solemn profession of vows; all female religious are non-ordained, they may be sisters living to some degree of activity in a communal state, or nuns living in cloister or some other type of isolation). The male members of religious orders, whether living in monastic communities or cloistered in isolation, and who are ordained priests or deacons constitute what is called the religious or regular clergy, distinct from the diocesan or secular clergy. Those ordained priests or deacons who are not members of some sort of religious order (secular priests) most often serve as clergy to a specific church or in an office of a specific diocese or in Rome.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Old Testament describes how God made his people \\"a kingdom of priests and a holy nation,\\"[9] and within the twelve tribes of Israel, the tribe of Levi was chosen to be set apart for the liturgical service of offering sacrifice as priests.[10] The priest was understood as a mediator between God and human beings who offers sacrifices and intercedes for the people.\\r\\nThe New Testament depicts Jesus as the \\"great high priest\\" of the New Covenant who, instead of offering the ritual animal sacrifices prescribed by the Jewish Law, offers himself on the cross as the true and perfect sacrifice.[11] The Catholic priesthood is a participation in this priesthood of Christ, and therefore traces its origins to Jesus Christ himself. Thus, the New Testament says that as high priest, Jesus has made the Church \\"a kingdom of priests for his God and Father.\\"[12] All who are baptized are given a share in the priesthood of Christ; that is, they are conformed to Christ and made capable of offering true worship and praise to God as Christians. \\"The whole community of believers is, as such, priestly.\\"[13]\\r\\nThe ministerial priesthood of Catholic priests and bishopswhat most people think of as \\"the Catholic priesthood\\"has a distinct history. This ministerial priesthood is at the service of the priesthood of all believers and involves the direct consecration of a man to Christ through the sacrament of orders, so that he can act in the person of Christ for the sake of the Christian faithful, above all in dispensing the sacraments. It is understood to have begun at the Last Supper, when Jesus Christ instituted the Eucharist in the presence of the Twelve Apostles, commanding them to \\"do this in memory of me.\\"\\r\\nThe Catholic priesthood, therefore, is a share in the priesthood of Christ and traces its historical origins to the Twelve Apostles appointed by Christ. Those apostles in turn selected other men to succeed them as the bishops (episkopoi, Greek for \\"overseers\\") of the Christian communities, with whom were associated presbyters (presbyteroi, Greek for \\"elders\\") and deacons (diakonoi, Greek for \\"servants\\"). As communities multiplied and grew in size, the bishops appointed more and more presbyters to preside at the Eucharist in place of the bishop in the multiple communities in each region. The diaconate evolved as the liturgical assistants of the bishop and his delegate for the administration of Church funds and programmes for the poor. Today, the rank of \\"presbyter\\" is typically what one thinks of as a priest, although technically both a bishop and a presbyter are \\"priests\\" in the sense that they share in Christ's ministerial priesthood and offer sacrifice to God in the person of Christ.[14]\\r\\nIn the decade of the 2010s, catholic priests as a group garnered public attention due to the numerous cases of sexual abuse of children by catholic clergy being revealed.\\r\\nThe theology of the Catholic priesthood is rooted in the priesthood of Christ and to some degree shares elements of the ancient Hebraic priesthood as well.[15] A priest is one who presides over a sacrifice and offers that sacrifice and prayers to God on behalf of believers. Jewish priesthood which functioned at the temple in Jerusalem offered animal sacrifices at various times throughout the year for a variety of reasons.\\r\\nIn Christian theology, Jesus is the Lamb provided by God himself as a sacrifice for the sins of the world. Before his death on the cross, Jesus celebrated the Passover with his disciples (the Last Supper) and offered blessings over the bread and wine respectively, saying: \\"Take and eat. This is my body\\" and \\"Drink from this all of you, for this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, poured out for the forgiveness of sins.\\" (Matthew 26:26ÿ28 Jerusalem Bible). The next day Christ's body and blood were visibly sacrificed on the cross.\\r\\nCatholics believe that it is this same body, sacrificed on the cross and risen on the third day and united with Christ's divinity, soul and blood which is made present in the offering of each Eucharistic sacrifice which is called the Eucharist. However, Catholicism does not believe that transubstantiation and the doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist involves a material change in the 'accidental' features: i.e. under normal circumstances, scientific analysis of the Eucharistic elements would indicate the physical-material properties of wine and bread.\\r\\nThus Catholic priests, in presiding at the Eucharist, join each offering of the Eucharistic elements in union with the sacrifice of Christ.[16] Through their celebration of the Holy Eucharist, they make present the one eternal sacrifice of Christ on the cross.\\r\\nCatholicism does not teach that Christ is sacrificed again and again, but that \\"The sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are one single sacrifice.\\".[17] Instead, the Catholic Church holds the Jewish concept of memorial in which \\"..the memorial is not merely a recollection of past events....these events become in a certain way present and real.\\" and thus \\"...the sacrifice Christ offered once and for all on the cross remains ever present.\\"[18] Properly speaking, in Catholic theology, expressed by Saint Thomas Aquinas, \\"Only Christ is the true priest, the others being only his ministers.\\"[19] Thus, Catholic clergy share in the one, unique, Priesthood of Christ.[20]\\r\\nThe Canon law of the Catholic Church holds that the priesthood is a sacred and perpetual vocational state, not just a profession (which is a reason for, and symbolized by, the state of celibacy). There are programs of formation and studies which aim to enable the future priest to effectively serve his ministry. These programs are demanded by canon law (in the Latin rite, canons 232ÿ264) which also refers to the Bishops' Conferences for local more detailed regulation. As a general rule, education is extensive and lasts at least five or six years, depending on the national Programme of Priestly Formation.[21]\\r\\nRegardless of where a person prepares for ordination, it includes not only academic but also human, social, spiritual and pastoral formation. The purpose of seminary education is ultimately to prepare men to be pastors of souls.[23] In the end, however, each individual Ordinary (such as a bishop or Superior General) is responsible for the official call to priesthood, and only a bishop may ordain. Any ordinations done before the normally scheduled time (before study completion) must have the explicit approval of the bishop; any such ordinations done more than a year in Holy See.\\r\\nThe Rite of Ordination is what \\"makes\\" one a priest, having already been a deacon and with the minister of Holy Orders being a validly ordained bishop.[24]\\r\\nThe Rite of Ordination occurs within the context of Holy Mass. After being called forward and presented to the assembly, the candidates are interrogated. Each promises to diligently perform the duties of the Priesthood and to respect and obey his ordinary (bishop or religious superior). Then the candidates lie prostrate before the altar, while the assembled faithful kneel and pray for the help of all the saints in the singing of the Litany of the Saints.\\r\\nThe essential part of the rite is when the bishop silently lays his hands upon each candidate (followed by all priests present), before offering the consecratory prayer, addressed to God the Father, invoking the power of the Holy Spirit upon those being ordained.\\r\\nAfter the consecratory prayer, the newly ordained is vested with the stole and chasuble of those belonging to the Ministerial Priesthood and then the bishop anoints his hands with chrism before presenting him with the chalice and paten which he will use when presiding at the Eucharist. Following this, the gifts of bread and wine are brought forward by the people and given to the new priest; then all the priests present, concelebrate the Eucharist with the newly ordained taking the place of honour at the right of the bishop. If there are several newly ordained, it is they who gather closest to the bishop during the Eucharistic Prayer.\\r\\nThe laying of hands of the priesthood is found in 1 Timothy 4:14:\\r\\nDo not neglect the gift you have, which was conferred on you through the prophetic word with the imposition of hands of the presbyterate.\\"\\r\\nThe following is the full text of the Rite during the Mass (after the Prelude, the Introit, the Procession, the Opening Hymn, the Kyrie, the Gloria, the Opening Prayer, and the First and Second Readings and the Gospel have all taken place), taken from a program for an ordination of priests for the Diocese of Peoria in 2015:\\r\\nThe Calling of the Candidates: Those to be ordained are called by name, they stand in their place and answer: \\"Present\\".\\r\\nThe Presentation of the Priest Candidates:\\r\\nVocation Director: Most Reverend Father, Holy Mother Church asks you to ordain these, our brothers, to the responsibility of the Priesthood.\\r\\nBishop: Do you know them to be worthy?\\r\\nVocation Director: After inquiry among the Christian people and upon the recommendation of those responsible, I testify that they have been found worthy.\\r\\nBishop: Relying on the help of the Lord God and our Savior Jesus Christ, we choose these men, our brothers, for the Order of the Priesthood.\\r\\nAll: Thanks be to God. (Applause).\\r\\nHomily of the Bishop\\r\\nPromise of the Elect:\\r\\nBishop: My dear sons, before you enter the Order of the Priesthood, you must declare before the people of God your intention to undertake this office. Do you resolve, with the help of the Holy Spirit, to discharge without fail the office of Priesthood in the presbyteral rank, as worthy fellow workers with the Order of Bishops in caring for the Lord's flock?\\r\\nElect: I do.\\r\\nBishop: Do you resolve to exercise the ministry of the word worthily and wisely, preaching the Gospel and teaching the Catholic faith?\\r\\nElect: I do.\\r\\nBishop: Do you resolve to celebrate faithfully and reverently, in accord with the Church's tradition, the mysteries of Christ, especially the Sacrifice of the Eucharist and the Sacrament of Reconciliation, for the glory of God and the sanctification of the Christian people?\\r\\nElect: I do.\\r\\nBishop: Do you resolve to implore with us God's mercy upon the people entrusted to your care by observing the command to pray without ceasing?\\r\\nElect: I do.\\r\\nBishop: Do you resolve to be united more closely every day to Christ the High Priest, who offered himself for us to the Father as a pure Sacrifice, and with him to consecrate yourselves to God for the salvation of all?\\r\\nElect: I do, with the help of God.\\r\\nPromise of Obedience of the Priest Candidates:\\r\\nEach of the candidates goes to the Bishop and, kneeling before him, places his joined hands between those of the Bishop.\\r\\nBishop: Do you promise respect and obedience to me and my successors?\\r\\nElect: I do.\\r\\nBishop: May God, who has begun this good work in you bring it to fulfillment.\\r\\nInvitation to Prayer\\r\\nLitany of the Saints\\r\\nLaying on of Hands: The Bishop first lays hands on the head of each candidate, followed by the concelebrating priests and all the priests present.\\r\\nPrayer of Consecration\\r\\nInvestiture with the Stole and Chasuble\\r\\nAnointing of Hands: The Bishop receives the linen gremial and anoints with Sacred Chrism the palms of each new priest as he kneels before him.\\r\\nProcession of the Gifts of Bread and Wine by the relatives of the ordained and Offertory Hymn\\r\\nPresentation of the Gifts\\r\\nThe Bishop stands and gives the kiss of peace to the new priests, followed by the concelebrants and all the priests present. The Liturgy of the Eucharist (the Preparation of the Altar, the Sanctus, the Memorial Acclamation, the Great Amen, the Lamb of God (Agnus Dei), the Communion Antiphon and Hymn, and the Prayer after Communion and Solemn Blessing and Dismissal) then proceeds as normal, with the newly ordained to the immediate right of the Bishop and the other celebrants.\\r\\nThe earliest Christians were Jews and Jewish tradition has always deemed the married state as more spiritual than the celibate state.[25] However Christian tradition places a high valuation on chastity as a special gift of God. The life of a priest involves being conformed to Christ. It is known that the Apostle Peter had a spouse from Gospel stories of Peter's mother-in-law sick with fever (Matt 8:14, Mark 1:29, Luke 4:38)[26] and from Paul's mention that Peter took along a believing wife in his ministry (1 Cor 9:5).\\r\\nFrom its beginnings, the idea of clerical celibacy has been contested in canon courts, in theology, and in religious practices. Celibacy for Roman Catholic priests was not mandated under canon law for the universal church until the Second Lateran Council in 1139.[27]\\r\\nThe Council of Elvira in Spain (c. 305ÿ306) was the first council to call for clerical celibacy. In February 385, Pope Siricius wrote the Directa decretal, which was a long letter to Spanish bishop Himerius of Tarragona, replying to the bishops requests on various subjects, which had been sent several months earlier to Pope Damasus I.[28] It was the first of a series of documents published by the Church's magisterium that claimed apostolic origin for clerical celibacy and reminded ministers of the altar of the perpetual continence required.\\r\\nWithin a century of the Great Schism of 1054, the Churches of the East and West arrived at different disciplines as to abstaining from sexual contact during marriage. In the East, candidates for the Priesthood could be married with permission to have regular sexual relations with their wives, but were required to abstain before celebrating the Eucharist. An unmarried person, once ordained, could not marry. Additionally, the Christian East required that, before becoming a bishop, a priest separate from his wife (she was permitted to object), with her typically becoming a nun. In the East, more normally, bishops are chosen from those priests who are monks and are thus unmarried.\\r\\nIn the West, the law of celibacy became mandatory by Pope Gregory VII at the Roman Synod of 1074.[29][30] This law mandated that, in order to become a candidate for ordination, a man could not be married. The law remains in effect in the Latin Church, although not for those who are priests of the Eastern Catholic Churches, who remain under their own discipline. The issue of mandatory celibacy in the Latin Church continues to be debated.[citation needed]\\r\\nThree main aspects to the priesthood: offering the Eucharist, hearing confessions, and counseling.[31] Whilst continuing to hold the importance of these three aspects of priesthood, the church now has a significantly broader understanding. Priests are also responsible for daily recitation of the principal and minor offices of the Liturgy of the Hours.[32] Priests are the only ministers of the Sacrament of Penance[33] and Anointing of the Sick.[34][35] They are the ordinary ministers of Baptism and witnesses to Holy Matrimony.[36]\\r\\nWorldwide, the number of priests has remained fairly steady since 1970, decreasing by about 5,000. This stagnation is due to a balance of large growth in Africa and Asia and a significant decrease in North America and Europe.","input":"How many years does it take to become a roman catholic priest?"},{"output":"a slow moving landslide","context":"The Slumgullion Earthflow in the San Juan Mountains in Hinsdale County, Colorado has been a National Natural Landmark since 1983.

Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist.[1] Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres (6.2?mi), they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Once formed, they no longer actively generate heat and cool over time; however, they may still evolve further through collision or accretion. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons. Neutron stars are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle, just as white dwarfs are supported against collapse by electron degeneracy pressure. If the remnant star has a mass greater than about 3 solar masses, it continues collapsing to form a black hole.\\r\\nNeutron stars that can be observed are very hot and typically have a surface temperature around 7005600000000000000?600000?K.[2][3][4][5][a] They are so dense that a normal-sized matchbox containing neutron-star material would have a mass of approximately 3 billion tonnes, or a 0.5 cubic kilometre chunk of the Earth (a cube with edges of about 800 metres).[6][7] Their magnetic fields are between 108 and 1015 (100 million to 1 quadrillion) times as strong as that of the Earth. The gravitational field at the neutron star's surface is about 7011200000000000000?2G1011 (200 billion) times that of the Earth.\\r\\nAs the star's core collapses, its rotation rate increases as a result of conservation of angular momentum, hence newly formed neutron stars rotate at up to several hundred times per second. Some neutron stars emit beams of electromagnetic radiation that make them detectable as pulsars. Indeed, the discovery of pulsars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 was the first observational suggestion that neutron stars exist. The radiation from pulsars is thought to be primarily emitted from regions near their magnetic poles. If the magnetic poles do not coincide with the rotational axis of the neutron star, the emission beam will sweep the sky, and when seen from a distance, if the observer is somewhere in the path of the beam, it will appear as pulses of radiation coming from a fixed point in space (the so-called \\"lighthouse effect\\"). The fastest-spinning neutron star known is PSR J1748-2446ad, rotating at a rate of 716 times a second[8][9] or 43,000 revolutions per minute, giving a linear speed at the surface on the order of 6999240000000000000?0.24?c (i.e. nearly a quarter the speed of light).\\r\\nThere are thought to be around 100 million neutron stars in the Milky Way, a figure obtained by estimating the number of stars that have undergone supernova explosions.[10] However, most are old and cold, and neutron stars can only be easily detected in certain instances, such as if they are a pulsar or part of a binary system. Slow-rotating and non-accreting neutron stars are virtually undetectable; however, since the Hubble Space Telescope detection of RX J185635-3754, a few nearby neutron stars that appear to emit only thermal radiation have been detected. Soft gamma repeaters are conjectured to be a type of neutron star with very strong magnetic fields, known as magnetars, or alternatively, neutron stars with fossil disks around them.[11]\\r\\nNeutron stars in binary systems can undergo accretion which typically makes the system bright in x-rays while the material falling onto the neutron star can form hotspots that rotate in and out of view in identified X-ray pulsar systems. Additionally, such accretion can \\"recycle\\" old pulsars and potentially cause them to gain mass and spin-up to very fast rotation rates, forming the so-called millisecond pulsars. These binary systems will continue to evolve, and eventually the companions can become compact objects such as white dwarfs or neutron stars themselves, though other possibilities include a complete destruction of the companion through ablation or merger. The merger of binary neutron stars may be the source of short-duration gamma-ray bursts and are likely strong sources of gravitational waves. In 2017, a direct detection (GW170817) of the gravitational waves from such an event was made,[12] and gravitational waves have also been indirectly detected in a system where two neutron stars orbit each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAny main-sequence star with an initial mass of above 8 times the mass of the sun (8?M?) has the potential to produce a neutron star. As the star evolves away from the main sequence, subsequent nuclear burning produces an iron-rich core. When all nuclear fuel in the core has been exhausted, the core must be supported by degeneracy pressure alone. Further deposits of mass from shell burning cause the core to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Electron-degeneracy pressure is overcome and the core collapses further, sending temperatures soaring to over 7009500000000000000?5G109?K. At these temperatures, photodisintegration (the breaking up of iron nuclei into alpha particles by high-energy gamma rays) occurs. As the temperature climbs even higher, electrons and protons combine to form neutrons via electron capture, releasing a flood of neutrinos. When densities reach nuclear density of 7017400000000000000?4G1017?kg/m3, neutron degeneracy pressure halts the contraction. The infalling outer envelope of the star is halted and flung outwards by a flux of neutrinos produced in the creation of the neutrons, becoming a supernova. The remnant left is a neutron star. If the remnant has a mass greater than about 3?M?, it collapses further to become a black hole.[13]\\r\\nAs the core of a massive star is compressed during a Type II supernova, Type Ib or Type Ic supernova, and collapses into a neutron star, it retains most of its angular momentum. But, because it has only a tiny fraction of its parent's radius (and therefore its moment of inertia is sharply reduced), a neutron star is formed with very high rotation speed, and then over a very long period it slows. Neutron stars are known that have rotation periods from about 1.4?ms to 30?s. The neutron star's density also gives it very high surface gravity, with typical values ranging from 1012 to 1013?m/s2 (more than 1011 times that of Earth).[5] One measure of such immense gravity is the fact that neutron stars have an escape velocity ranging from 100,000 km/s to 150,000 km/s, that is, from a third to half the speed of light. The neutron star's gravity accelerates infalling matter to tremendous speed. The force of its impact would likely destroy the object's component atoms, rendering all the matter identical, in most respects, to the rest of the neutron star.\\r\\nA neutron star has a mass of at least 1.1 and perhaps up to 3 solar masses (M?).[14][15] The maximum observed mass of neutron stars is about 2.01?M?. But in general, compact stars of less than 1.39?M? (the Chandrasekhar limit) are white dwarfs, whereas compact stars with a mass between 1.4?M? and 3?M? (the TolmanÿOppenheimerÿVolkoff limit) should be neutron stars (though there is an interval of a few tenths of a solar mass where the masses of low-mass neutron stars and high-mass white dwarfs can overlap). Between 3?M? and 5?M?, hypothetical intermediate-mass stars such as quark stars and electroweak stars have been proposed, but none have been shown to exist. Beyond 10?M? the stellar remnant will overcome the neutron degeneracy pressure and gravitational collapse will usually occur to produce a black hole, though the smallest observed mass of a stellar black hole is about 5?M?.[16]\\r\\nThe temperature inside a newly formed neutron star is from around 1011 to 1012?kelvin.[17] However, the huge number of neutrinos it emits carry away so much energy that the temperature of an isolated neutron star falls within a few years to around 106 kelvin.[17] At this lower temperature, most of the light generated by a neutron star is in X-rays.\\r\\nNeutron stars have overall densities of 7017370000000000000?3.7G1017 to 7017590000000000000?5.9G1017?kg/m3 (7014260000000000000?2.6G1014 to 7014409999999999999?4.1G1014 times the density of the Sun),[b] which is comparable to the approximate density of an atomic nucleus of 7017300000000000000?3G1017?kg/m3.[18] The neutron star's density varies from about 7009100000000000000?1G109?kg/m3 in the crustincreasing with depthto about 7017600000000000000?6G1017 or 7017800000000000000?8G1017?kg/m3 (denser than an atomic nucleus) deeper inside.[17] A neutron star is so dense that one teaspoon (5 milliliters) of its material would have a mass over 7012550000000000000?5.5G1012?kg (that is 1100 tonnes per 1 nanolitre), about 900 times the mass of the Great Pyramid of Giza. In the enormous gravitational field of a neutron star, its weight would be 7025110000000000000?1.1G1025?N, which is about 15 times the weight of the Moon.[c] The pressure increases from 7031320000000000000?3.2G1031 to 7034159999999999999?1.6G1034?Pa from the inner crust to the center.[19]\\r\\nThe equation of state of matter at such high densities is not precisely known because of the theoretical difficulties associated with extrapolating the likely behavior of quantum chromodynamics, superconductivity, and superfluidity of matter in such states along with the empirical difficulties of observing the characteristics of neutron stars that are at least hundreds of parsecs away.\\r\\nA neutron star has some of the properties of an atomic nucleus, including density (within an order of magnitude) and being composed of nucleons. In popular scientific writing, neutron stars are therefore sometimes described as \\"giant nuclei\\". However, in other respects, neutron stars and atomic nuclei are quite different. A nucleus is held together by the strong interaction, whereas a neutron star is held together by gravity. The density of nucleus is uniform, while neutron stars are predicted to consist of multiple layers with varying composition and density.\\r\\nNeutron stars have strong magnetic fields. The magnetic field strength on the surface of neutron stars has been estimated at least to have the range of 104 to 1011 tesla.[20] In comparison, the magnitude at Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65?microteslas (0.25 to 0.65?gauss),[21] making the field at least 108 times as strong as that of Earth. For comparison, 16 T is sufficient to levitate a live frog due to diamagnetic levitation. Variations in magnetic field strengths are most likely the main factor that allows different types of neutron stars to be distinguished by their spectra, and explains the periodicity of pulsars.[20] The neutron stars known as magnetars have the strongest magnetic fields, in the range of 108 to 1011 tesla,[22] and have become the widely accepted hypothesis for neutron star types soft gamma repeaters (SGRs)[23] and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs).[24] Fields of this strength are able to polarize the vacuum to the point that the vacuum becomes birefringent. Photons can merge or split in two, and virtual particle-antiparticle pairs are produced. The field changes electron energy levels and atoms are forced into thin cylinders.[25]\\r\\nThe origins of the strong magnetic field are as yet unclear.[20] One hypothesis is that of \\"flux freezing\\", or conservation of the original magnetic flux takes place during the formation of the neutron star.[20] If an object has a certain magnetic flux over its surface area, and that area shrinks to a smaller area, but the magnetic flux is conserved, then the magnetic field would correspondingly increase. Likewise, a collapsing star begins with a much larger surface area than the resulting neutron star, and conservation of magnetic flux would result in a far stronger magnetic field. However, this simple explanation does not fully explain magnetic field strengths of neutron stars.[20]\\r\\nThe gravitational field at a neutron star's surface is about 7011200000000000000?2G1011 times stronger than on Earth, at around 7012200000000000000?2.0G1012?m/s2.[27] Such a strong gravitational field acts as a gravitational lens and bends the radiation emitted by the neutron star such that parts of the normally invisible rear surface become visible.[26] If the radius of the neutron star is 3GM/c2 or less, then the photons may be trapped in an orbit, thus making the whole surface of that neutron star visible from a single vantage point, along with destabilizing photon orbits at or below the 1 radius distance of the star.\\r\\nA fraction of the mass of a star that collapses to form a neutron star is released in the supernova explosion from which it forms (from the law of massÿenergy equivalence, E = mc2). The energy comes from the gravitational binding energy of a neutron star.\\r\\nHence, the gravitational force of a typical neutron star is huge. If an object were to fall from a height of one meter on a neutron star 12 kilometers in radius, it would reach the ground at around 1400 kilometers per second.[28] However, even before impact, the tidal force would cause spaghettification, breaking any sort of an ordinary object into a stream of material.\\r\\nBecause of the enormous gravity, time dilation between a neutron star and Earth is significant. For example, eight years could pass on the surface of a neutron star, yet ten years would have passed on Earth, not including the time-dilation effect of its very rapid rotation.[29]\\r\\nNeutron star relativistic equations of state describe the relation of radius vs. mass for various models.[30] The most likely radii for a given neutron star mass are bracketed by models AP4 (smallest radius) and MS2 (largest radius). BE is the ratio of gravitational binding energy mass equivalent to the observed neutron star gravitational mass of \\"M\\" kilograms with radius \\"R\\" meters,[31]\\r\\nGiven current values\\r\\nand star masses \\"M\\" commonly reported as multiples of one solar mass,\\r\\nthen the relativistic fractional binding energy of a neutron star is\\r\\nA 2?M? neutron star would not be more compact than 10,970 meters radius (AP4 model). Its mass fraction gravitational binding energy would then be 0.187, ?18.7% (exothermic). This is not near 0.6/2 = 0.3, ?30%.\\r\\nThe equation of state for a neutron star is still not known. It is assumed that it differs significantly from that of a white dwarf, whose equation of state is that of a degenerate gas that can be described in close agreement with special relativity. However, with a neutron star the increased effects of general relativity can no longer be ignored. Several equations of state have been proposed (FPS, UU, APR, L, SLy, and others) and current research is still attempting to constrain the theories to make predictions of neutron star matter.[5][33] This means that the relation between density and mass is not fully known, and this causes uncertainties in radius estimates. For example, a 1.5?M? neutron star could have a radius of 10.7, 11.1, 12.1 or 15.1 kilometers (for EOS FPS, UU, APR or L respectively).[33]\\r\\nCurrent understanding of the structure of neutron stars is defined by existing mathematical models, but it might be possible to infer some details through studies of neutron-star oscillations. Asteroseismology, a study applied to ordinary stars, can reveal the inner structure of neutron stars by analyzing observed spectra of stellar oscillations.[5]\\r\\nCurrent models indicate that matter at the surface of a neutron star is composed of ordinary atomic nuclei crushed into a solid lattice with a sea of electrons flowing through the gaps between them. It is possible that the nuclei at the surface are iron, due to iron's high binding energy per nucleon.[34] It is also possible that heavy elements, such as iron, simply sink beneath the surface, leaving only light nuclei like helium and hydrogen.[34] If the surface temperature exceeds 106 kelvin (as in the case of a young pulsar), the surface should be fluid instead of the solid phase that might exist in cooler neutron stars (temperature <106 kelvin).[34]\\r\\nThe \\"atmosphere\\" of a neutron star is hypothesized to be at most several micrometers thick, and its dynamics are fully controlled by the neutron star's magnetic field. Below the atmosphere one encounters a solid \\"crust\\". This crust is extremely hard and very smooth (with maximum surface irregularities of ~5?mm), due to the extreme gravitational field.[35]\\r\\nProceeding inward, one encounters nuclei with ever-increasing numbers of neutrons; such nuclei would decay quickly on Earth, but are kept stable by tremendous pressures. As this process continues at increasing depths, the neutron drip becomes overwhelming, and the concentration of free neutrons increases rapidly. In that region, there are nuclei, free electrons, and free neutrons. The nuclei become increasingly small (gravity and pressure overwhelming the strong force) until the core is reached, by definition the point where mostly neutrons exist. The expected hierarchy of phases of nuclear matter in the inner crust has been characterized as \\"nuclear pasta\\", with fewer voids and larger structures towards higher pressures.[36] The composition of the superdense matter in the core remains uncertain. One model describes the core as superfluid neutron-degenerate matter (mostly neutrons, with some protons and electrons). More exotic forms of matter are possible, including degenerate strange matter (containing strange quarks in addition to up and down quarks), matter containing high-energy pions and kaons in addition to neutrons,[5] or ultra-dense quark-degenerate matter.\\r\\nNeutron stars are detected from their electromagnetic radiation. Neutron stars are usually observed to pulse radio waves and other electromagnetic radiation, and neutron stars observed with pulses are called pulsars.\\r\\nPulsars' radiation is thought to be caused by particle acceleration near their magnetic poles, which need not be aligned with the rotational axis of the neutron star. It is thought that a large electrostatic field builds up near the magnetic poles, leading to electron emission.[37] These electrons are magnetically accelerated along the field lines, leading to curvature radiation, with the radiation being strongly polarized towards the plane of curvature.[37] In addition, high energy photons can interact with lower energy photons and the magnetic field for electron-positron pair production, which through electronÿpositron annihilation leads to further high energy photons.[37]\\r\\nThe radiation emanating from the magnetic poles of neutron stars can be described as magnetospheric radiation, in reference to the magnetosphere of the neutron star.[38] It is not to be confused with magnetic dipole radiation, which is emitted because the magnetic axis is not aligned with the rotational axis, with a radiation frequency the same as the neutron star's rotational frequency.[37]\\r\\nIf the axis of rotation of the neutron star is different to the magnetic axis, external viewers will only see these beams of radiation whenever the magnetic axis point towards them during the neutron star rotation. Therefore, periodic pulses are observed, at the same rate as the rotation of the neutron star.\\r\\nIn addition to pulsars, neutron stars have also been identified with no apparent periodicity of their radiation.[39] This seems to be a characteristic of the X-ray sources known as Central Compact Objects in Supernova remnants (CCOs in SNRs), which are thought to be young, radio-quiet isolated neutron stars.[40]\\r\\nIn addition to radio emissions, neutron stars have also been identified in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This includes visible light, near infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays.[38] Pulsars observed in X-rays are known as X-ray pulsars if accretion-powered; while those identified in visible light as optical pulsars. The majority of neutron stars detected, including those identified in optical, X-ray and gamma rays, also emit radio waves;[41] the Crab Pulsar produces electromagnetic emissions across the spectrum.[41] However, there exist neutron stars called radio-quiet neutron stars, with no radio emissions detected.[42]\\r\\nNeutron stars rotate extremely rapidly after their formation due to the conservation of angular momentum; like spinning ice skaters pulling in their arms, the slow rotation of the original star's core speeds up as it shrinks. A newborn neutron star can rotate many times a second.\\r\\nOver time, neutron stars slow, as their rotating magnetic fields in effect radiate energy associated with the rotation; older neutron stars may take several seconds for each revolution. This is called spin down. The rate at which a neutron star slows its rotation is usually constant and very small.\\r\\nThe periodic time (P) is the rotational period, the time for one rotation of a neutron star. The spin-down rate, the rate of slowing of rotation, is then given the symbol \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\dot {P}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n (P-dot), the negative derivative of P with respect to time. It is defined as periodic time decrease per unit time; it is a dimensionless quantity, but can be given the units of s?s?1 (seconds per second).[37]\\r\\nThe spin-down rate (P-dot) of neutron stars usually falls within the range of 10?22 to 10?9?s?s?1, with the shorter period (or faster rotating) observable neutron stars usually having smaller P-dot. However, as a neutron star ages, the neutron star slows (P increases) and the rate of slowing decreases (P-dot decreases). Eventually, the rate of rotation becomes too slow to power the radio-emission mechanism, and the neutron star can no longer be detected.[37]\\r\\nP and P-dot allow minimum magnetic fields of neutron stars to be estimated.[37] P and P-dot can be also used to calculate the characteristic age of a pulsar, but gives an estimate which is somewhat larger than the true age when it is applied to young pulsars.[37]\\r\\nP and P-dot can also be combined with neutron star's moment of inertia to estimate a quantity called spin-down luminosity, which is given the symbol \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\dot {E}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n (E-dot). It is not the measured luminosity, but rather the calculated loss rate of rotational energy that would manifest itself as radiation. For neutron stars where the spin-down luminosity is comparable to the actual luminosity, the neutron stars are said to be \\"rotation powered\\".[37][38] The observed luminosity of the Crab Pulsar is comparable to the spin-down luminosity, supporting the model that rotational kinetic energy powers the radiation from it.[37] With neutron stars such as magnetars, where the actual luminosity exceeds the spin-down luminosity by about a factor of one hundred, it is assumed that the luminosity is powered by magnetic dissipation, rather than being rotation powered.[43]\\r\\nP and P-dot can also be plotted for neutron stars to create a PÿP-dot diagram. It encodes a tremendous amount of information about the pulsar population and its properties, and has been likened to the HertzsprungÿRussell diagram in its importance for neutron stars.[37]\\r\\nNeutron star rotational speeds can increase, a process known as spin up. Sometimes neutron stars absorb orbiting matter from companion stars, increasing the rotation rate and reshaping the neutron star into an oblate spheroid. This causes an increase in the rate of rotation of the neutron star of over a hundred times per second in the case of millisecond pulsars.\\r\\nThe most rapidly rotating neutron star currently known, PSR J1748-2446ad, rotates at 716 rotations per second.[44] However, a recent paper reported the detection of an X-ray burst oscillation, which provides an indirect measure of spin, of 1122?Hz from the neutron star XTE J1739-285,[45] suggesting 1122 rotations a second. However, at present, this signal has only been seen once, and should be regarded as tentative until confirmed in another burst from that star.\\r\\nSometimes a neutron star will undergo a glitch, a sudden small increase of its rotational speed or spin up. Glitches are thought to be the effect of a starquakeas the rotation of the neutron star slows, its shape becomes more spherical. Due to the stiffness of the \\"neutron\\" crust, this happens as discrete events when the crust ruptures, creating a starquake similar to earthquakes. After the starquake, the star will have a smaller equatorial radius, and because angular momentum is conserved, its rotational speed has increased.\\r\\nStarquakes occurring in magnetars, with a resulting glitch, is the leading hypothesis for the gamma-ray sources known as soft gamma repeaters.[46]\\r\\nRecent work, however, suggests that a starquake would not release sufficient energy for a neutron star glitch; it has been suggested that glitches may instead be caused by transitions of vortices in the theoretical superfluid core of the neutron star from one metastable energy state to a lower one, thereby releasing energy that appears as an increase in the rotation rate.[47]\\r\\nAn \\"anti-glitch\\", a sudden small decrease in rotational speed, or spin down, of a neutron star has also been reported.[48] It occurred in a magnetar, that in one case produced an X-ray luminosity increase of a factor of 20, and a significant spin-down rate change. Current neutron star models do not predict this behavior. If the cause was internal, it suggests differential rotation of solid outer crust and the superfluid component of the magnetar's inner structure.[48]\\r\\nAt present, there are about 2000 known neutron stars in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, the majority of which have been detected as radio pulsars. Neutron stars are mostly concentrated along the disk of the Milky Way although the spread perpendicular to the disk is large because the supernova explosion process can impart high translational speeds (400?km/s) to the newly formed neutron star.\\r\\nSome of the closest known neutron stars are RX J1856.5-3754, which is about 400 light years away, and PSR J0108-1431 at about 424 light years.[50] RX J1856.5-3754 is a member of a close group of neutron stars called The Magnificent Seven. Another nearby neutron star that was detected transiting the backdrop of the constellation Ursa Minor has been nicknamed Calvera by its Canadian and American discoverers, after the villain in the 1960 film The Magnificent Seven. This rapidly moving object was discovered using the ROSAT/Bright Source Catalog.\\r\\nAbout 5% of all known neutron stars are members of a binary system. The formation and evolution of binary neutron stars can be a complex process.[51] Neutron stars have been observed in binaries with ordinary main-sequence stars, red giants, white dwarfs or other neutron stars. According to modern theories of binary evolution it is expected that neutron stars also exist in binary systems with black hole companions. The merger of binaries containing two neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole, are expected to be prime sources for the emission of detectable gravitational waves.\\r\\nBinary systems containing neutron stars often emit X-rays, which are emitted by hot gas as it falls towards the surface of the neutron star. The source of the gas is the companion star, the outer layers of which can be stripped off by the gravitational force of the neutron star if the two stars are sufficiently close. As the neutron star accretes this gas its mass can increase; if enough mass is accreted the neutron star may collapse into a black hole.[52]\\r\\nBinaries containing two neutron stars are observed to shrink as gravitational waves are emitted.[53] Ultimately the neutron stars will come into contact and coalesce. The coalescence of binary neutron stars is one of the leading models for the origin of short gamma-ray bursts. Strong evidence for this model came from the observation of a kilonova associated with the short-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 130603B,[54] and finally confirmed by detection of gravitational wave GW170817 and short GRB 170817A by LIGO, Virgo and 70 observatories covering the electromagnetic spectrum observed the event.[55][56][57][58] The light emitted in the kilonova is believed to come from the radioactive decay of material ejected in the merger of the two neutron stars. This material may be responsible for the production of many of the chemical elements beyond iron,[59] as opposed to the supernova nucleosynthesis theory.\\r\\nNeutron stars can host exoplanets. These can be original, circumbinary, captured, or the result of a second round of planet formation. Pulsars can also strip the atmosphere off from a star, leaving a planetary-mass remnant, which may be understood as a chthonian planet or a stellar object depending on interpretation. For pulsars, such pulsar planets can be detected with the pulsar timing method, which allows for high precision and detection of much smaller planets than with other methods. Two systems have been definitively confirmed. The first exoplanets ever to be detected were the three planets Draugr, Poltergeist and Phobetor around PSR B1257+12, discovered in 1992ÿ1994. Of these, Draugr is the smallest exoplanet ever detected, at a mass of twice that of the Moon. Another system is PSR B1620-26, where a circumbinary planet orbits a neutron star-white dwarf binary system. Also, there are several unconfirmed candidates. Pulsar planets receive little visible light, but massive amounts of ionizing radiation and high-energy stellar wind, which makes them rather hostile environments.\\r\\nIn 1934, Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky proposed the existence of neutron stars,[60][d] only a year after the discovery of the neutron by Sir James Chadwick.[63] In seeking an explanation for the origin of a supernova, they tentatively proposed that in supernova explosions ordinary stars are turned into stars that consist of extremely closely packed neutrons that they called neutron stars. Baade and Zwicky correctly proposed at that time that the release of the gravitational binding energy of the neutron stars powers the supernova: \\"In the supernova process, mass in bulk is annihilated\\". Neutron stars were thought to be too faint to be detectable and little work was done on them until November 1967, when Franco Pacini pointed out that if the neutron stars were spinning and had large magnetic fields, then electromagnetic waves would be emitted. Unbeknown to him, radio astronomer Antony Hewish and his research assistant Jocelyn Bell at Cambridge were shortly to detect radio pulses from stars that are now believed to be highly magnetized, rapidly spinning neutron stars, known as pulsars.\\r\\nIn 1965, Antony Hewish and Samuel Okoye discovered \\"an unusual source of high radio brightness temperature in the Crab Nebula\\".[64] This source turned out to be the Crab Pulsar that resulted from the great supernova of 1054.\\r\\nIn 1967, Iosif Shklovsky examined the X-ray and optical observations of Scorpius X-1 and correctly concluded that the radiation comes from a neutron star at the stage of accretion.[65]\\r\\nIn 1967, Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish discovered regular radio pulses from PSR B1919+21. This pulsar was later interpreted as an isolated, rotating neutron star. The energy source of the pulsar is the rotational energy of the neutron star. The majority of known neutron stars (about 2000, as of 2010) have been discovered as pulsars, emitting regular radio pulses.\\r\\nIn 1971, Riccardo Giacconi, Herbert Gursky, Ed Kellogg, R. Levinson, E. Schreier, and H. Tananbaum discovered 4.8 second pulsations in an X-ray source in the constellation Centaurus, Cen X-3.[66] They interpreted this as resulting from a rotating hot neutron star. The energy source is gravitational and results from a rain of gas falling onto the surface of the neutron star from a companion star or the interstellar medium.\\r\\nIn 1974, Antony Hewish was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \\"for his decisive role in the discovery of pulsars\\" without Jocelyn Bell who shared in the discovery.[67]\\r\\nIn 1974, Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse discovered the first binary pulsar, PSR B1913+16, which consists of two neutron stars (one seen as a pulsar) orbiting around their center of mass. Einstein's general theory of relativity predicts that massive objects in short binary orbits should emit gravitational waves, and thus that their orbit should decay with time. This was indeed observed, precisely as general relativity predicts, and in 1993, Taylor and Hulse were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.[68]\\r\\nIn 1982, Don Backer and colleagues discovered the first millisecond pulsar, PSR B1937+21.[69] This object spins 642 times per second, a value that placed fundamental constraints on the mass and radius of neutron stars. Many millisecond pulsars were later discovered, but PSR B1937+21 remained the fastest-spinning known pulsar for 24 years, until PSR J1748-2446ad (which spins more than 700 times a second) was discovered.\\r\\nIn 2003, Marta Burgay and colleagues discovered the first double neutron star system where both components are detectable as pulsars, PSR J0737-3039.[70] The discovery of this system allows a total of 5 different tests of general relativity, some of these with unprecedented precision.\\r\\nIn 2010, Paul Demorest and colleagues measured the mass of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1614ÿ2230 to be 1.97I0.04?M?, using Shapiro delay.[71] This was substantially higher than any previously measured neutron star mass (1.67?M?, see PSR J1903+0327), and places strong constraints on the interior composition of neutron stars.\\r\\nIn 2013, John Antoniadis and colleagues measured the mass of PSR J0348+0432 to be 2.01I0.04?M?, using white dwarf spectroscopy.[72] This confirmed the existence of such massive stars using a different method. Furthermore, this allowed, for the first time, a test of general relativity using such a massive neutron star.\\r\\nNeutron stars containing 500,000 Earth-masses in 25?km (16?mi) diameter sphere\\r\\nNeutron stars colliding\\r\\nNeutron star collision","input":"What are the densest stars known to exist?"},{"output":"December 12, 1998","context":"The following is a list of recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced between September 28, 1996, and May 17, 1997, the twenty-second season of SNL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA cartoon by Robert Smigel, part of the Saturday TV Funhouse series. Debuted September 28, 1996.\\r\\nMr. Peepers was a part-monkey/part-human character created and portrayed by Chris Kattan. His signature bits of physical comedy involved eating apples one after another in rapid succession, and spitting out the pieces machine gun style. Often he would spit the apple chunks directly at characters in the scene. His other physical act was dry humping other characters, with the recipient of the act getting reprimanded when they tried to push him off.\\r\\nMr. Peepers was first introduced as an animal act brought out by John Barbary (played by Tom Hanks) on a parody of The Tonight Show (with Darrell Hammond as Jay Leno). In an episode in the 25th season, \\"Papa Peepers\\" (played by The Rock) was revealed to be Mr. Peepers's father. Another memorable sketch was a parody of an episode of Dawson's Creek, featuring Katie Holmes as Joey, the character she played on that show. On the Weekend Update segment of the May 17, 2003 episode, Chris Kattan performed a lightning-round montage of his most popular characters, and assumed the character of Mr. Peepers for a brief moment during that bit. It was the final episode of the 2002-2003 season, and also Kattan's last episode as a cast member.\\r\\nPlayed by Ana Gasteyer, Kincaid was a fast-talking MTV VJ. Sketch debuted September 28, 1996.\\r\\nA Colin Quinn sketch. Debuted October 5, 1996.\\r\\nThe Quiet Storm was a radio show hosted by Chris \\"Champagne\\" Garnett (Tim Meadows). Debuted October 19, 1996.\\r\\nThe Culps, or \\"The Culp Family Musical Performances\\", were recurring characters that appeared on SNL between 1996 and 2002, and were portrayed by Will Ferrell (as Marty Culp), and Ana Gasteyer (as Bobbi Mohan-Culp). Marty and Bobbi were an awkward, unstylish, married couple who served as music teachers at Altadena Middle School. In the sketches, they would perform prim, conservative medleys of modern pop, R&B or rap songs at various school functions, much to the embarrassment of their unseen son who attended the school; when Claire Danes hosted, she played their college-student daughter, embarrassed beyond words when her parents performed during Career Day.\\r\\nMarty played the keyboard and sings backup, while Bobbi was the lead vocalist, who sang in a high-pitched, operatic style. In between medleys, the Culps make comments to the audience of middle school students, often implying that the children are mocking them, most often by showing them the finger. Debuted November 2, 1996.\\r\\nThe Culps followed in the tradition of earlier skits that began with 1970s sketch Nick The Lounge Singer and continued in the 1980s with The Sweeney Sisters. The basic premise being that the singers, who usually perform in bottom-of-the-barrel gigs, sing modern songs in their own unique style, but are totally oblivious to how unstylish and \\"cheesy\\" their performances are.\\r\\nFerrell and Gasteyer reprised their roles in 2012 when Ferrell hosted the May 12th episode. The couple had a gig at an LGBT prom. They later returned for the 40th anniversary special on February 15, 2015 in a tribute of musical sketches.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Ana Gasteyer and Molly Shannon sketch. Debuted November 16, 1996. Margaret Jo McCullen (Gasteyer) and Teri Rialto (Shannon) host a fictitious culinary-themed show on National Public Radio called The Delicious Dish. They both speak in extremely bland monotone voices and imply that their greatest joys in life are derived from absurdly simple things such as purchasing a new funnel. When Molly Shannon left the show during the 2000 - 2001 season, the character of Teri Rialto was replaced by the equally bland and monotone Lynn Bershad, played by Rachel Dratch.\\r\\nIn each sketch they have a guest, always played with a similarly bland personality by the host of the episode. The most frequently replayed installment of this sketch, which originally aired on December 12, 1998, featured Alec Baldwin as Christmas treat maker Pete Schweddy, who owned a holiday-themed store called Seasons Eatings. He was famous for his \\"Schweddy Balls\\" (assortments of spherical food treats made out of anything from meat to cake to candy), which were sold as an assortment in a \\"Schweddy ball sack\\". The two hosts and their guest were, as usual, completely oblivious to the double entendres.\\r\\nOn the May 8, 2010 episode, Gasteyer and Shannon both reprised their Delicious Dish characters in cameo with host Betty White playing their guest Florence Dusty, famous for her \\"Dusty Muffin\\", with all concerned again being oblivious to the double entendre.\\r\\nA Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan sketch. Debuted November 16, 1996.\\r\\nPortrayed by Ana Gasteyer, Calhoun was an activist, feminist singer who played at the Lilith Fair festival. In one episode, she is introduced as the warm-up act for the festival. Ultra-politically correct, she would go out of her way to pronounce ethnic-named cities in their native dialect and would frequently dedicate her songs to activist causes. On a Christmas episode she sang a song called \\"Christmas Chainsaw Massacre\\", referring to the \\"senseless cutting down of innocent trees for our twisted holiday pleasure\\". She also performed the anti-Thanksgiving song \\"Basted in Blood\\" in a duet with Sarah McLachlan, referencing in her introduction as being inspired by Fiona Apple's criticism of Butterball Turkey for having a 1-800 number for Turkey recipes. She professed her love for Garth Brooks in a song entitled \\"Adonis in Blue Jeans\\" when he hosted the show. Debuted November 23, 1996 in a Thanksgiving Song Auditions sketch.\\r\\nA parody of the annual celebrity tournament of the television quiz show Jeopardy!. Debuted December 7, 1996.\\r\\nJanet Reno's Dance Party (\\"coming to you live, from my basement/the deck of a battleship\\") was an SNL sketch starring Will Ferrell as U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. It aired four times and featured the song \\"My Sharona\\" by the Knack. Debuted January 11, 1997. During the dance party, Reno expressed an aversion to mosh pits and accused her youthful guests of lying during interviews. While she opposed moshing, Reno did engage in stage-diving during one episode, warning the dancing youths below to brace themselves for \\"180 lb of pure Reno.\\" In most episodes, Darrell Hammond would make an appearance as then-President Bill Clinton, urging Janet to leave her basement and rejoin society; he would assure her that nobody blamed her for the events at Waco, to which Reno would respond, \\"DANCE PARTY TAKES AWAY WACO!\\". Notable guests included Donna Shalala (played by Kevin Spacey), who slow-danced with Janet; and Rudy Giuliani (played by himself), who lost to Janet in a boxing match. The last time the sketch aired, January 20, 2001, the real Janet Reno herself made an appearance. It was also the day she left office, as the Clinton administration had ended earlier that afternoon. After George W. Bush's inauguration ceremony was completed at noon, Reno was whisked away to a supposed undisclosed location. Will Ferrell stated:\\r\\nIt was all her idea to come on the show, and I was impressed with her. She talked about how important humor is to our political process. She said that when she speaks at schools, the first question she's asked is, \\"Have you seen the guy who plays you on Saturday Night Live?\\" She tells them she loves (being lampooned); it lets all the tension out of the room.[1]\\r\\nA cartoon by Robert Smigel, part of the Saturday TV Funhouse series. Debuted January 11, 1997.\\r\\nAn Ana Gasteyer, Mark McKinney and Will Ferrell sketch. Debuted January 11, 1997.\\r\\nA Jim Breuer and Tracy Morgan sketch. Debuted January 18, 1997.\\r\\nThe Zimmermans were a married couple portrayed by Chris Kattan and Cheri Oteri as Josh and Laura Zimmerman, they would often meet other couples in various settings. Normal dialogue between the Zimmermans would often change course suddenly, as the couple work one another into a sexual frenzy which typically ends just as abruptly. Each sketch typically ends with one or both members of the other couple finally adopting behavior similar to the Zimmermans after extensive baiting, at which point the Zimmermans become shocked and appalled by the other's display.\\r\\nThe DeMarco Brothers are played by Chris Kattan (Kyle) and Chris Parnell (Sean). The premise of the sketch is that the brothers are auditioning to be dancers on tour for a musical act (usually, whoever is the musical guest on the show that week). They would wear matching t-shirts with quotes or references to a particular song by the artist, and then play a tape of the artist's songs and proceed to dance to it. Their dancing can be described as interpretive, as they often act out a portion of the song's lyrics in the form of skits during their performance. The musicians generally detest their performances, cutting them off before ever getting through an entire song. However, two auditions were successful: In the January 20, 2001 sketch, Lenny Kravitz, while initially dismissive, empathizes with the pair and hires them over the vociferous objections of his tour manager (host Mena Suvari), while for the May 11, 2002 episode, in which host Kirsten Dunst joins them as their cousin Tamara, Eminem ended the audition many of the same insults other artists had used to describe their performance  but since this was exactly what he was wanted out of his backup dancers, they got the job. Debuted (solely Kattan) March 15, 1997.\\r\\nDominican Lou (played by Tracy Morgan) is the building superintendent at 1901 Burnside Avenue in The Bronx. Debuted March 22, 1997.\\r\\nOn Weekend Update in 1998, he attempted to sell Colin Quinn the signed 62nd home run ball of his fellow countryman Sammy Sosa for a million dollars, even though it was later discovered to be a foul ball hit by Gary Gaetti and signed Dominican Lou.\\r\\nHe also did the weather report in Good Morning, Bronx on February 10, 2001.\\r\\nIn October 17, 1998, Dominican Lou was impersonated by Chucky on Weekend Update.\\r\\nA late-night Tampa Bay Public-access television cable TV show hosted by goth high school students Azrael Abyss, Prince of Sorrows (Chris Kattan), and Circe Nightshade (Molly Shannon). The show, recorded in Azrael's home, begins with the theme song, \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\" by Bauhaus, and a station identification bumper, ironically from \\"Channel 33: Sunshine State Cable Access.\\" The hosts speak in a melodramatic, woeful tone, and wear dark gothic clothes and black make-up. Azrael speaks in a grating, high-pitched voice and frequently makes noises like a cat. They try to be as dark and gothic as they can, making regular references to death and the macabre, but always end in matters that are in quite contrast to both, prompting them to end the show abruptly with the slogan \\"Stay out of the daylight!\\".\\r\\nRecurring themes include Azrael's job at Cinnabon and Jim Breuer's interruptions of the show as Azrael's older brother Glenn, a stereotypical jock attending Michigan State. Glenn ruins the goth mood by turning on the light in the garage and calling Azrael and Circe by their real names, Todd (Henderson) and Stephanie. Often the dark aspects of their lives are juxtaposed with their surroundings, such as the time they mused that \\"The Tampa Bay Lightning aren't very goth.\\" The show's sponsor is a clothing store called \\"The Gloom Room,\\" which has the slogan, \\"It's an orgy of the macabre... located right next to the Pizza Hut on Hibiscus Road.\\" Another recurring theme is having guests on the show who are touted as being dark and sinister, but are revealed to have regular pedestrian lives despite the hosts' efforts. Will Ferrell also appears as Baron Nocturna in three sketches. Nocturna, whose real name is Gordy, is an employee at Cinnabon and a friend of Abyss and Nightshade. In one appearance, Nocturna was scheduled to appear on the show but was \\"pantsed\\" and thrown in their pool by Glenn and his friend (Chris Farley).\\r\\nA Cheri Oteri sketch. Debuted May 10, 1997. Collette Reardon was a disheveled middle-aged woman who appeared to be significantly impaired by some drug or mixture of drugs. In the first two sketches, she would show up in a pharmacy with a stack of numerous prescriptions for unbelievably large supplies and large doses of an assortment of drugs, most of which were notorious for being addictive. Some of the prescriptions would be for clearly recreational drugs, such as peyote buttons, that would not be available in a pharmacy. The pharmacist (played by the guest host of the episode) was naturally skeptical of the legitimacy of the prescriptions. Subsequently, she appeared on Weekend Update as an \\"expert\\" and in situations where her impairment was particularly inappropriate.\\r\\nDuring the course of some of her appearances, it was mentioned that Ms. Reardon drove a school bus for a living.\\r\\nAppearances:","input":"When did the snl schweddy balls skit air?"},{"output":"General Robert E.

Carrie attempts to comfort Arthur by telling him, \\"She had wanted a companion.\\" Arthur refuses to announce that the wedding is off, and proposes to Veronica Olchin, Spence's mother (Anne Meara) in the men's room. She at first declines, but later accepts. Carrie and Spence are both surprised and against the decision. The ceremony is performed by Rabbi Feldman (Josh Cooke), because the original bride Ava was Jewish, although neither Arthur nor Veronica is Jewish. The wedding ends with Arthur smashing a glass with his foot, while everyone cheers, \\"Mazel tov!\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately afterward, Carrie is notified that the baby she and Doug wanted to adopt is waiting for them in Beijing. However, Doug does not want to have a baby with her anymore because of her betrayal regarding the apartment. A very pregnant Holly (Nicole Sullivan) also shows up at the wedding, as does the Heffernans neighbor Lou Ferrigno. At this point, it is also revealed that Holly's husband recently left her. When Lou tries to cheer everyone up with \\"Such a Happy Day,\\" he is greeted by very unhappy expressions.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoug, who sits outside in the back of the building where the ceremony is performed, makes an offer to Spence to become his new roommate, since he is divorcing Carrie, but later retracts the offer when Holly tells him her story. Very drunk, he challenges each of them to a wrestling match, but falls asleep while fighting with Holly. When Arthur learns that Doug will not toast him as his best man, he pitches the role to Spence, who turns it down, and ultimately, Deacon is forced to make the toast, though Deacon pleads that he doesn't know him that well.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpence tries to move back in with Doug's cousin Danny because Arthur will be living with his wife Veronica now. He learns, however, that Danny has a new girlfriend Sandy (Jillian Bach) who is living with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolly and Spence begin talking and realize that they both don't have a place to stay, so they decide to get an apartment together. Danny returns without Sandy, and suggests that Spence and he move back in together. Spence accepts, leaving Holly alone without a place to stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Kelly points out to Carrie that she shouldn't feel so guilty about keeping the apartment, because Doug let Carrie down many times in the past. Carrie is convinced and tells Doug off.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth decide that they want to get the Chinese baby for themselves and board the same plane, although Carrie leaves the house first, and Doug has to find his passport, which Deacon finds in the vegetable crisper. Holly met Rabbi Feldman and they hit it off. Holly is going to move in with him and convert to Judaism. Doug later surprises Carrie on board the plane, by greeting her with a gruff \\"Hello!\\" and showing her his passport in triumph. He also adds that \\"Deacon's BLT was delicious, as is my revenge.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey use the long flight to sort out their problems and remain together. After getting baby Ming-Mei from the adoption agency, Carrie finds out that she is pregnant. She is scared about the changes to come, but Doug is optimistic that they will be able to handle it together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe episode fast-forwards one year and shows Doug and Carrie with their two small children in their living room. Arthur comes in with a suitcase, announcing that his marriage \\"didn't work out.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe episode ends with a three-minute montage of scenes from the show's nine seasons to A Million Billion's song \\"Milk & Honey\\".  As the song concludes, the series ends with a final screen shot: \\"thanks for the ride...\\".","input":"What was the last episode of the king of queens?"},{"output":"Tealand Theatre in Lugano, Switzerland","context":"The Eurovision Song Contest 1956 was the first edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest, held at the Tealand Theatre in Lugano, Switzerland on Thursday 24 May.\\r\\nOrganised by the European Broadcasting Union, the pan-European music competition was inspired by the Italian Sanremo Music Festival. Lohengrin Filipello hosted the first contest which lasted approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. Seven countries participated, with each of them performing two songs. Two jury members from all participating countries cast their votes in secret, based on which song was their favourite.\\r\\nThis first edition of the Eurovision Song Contest included several procedures that were not repeated in any subsequent edition: Two songs for each country, secret voting, double voting of one country on behalf of another, optional inclusion of the jury members' own represented country in their voting, only \\"Grand Prix\\" title reception for the winner, and a single male presenter to host the show.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a meeting in Monaco in 1955, members of the European Broadcasting Union discussed ideas to organise a pan-European music competition, taking inspiration from the Italian Sanremo Music Festival. From that meeting, the concept of the Eurovision Song Contest was born. A decision was reached to hold the first ever contest in the Swiss resort of Lugano the following year.[1]\\r\\nThe programme was hosted by Lohengrin Filipello,[1] making it the only Eurovision Song Contest to have a solo male presenter and up until the 2017 edition with a male trio,[2] the only edition without a female presenter. The programme lasted approximately one hour and 40 minutes. Although it was mainly a radio programme, there were cameras in the studio for the benefit of the few Europeans who possessed a television.[1]\\r\\nOnly solo artists were allowed to enter the contest, and their songs were not to exceed three and a half minutes in length, and were accompanied by a 24-musician orchestra, which was led by Fernando Paggi, along with four guest conductors, which came from Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Italy. The interval act, whistling by the Joyeux Rossignols, had to be extended due to a delay in the voting procedure. It had been strongly recommended that each participating country have a preliminary national song contest.[1]\\r\\nTwo jury members from each participating country travelled to Lugano to cast their vote on the songs, except for Luxembourg which was unable to send juries. The EBU conducted a secret voting and a system allowing the juries to also vote for the two songs representing their own country, as well as allowing the Swiss jury to vote on behalf of Luxembourg. Claims were raised that the Swiss entry won as a result of these procedures.[3] This system was never repeated, as from the second edition of the contest onwards the voting is visible, excludes the jury's own competing country from their voting and includes individual jury members for each country.[1]\\r\\nWhile the contest was shown and recorded for television broadcasting in certain European countries (as television sets were somewhat uncommon still at this time), no copies have survived, with the exception of Lys Assia's repeat performance at the end of the contest. It is one of only two contests to not have survived completely, along with the 1964 contest (of which the tapes were destroyed in a fire).\\r\\nSeven countries participated in the first ever contest, each were represented with two songs.[1] Two more countries, Austria, and Denmark were also expected to take part in the contest, but they missed the submission deadline and therefore could not take part.[1] Although it was thought that the United Kingdom had also missed the participation deadline, it was later revealed by the EBU in January 2017 that it was a mythical fact created by fans of the contest.[4] The EBU further went on to explain that the \\"Festival of British Popular Song\\", a contest created by the BBC for the United Kingdom, was the inspiration that brought in changes to the contest format from 1957.[4]\\r\\nEach performance had a maestro who conducted the orchestra.[5] The conductors listed conducted both performances for the indicated countries.\\r\\nExcept for the winning song, the results have never been published. Simon Barclay's book The Complete and Independent Guide to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 includes a table with what appears to be the rankings, but the author does not give a source. Under the chart he writes that \\"the votes awarded have never been disclosed.\\"[6] According to writer Jan Feddersen, \\"Im Wartesaal zum gro?en Glck\\" was probably voted No. 2 behind Lys Assia.[3]\\r\\nThe participating national broadcasters sent commentators to the contest, in order to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language.

Thompson in 1918, that became infamous during the Prohibition era, becoming a signature weapon of various police syndicates in the United States. It was a common sight in the media of the time, being used by both law enforcement officers and criminals.[11] The Thompson submachine gun was also known informally as the \\"Tommy  Gun\\", \\"Annihilator\\", \\"Chicago Typewriter\\", \\"Chicago Piano\\", \\"Chicago Style\\", \\"Chicago Organ Grinder\\", \\"Trench Broom\\", \\"Trench Sweeper\\", \\"The Chopper\\", and simply \\"The Thompson\\".[12][13][14][15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thompson was favored by soldiers, criminals, police, and civilians alike for its large .45 ACP cartridge, accuracy, and high volume of fully automatic fire. It has since gained popularity among civilian collectors for its historical significance. It has had, and continues to have, considerable significance in popular culture, especially in works about the U.S.'s Prohibition era and World War II, and hence is among the best-known firearms in history. Although the original fully automatic Thompsons are no longer produced, numerous semi-automatic civilian versions are still being manufactured by Auto-Ordnance. These retain a similar appearance to the original models, but they have various modifications in order to comply with US firearm laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thompson Submachine Gun was developed by General John T. Thompson, who originally envisioned an \\"auto rifle\\" (semi-automatic rifle) to replace the bolt action service rifles then in use. While searching for a way to allow such a weapon to operate safely without the complexity of a recoil or gas operated mechanism, Thompson came across a patent issued to John Bell Blish in 1915 based on adhesion of inclined metal surfaces under pressure.[17] Thompson found a financial backer, Thomas F. Ryan, and started the Auto-Ordnance Company in 1916 for the purpose of developing his \\"auto rifle\\". It was primarily developed in Cleveland, Ohio.[18] The principal designers were Theodore H. Eickhoff, Oscar V. Payne, and George E. Goll. By late 1917, the limits of the Blish Principle were discovered: rather than working as a locked breech, it functioned as a friction-delayed blowback action. It was found that the only cartridge currently in U.S. service suitable for use with the lock was the .45 ACP round. Thompson then envisioned a \\"one-man, hand-held machine gun\\" in .45 ACP as a \\"trench broom\\" for use in the ongoing trench warfare of World War I. Payne designed the gun itself and its stick and drum magazines. The project was then titled \\"Annihilator I\\" and by 1918, most of the design issues had been resolved. However, the war ended two days before prototypes could be shipped to Europe.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt an Auto-Ordnance board meeting in 1919 to discuss the marketing of the \\"Annihilator\\", with the war now over, the weapon was officially renamed the \\"Thompson Submachine Gun\\". While other weapons had been developed shortly prior with similar objectives in mind, the Thompson was the first weapon to be labeled and marketed as a \\"submachine gun\\".[13] Thompson intended the weapon as an automatic \\"trench-broom\\" to sweep enemy troops from the trenches, filling a role for which the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) had been proven ill-suited.[20] This concept had already been developed by German troops using their own Bergmann MP 18, the world's first submachine gun, in concert with Sturmtruppen tactics.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thompson first entered production as the M1921. It was available to civilians, although poor sales resulted from the expense of the weapon: the Thompson gun, with one Type XX 20 shot \\"stick\\" magazine, was priced at $200 in 1921 (equivalent to $2,744 in 2017). M1921 Thompsons were sold in small quantities to the United States Postal Inspection Service[22] (to protect the mail from a spate of robberies)[23] and to the United States Marine Corps. Federal sales were followed by sales to several police departments in the US and minor international sales to various armies and constabulary forces, chiefly in Central and South America.[23] The Marines used their Thompsons in the Banana Wars and in China. It was popular with the Marines as a point-defense weapon for countering ambush by Nicaraguan guerrillas, and led to the organization of four-man fire teams with as much firepower as a nine-man rifle squad. The major complaints against the Thompson were its weight, inaccuracy at ranges over 50 yards (46?m), and the lack of penetrating power of the .45 ACP pistol cartridge.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the first batches of Thompsons were bought in America by agents of the Irish Republic, notably Harry Boland. The first test of a Thompson in Ireland was performed by West Cork Brigade commander Tom Barry in presence of IRA leader Michael Collins.[25] A total of 653 were purchased, but 495 were seized by US customs authorities in New York in June 1921. The remainder made their way to the Irish Republican Army by way of Liverpool and were used in the last month of the Irish War of Independence (1919ÿ1921).[26] After a truce with the British in July 1921, the IRA imported more Thompsons and they were used in the subsequent Irish Civil War (1922ÿ23). They were not found to be very effective in Ireland; the Thompson caused serious casualties (death or serious injury) to those attacked in only 32% of the actions in which it was used.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thompson achieved most of its early notoriety in the hands of Prohibition and Depression-era gangsters, motorized bandits and the lawmen who pursued them, and in Hollywood films about their exploits, most notably in the St Valentine's Day Massacre. The two Thompson guns used in the massacre, called \\"the most famous murder weapons in the world\\", are still held by the Berrien County Sheriff's Department.[30] It has been referred to by one researcher as the \\"gun that made the twenties roar\\".[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1926, the Cutts Compensator (a muzzle brake) was offered as an option for the M1921; Thompsons with the compensator were cataloged as No. 21AC at the original price of $200, with the plain M1921 designated No. 21A at a reduced price of $175.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1928, Federal Laboratories took over the distribution of the weapon from Thompson's Auto Ordnance Corporation.[34] The cost at this time was $225 per weapon (equivalent to $3,207 in 2017), with $5 per 50-round drum and $3 per 20-round magazine.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nNationalist China acquired a quantity for use against Japanese land forces, and eventually began producing copies of the Thompson in small quantities for use by its armies and militias. In the 1930s, Taiyuan Arsenal produced copies of the Thompson for Yan Xishan, the warlord of Shanxi province.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation first acquired Thompsons in 1933 following the Kansas City Massacre.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1938, the Thompson submachine gun was adopted by the U.S. military, serving during World War II and beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two military types of Thompson SMG.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 1.5 million military Thompson submachine guns were produced during World War II.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMilitary users of the M1928A1 had complaints about the \\"L\\" fifty-round drum magazine; the British Army officially criticised \\"their excessive weight, the rattling sound they made\\" and shipped thousands back to the U.S. in exchange for box magazines. The Thompson had to be cocked, bolt retracted ready to fire, to attach the drum. It attached and detached by sliding sideways, which made magazine changes slow and also created difficulty in clearing a cartridge malfunction (\\"jam\\"). Reloading an empty drum with cartridges was an involved process.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, the \\"XX\\" twenty-round box magazine was light and compact, it tended not to rattle, and could be inserted with the bolt safely closed. It was quickly attached and detached and was removed downward, making clearing jams easier. The box tripped the bolt open lock when empty, facilitating magazine changes. An empty box was easily reloaded with loose rounds. However, users complained it was limited in capacity. In the field, some soldiers taped two \\"XX\\" magazines together in what would be known as \\"jungle style\\" to speed magazine changes.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo alternatives to the \\"L\\" drum and \\"XX\\" box magazines were tested December 6, 1941, at Fort Knox: an extended thirty-round box magazine and a forty-round magazine made by welding two 20-round magazines face to face, jungle style. Testers considered both superior to either the \\"XX\\" box or \\"L\\" drum. The 30-round box was approved as standard in December 1941 to replace the \\"XX\\" and \\"L\\" magazines.[37] (The concept of welding two box magazines face-to-face was carried over with the UD 42 submachine gun.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe staff of Savage Arms looked for ways to simplify the M1928A1, producing a prototype in February 1942 which was tested at Aberdeen Proving Ground in March 1942; Army Ordnance approved adoption as the M1 in April 1942. M1s were made by Savage Arms and by Auto-Ordnance. M1s were issued with the 30-round box magazine and would accept the earlier 20-round box, but would not accept the drum magazine.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thompson was used in World War II in the hands of Allied troops as a weapon for scouts, non-commissioned officers (corporal, sergeant, and higher), and patrol leaders, as well as commissioned officers, tank crewmen, and soldiers performing raids on German positions. In the European theater, the gun was widely utilized in British and Canadian commando units, as well as in the U.S. Army paratrooper and Ranger battalions, where it was issued more frequently than in line infantry units because of its high rate of fire and its stopping power, which made it very effective in the kinds of close combat these special operations troops were expected to undertake. Military Police were fond of it, as were paratroopers, who \\"borrowed\\" Thompsons from members of mortar squads for use on patrols behind enemy lines.[39][page?needed] The gun was prized by those lucky enough to get one and proved itself in the close street fighting that was encountered frequently during the invasion of France. A Swedish variant of the M1928A1, the Kulsprutepistol m/40 (submachine gun, model 40), served in the Swedish Army between 1940 and 1951. Through Lend-Lease, the Soviet Union also received the Thompson, but due to a shortage of appropriate ammunition, its use was not widespread.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Malayan Campaign, the Burma Campaign and the Pacific Theater, Lend-Lease issue Thompsons were used by the British Army, Indian Army, Australian Army infantry and other Commonwealth forces. They used the Thompson extensively in jungle patrols and ambushes, where it was prized for its firepower, though it was criticized for its hefty weight and poor reliability. Difficulties in supply eventually led to its replacement in Australian Army units in 1943 by other submachine guns such as the Owen and Austen. The Thompsons were then given to the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy. New Zealand commando forces initially used Thompsons but switched them for the more reliable, lighter, and more accurate Owen during the Solomon Islands and Guadalcanal campaigns.[41] The U.S. Marines also used the Thompson as a limited-issue weapon, especially during their later island assaults. The Thompson was soon found to have limited effect in heavy jungle cover, where the low-velocity .45 bullet would not penetrate most small-diameter trees or protective armor vests. (In 1923, the Army had rejected the .45 RemingtonÿThompson, which had twice the energy of the .45 ACP).[42] In the U.S. Army, many Pacific War jungle patrols were originally equipped with Thompsons in the early phases of the New Guinea and Guadalcanal campaigns, but soon began employing the Browning Automatic Rifle in its place as a point defense weapon.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Army introduced the U.S. M3 and M3A1 submachine guns in 1943 with plans to produce the latter in numbers sufficient to cancel future orders for the Thompson, while gradually withdrawing it from the first-line service. However, due to unforeseen production delays and requests for modifications, the M3/M3A1 never replaced the Thompson, and purchases continued until February 1944. At the end of World War II, the Thompson, with a total wartime production of over 1.5 million, outnumbered the M3/M3A1 submachine guns in service by nearly three to one.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThompson submachine guns were used by both sides during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.[45] Following the war, Thompsons were issued to members of Israels elite Unit 101, upon the formation of that unit in 1953.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Greek Civil War, the Thompson submachine gun was used by both sides. The Hellenic Armed Forces, gendarmerie and police units were equipped with Thompson submachine guns supplied by the British and later in the war by the United States. The opposing Communist fighters of the Democratic Army of Greece were also using Thompson submachine guns, either captured from government forces or inherited from ELAS. ELAS was the strongest of the resistance forces during the period of Greek Resistance against the Germans and Italians and were supplied with arms from both the British and the United States. After the demobilization of ELAS, an unspecified number of arms were not surrendered to the government but kept hidden, and were later used by the Democratic Army of Greece.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thompson also found service with the KNIL during their attempt to retake their former colony of Indonesia. Captured examples were later used by Indonesian forces against Dutch forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time of the Korean War, the Thompson had seen much use by the U.S. and South Korean military, even though Thompson had been replaced as standard issue by the M3/M3A1. With huge numbers of guns available in army ordnance arsenals, the Thompson remained classed as Limited Standard or Substitute Standard long after the standardization of the M3/M3A1. Many Thompsons were distributed to Chinese armed forces as a military aid before the fall of Chiang Kai-shek's government to Mao Zedong's Communist forces in 1949 during the Chinese Civil War. During the Korean War, American troops were surprised to encounter Chinese Communist troops heavily armed with Thompsons, especially during surprise night assaults. The gun's ability to deliver large quantities of short-range automatic assault fire proved very useful in both defense and assault during the early part of the conflict. Many of these weapons were captured and placed into service with American soldiers and Marines for the balance of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Cuban Revolution, the Thompson submachine gun was used by some of Fidel Castro's guerrillas.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Vietnam War, some South Vietnamese army units and defense militia were armed with Thompson submachine guns, and a few of these weapons were used by reconnaissance units, advisors, and other American troops. It was later replaced by the M16 assault rifle. Not only did some U.S. soldiers have use of them in Vietnam, but they encountered them as well. The Viet Cong liked the weapon and used both captured models as well as manufacturing their own copies in small jungle workshops.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian government destroyed most of their Thompson machine carbines in the 1960s. They shipped their remaining stocks to arm the forces of Lon Nol's Khmer Republic in 1975. They were then captured and used by the Khmer Rouge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles (1969ÿ1998), the Thompson was again used by the Irish Republican paramilitaries. According to historian Peter Hart, \\"The Thompson remained a key part of both the Official IRA and Provisional IRA arsenals until well into the 1970s when it was superseded by the Armalite and the AK-47.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thompson was also used by U.S. and overseas law enforcement and police forces, most prominently by the FBI. The FBI used Thompsons until they were declared obsolete and ordered destroyed in the early 1970s.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of their quality and craftsmanship, as well as their gangster-era and WWII connections, Thompsons are sought as collector's items. There were fewer than 40 pre-production prototypes. The Colt Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company in Hartford, Connecticut was contracted by the Auto-Ordnance Corporation to manufacture the initial mass production of 15,000 Thompson Submachine Guns in 1920. An original Colt Model 1921 A or AC, Model 1927 A or AC, Model 1928 Navy A or AC, properly registered in working condition with original components can easily fetch from US$25,000 to $45,000+ depending on condition and accessories. For WWII, approximately 1,700,000 Thompson Submachine Guns were produced by Auto-Ordnance and Savage Arms, with 1,387,134 being the simplified World War II M1 and M1A1 variants (without the Blish lock and oiling system[51]).\\r\\n\\r\\nA Model 1921A believed to have been owned by Bonnie and Clyde, but without historical documentation to substantiate this provenance, sold at auction on January 21, 2012, in Kansas City for $130,000.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly versions of the Thompson, the Model 1919, had a fairly high cyclic rate of fire, as high as 1,200?rounds per minute (rpm), with most Model 1921s at 800?rpm. In 1927, the U.S. Navy ordered 500 Thompsons but requested a lower rate of fire. Thompson requested  Payne develop a method of reducing the cyclic rate of fire. Payne replaced the actuator with a heavier one and the recoil spring with a stiffer one; the changes reduced the rate of fire from 800 to the 600?rpm of the U.S. Navy Model 1928. Later M1 and M1A1 Thompsons averaged also 600?rpm.[53] This rate of fire, combined with a rather heavy trigger pull and a stock with an excessive drop, increases the tendency for the barrel to climb off target in automatic fire.[53][54] Compared to more modern submachine guns, the .45 Thompson is quite heavy, weighing roughly the same as the contemporary M1 Garand semi-automatic rifle, and requires a lot of cleaning. This was one of the major complaints about the weapon by U.S. Army personnel to whom it was issued.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the drum magazine provided significant firepower, in military service it was found to be overly heavy and bulky, especially when slung on the shoulder while marching.[54] The M1928A1 Thompson drum magazine was rather fragile, and cartridges tended to rattle inside it, producing unwanted noise.[citation needed] For these reasons, the 20-round and later 30-round box magazines soon proved most popular with military users of the M1928A1, and drum compatibility was not included in the design of the wartime M1 and M1A1 models. The Thompson was one of the earliest submachine guns to incorporate a double-column, double-feed box magazine design, which undoubtedly contributed to the gun's reputation for reliability. In addition, the gun performed better than most after exposure to rain, dirt, and mud.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe selective-fire (semi- or fully automatic) Thompson fires from the \\"open bolt\\" position, in which the bolt is held fully to rearward by the sear when cocked. When the trigger is depressed, the bolt is released, traveling forward to chamber and simultaneously fire the first and subsequent rounds until either the trigger is released or the ammunition is exhausted. This eliminates the risk of \\"cook-off\\", which can sometimes occur in closed-bolt automatic weapons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thompson submachine gun varies in field strip procedure, depending on the variant. World War II-era M1 variants and RPB models field strip more easily than the M1921.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1928 variant can be disassembled easily by first detaching the stock, then sliding off the lower receiver and then simply removing the internal parts, cleaning them, and then putting it back together. When opened up, the Thompson features a small number of parts that need to be removed including the spring, bolt, Blish Lock, and actuator bolt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two main experimental models of the Thompson. The Persuader was a belt-fed version developed in 1917/18. It was partially built, but never completely finished. The Annihilator , serial no. Ver 10 prototypes  was similar in appearance to the later models, but without rear sight and butt stock mounts. The Annihilator prototypes first were fed from a 20-round box magazine, but later, the 50- and 100-round drum magazines models were developed.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting with the Serial no. 11, the Model 1919 takes the final appearance of the later Thompsons with the rear sights and the butt stock. The Model 1919 was limited to about 40 units; the first built did not use the drums, as it was too difficult to fire. Many variations have been noted within this model. The weapons had very high cyclic rates up to 1,500?rpm.[55] This was the weapon Brigadier General Thompson demonstrated at Camp Perry in 1920. A number of Model 1919s were made without butt stocks, rear- and front sights, but the final version closely resembled the later Model  1921.  This model was designed to \\"sweep\\" trenches with bullets. The New York City Police Department was the largest purchaser of the M1919. Some experimental calibers aside the .45 ACP (11.4x23mm) were the .22LR, .32 ACP, .38 ACP, and 9mmP.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one prototype was made in .351 WSL using a standard 20\\" barrel and an ROF of 1000rpm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe layout and ergonomics of the Thompson submachine gun were also considered for the role of a Light Rifle before the adoption of the M1 Carbine. It was based on the M1921/27 variants. However, it was turned down without testing due to logistic problems.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nA .30-06 variant was intended as a rival to the M1918 BAR. It had an extended receiver with a recoil buffer and fed from 20 round magazines.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Model 1921 (M1921) was the first major production model. Fifteen thousand were produced by Colt for Auto-Ordnance. In its original design, it was finished more like a sporting weapon, with an adjustable rear sight, a blued, finned barrel and vertical foregrip (or pistol grip) and the Blish lock. The M1921 was quite expensive to manufacture, with the original retail price around $200, because of its high-quality wood furniture and finely machined parts. The M1921 was famous throughout its career with police and criminals and in motion pictures. This model gained fame from its use by criminals during Prohibition, and was nicknamed \\"tommy gun\\" by the media.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Model 1923 was a heavy submachine gun introduced to potentially expand the Auto-Ordnance product line and was demonstrated for the U.S. Army.[58] It fired the more powerful .45 RemingtonÿThompson cartridge which fired a heavier 250?gr (0.57?oz; 16?g) bullet at muzzle velocities of about 1,450?ft/s (440?m/s) and energy about 1,170?ft?lb (1,590?J), with greater range than the .45 ACP. It introduced a horizontal forearm, improved inline stock for accuracy, 14?in (36?cm) barrel, bipod, and bayonet lug. The M1923 was intended to rival the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), with which the Army was already satisfied. The Army did not give the Model 1923 much consideration, so it was not adopted.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile not a new model in the usual sense of incorporating major changes, in 1926 the Cutts Compensator (a muzzle brake) was offered as an option for the M1921; Thompsons with the compensator were cataloged as No. 21AC at the original price of $200.00, with the plain M1921 designated No. 21A at a reduced price of $175.00.[33] The Model 1921 was thereafter referred to as Model 1921A or Model 1921AC, though some collectors still refer to it as the Model 1921.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Model 1928 was the first type widely used by military forces, with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps as major buyers through the 1930s. The original Model 1928s were Model 1921s with weight added to the actuator, which slowed down the cyclic rate of fire, a United States Navy requirement. On these guns, the model number \\"1921\\" on the receiver was updated by stamping an \\"8\\" over the last \\"1\\". The Navy Model 1928 has several names among collectors: the \\"Colt Overstamp\\", \\"1921 Overstamp\\", \\"28 Navy\\", or just \\"28N\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1928 Thompson would be the last small arm adopted by the U.S. Army that used a year designation in the official nomenclature. With the start of World War II, major contracts from several countries saved the manufacturer from bankruptcy. A notable variant of the Model 1928 with an aluminum receiver and tenite grip, buttstock, and forend, was made by Savage.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M1928A1 variant entered mass production before the attack on Pearl Harbor, as on-hand stocks ran out. Changes included a horizontal forend, in place of the distinctive vertical foregrip (\\"pistol grip\\"), and a provision for a military sling. Despite new U.S. contracts for Lend-Lease shipments abroad to China, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as the needs of American armed forces, only two factories supplied M1928A1 Thompsons during the early years of World War II. Though it could use both the 50-round drum and the 20- or 30-round box magazines, active service showed the drums were more prone to jamming, rattled when moving, and were too heavy and bulky on long patrols. 562,511 were made. Wartime production variants had a fixed rear sight without the triangular sight guard wings and a non-ribbed barrel, both like those found on the M1/M1A1.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the Soviet Union received M1928A1s, included as standard equipment with the M3 light tanks obtained through Lend-Lease. The weapons were never issued to the Red Army because of a lack of .45 ACP ammunition on the Eastern Front; they were simply put in storage, although a picture exists of what appears to be Thompsons being used by Russian M3 Stuart crews in the Caucasus. As of September 2006, limited numbers of these weapons have been re-imported from Russia to the United States as disassembled \\"spare parts kits\\", comprising the entire weapon less the receiver (as required by Federal law).\\r\\n\\r\\nAn M1928A1 which also came with an unusual inline stock, modified with elevated sights to increase accuracy also existed.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1940 Commonwealth troops in Egypt and North Africa were issued commercial model Lend-Lease Colt- and Savage-manufactured M1928s. Section leaders carried them instead of pistols or rifles. Many of the Colt models had French-language manuals packed with them as they had been abruptly diverted to England after the fall of France. They soon discovered that the weapon was prone to jamming due to sand. To fix this, the armorers removed the Blish Lock and replaced it with a hex bolt to keep the cocking handle and bolt together. The 20-round Type XX magazines had their peep-holes welded shut to keep sand out and the 50-round Type L drums were discontinued. Ammunition was scarce as it was either in small lots of Lend-Lease commercial ammo or obtained from adjacent American troops. It was later replaced by the 9mm Sten gun and Lanchester SMG.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese captured enough Thompson M1928 SMGs and ammunition when they captured Hong Kong and Malaysia that it became a limited standard weapon. It surpassed any similar weapons currently in their service. Ammunition was usually in US 42-round Lend-Lease commercial cartons or Australian 28-round military cartons captured from the Commonwealth forces that was sampled, tested, and resealed with Japanese arsenal stickers.\\r\\n\\r\\nModels used in the Pacific by Australian troops had their sling swivels remounted on the left side to allow it to be fired more easily while prone. A metal sling mount was fitted to the left side of the wooden buttstock. Ammunition was manufactured in Australia or obtained from adjacent American troops. It was later replaced by the Owen Machine Carbine.\\r\\n\\r\\nResponding to a request for further simplification, the M1 was standardized in April 1942 as the United States Submachine Gun, Cal. .45, M1. Rate of fire was reduced to approximately 600-700?rpm.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst issued in 1943, the M1 uses a simple blowback operation, with the charging handle moved to the side. The flip-up adjustable Lyman rear sight was replaced with a fixed L sight. Late M1s had triangular guard wings added to the rear L sight, which were standardized on the M1A1. The slots adjoining the magazine well allowing the use of a drum magazine were removed. A new magazine catch with the provision for retaining drum magazines removed, was produced, but most M1s and later M1A1s retained the original. The less expensive and more-easily manufactured \\"stick\\" magazines were used exclusively in the M1, with a new 30-round version joining the familiar 20-round type. The Cutts compensator, barrel cooling fins, and Blish lock were omitted while the buttstock was permanently affixed. Late production M1 stocks were fitted with reinforcing bolts and washers to prevent splitting of the stock where it attached to the receiver. The British had used improvised bolts or wood screws to reinforce M1928 stocks. The M1 reinforcing bolt and washer were carried over to the M1A1 and retrofitted to many of the M1928A1s in U.S. and British service. Late M1s also had simplified fire control switches, also carried over to the M1A1.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M1A1, standardized in October 1942 as the United States Submachine Gun, Cal. .45, M1A1, could be produced in half the time of the M1928A1, and at a much lower cost. The main difference between the M1 and M1A1 was the bolt. The M1 bolt had a floating firing pin and hammer, the bolt of the M1A1 had the firing pin machined to the face of the bolt, eliminating unnecessary parts. The reinforced stock and protective sight wings were standard. The 30-round magazine became more common. In 1939, Thompsons cost the government $209 apiece. By the spring of 1942, cost-reduction design changes had brought this down to $70. In February 1944, the M1A1 reached a low price of $45 each, including accessories and spare parts, although the difference in price between the M1 and M1A1 was only $0.06. By the end of the war, the M1A1 was replaced with the even lower-cost M3 (commonly called the \\"Grease Gun\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Model 1927 was the open bolt semi-automatic-only version of the M1921. It was made by modifying an existing Model 1921, including replacing certain parts. The \\"Thompson Submachine Gun\\" inscription was machined over to replace it with \\"Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine\\", and the \\"Model 1921\\" inscription was also machined over to replace it with \\"Model 1927.\\" Although the Model 1927 was semi-automatic only, it was easily converted to fully automatic by installing a full-auto Model 1921 fire control group (internal parts). Most Model 1927s owned by police have been converted back to full-auto.[61] The original Model 1927 is classified as a machine gun under the National Firearms Act of 1934 (a) by being \\"readily convertible\\" by swapping parts and (b) by a 1982 BATF ruling making all open bolt semi-automatic firearms manufactured after the date of this ruling classified as machine guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Model 1927A1 is a semi-automatic only replica version of the Thompson, originally produced by Auto-Ordnance of West Hurley, New York for the civilian collector's market from 1974 to 1999. It has been produced since 1999 by Kahr Arms of Worcester, Massachusetts. It is officially known as the \\"Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine, Model of 1927A1.\\" The internal design is completely different to operate from the closed bolt and the carbine has barrel length of 16.5?in (420?mm) (versus open bolt operation and barrel length of 10.5?in (270?mm) for the full automatic versions). Under federal regulations, these changes make the Model 1927A1 legally a rifle and remove it from the federal registry requirements of the National Firearms Act. These modern versions should not be confused with the original semi-automatic M1927, which was a slightly modified M1921 produced by Colt for Auto-Ordnance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Model 1927A1 is the semi-automatic replica of the Thompson Models of 1921 and 1927. The \\"Thompson Commando\\" is a semi-automatic replica of the M1928A1. The Auto-Ordnance replica of the Thompson M1 and M1A1 is known as the TM1, and may be found marked \\"Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine, Caliber .45M1\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Model 1927A3 is a semi-automatic, .22 caliber version of the Thompson produced by Auto-Ordnance in West Hurley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Model 1927A5 is a semi-automatic, .45 ACP pistol version of the Thompson originally produced by Auto-Ordnance in West Hurley. It featured an aluminum receiver to reduce weight. It has been produced since 2008 by Kahr Arms of Worcester, Massachusetts as the \\"M1927A1 TA5\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of changes to Federal Law (prior to 2011), the 1927A5 .45 ACP Pistol is now simply classified as a \\"Firearm\\" or \\"Any Other Weapon (AOW) as it neither fits the definition of a Pistol or Rifle under current law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1928A1 LTD is a civilian semi-automatic-only clone with fixed stock, produced by Luxembourg Defense Technology in Luxembourg.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an attempt to expand interest and sales overseas, Auto-Ordnance entered into a partnership with and licensed the Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited (BSA) in England to produce a European model. These were produced in small quantities and have a different appearance than the classic style. The BSA 1926 was manufactured in 9mmP and 7.63mm Mauser and were tested by various governments, including France, in the mid-1920s. It was never adopted by any military force, and only a small number were produced.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nA special purpose machine pistol variant of the Thompson is manufactured by RPB Industries of Atlanta.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nA version with a threaded barrel for suppressors, side folding stock, and modified sights.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll variants and modified versions of Thompson Submachine Guns (even semiautomatic-only versions) are prohibited by name in Canada, as part of Prohibited Weapons Order No. 13 in 1995. Consequently, they cannot be legally imported or owned except under very limited circumstances. For example, to own one the person must be \\"grandfathered\\" and have owned one before the bill was passed against it. The submachine gun is not grandfathered like in US, only the owner. The submachine gun can only be sold to other grandfathered individuals; this keep prices extremely low as the number of permitted licensed individuals is very small and dwindling with time. Eventually, all prohibited guns will be confiscated.[64]:Part 1.86[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe perceived popularity of submachine guns such as the Thompson with violent gangsters in the 1920s and 1930s was one of the main reasons given for passage of the National Firearms Act by the United States Congress in 1934. One of its provisions was that owners of fully automatic firearms were required to register them with the predecessor agency of the modern Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The law also placed restrictions on the possession, transfer, and transport of the weapons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several U.S. made automatic and semi-automatic variants, copies, or replicas. The semi-automatic versions are less regulated by federal law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possession of any fully automatic firearm is prohibited in the UK by the Firearms Act 1968; prohibited firearms can be possessed on a section 5 certificate, but these are not issued to civilians. A fully automatic firearm that has been converted to semi-automatic fire, such as the Model 1927, is prohibited by the Firearms Act 1988, as is any centre-fire purpose-made semi-automatic weapon, such as the Model 1927A1. It is now effectively impossible for a firearm of this type to be legally possessed by a member of the general public, except in certified deactivated condition.","input":"What caliber does the thompson machine gun shoot?"},{"output":"September 5, 2017","context":"American Horror Story is an American anthology horror television series created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk.

Kit Walker (Evan Peters), accused of being prolific serial killer \\"Bloody Face\\" after the disappearance of his wife but claiming that his wife was abducted by aliens, is incarcerated at Briarcliff. This piques the interest of ambitious journalist Lana Winters (Sarah Paulson), who is yearning to find a story for her big break. At Briarcliff, Kit meets the other patients, many of whom claim to be unjustly institutionalized, including nymphomaniac Shelley (Chloe Sevigny), and the unassuming Grace (Lizzie Brocher) from France, who appears to be harboring a deep secret of her own. Believed to be a violent serial killer, he becomes the subject of interest of pragmatic psychiatrist Dr. Oliver Thredson (Zachary Quinto) and the sadistic Dr. Arthur Arden (James Cromwell), the latter of whom routinely conducts scientific operations on patients.

The season mostly deals with insanity, with other themes including female sexuality, corrupt ambition, religion versus science, racism, prejudice, death, and faith.\\r\\nSet in the year 2013, the season follows the dwindling descendants of the witches who survived the Salem Witch Trials and their struggle to hide their identity in the modern world. Those who share this genetic affliction are being subjected to violent attacks from outside forces, such as religious townspeople and witch hunters. Zoe Benson (Taissa Farmiga), a young teenager completely unaware of the existence of witches, discovers her identity as a Salem descendent after a violent accident that causes the death of her boyfriend. She is sent to an all-girls boarding school in New Orleans which aims to protect and house young women who carry this unique bloodline, and keep them from the dangers of the outside world. There, she meets the other students, narcissistic film star Madison Montgomery (Emma Roberts), outspoken Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe), and enigmatic Nan (Jamie Brewer), and gets romantically entangled with Kyle (Evan Peters), a non-witch and good-natured college student. The school is run by headmistress Cordelia Foxx (Sarah Paulson), head of the Witches Council and eccentric fashionista Myrtle Snow (Frances Conroy), and the mute butler Spalding (Denis O'Hare). Cordelia's mother, Fiona Goode (Jessica Lange), is the Supreme and most powerful witch of her generation, though she regularly avoids her responsibilities, much to the chagrin of Cordelia and her long-time rival Myrtle. After a mob of townspeople discover and nearly kill a lonely, young witch living in the swamps named Misty (Lily Rabe), Fiona returns to the school to ensure the safety of the other young witches, but also to fulfill her own hidden agenda. Events reveal a long-held rivalry between the witches of Salem and the voodoo practitioners of New Orleans, as well as a historic grudge between Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett) and socialite serial killer Delphine LaLaurie (Kathy Bates). This season mostly deals with oppression, with other themes including witchcraft, voodoo, racism, prejudice, death, and family, such as the relationships between mothers and daughters.\\r\\nSet in the year 1952 in the quiet town of Jupiter, Florida, the season follows a struggling freak show led by Elsa Mars (Jessica Lange). Decades have passed since the public has looked upon freak shows as a form of entertainment, but Elsa dreams of finding a home for her \\"monsters\\", as well as for her own fame and fortune. Other members of her troupe include Jimmy Darling (Evan Peters), a boy born with syndactyly who dreams of living a normal life, and his mother Ethel (Kathy Bates), a bearded lady who is Elsa's second-in-command by maintaining law and order under the tent. A strongman from Ethel's troubled past named Dell Toledo (Michael Chiklis), and his three-breasted wife Desiree Dupree (Angela Bassett), make waves when they arrive to join the freak show. To drum up business and save her troupe once and for all, Elsa also recruits conjoined twin sisters Bette and Dot Tattler (Sarah Paulson) to perform for her show. In a time when the era of television is beginning to reign high above sideshow acts, these individuals must overcome those who persecute them based on their looks. However, as events unfold, it is revealed that multiple dark entities have taken up residence in Jupiter, with all of their eyes being set on the freaks. A conman named Stanley (Denis O'Hare), posing as a Hollywood executive, arrives with his young protege Maggie (Emma Roberts), with the intention of murdering the freaks and sending their bodies to a museum for profit. The wealthy and spoiled Dandy Mott (Finn Wittrock), enabled by his doting mother Gloria (Frances Conroy), develops an unhealthy obsession with the freaks, particularly Bette and Dot. Perhaps most dangerous of all is a mysterious, deformed serial killer, only known as Twisty the Clown (John Carroll Lynch), who wreaks havoc among the town and appears to be targeting freaks and townspeople alike. This season mostly deals with discrimination, with other themes including prejudice, acceptance, exploitation, entertainment, television, and medical oddities.\\r\\nSet in the year 2015, the season follows the strange and dangerous happenings that seem to center around the retro Hotel Cortez in downtown Los Angeles, California, initially built as a secret torture chamber to fulfill the violent desires of founder James Patrick March (Evan Peters). Detective John Lowe (Wes Bentley) arrives at the hotel, based on intel from an anonymous tip, to investigate a grisly string of murders, each of which exemplify a sin in violation of one of the Ten Commandments. He has become estranged from his wife Alex (Chloe Sevigny), who suffers from depression, and his daughter Scarlett (Shree Crooks), after the disappearance of their son Holden (Lennon Henry). As the season unfolds, the Lowes discover that the disappearance of Holden may be related to the strange activities at the hotel, lead by the centuries-old, bloodthirsty vampire Elizabeth, known to others simply as the Countess (Lady Gaga), and her current lover and former heroin addict-turned-vampire Donovan (Matt Bomer). Throughout his investigation, John also becomes entangled with a mysterious heroin junkie named Sally (Sarah Paulson), as well as the ghost of James Patrick March, who is looking for a protege to continue the violent acts he started when he was alive. The hotel's tireless staff includes the surly front desk manager Iris (Kathy Bates), Donovan's mother who took the job to be close to her son, and perceptive transgender bartender Liz (Denis O'Hare), both of whom hesitantly cater to the Countess and her homicidal tendencies. The Countess's relationship with Donovan becomes troubled with the arrival of male model heartthrob Tristan (Finn Wittrock), New York fashion designer and potential purchaser of the hotel Will Drake (Cheyenne Jackson), and her former scorned lover and actress Ramona Royale (Angela Bassett), all of whom become entangled in her hedonistic, violent lifestyle. This season mostly deals with addiction, with other themes including sexuality, insanity, revenge, debauchery, religion, sin, drug use, forgiveness, and death.\\r\\nSet in the year 2016, the season follows the supernatural events that occur in a renovated farmhouse in North Carolina which is situated on the land where the Roanoke Colony moved after their infamous disappearance. Shelby Miller (Lily Rabe), her husband Matt (Andr Holland), along with Matt's sister Lee Harris (Adina Porter) recount their harrowing experience living in the farmhouse a year prior in a popular documentary titled My Roanoke Nightmare, including their encounters with the ghosts of the house's previous residents, the violent ghosts of the Roanoke Colony, the cannibalistic Polk family who live nearby, and a mysterious but dangerous entity known as Scathach. The documentary becomes a huge success, featuring dramatic reenactments of the Millers' story starring Audrey Tindall (Sarah Paulson) as Shelby, Dominic Banks (Cuba Gooding Jr.) as Matt, Monet Tumusiime (Angela Bassett) as Lee, Agnes Mary Winstead (Kathy Bates) as Thomasin, the matriarch of the ghost colony, Rory Monahan (Evan Peters) as Edward Mott, the wealthy former owner of the house, William van Henderson (Denis O'Hare) as Dr. Cunningham, a professor who becomes entranced with the paranormal happenings of the area, Dylan (Wes Bentley) as Ambrose, another member of the ghost colony. The success of the documentary leads to a sequel titled Return to Roanoke: Three Days In Hell, spearheaded by the producer of the original series, Sidney Aaron James (Cheyenne Jackson), who invites the Millers, as well as many of the reenactment actors, to return to the farmhouse for three days, where all their actions will be captured by hidden cameras. Although the Millers are aware of the entities that reside in the house, all three agree to return, each with their own agenda. The production eventually descends into disaster, however, as cast and crew alike are quickly targeted when the violent entities begin to surface. This season mostly deals with exploitation, with other themes including reality, fame, motherhood, family, publicity, revenge, the media, and television.\\r\\nSet in the year 2017, the fictitious town of Brookfield Heights, Michigan, is left divided upon the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election. Local restaurant owner Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson) is left utterly distraught, along with her wife Ivy (Alison Pill). Despite the help of her psychiatrist, Dr. Rudy Vincent (Cheyenne Jackson), Ally becomes increasingly unstable in the following weeks, her long repressed phobias begin to re-emerge, and they begin to affect her relationships with her wife as well as their son Oz (Cooper Dodson). Across town, a young man named Kai Anderson (Evan Peters) rejoices at the election results, enticing him to pursue political power by running for city council, led by an eccentric old feminist woman, called Bebe Babbitt (Frances Conroy), with the help of his reluctant, liberal sister Winter (Billie Lourd), who was also hired by the Mayfair-Richards household as their babysitter. As Ally attempts to adjust to regular life despite her growing anxiety and paranoia, she becomes terrorized by a group of masked assailants in clown attire who are only present when she is alone, leaving those around her to wonder if she was truly attacked, or if they were merely hallucinations. Kai's faithful followers include Ally's eccentric neighbors Harrison (Billy Eichner) and Meadow Wilton (Leslie Grossman), newscast reporter Beverly Hope (Adina Porter), sneaky Detective Jack Samuels (Colton Haynes), as well as local grocery cashier Gary K. Longstreet (Chaz Bono).With Kai's rise to power revealing sinister motives, amplifying her growing distrust of those around her, such as her neighbors, Ally starts to draw connections between her alleged clown attackers and the many strange incidents occurring in Brookfield Heights, and she begins to fear that everyone in town is out to get her. This season mostly deals with marginalization, with other themes including politics, government, conspiracies, the media, fear, power, disenfranchisement, revenge, sexism, and oppression.\\r\\nOn January 12, 2017, the series was renewed for an eighth season set to air in 2018.[7] On October 1, 2017, it was announced that cast mainstay Sarah Paulson will return to the eighth season.[8]\\r\\nOn January 12, 2017, the series was renewed for a ninth season set to air in 2019.[7]\\r\\nCreators Murphy and Falchuk began working on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy wanted to do the opposite of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated: \\"I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me.\\"[10] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. \\"You want people to be a little bit off balance afterwards,\\" he said.[11]\\r\\nIn February 2011, FX officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series from Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, with both Murphy and Falchuk writing and Murphy directing. Dante Di Loreto was announced as executive producer. Production on the series began in April 2011.[12] In July 2011, FX officially announced the project had been picked up to series.[13]\\r\\nFrom the beginning, Murphy and Falchuk planned that each season of the series would tell a different story.[9] After the first-season finale aired, Murphy spoke of his plans to change the cast and location for the second season.[14] He did say, however, that some actors who starred in the first season would be returning. \\"The people that are coming back will be playing completely different characters, creatures, monsters, etc. [The Harmons'] stories are done. People who are coming back will be playing entirely new characters,\\" he announced.[9] In November 2012, FX chief executive, John Landgraf, described the unique format of the series stating: \\"[T]he notion of doing an anthological series of miniseries with a repertory cast ÿ has proven groundbreaking, wildly successful and will prove to be trendsetting.\\"[15]\\r\\nAt the 2013 PaleyFest, Falchuk compared the series to horror films: \\"It does demand a little bit of compassion at the end because you fall in love with these characters in a different way than you would in a movie,\\" he said. \\"If you want to kill everybody in a movie except one person, you can kind of get away with that, but if you're looking to do a horror TV show, you have a different responsibility to the characters because the audience has a different affection for them.\\"[16]\\r\\nMurphy then explained the process of planning a series' season takes about a year. \\"We come up with story first and then we come up with the characters,\\" he said. \\"It is a repertory company, so we'll move people around and sometimes there won't yet be a role for somebody. Like when we started [the second season], I really had no idea that Dylan [McDermott] would be the person to play Sarah's son, but the deeper we got, I thought, that would work great.\\"[16]\\r\\nIn an August 2015 article for Entertainment Weekly, Murphy revealed that the show is mulling producing two seasons a year. The first being broadcast in the spring and the second in the fall. He explained, \\"We're doing something that we've never done before on the show where we're doing two different groups of writers rooms. Some of our writers will be bouncing around but a whole different group coming in late August. The next thing were crafting up is very, very different than [Hotel]. Not smaller. But just not opulent.

Designed and built in 1908 by Alfred Rosenheim, the president of the American Institute of Architects' Los Angeles chapter, the Tudor or Collegiate Gothic-style single family home was previously used as a convent.[70][71] The first season was filmed on sets which are an exact replica of the house.[72] Details such as Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows and hammered bronze light fixtures were re-created to preserve the look of the house.[70]\\r\\nProduction and shooting for the second season began in late July 2012 for a scheduled premiere in mid October.[73] The exteriors for the second season were filmed in Hidden Valley, Ventura County, California, a rural area outside Los Angeles, although the season took place in Massachusetts.[74]\\r\\nPrincipal photography for the third season began on July 23, 2013,[75] in New Orleans, Louisiana.[76][77] It was first reported that the season would film in multiple locations, but filming primarily took place in New Orleans.[78]\\r\\nPrincipal photography for season 4 began on July 15, 2014, in New Orleans, though the story takes place in Jupiter, Florida.\\r\\nPrincipal photography for season 5 began on July 14, 2015, in Los Angeles, California, where the story also takes place.[79] Murphy revealed a six-story hotel set was being built on the Fox lot. A dummy set of the hotel was built at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, showing an Art Deco style building from the 1920s, inspired by the old Hollywood era.[80]\\r\\nFilming for season 6 began on July 6, 2016 at Santa Clarita, California.[81] Set constructions include a Colonial Settler home to speculate the disappearance of the Roanoke Colony.[82]\\r\\nFilming for season 7 was originally planned to begin in Orange, California on June 2017 before it was moved to May instead.[83][84]\\r\\nAmerican Horror Story's title screens offer vague hints to important plot elements and events that compose each season. For Murder House, Murphy described the sequence as a mini-mystery and stated that: \\"By the time you see the ninth episode of this season, every image in that title sequence will be explained,\\" establishing the purpose of the title sequence for future seasons.[85]\\r\\nThe opening title sequence was created by Kyle Cooper and his company Prologue. He also created the title sequence for the AMC series The Walking Dead and the 1995 film Seven. The theme music was composed by sound designer Cesar Davila-Irizarry and musician Charlie Clouser.[86] The cinematography was done by Juan Ruiz Ancha and the editing by Gabriel J. Diaz.\\r\\nFor the first season, the sequence is set in the Harmons' basement and includes images of postmortem young children, fetuses in jars, skulls, a christening dress, a nurse's uniform, and a figure holding a pair of bloody hedge clippers. A photo of alleged axe murderer Lizzie Borden is shown.\\r\\nThe second season's opening sequence is done by the same creative team. \\"We are shooting a new title sequence with the same team that did last year's,\\" series creator Ryan Murphy said. \\"The song may stay... not sure.\\"[87] The music was kept, and the new title sequence was set around the Asylum, using shots of inmates raving and surgeons operating on patients with bandages obscuring their faces. Elements include a young girl walking backwards on her hands and feet up a staircase and a shot of the Virgin Mary's smile changing from one of benevolence to one of spite.\\r\\nThe third season's opening sequence keeps the same music, and this sequence is the first one to be filmed primarily outside and not in an enclosed location. Shots include figures wearing black robes and capirotes, a bony-skeleton creature with wings and shots of dead goats, the Minotaur from the season also appears. For the first time, there are actual backgrounds that appear with the actor names instead of an all-black background, some of these images include witches hanging and Santa Muerte. Other elements include a black man with piercing eyes and a disturbing smile as well as voodoo dolls. The final shot continues after the figures in black capirotes seize one of their own who is later seen burning at a stake where young, dress-clad witches dance around.\\r\\nThe fourth season's opening sequence changed things up, the series theme music remains intact albeit with an added carnival-like soundscape. The sequence is composed of both CGI and stop-motion animation and features strange characters such as a skeleton chimera of a human being and an elephant riding a bicycle, a skeleton of what appears to be a single head but two bodies, a devil-like man, a boy in a wheel chair with deformed legs, a character with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet, a clown who can twist his head around, a woman with a third leg where her genitalia should be, and a demonic cymbal-banging monkey toy. There are also shots of side show attractions like the Human Blockhead, knife throwing and sword swallowing. The main recurring element features a balloon twister popping balloons with a knife.\\r\\nThe fifth season's opening sequence also was very different from previous seasons', taking a more biblical approach. The font, while remaining the same as the first four seasons, glow in red against a hotel wallpaper. The Ten Commandments are also shown throughout the video. The intro returns to live-action like the first three seasons. Visuals include many people scrubbing blood all over the walls and the floor, strange things shown through peepholes, people being victims to the hotel, little kids running around the hotel, as well as many different creatures.[88]\\r\\nThe sixth season featured no title sequence or opening credits, instead opting for a simple title card (from the first season) which read \\"American Horror Story\\", while the series theme music plays over the end credits.\\r\\nIn the deveploment of the seventh season, Ryan Murphy confirmed that the opening sequence will return. The seventh season's opening sequence features the series theme music played by a marching band. The sequence is live-action. Visuals include: a gang of clowns rises from a casket, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton masks, Benjamin Franklin statue, a dead dog killed by toxic gas, a Merry Go Round, bloody hands that cannot be washed, beehive, toxic smoke released from a grenade, holes in several forms, bloody US flag with sound of a xylophone playing The Star-Spangled Banner, blood covered couple having sex and a handcuffed pinky promise. Clowns also appear throughout the sequence.\\r\\nThe title sequence for all seasons of the show use a variation of the Willow typeface that very closely resembles a style for which Scottish designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh was known.[89]\\r\\nAs part of the promotion for the series, FX launched a \\"House Call\\" campaign, in which viewers at home could sign up and come face-to-face with a character from the series.[90] Prior to the series premiere, FX released several clues to shine light on the series. They were offered on the show's official YouTube channel. Ten clues were released.[91] In September 2011, FX launched a website which allows visitors to tour the Murder House throughout the decades and look for clues.[92]\\r\\nIn August 2012, the first promo for the second season was released on the American Horror Story Facebook page entitled \\"Special Delivery\\", in which a nun carries a couple of buckets filled with body parts through a field. As a church bell rings, the nun empties one bucket's bloody contents, leaving the empty bucket behind, and resumes her trek.[93] Over 20 subsequent teasers were released.[94] Four photos were also released on EW.com.[95] Two televised teasers, titled \\"Meet the Residents\\", were released on August 31, 2012. They feature the patients and some staff (such as Dr. Thredson, played by Zachary Quinto, and Sister Mary Eunice, played by Lily Rabe) lying in twin beds and dealing with their individual issues as the heads of the asylum (Jessica Lange, Joseph Fiennes and James Cromwell) look on. The song \\"Que Sera, Sera\\", mixed with the show's theme music, plays.[96] To promote Cult, a competition was set up where fans who donated to the Children's Hospital Los Angeles could get a chance to get a walk-on role in an episode, and lunch with Evan Peters.[97]\\r\\nOn August 16, 2016, FX announced a deal had been struck to feature an American Horror Story exhibit at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Orlando for their Halloween Horror Nights. The maze will feature sets and themes from Murder House, Freak Show, and Hotel. Universal said of the experience, \\"Twisted scenes from Murder House will unleash the evil spirits that possess the Harmon estate, spiraling guests through decades of the tortured dead who previously resided there. In Freak Show, guests will join a troupe of biological misfits in a sinister sideshow where they'll be stalked by the murderous and deformed Twisty the Clown. Finally, guests will succumb to the warped desires of The Countess after checking into the haunted Hotel Cortez, conceived from the beginning as a torture chamber for its customers.\\"[98]\\r\\nIn 2017, the show returned as haunted attractions to both parks, with Universal Orlando having an attraction based on Asylum, Coven, and Roanoke, and Universal Studios Hollywood basing their attraction solely on Roanoke.\\r\\nThe series premiered on October 5, 2011, and is broadcast on the cable television channel FX in the United States.

At age 76 in 2006, he became the second-oldest inmate to be executed in the United States since 1976, after John B. Nixon, who was executed in Mississippi in December 2005 at age 77.\\r\\nPro-death penalty activists cite Allen's actions as a reason to support capital punishment in the United States. He was already serving a life sentence for one murder when he was convicted of organizing the killing of three more people.\\r\\nWhile in prison, Allen then acknowledged his Native American Choctaw heritage. He also claimed to be deaf, blind and severely disabled, requiring a wheelchair for mobility. He did not know any sign language to communicate with hearing people. During his execution, he was able to walk from his wheelchair to the death podium unassisted. In addition, he appeared to be looking straight at his family prior to receiving the first dose of drugs during his lethal injection procedure. Allen had a confirmed advanced case of type 2 diabetes, and he suffered a perhaps related heart attack on September 2, 2005. His lawyers declared that \\"he presents absolutely no danger at this point, as incapacitated as he is. There's no legitimate state purpose served by executing him. It would be gratuitous punishment.\\" They argued that his execution would constitute cruel and unusual punishment and requested that he be granted clemency by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, which was subsequently refused.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1974, Allen plotted the burglary of Fran's Market, a Fresno area supermarket, owned by Ray and Fran Schletewitz, whom Allen had known for years. The plot involved his son, Roger Allen, as well as Ed Savala, Carl Mayfield, and Charles Jones. Mayfield and Jones worked for Clarence Ray Allen in his security guard business as well as part of a burglary enterprise allegedly operated by Allen. As part of the burglary plot against Fran's Market, he arranged for someone to steal a set of door and alarm keys from the market owner's son, Bryon Schletewitz, age 19, while Schletewitz was swimming in Allen's pool. Allen then arranged a date between Schletewitz and Mary Sue Kitts (his son Roger's girlfriend) for the evening, during which time the burglary took place. The burglary netted $500 in cash and $10,000 in money orders from the store's safe. Following the commission of the burglary, Kitts told Bryon Schletewitz that Allen had committed the crime, which she knew as she had helped Allen cash money orders that had been stolen from the store.[1]\\r\\nSchletewitz confronted Roger Allen, informing him that he had been told of the crime by Kitts, and Roger Allen admitted the crime. When Roger Allen told his father Clarence of Bryon's accusation, Clarence Allen stated that they (Schletewitz and Kitts) would have to be \\"dealt with.\\" He enlisted three employees of his security firm, Charles Jones, Carl Mayfield, and Lee Furrow. According to an opinion filed on May 6, 2004 in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals:\\r\\nAllen then ordered the murder of Kitts by Lee Furrow. After an unsuccessful attempt to poison her with cyanide capsules, Allen called Furrow to learn if he had killed Kitts. Furrow told Allen he was in the process of strangling her and Allen replied, \\"do it.\\" After killing Kitts, Furrow threw her body into the Friant-Kern Canal. The body has never been found.\\r\\nWhile in Folsom Prison, Allen conspired with fellow inmate Billy Ray Hamilton to murder the various witnesses who had testified against him, including Bryon Schletewitz. Allen intended to obtain a new trial, where there would be no witnesses to testify to his acts.\\r\\nAfter Hamilton was paroled from Folsom Prison, he carried out Allen's orders. On September 5, 1980, Hamilton and his girlfriend, Connie Barbo, went to Fran's Market, east of Fresno, California. Bryon Schletewitz, the son of the market's owner, worked at the market. There, Hamilton murdered Schletewitz and fellow employees Josephine Rocha, 17, and Douglas White, 18, with a sawed-off shotgun and wounded two other people, Joe Rios and Jack Abbott.[3] Hamilton shot Schletewitz at near point-blank range in the forehead and then killed Rocha and White after forcing them to lie on the floor of the store. Rios, also an employee of the market, was shot as well but raised his arm as Hamilton fired on him and this action undoubtedly saved his life. The other wounded survivor, Abbott, was a neighbor who heard the shotgun blasts, came to the market to investigate, and was also shot by Hamilton. Abbott returned fire and wounded Hamilton, who escaped from the scene.\\r\\nFive days after the events at Fran's Market, Hamilton was arrested while attempting to rob a liquor store. On his person was found a \\"hit list\\" with the names and addresses of the witnesses who testified against Allen at his trial for Kitts' murder; Bryon Schletewitz was on the list.\\r\\nIn 1980, the California Attorney General filed charges against Allen and prosecuted the trial in Glenn County, California, due to a change of venue. The trial lasted 23 days, and 58 witnesses were called to testify. Ultimately, the jury convicted Allen of triple murder and conspiracy to murder eight witnesses.\\r\\nAs special circumstances making Allen eligible for the death penalty, the jury also found that Allen had previously been convicted of murder, had committed multiple murders, and had murdered witnesses in retaliation for their prior testimony and to prevent future testimony. During a seven-day penalty phase, the Attorney General introduced evidence of Allen's career orchestrating violent robberies in the Central Valley, including ten violent crimes and six prior felony convictions. The jury returned a unanimous verdict of death, and the Glenn County Superior Court sentenced Allen on November 22, 1980.\\r\\nIn 1987, the California Supreme Court affirmed Allen's death sentence. Associate Justice Joseph Grodin's opinion referred to Allen's crimes as \\"sordid events\\" with an \\"extraordinarily massive amount\\" of aggravating evidence. In a dissenting opinion, California Supreme Court Justice Broussard stated that the prosecutor influenced the jury by telling them that \\"if you conclude that aggravating evidence outweighs the mitigating evidence, you shall return a death sentence,\\" while the law does not mandate a death sentence in such a situation. According to Justice Broussard, this led to a lack of freedom for the jury to make a \\"normative decision.\\"\\r\\nIn 2005, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that Allen's trial counsel had been inadequate, and the evidence against him was largely the testimony of Allen's several accomplices, who painted him as the mastermind who forced them by threats and scare tactics to commit robberies and murders. However the court denied rehearing in Allen's case. In her opinion for the panel, Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw concluded:\\r\\nDeputy California Attorney General Ward Campbell stated in an interview:\\r\\nOn January 13, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger refused to grant Allen clemency, stating that \\"his conduct did not result from youth or inexperience, but instead resulted from the hardened and calculating decisions of a mature man.\\" Schwarzenegger also cited a poem in which Allen glorified his actions, where Allen wrote, \\"We rob and steal and for those who squeal are usually found dying or dead.\\"\\r\\nOn January 15, 2006, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Allen's claim that executing an aged or infirm person was cruel and unusual punishment, observing that his mental acuity was unimpaired and that he had been fifty years of age when he arranged the murders from prison. Judge Kim Wardlaw writing for the panel of judges Susan Graber, Richard Clifton, and herself:\\r\\nThe United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case, albeit over the dissent of Justice Stephen Breyer, who stated: \\"I believe that in the circumstances he raises a significant question as to whether his execution would constitute 'cruel and unusual punishment.'\\"\\r\\nAllen was executed by lethal injection on January 17, 2006, the day after his 76th birthday, at California's San Quentin State Prison. He became the second-oldest inmate to be executed in the United States since 1976 (John B. Nixon of Mississippi was executed in 2005 at age 77) and, as of 2018, the last inmate executed in California. Allen was assisted in the death chamber by four correctional officers, though a media observer stated that he was clearly moving under his own power. To the surprise of everyone present, the warden indicated that he needed an additional injection of the lethal potassium in order to stop his surprisingly healthy heart. Allen wrote in his final statement, which was read immediately following the execution, \\"My last words will be 'Hoka hey, it's a good day to die. Thank you very much. I love you all. Goodbye.'\\"\\r\\nAllen died with an eagle feather on his chest. He was wearing a medicine bag around his neck, and a beaded headband. He was visited shortly before the execution by two Native American spiritual advisers.\\r\\nAllen died at 12:38?a.m. Approximately 250 death penalty opponents gathered for a candlelight vigil outside the walls of San Quentin. His last meal consisted of Buffalo steak and frybread (both are traditional Native American dishes) as well as a bucket of KFC white-meat-only chicken, sugar-free pecan pie, sugar-free walnut ice cream, and whole milk. The ice-cream was left out to thaw for one hour, which Allen turned into a milkshake by hand.\\r\\nCorrectional Officers familiar with Clarence Ray Allen stated that he often walked without assistance and was also able to read his mail.[1]","input":"When was the last person to be executed in california?"},{"output":"China","context":"Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae. The fiber is almost pure cellulose. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.\\r\\nThe plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa.[1] Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds.\\r\\nThe fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated to the fifth millennium BC have been found in the Indus Valley Civilization. Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today.\\r\\nCurrent estimates for world production are about 25 million tonnes or 110 million bales annually, accounting for 2.5% of the world's arable land. China is the world's largest producer of cotton, but most of this is used domestically. The United States has been the largest exporter for many years.[2] In the United States, cotton is usually measured in bales, which measure approximately 0.48 cubic meters (17 cubic feet) and weigh 226.8 kilograms (500 pounds).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are four commercially grown species of cotton, all domesticated in antiquity:\\r\\nThe two New World cotton species account for the vast majority of modern cotton production, but the two Old World species were widely used before the 1900s. While cotton fibers occur naturally in colors of white, brown, pink and green, fears of contaminating the genetics of white cotton have led many cotton-growing locations to ban the growing of colored cotton varieties.\\r\\nThe earliest evidence of cotton use in the Indian subcontinent has been found at the site of Mehrgarh and Rakhigarhi where cotton threads have been found preserved in copper beads; these finds have been dated to the Neolithic (5th millennium BC).[4][5] Cotton cultivation in the region is dated to the Indus Valley Civilization, which covered parts of modern eastern Pakistan and northwestern India between 3300 and 1300 BC.[6] The Indus cotton industry was well-developed and some methods used in cotton spinning and fabrication continued to be used until the industrialization of India.[7] Between 2000 and 1000 BC cotton became widespread across much of India.[8] For example, it has been found at the site of Hallus in Karnataka dating from around 1000 BC.[9]\\r\\nCotton bolls discovered in a cave near Tehuacn, Mexico, have at first been dated to as early as 5500 BC, but this date has been challenged.[10] More securely dated is the domestication of Gossypium hirsutum in Mexico between around 3400 and 2300 BC.[11]\\r\\nIn Peru, cultivation of the indigenous cotton species Gossypium barbadense has been dated, from a find in Ancon, to c 4200 BC,[12] and was the backbone of the development of coastal cultures such as the Norte Chico, Moche, and Nazca. Cotton was grown upriver, made into nets, and traded with fishing villages along the coast for large supplies of fish. The Spanish who came to Mexico and Peru in the early 16th century found the people growing cotton and wearing clothing made of it.\\r\\nThe Greeks and the Arabs were not familiar with cotton until the Wars of Alexander the Great, as his contemporary Megasthenes told Seleucus I Nicator of \\"there being trees on which wool grows\\" in \\"Indica\\".[citation needed] This may be a reference to \\"tree cotton\\", Gossypium arboreum, which is a native of the Indian subcontinent.\\r\\nAccording to the Columbia Encyclopedia:[9]\\r\\nCotton has been spun, woven, and dyed since prehistoric times. It clothed the people of ancient India, Egypt, and China. Hundreds of years before the Christian era, cotton textiles were woven in India with matchless skill, and their use spread to the Mediterranean countries.\\r\\nIn Iran (Persia), the history of cotton dates back to the Achaemenid era (5th century BC); however, there are few sources about the planting of cotton in pre-Islamic Iran. The planting of cotton was common in Merv, Ray and Pars of Iran. In Persian poets' poems, especially Ferdowsi's Shahname, there are references to cotton (\\"panbe\\" in Persian). Marco Polo (13th century) refers to the major products of Persia, including cotton. John Chardin, a French traveler of the 17th century who visited Safavid Persia, spoke approvingly of the vast cotton farms of Persia.[13]\\r\\nDuring the Han dynasty (207 BC - 220 AD), cotton was grown by Chinese peoples in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan.[14]\\r\\nEgyptians grew and spun cotton in the first seven centuries of the Christian era.[15]\\r\\nHandheld roller cotton gins had been used in India since the 6th century, and was then introduced to other countries from there.[16] Between the 12th and 14th centuries, dual-roller gins appeared in India and China. The Indian version of the dual-roller gin was prevalent throughout the Mediterranean cotton trade by the 16th century. This mechanical device was, in some areas, driven by water power.[17]\\r\\nThe spinning wheel was invented in India, between 500 and 1000 AD.[18] The earliest clear illustrations of the spinning wheel come from the Islamic world in the eleventh century.[19]\\r\\nDuring the late medieval period, cotton became known as an imported fiber in northern Europe, without any knowledge of how it was derived, other than that it was a plant. Because Herodotus had written in his Histories, Book III, 106, that in India trees grew in the wild producing wool, it was assumed that the plant was a tree, rather than a shrub. This aspect is retained in the name for cotton in several Germanic languages, such as German Baumwolle, which translates as \\"tree wool\\" (Baum means \\"tree\\"; Wolle means \\"wool\\"). Noting its similarities to wool, people in the region could only imagine that cotton must be produced by plant-borne sheep. John Mandeville, writing in 1350, stated as fact that \\"There grew there [India] a wonderful tree which bore tiny lambs on the endes of its branches. These branches were so pliable that they bent down to allow the lambs to feed when they are hungry.\\" (See Vegetable Lamb of Tartary.) By the end of the 16th century, cotton was cultivated throughout the warmer regions in Asia and the Americas.\\r\\nCotton manufacture was introduced to Europe during the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula and Sicily. The knowledge of cotton weaving was spread to northern Italy in the 12th century, when Sicily was conquered by the Normans, and consequently to the rest of Europe. The spinning wheel, introduced to Europe circa 1350, improved the speed of cotton spinning.[20] By the 15th century, Venice, Antwerp, and Haarlem were important ports for cotton trade, and the sale and transportation of cotton fabrics had become very profitable.[21]\\r\\nUnder the Mughal Empire, which ruled in the Indian subcontinent from the early 16th century to the early 18th century, Indian cotton production increased, in terms of both raw cotton and cotton textiles. The Mughals introduced agrarian reforms such as a new revenue system that was biased in favour of higher value cash crops such as cotton and indigo, providing state incentives to grow cash crops, in addition to rising market demand.[22]\\r\\nThe largest manufacturing industry in the Mughal Empire was cotton textile manufacturing, which included the production of piece goods, calicos, and muslins, available unbleached and in a variety of colours. The cotton textile industry was responsible for a large part of the empire's international trade.[23] India had a 25% share of the global textile trade in the early 18th century.[24] Indian cotton textiles were the most important manufactured goods in world trade in the 18th century, consumed across the world from the Americas to Japan.[25] The most important center of cotton production was the Bengal Subah province, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka.[26]\\r\\nThe worm gear roller cotton gin, which was invented in India during the early Delhi Sultanate era of the 13thÿ14th centuries, came into use in the Mughal Empire some time around the 16th century,[27] and is still used in India through to the present day.[16] Another innovation, the incorporation of the crank handle in the cotton gin, first appeared in India some time during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire.[28] The production of cotton, which may have largely been spun in the villages and then taken to towns in the form of yarn to be woven into cloth textiles, was advanced by the diffusion of the spinning wheel across India shortly before the Mughal era, lowering the costs of yarn and helping to increase demand for cotton. The diffusion of the spinning wheel, and the incorporation of the worm gear and crank handle into the roller cotton gin, led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production during the Mughal era.[29]\\r\\nIt was reported that, with an Indian cotton gin, which is half machine and half tool, one man and one woman could clean 28 pounds of cotton per day. With a modified Forbes version, one man and a boy could produce 250 pounds per day. If oxen were used to power 16 of these machines, and a few people's labour was used to feed them, they could produce as much work as 750 people did formerly.[30]\\r\\nIn the early 19th century, a Frenchman named M. Jumel proposed to the great ruler of Egypt, Mohamed Ali Pasha, that he could earn a substantial income by growing an extra-long staple Maho (Gossypium barbadense) cotton, in Lower Egypt, for the French market. Mohamed Ali Pasha accepted the proposition and granted himself the monopoly on the sale and export of cotton in Egypt; and later dictated cotton should be grown in preference to other crops.\\r\\nEgypt under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century had the fifth most productive cotton industry in the world, in terms of the number of spindles per capita.[31] The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as animal power, water wheels, and windmills, which were also the principal energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870.[32] It was under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century that steam engines were introduced to the Egyptian cotton industry.[32]\\r\\nBy the time of the American Civil war annual exports had reached $16 million (120,000 bales), which rose to $56 million by 1864, primarily due to the loss of the Confederate supply on the world market. Exports continued to grow even after the reintroduction of US cotton, produced now by a paid workforce, and Egyptian exports reached 1.2 million bales a year by 1903.\\r\\nThe English East India Company introduced the Britain to cheap calico and chintz cloth on the restoration of the monarchy in the 1660s. Initially imported as a novelty side line, from its spice trading posts in Asia, the cheap colourful cloth proved popular and overtook the EIC's spice trade by value in the late 17th century. The EIC embraced the demand, particularly for calico, by expanding its factories in Asia and producing and importing cloth in bulk, creating competition for domestic woollen and linen textile producers. The impacted weavers, spinners, dyers, shepherds and farmers objected and the calico question became one of the major issues of National politics between the 1680s and the 1730s. Parliament began to see a decline in domestic textile sales, and an increase in imported textiles from places like China and India. Seeing the East India Company and their textile importation as a threat to domestic textile businesses, Parliament passed the 1700 Calico Act, blocking the importation of cotton cloth. As there was no punishment for continuing to sell cotton cloth, smuggling of the popular material became commonplace. In 1721, dissatisfied with the results of the first act, Parliament passed a stricter addition, this time prohibiting the sale of most cottons, imported and domestic (exempting only thread Fustian and raw cotton). The exemption of raw cotton from the prohibition initially saw 2 thousand bales of cotton imported annually, to become the basis of a new indigenous industry, initially producing Fustian for the domestic market, though more importantly triggering the development of a series of mechanised spinning and weaving technologies, to process the material. This mechanised production was concentrated in new cotton mills, which slowly expanded till by the beginning of the 1770s seven thousand bales of cotton were imported annually, and pressure was put on Parliament, by the new mill owners, to remove the prohibition on the production and sale of pure cotton cloth, as they could easily compete with anything the EIC could import.\\r\\nThe acts were repealed in 1774, triggering a wave of investment in mill based cotton spinning and production, doubling the demand for raw cotton within a couple of years, and doubling it again every decade, into the 1840s[33]\\r\\nIndian cotton textiles, particularly those from Bengal, continued to maintain a competitive advantage up until the 19th century. In order to compete with India, Britain invested in labour-saving technical progress, while implementing protectionist policies such as bans and tariffs to restrict Indian imports.[34] At the same time, the East India Company's rule in India contributed to its deindustrialization, opening up a new market for British goods,[34] while the capital amassed from Bengal after its 1757 conquest was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacturing and greatly increase British wealth.[35][36][37] British colonization also forced open the large Indian market to British goods, which could be sold in India without tariffs or duties, compared to local Indian producers who were heavily taxed, while raw cotton was imported from India without tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton, giving Britain a monopoly over India's large market and cotton resources.[38][34][39] India served as both a significant supplier of raw goods to British manufacturers and a large captive market for British manufactured goods.[40] Britain eventually surpassed India as the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th century.[34]\\r\\nIndia's cotton-processing sector changed during EIC expansion in India in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. From focusing on supplying the British market to supplying East Asia with raw cotton. As the Artisan produced textiles were no longer competitive with those produced Industrially, and Europe preferring the cheaper slave produced, long staple American, and Egyptian cottons, for its own materials.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe advent of the Industrial Revolution in Britain provided a great boost to cotton manufacture, as textiles emerged as Britain's leading export. In 1738, Lewis Paul and John Wyatt, of Birmingham, England, patented the roller spinning machine, as well as the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing cotton to a more even thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled at different speeds. Later, the invention of the James Hargreaves' spinning jenny in 1764, Richard Arkwright's spinning frame in 1769 and Samuel Crompton's spinning mule in 1775 enabled British spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates. From the late 18th century on, the British city of Manchester acquired the nickname \\"Cottonopolis\\" due to the cotton industry's omnipresence within the city, and Manchester's role as the heart of the global cotton trade.\\r\\nProduction capacity in Britain and the United States was improved by the invention of the modern cotton gin by the American Eli Whitney in 1793. Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s, a number of crude ginning machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor,[41] making large-scale production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796.[41] Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).\\r\\nBy the 1840s, India was no longer capable of supplying the vast quantities of cotton fibers needed by mechanized British factories, while shipping bulky, low-price cotton from India to Britain was time-consuming and expensive. This, coupled with the emergence of American cotton as a superior type (due to the longer, stronger fibers of the two domesticated Native American species, Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense), encouraged British traders to purchase cotton from plantations in the United States and plantations in the Caribbean. By the mid-19th century, \\"King Cotton\\" had become the backbone of the southern American economy. In the United States, cultivating and harvesting cotton became the leading occupation of slaves.\\r\\nDuring the American Civil War, American cotton exports slumped due to a Union blockade on Southern ports, and also because of a strategic decision by the Confederate government to cut exports, hoping to force Britain to recognize the Confederacy or enter the war. This prompted the main purchasers of cotton, Britain and France, to turn to Egyptian cotton. British and French traders invested heavily in cotton plantations. The Egyptian government of Viceroy Isma'il took out substantial loans from European bankers and stock exchanges. After the American Civil War ended in 1865, British and French traders abandoned Egyptian cotton and returned to cheap American exports,[citation needed] sending Egypt into a deficit spiral that led to the country declaring bankruptcy in 1876, a key factor behind Egypt's occupation by the British Empire in 1882.\\r\\nDuring this time, cotton cultivation in the British Empire, especially Australia and India, greatly increased to replace the lost production of the American South. Through tariffs and other restrictions, the British government discouraged the production of cotton cloth in India; rather, the raw fiber was sent to England for processing. The Indian Mahatma Gandhi described the process:\\r\\nIn the United States, Southern cotton provided capital for the continuing development of the North. The cotton was largely produced through the labor of enslaved African Americans. It enriched both the Southern landowners and the Northern merchants. Much of the Southern cotton was trans-shipped through northern ports. In this era the slogan \\"Cotton is king\\" characterized the attitude of the South toward this monocrop.\\r\\nCotton remained a key crop in the Southern economy after emancipation and the end of the Civil War in 1865. Across the South, sharecropping evolved, in which landless black and white farmers worked land owned by others in return for a share of the profits. Some farmers rented the land and bore the production costs themselves. Until mechanical cotton pickers were developed, cotton farmers needed additional labor to hand-pick cotton. Picking cotton was a source of income for families across the South. Rural and small town school systems had split vacations so children could work in the fields during \\"cotton-picking.\\"\\r\\nIt was not until the 1950s that reliable harvesting machinery was introduced (prior to this, cotton-harvesting machinery had been too clumsy to pick cotton without shredding the fibers).[citation needed] During the first half of the 20th century, employment in the cotton industry fell, as machines began to replace laborers and the South's rural labor force dwindled during the World Wars.\\r\\nCotton remains a major export of the southern United States, and a majority of the world's annual cotton crop is of the long-staple American variety.[43]\\r\\nSuccessful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free period, plenty of sunshine, and a moderate rainfall, usually from 60 to 120?cm (24 to 47?in)[citation needed]. Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests.[44] Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains is the largest contiguous cotton-growing region in the world. While dryland (non-irrigated) cotton is successfully grown in this region, consistent yields are only produced with heavy reliance on irrigation water drawn from the Ogallala Aquifer. Since cotton is somewhat salt and drought tolerant, this makes it an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions. As water resources get tighter around the world, economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict, as well as potential environmental problems.[45][46][47][48][49] For example, improper cropping and irrigation practices have led to desertification in areas of Uzbekistan, where cotton is a major export. In the days of the Soviet Union, the Aral Sea was tapped for agricultural irrigation, largely of cotton, and now salination is widespread.[48][49]\\r\\nCotton can also be cultivated to have colors other than the yellowish off-white typical of modern commercial cotton fibers. Naturally colored cotton can come in red, green, and several shades of brown.[50]\\r\\nGenetically modified (GM) cotton was developed to reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) naturally produces a chemical harmful only to a small fraction of insects, most notably the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, and flies, and harmless to other forms of life.[51][52][53] The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton, causing cotton, called Bt cotton, to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.\\r\\nBut Bt cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests, however, such as plant bugs, stink bugs, and aphids; depending on circumstances it may still be desirable to use insecticides against these. A 2006 study done by Cornell researchers, the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on Bt cotton farming in China found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased, necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-Bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM seeds.[54] However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University and Rutgers University refuted this.[55] They concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm. The secondary pests were mostly miridae (plant bugs) whose increase was related to local temperature and rainfall and only continued to increase in half the villages studied. Moreover, the increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption. A 2012 Chinese study concluded that Bt cotton halved the use of pesticides and doubled the level of ladybirds, lacewings and spiders.[56][57] The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) said that, worldwide, GM cotton was planted on an area of 25 million hectares in 2011.[58] This was 69% of the worldwide total area planted in cotton.\\r\\nGM cotton acreage in India grew at a rapid rate, increasing from 50,000 hectares in 2002 to 10.6 million hectares in 2011. The total cotton area in India was 12.1 million hectares in 2011, so GM cotton was grown on 88% of the cotton area. This made India the country with the largest area of GM cotton in the world.[58] A long-term study on the economic impacts of Bt cotton in India, published in the Journal PNAS in 2012, showed that Bt cotton has increased yields, profits, and living standards of smallholder farmers.[59] The U.S. GM cotton crop was 4.0 million hectares in 2011 the second largest area in the world, the Chinese GM cotton crop was third largest by area with 3.9 million hectares and Pakistan had the fourth largest GM cotton crop area of 2.6 million hectares in 2011.[58] The initial introduction of GM cotton proved to be a success in Australia?ÿ the yields were equivalent to the non-transgenic varieties and the crop used much less pesticide to produce (85% reduction).[60] The subsequent introduction of a second variety of GM cotton led to increases in GM cotton production until 95% of the Australian cotton crop was GM in 2009[61] making Australia the country with the fifth largest GM cotton crop in the world.[58] Other GM cotton growing countries in 2011 were Argentina, Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, South Africa and Costa Rica.[58]\\r\\nCotton has been genetically modified for resistance to glyphosate a broad-spectrum herbicide discovered by Monsanto which also sells some of the Bt cotton seeds to farmers. There are also a number of other cotton seed companies selling GM cotton around the world. About 62% of the GM cotton grown from 1996 to 2011 was insect resistant, 24% stacked product and 14% herbicide resistant.[58]\\r\\nCotton has gossypol, a toxin that makes it inedible. However, scientists have silenced the gene that produces the toxin, making it a potential food crop.[62]\\r\\nOrganic cotton is generally understood as cotton from plants not genetically modified and that is certified to be grown without the use of any synthetic agricultural chemicals, such as fertilizers or pesticides.[63] Its production also promotes and enhances biodiversity and biological cycles.[64] In the United States, organic cotton plantations are required to enforce the National Organic Program (NOP). This institution determines the allowed practices for pest control, growing, fertilizing, and handling of organic crops.[65] As of 2007, 265,517 bales of organic cotton were produced in 24 countries, and worldwide production was growing at a rate of more than 50% per year.[66]\\r\\nThe cotton industry relies heavily on chemicals, such as herbicides, fertilizers and insecticides, although a very small number of farmers are moving toward an organic model of production, and organic cotton products are now available for purchase at limited locations. These are popular for baby clothes and diapers. Under most definitions, organic products do not use genetic engineering. All natural cotton products are known to be both sustainable and hypoallergenic.\\r\\nHistorically, in North America, one of the most economically destructive pests in cotton production has been the boll weevil. Due to the US Department of Agriculture's highly successful Boll Weevil Eradication Program (BWEP), this pest has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States. This program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered Bt cotton (which contains a bacterial gene that codes for a plant-produced protein that is toxic to a number of pests such as cotton bollworm and pink bollworm), has allowed a reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides.\\r\\nOther significant global pests of cotton include the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella; the chili thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis; the cotton seed bug, Oxycarenus hyalinipennis; the tarnish plant bug, Lygus lineolaris; and the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, Xanthomonas citri subsp. malvacearum.\\r\\nMost cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is harvested mechanically, either by a cotton picker, a machine that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical defoliant or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without defoliation or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.\\r\\nCotton continues to be picked by hand in developing countries.[67]\\r\\nThe era of manufactured fibers began with the development of rayon in France in the 1890s. Rayon is derived from a natural cellulose and cannot be considered synthetic, but requires extensive processing in a manufacturing process, and led the less expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials. A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades. Acetate in fiber form was developed in 1924. Nylon, the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a sewing thread by DuPont in 1936, followed by DuPont's acrylic in 1944. Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women's hosiery from nylon, but it was not until the introduction of polyester into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat.[68] The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused economic hardship in cotton-exporting economies, especially in Central American countries, such as Nicaragua, where cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the advent of cheap chemical pesticides. Cotton production recovered in the 1970s, but crashed to pre-1960 levels in the early 1990s.[69]\\r\\nCotton is used to make a number of textile products. These include terrycloth for highly absorbent bath towels and robes; denim for blue jeans; cambric, popularly used in the manufacture of blue work shirts (from which we get the term \\"blue-collar\\"); and corduroy, seersucker, and cotton twill. Socks, underwear, and most T-shirts are made from cotton. Bed sheets often are made from cotton. Cotton also is used to make yarn used in crochet and knitting. Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including rayon and synthetic fibers such as polyester. It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans. Cotton can be blended also with linen as Linen-cotton blends which give benefit of both plant materials which wrinkle resistant, lightweight, breathable and can keep heat more effectively than only linen. These blends are thinner and lighter, but stronger than only cotton.[70]\\r\\nIn addition to the textile industry, cotton is used in fishing nets, coffee filters, tents, explosives manufacture (see nitrocellulose), cotton paper, and in bookbinding. The first Chinese paper was made of cotton fiber.[citation needed] Fire hoses were once made of cotton.\\r\\nThe cottonseed which remains after the cotton is ginned is used to produce cottonseed oil, which, after refining, can be consumed by humans like any other vegetable oil. The cottonseed meal that is left generally is fed to ruminant livestock; the gossypol remaining in the meal is toxic to monogastric animals. Cottonseed hulls can be added to dairy cattle rations for roughage. During the American slavery period, cotton root bark was used in folk remedies as an abortifacient, that is, to induce a miscarriage. Gossypol was one of the many substances found in all parts of the cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as 'poisonous pigment'. It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm. Also, it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones.[71]\\r\\nCotton linters are fine, silky fibers which adhere to the seeds of the cotton plant after ginning. These curly fibers typically are less than 1?8 inch (3.2?mm) long. The term also may apply to the longer textile fiber staple lint as well as the shorter fuzzy fibers from some upland species. Linters are traditionally used in the manufacture of paper and as a raw material in the manufacture of cellulose. In the UK, linters are referred to as \\"cotton wool\\". This can also be a refined product (absorbent cotton in U.S. usage) which has medical, cosmetic and many other practical uses. The first medical use of cotton wool was by Sampson Gamgee at the Queen's Hospital (later the General Hospital) in Birmingham, England.\\r\\nShiny cotton is a processed version of the fiber that can be made into cloth resembling satin for shirts and suits.[72] However, it is hydrophobic (does not absorb water easily), which makes it unfit for use in bath and dish towels (although examples of these made from shiny cotton are seen).\\r\\nThe name Egyptian cotton is broadly associated with quality products, however only a small percentage of \\"Egyptian cotton\\" products are actually of superior quality. Most products bearing the name are not made with cotton from Egypt.[73]\\r\\nPima cotton is often compared to Egyptian cotton, as both are used in high quality bed sheets and other cotton products. It is considered the next best quality after high quality Egyptian cotton by some authorities. Pima cotton is grown in the American southwest. Not all products bearing the Pima name are made with the finest cotton. The Pima name is now used by cotton-producing nations such as Peru, Australia and Israel.[74]\\r\\nCotton lisle is a finely-spun, tightly twisted type of cotton that is noted for being strong and durable. Lisle is composed of two strands that have each been twisted an extra twist per inch than ordinary yarns and combined to create a single thread. The yarn is spun so that it is compact and solid. This cotton is used mainly for underwear, stockings, and gloves. Colors applied to this yarn are noted for being more brilliant than colors applied to softer yarn. This type of thread was first made in the city of Lisle, France (now Lille), hence its name.[75][76][77]\\r\\nThe largest producers of cotton, currently (2009), are China and India, with annual production of about 34 million bales and 33.4 million bales, respectively; most of this production is consumed by their respective textile industries. The largest exporters of raw cotton are the United States, with sales of $4.9 billion, and Africa, with sales of $2.1 billion. The total international trade is estimated to be $12 billion. Africa's share of the cotton trade has doubled since 1980. Neither area has a significant domestic textile industry, textile manufacturing having moved to developing nations in Eastern and South Asia such as India and China. In Africa, cotton is grown by numerous small holders. Dunavant Enterprises, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the leading cotton broker in Africa, with hundreds of purchasing agents. It operates cotton gins in Uganda, Mozambique, and Zambia. In Zambia, it often offers loans for seed and expenses to the 180,000 small farmers who grow cotton for it, as well as advice on farming methods. Cargill also purchases cotton in Africa for export.\\r\\nThe 25,000 cotton growers in the United States are heavily subsidized at the rate of $2 billion per year although China now provides the highest overall level of cotton sector support.[78] The future of these subsidies is uncertain and has led to anticipatory expansion of cotton brokers' operations in Africa. Dunavant expanded in Africa by buying out local operations. This is only possible in former British colonies and Mozambique; former French colonies continue to maintain tight monopolies, inherited from their former colonialist masters, on cotton purchases at low fixed prices.[79]\\r\\nThe five leading exporters of cotton in 2011 are (1) the United States, (2) India, (3) Brazil, (4) Australia, and (5) Uzbekistan. The largest nonproducing importers are Korea, Taiwan, Russia, and Japan.[81]\\r\\nIn India, the states of Maharashtra (26.63%), Gujarat (17.96%) and Andhra Pradesh (13.75%) and also Madhya Pradesh are the leading cotton producing states,[82] these states have a predominantly tropical wet and dry climate.\\r\\nIn the United States, the state of Texas led in total production as of 2004,[83] while the state of California had the highest yield per acre.[84]\\r\\nCotton is an enormously important commodity throughout the world. However, many farmers in developing countries receive a low price for their produce, or find it difficult to compete with developed countries.\\r\\nThis has led to an international dispute (see United States?ÿ Brazil cotton dispute):\\r\\nOn 27 September 2002, Brazil requested consultations with the US regarding prohibited and actionable subsidies provided to US producers, users and/or exporters of upland cotton, as well as legislation, regulations, statutory instruments and amendments thereto providing such subsidies (including export credits), grants, and any other assistance to the US producers, users and exporters of upland cotton.[85]\\r\\nOn 8 September 2004, the Panel Report recommended that the United States \\"withdraw\\" export credit guarantees and payments to domestic users and exporters, and \\"take appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or withdraw\\" the mandatory price-contingent subsidy measures.[86]\\r\\nWhile Brazil was fighting the US through the WTO's Dispute Settlement Mechanism against a heavily subsidized cotton industry, a group of four least-developed African countries?ÿ Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali?ÿ also known as \\"Cotton-4\\" have been the leading protagonist for the reduction of US cotton subsidies through negotiations. The four introduced a \\"Sectoral Initiative in Favour of Cotton\\", presented by Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaor during the Trade Negotiations Committee on 10 June 2003.[87]\\r\\nIn addition to concerns over subsidies, the cotton industries of some countries are criticized for employing child labor and damaging workers' health by exposure to pesticides used in production. The Environmental Justice Foundation has campaigned against the prevalent use of forced child and adult labor in cotton production in Uzbekistan, the world's third largest cotton exporter.[88] The international production and trade situation has led to \\"fair trade\\" cotton clothing and footwear, joining a rapidly growing market for organic clothing, fair fashion or \\"ethical fashion\\". The fair trade system was initiated in 2005 with producers from Cameroon, Mali and Senegal.[89]\\r\\nCotton is bought and sold by investors and price speculators as a tradable commodity on 2 different stock exchanges in the United States of America.\\r\\nA temperature range of 25 to 35?C (77 to 95?F) is the optimal range for mold development. At temperatures below 0?C (32?F), rotting of wet cotton stops. Damaged cotton is sometimes stored at these temperatures to prevent further deterioration.[93]\\r\\nEgypt has a unique climatic temperature that the soil and the temperature provide an exceptional environment for cotton to grow rapidly.\\r\\nThe chemical composition of cotton is as follows:\\r\\nThere is a public effort to sequence the genome of cotton. It was started in 2007 by a consortium of public researchers.[94] Their aim is to sequence the genome of cultivated, tetraploid cotton. \\"Tetraploid\\" means that its nucleus has two separate genomes, called A and D. The consortium agreed to first sequence the D-genome wild relative of cultivated cotton (G. raimondii, a Central American species) because it is small and has few repetitive elements. It has nearly one-third of the bases of tetraploid cotton, and each chromosome occurs only once.[clarification needed] Then, the A genome of G. arboreum would be sequenced. Its genome is roughly twice that of G. raimondii. Part of the difference in size is due the amplification of retrotransposons (GORGE). After both diploid genomes are assembled, they would be used as models for sequencing the genomes of tetraploid cultivated species. Without knowing the diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of AD genomes would co-assemble, and their repetitive elements would assemble independently into A and D sequences respectively. There would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.\\r\\nThe public sector effort continues with the goal to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids, as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, the companies Monsanto and Illumina completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of G. raimondii about 50x.[95] They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled from all of this raw material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton, but much work remains.","input":"Who produces the most cotton in the world?"},{"output":"Henry Morton Stanley","context":"The geography of North Africa has been reasonably well known among Europeans since classical antiquity in Greco-Roman geography. Northwest Africa (the Maghreb) was known as either Libya or Africa, while Egypt was considered part of Asia.\\r\\nEuropean exploration of Sub-Saharan Africa begins with the Age of Discovery in the 15th century, pioneered by Portugal under Henry the Navigator. The Cape of Good Hope was first reached by Bartolomeu Dias on 12 March 1488, opening the important sea route to India and the Far East, but European exploration of Africa itself remained very limited during the 16th and 17th centuries. The European powers were content to establish trading posts along the coast while they were actively exploring and colonizing the New World. Exploration of the interior of Africa was thus mostly left to the Arab slave traders, who in tandem with the Muslim conquest of the Sudan established far-reaching networks and supported the economy of a number of Sahelian kingdoms during the 15th to 18th centuries.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, European knowledge of geography of the interior of Sub-Saharan Africa was still rather limited. Expeditions exploring Southern Africa were made during the 1830s and 1840s, so that around the midpoint of the 19th century and the beginning of the colonial Scramble for Africa, the unexplored parts were now limited to what would turn out to be the Congo Basin and the African Great Lakes. This \\"Heart of Africa\\" remained one of the last remaining \\"blank spots\\" on world maps of the later 19th century (alongside the Arctic, Antarctic and the interior of the Amazon basin). It was left for 19th-century European explorers (including those searching for the famed sources of the Nile, notably John Hanning Speke, David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley, to complete the exploration of Africa by the 1870s. After this, the general geography of Africa was known, but it was left to further expeditions during the 1880s onward, notably those led by Oskar Lenz, to flesh more detail such as the continent's geological makeup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenicians explored North Africa, establishing a number of colonies, the most prominent of which was Carthage. Carthage itself conducted exploration of West Africa. The first circumnavigation of the African continent was probably made by Phoenician sailors, in an expedition commissioned by Egyptian pharaoh Necho II, in c. 600 BC and took three years. A report of this expedition is provided by Herodotus (4.37). They sailed south, rounded the Cape heading west, made their way north to the Mediterranean and then returned home. He states that they paused each year to sow and harvest grain. Herodotus himself is sceptical of the historicity of this feat, which would have taken place close about 120 years before his birth; however, the reason he gives for disbelieving the story is the sailors' reported claim that when they sailed along the southern coast of Africa, they found the Sun stood to their right, in the north; Herodotus, who was unaware of the spherical shape of the Earth found this impossible to believe. Some commentators took this circumstance as proof that the voyage is historical, but other scholars still dismiss the report as unlikely. [1]\\r\\nThe West African coast was explored by Hanno the Navigator in an expedition in c. 500 BC.[2] The report of this voyage survives in a short Periplus in Greek, which was first cited by Greek authors in the 3rd century BC.[3]:162ÿ3 There is some uncertainty as to how far precisely Hanno reached, he clearly sailed as far as Sierra Leone, and may have continued as far as Guinea or even Gabon.[4]\\r\\nAfrica is named for the Afri people who settled in the area of current-day Tunisia. The Africa Province of the Roman Empire spanned the Mediterranean coast of what is now Libya, Tunisia and Algeria. The parts of North Africa north of the Sahara were well known in antiquity. Prior to the 2nd century BC, however, Greek geographers were unaware that the land mass then known as Libya expanded south of the Sahara, assuming that the desert bounded on the outer Ocean. Indeed, Alexander the Great, according to Plutarchus' Lives, considered sailing from the mouths of the Indus back to Macedonia passing south of Africa as a shortcut compared to the land route. Even Eratosthenes around 200 BC still assumed an extent of the landmass no further south than the Horn of Africa.\\r\\nBy the Roman imperial period the Horn of Africa was well-known to Mediterranean geographers. The trading post of Rhapta, described as \\"the last marketplace of Azania,\\" may correspond to the coast of Tanzania. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, dated to the 1st century AD, appears to extend geographical knowledge further south, to Southeast Africa. Ptolemy's world map of the 2nd century is well aware that the African continent extents significantly further south than the Horn of Africa, but has no geographic detail south of the equator (it is unclear whether it is aware of the Gulf of Guinea)[5]\\r\\nIn the medieval period, the exploration of the interior of the Sahara and the Sahel as well as along the Swahili coast as far as Mozambique was the project of Muslim conquests and slave trade. It was at Mozambique that the Arab \\"clockwise\\" and the Portuguese \\"counter-clockwise\\" routes of exploration would meet at the end of the 15th century.\\r\\nFollowing its 8th-century conquest of North Africa, Arab Muslims ventured into Sub-Saharan Africa first along the Nile Valley towards Nubia, and later also across the Sahara towards West Africa. They were interested in the trans-Saharan trade, especially in slaves. This expansion of Arab and Islamic culture was a gradual process, lasting throughout most of the Middle Ages. The Christian kingdoms of Nubia came under pressure from the 7th century, but they resisted for several centuries. The Kingdom of Makuria and Old Dongola collapsed by the beginning of the 14th century. A significant role in the spread of Islam in Africa was taken by Sufi orders during the 9th to 14th centuries, who spread south along trade routes between North Africa and the sub-Saharan kingdoms of Ghana and Mali. On the West African coast, they set up zawiyas on the shores of the River Niger. The Mali Empire became Islamic following the pilgrimage of Musa I of Mali in 1324. Timbuktu became an important center of Islamic culture south of the Sahara. Alodia, the last remnant of Christian Nubia, was destroyed by the Funj in 1504.\\r\\n\\r\\nPortuguese explorer Prince Henry, known as the Navigator, was the first European to methodically explore Africa and the oceanic route to the Indies. From his residence in the Algarve region of southern Portugal, he directed successive expeditions to circumnavigate Africa and reach India. In 1420, Henry sent an expedition to secure the uninhabited but strategic island of Madeira. In 1425, he tried to secure the Canary Islands as well, but these were already under firm Castilian control. In 1431, another Portuguese expedition reached and annexed the Azores.\\r\\nNaval charts of 1339 show that the Canary Islands were already known to Europeans. In 1341, Portuguese and Italian explorers prepared a joint expedition. In 1342 the Catalans organized an expedition captained by Francesc Desvalers to the Canary Islands that set sail from Majorca. In 1344, Pope Clement VI named French admiral Luis de la Cerda Prince of Fortune, and sent him to conquer the Canaries. In 1402, Jean de Bethencourt and Gadifer de la Salle sailed to conquer the Canary Islands but found them already plundered by the Castilians. Although they did conquer the isles, Bethencourt's nephew was forced to cede them to Castile in 1418.\\r\\nIn 1455 and 1456 two Italian explorers, Alvise Cadamosto from Venice and Antoniotto Usodimare from Genoa, together with an unnamed Portuguese captain and working for Prince Henry, the Navigator, of Portugal, followed the Gambia river, visiting the land of Senegal, while another Italian sailor from Genoa, Antonio de Noli, also on behalf of Prince Henry, explored the Bijag܇s islands, and, together with the Portuguese Diogo Gomes, the Cape Verde archipelago. Antonio de Noli, who became the first governor of Cape Verde (and the first European colonial governor in Sub-Saharan Africa), is also considered the discoverer of the First Islands of Cape Verde.[6]\\r\\nAlong the western and eastern coasts of Africa, progress was also steady; Portuguese sailors reached Cape Bojador in 1434 and Cape Blanco in 1441. In 1443, they built a fortress on the island of Arguin, in modern-day Mauritania, trading European wheat and cloth for African gold and slaves. It was the first time that the semi-mythic gold of the Sudan reached Europe without Muslim mediation. Most of the slaves were sent to Madeira, which became, after thorough deforestation, the first European plantation colony. Between 1444 and 1447, the Portuguese explored the coasts of Senegal, Gambia, and Guinea. In 1456, the Venetian captain Alvise Cadamosto, under Portuguese command, explored the islands of Cape Verde. In 1462, two years after Prince Henry's death, Portuguese sailors explored the Bissau islands and named Serra Leoa (Lioness Mountains).\\r\\nIn 1469, Fern?o Gomes rented the rights of African exploration for five years. Under his direction, in 1471, the Portuguese reached modern Ghana and settled in A Mina (the mine), later renamed Elmina. They had finally reached a country with an abundance of gold, hence the historical name of \\"Gold Coast\\" that Elmina would eventually receive.\\r\\nIn 1472, Fern?o do P܇ discovered the island that would bear his name for centuries (now Bioko) and an estuary abundant in shrimp (Portuguese: camar?o,), giving its name to Cameroon.\\r\\nSoon after, the equator was crossed by Europeans . Portugal established a base in So Tom that, after 1485, was settled with criminals. After 1497, expelled Spanish and Portuguese Jews also found a safe haven there.\\r\\nIn 1482, Diogo C?o found the mouth of a large river and learned of the existence of a great kingdom, Kongo. In 1485, he explored the river upstream as well.\\r\\nBut the Portuguese wanted, above anything else, to find a route to India and kept trying to circumnavigate Africa. In 1485, the expedition of Jo?o Afonso d'Aveiros, with the German astronomer Martin of Behaim as part of the crew, explored the Bight of Benin (Kingdom of Benin), returning information about African king Ogane.\\r\\nIn 1488, Bartolomeu Dias and his pilot Pro de Alenquer, after putting down a mutiny, turned a cape where they were caught by a storm, naming it Cape of Storms. They followed the coast for a while realizing that it kept going eastward with even some tendency to the north. Lacking supplies, they turned around with the conviction that the far end of Africa had finally been reached. Upon their return to Portugal the promising cape was renamed Cape of Good Hope.\\r\\nSome years later, Christopher Columbus landed in America under rival Castilian command. Pope Alexander VI decreed the Inter caetera bull, dividing the non-Christian parts of the world between the two rival Catholic powers, Spain and Portugal.\\r\\nFinally, in the years 1497 to 1498, Vasco da Gama, again with Alenquer as pilot, took a direct route to Cape of Good Hope, via St. Helena. He went beyond the farthest point reached by Dias and named the country Natal. Then he sailed northward, making land at Quelimane (Mozambique) and Mombasa, where he found Chinese traders, and Malindi (both in modern Kenya). In this town, he recruited an Arab pilot and set sail directly to Calicut. On August 28, 1498, King Manuel of Portugal informed the Pope of the good news that Portugal had reached India.\\r\\nEgypt and Venice reacted to this news with hostility; from the Red Sea, they jointly attacked the Portuguese ships that traded with India. The Portuguese defeated these ships near Diu in 1509. The Ottoman Empire's indifferent reaction to Portuguese exploration left Portugal in almost exclusive control of trade through the Indian Ocean. They established many bases along the eastern coast of Africa except for Somalia (See Ajuran-Portuguese wars), The Portuguese also captured Aden in 1513.\\r\\nOne of the ships under command of Diogo Dias arrived at a coast that was not in East Africa. Two years later, a chart already showed an elongated island east of Africa that bore the name Madagascar. But only a century later, between 1613 and 1619, did the Portuguese explore the island in detail. They signed treaties with local chieftains and sent the first missionaries, who found it impossible to make locals believe in Hell, and were eventually expelled.\\r\\nPortuguese presence in Africa soon interfered with existing Arab trade interests. By 1583, the Portuguese established themselves in Zanzibar and on the Swahili coast. The Kingdom of Congo was converted to Christianity in 1495, its king taking the name of Jo?o I. The Portuguese also established their trade interests in the Kingdom of Mutapa in the 16th century, and in 1629 placed a puppet ruler on the throne.\\r\\nThe Portuguese (and later also the Dutch) also became involved in the local slave economy, supporting the state of the Jaggas, who performed slave raids in the Congo.[citation needed]\\r\\nThey also used the Kongo to weaken the neighbour realm of Ndongo, where Queen Nzinga put a fierce but eventually doomed resistance to Portuguese and Jagga ambitions. Portugal intervened militarily in these conflicts, creating the basis for their colony of Angola. In 1663, after another conflict, the royal crown of Kongo was sent to Lisbon. Nevertheless, a diminished Kongo Kingdom would still exist until 1885, when the last Manicongo, Pedro V, ceded his almost non-existent domain to Portugal.\\r\\nThe Portuguese dealt with the other major state of Southern Africa, the Monomotapa (in modern Zimbabwe), in a similar manner: Portugal intervened in a local war hoping to get abundant mineral riches, imposing a protectorate. But with the authority of the Monomotapa diminished by the foreign presence, anarchy took over. The local miners migrated and even buried the mines to prevent them from falling into Portuguese hands. When in 1693 the neighbouring Cangamires invaded the country, the Portuguese accepted their failure and retreated to the coast.\\r\\nBeginning in the 17th century, the Netherlands began exploring and colonizing Africa. While the Dutch were waging a long war of independence against Spain, Portugal had temporarily united with Spain, starting in 1580 and ending in 1640. As a result, the growing colonial ambitions of the Netherlands were mostly directed against Portugal.\\r\\nFor this purpose, two Dutch companies were founded: the West Indies Company, with power over all the Atlantic Ocean, and the East Indies Company, with power over the Indian Ocean.\\r\\nThe West India Company conquered Elmina in 1637 and Luanda in 1640. In 1648, they were expelled from Luanda by the Portuguese. Overall the Dutch built 16 forts in different places, including Gore in Senegal, partly overtaking Portugal as the main slave-trading power.\\r\\nThe Dutch left a lasting impact in South Africa, a region ignored by Portugal that the Dutch eventually decided to use as station in their route to East Asia. Jan van Riebeeck founded Cape Town in 1652, starting the European exploration and colonization of South Africa.\\r\\nAlmost at the same time as the Dutch, other European powers attempted to create their own outposts for the African slave trade.\\r\\nAs early as 1530, English merchant adventurers started trading in West Africa, coming into conflict with Portuguese troops. In 1581, Francis Drake reached the Cape of Good Hope. In 1663, the English built Fort James in Gambia. One year later, another English colonial expedition attempted to settle southern Madagascar, resulting in the death of most of the colonists. The English forts on the West African coast were eventually taken by the Dutch.\\r\\nIn 1626, the French Compagnie de l'Occident was created. This company expelled the Dutch from Senegal, making it the first French domain in Africa.\\r\\nFrance also set her eyes on Madagascar, the island that had been used since 1527 as a stop in travels to India. In 1642, the French East India Company founded a settlement in southern Madagascar called Fort Dauphin. The commercial results of this settlement were scarce and, again, most of the settlers died. One of the survivors, Etienne de Flacourt, published a History of the Great Island of Madagascar and Relations, which was for a long time the main European source of information about the island. Further settlement attempts had no more success but, in 1667, Fran?ois Martin led the first expedition to the Malgasy heartland, reaching Lake Alaotra. In 1665, France officially claimed Madagascar, under the name of ?le Dauphine. However, little colonial activity would take place in Madagascar until the 19th century.\\r\\nIn 1657, Swedish merchants founded Cape Coast in modern Ghana, but were soon displaced by Denmark-Norway, founding Fort Christiansborg near modern-day Accra.\\r\\nIn 1677, King Frederick William I of Prussia sent an expedition to the western coast of Africa. The commander of the expedition, Captain Blonk, signed agreements with the chieftains of the Gold Coast. There, the Prussians built a fort named Gross Friederichsburg and restored the abandoned Portuguese fort of Arguin. But in 1720, the king decided to sell these bases to the Netherlands for 7,000 ducats and 12 slaves, six of them chained with pure gold chains.\\r\\nThe British expressed their interest by the formation in 1788 of The Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa. The individuals who formed this club were inspired in part by the Scotsman James Bruce, who had ventured to Ethiopia in 1769 and reached the source of the Blue Nile.\\r\\nOverall, European exploration of Africa in the 17th and 18th centuries was very limited. Instead they were focused on the slave trade, which only required coastal bases and items to trade. The real exploration of the African interior would start well into the 19th century.\\r\\nAlthough the Napoleonic Wars distracted the attention of Europe from exploratory work in Africa, those wars nevertheless exercised great influence on the future of the continent, both in Egypt and South Africa. The occupation of Egypt (1798ÿ1803), first by France and then by Great Britain, resulted in an effort by the Ottoman Empire to regain direct control over that country. In 1811, Mehemet Ali established an almost independent state, and from 1820 onward established Egyptian rule over the eastern Sudan. In South Africa, the struggle with Napoleon caused the United Kingdom to take possession of the Dutch settlements at the Cape. In 1814, Cape Colony, which had been continuously occupied by British troops since 1806, was formally ceded to the British crown.\\r\\nMeanwhile, considerable changes had been made in other parts of the continent. The occupation of Algiers by France in 1830 put an end to the piracy of the Barbary states. Egyptian authority continued to expand southward, with the consequent additions to knowledge of the Nile. The city of Zanzibar, on the island of that name, rapidly attained importance. Accounts of a vast inland sea, and the discovery of the snow-clad mountains of Kilimanjaro in 1840ÿ1848, stimulated the desire for further knowledge about Africa in Europe.\\r\\nIn the mid-19th century, Protestant missions were carrying on active missionary work on the Guinea coast, in South Africa and in the Zanzibar dominions. Missionaries visited little-known regions and peoples, and in many instances became explorers and pioneers of trade and empire. David Livingstone, a Scottish missionary, had been engaged since 1840 in work north of the Orange River. In 1849, Livingstone crossed the Kalahari Desert from south to north and reached Lake Ngami. Between 1851 and 1856, he traversed the continent from west to east, discovering the great waterways of the upper Zambezi River. In November 1855, Livingstone became the first European to see the famous Victoria Falls, named after the Queen of the United Kingdom. From 1858 to 1864, the lower Zambezi, the Shire River and Lake Nyasa were explored by Livingstone. Nyasa had been first reached by the confidential slave of Ant܇nio da Silva Porto, a Portuguese trader established at Bi in Angola, who crossed Africa during 1853ÿ1856 from Benguella to the mouth of the Rovuma. A prime goal for explorers was to locate the source of the River Nile. Expeditions by Burton and Speke (1857ÿ1858) and Speke and Grant (1863) located Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria. It was eventually proved to be the latter from which the Nile flowed.\\r\\nHenry Morton Stanley, who had in 1871 succeeded in finding and succouring Livingstone (originating the famous line \\"Dr. Livingstone, I presume\\"), started again for Zanzibar in 1874. In one of the most memorable of all exploring expeditions in Africa, Stanley circumnavigated Victoria Nyanza (Lake Victoria) and Lake Tanganyika. Striking farther inland to the Lualaba, he followed that river down to the Atlantic Oceanwhich he reached in August 1877and proved it to be the Congo.\\r\\nIn 1895, the British South Africa Company hired the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham to look for minerals and ways to improve river navigation in the central and southern Africa region. Burnham oversaw and led the Northern Territories British South Africa Exploration Company expedition that first established that major copper deposits existed north of the Zambezi in North-Eastern Rhodesia. Along the Kafue River, Burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he had worked in the United States, and he encountered native peoples wearing copper bracelets.[7] Copper rapidly became the primary export of Central Africa and it remains essential to the economy even today.\\r\\nExplorers were also active in other parts of the continent. Southern Morocco, the Sahara and the Sudan were traversed in many directions between 1860 and 1875 by Georg Schweinfurth and Gustav Nachtigal.[8] These travellers not only added considerably to geographical knowledge, but obtained invaluable information concerning the people, languages and natural history of the countries in which they sojourned. Among the discoveries of Schweinfurth was one that confirmed Greek legends of the existence beyond Egypt of a \\"pygmy race\\". But the first western discoverer of the pygmies of Central Africa was Paul Du Chaillu, who found them in the Ogowe district of the west coast in 1865, five years before Schweinfurth's first meeting with them. Du Chaillu had previously, through journeys in the Gabon region between 1855 and 1859, made popular in Europe the knowledge of the existence of the gorilla, whose existence was thought to be as legendary as that of the Pygmies of Aristotle.","input":"Who began exploration of africa's atlantic coast?"},{"output":"Leonard","context":"Ray Charles Leonard (born May 17, 1956), best known as \\"Sugar\\" Ray Leonard, is an American former professional boxer, motivational speaker, and occasional actor. Often regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, he competed from 1977 to 1997, winning world titles in five weight divisions; the lineal championship in three weight divisions;[2] as well as the undisputed welterweight title.[3] Leonard was part of \\"The Fabulous Four\\",[4] a group of boxers who all fought each other throughout the 1980s, consisting of himself, Roberto Durn, Thomas Hearns and Marvin Hagler.\\r\\n\\"The Fabulous Four\\" created a wave of popularity in the lower weight classes that kept boxing relevant in the post-Muhammad Ali era, during which Leonard defeated future fellow International Boxing Hall of Fame inductees Hearns, Durn, Hagler, and Wilfred Bentez.[5][6] Leonard was also the first boxer to earn more than $100 million in purses, and was named \\"Boxer of the Decade\\" in the 1980s.[7] The Ring magazine named him Fighter of the Year in 1979 and 1981, while the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) named him Fighter of the Year in 1976, 1979, and 1981.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonard, the fifth of seven children of Cicero and Getha Leonard, was born in Wilmington, North Carolina.[1] He was named after Ray Charles, his mother's favorite singer.[8] The family moved to Washington, D.C., when he was three, and they settled permanently in Palmer Park, Maryland when he was ten. His father worked as a supermarket night manager and his mother was a nurse. He attended Parkdale High School, Leonard was a shy child, and aside from the time he nearly drowned in a creek during a flood in Seat Pleasant, Maryland, his childhood was uneventful. He stayed home a lot, reading comic books and playing with his dog. His mother said: \\"He never did talk too much. We never could tell what he was thinking. But I never had any problems with him. I never had to go to school once because of him.\\"[9]\\r\\nLeonard started boxing at the Palmer Park Recreation Center in 1969. His older brother, Roger, started boxing first. Roger helped start the boxing program, urging the center's director, Ollie Dunlap, to form a team. Dave Jacobs, a former boxer, and Janks Morton volunteered as boxing coaches. Roger won some trophies and showed them off in front of Ray, goading him to start boxing.\\r\\nIn 1972, Leonard boxed in the featherweight quarterfinals of the National AAU Tournament, losing by decision to Jerome Artis. It was his first defeat. Later that year, he boxed in the Eastern Olympic Trials. The rules stated that a boxer had to be seventeen to box in international competition, so Leonard, only sixteen, lied about his age.[10] He made it to the lightweight semifinals, losing a disputed decision to Greg Whaley, who took such a beating that he wasn't allowed to continue in the trials and never boxed again.[11]\\r\\nSarge Johnson, assistant coach of the U.S. Olympic Boxing Team, said to Dave Jacobs, \\"That kid you got is sweet as sugar\\". The nickname stuck. However, given his style and first name, it was probably only a matter of time before people started calling him Sugar Ray, after the man many consider to be the best boxer of all time, Sugar Ray Robinson.[12]\\r\\nIn 1973, Leonard won the National Golden Gloves Lightweight Championship, but lost to Randy Shields in the lightweight final of the National AAU Tournament. The following year, Leonard won the National Golden Gloves and National AAU Lightweight Championships. Leonard suffered his last two losses as an amateur in 1974. He lost a disputed decision to Anatoli Kamnev in Moscow, after which, Kamnev gave the winner's trophy to Leonard. In Poland, Kazimierz Szczerba was given a decision victory over Leonard, even though he was dominated in the first two rounds and dropped three times in the third.[13]\\r\\nLeonard won the National Golden Gloves and National AAU Light Welterweight Championships in 1974. The following year, he again won the National AAU Light Welterweight Championship, as well as the Light Welterweight Championship at the Pan American Games.\\r\\nIn 1976, Leonard made the U.S. Olympic Team as the light welterweight representative. The team also included Leon and Michael Spinks, Howard Davis, Jr., Leo Randolph, Charles Mooney, and John Tate. Many consider the 1976 U.S. team to be the greatest boxing team in the history of the Olympics.[14] Leonard won his first four Olympic bouts by 5ÿ0 decisions. He faced Kazimierz Szczerba in the semifinals and won by a 5ÿ0 decision, avenging his last amateur loss.\\r\\nIn the final, Leonard boxed the great Cuban knockout artist Andrs Aldama, who scored five straight knockouts to reach the final. Leonard landed several good left hooks in the first round. In the second, he dropped Aldama with a left to the chin. Late in the final round, he again hurt Aldama, which brought a standing eight count from the referee.\\r\\nWith only a few seconds left in the fight, a Leonard combination forced another standing eight count. Leonard was awarded a 5ÿ0 decision and the Olympic Gold Medal. Afterward, Leonard announced, \\"I'm finished...I've fought my last fight. My journey has ended, my dream is fulfilled. Now I want to go to school.\\" He was given a scholarship to the University of Maryland, a gift from the citizens of Glenarden, Maryland. He planned to study business administration and communications.[15] He finished his amateur career with a record of 145ÿ5 and 75 KO's.[16]\\r\\nJuanita Wilkinson, Leonard's high school girlfriend, told him she was pregnant in the summer of 1973. They decided to have the baby but marriage would be put off until after the Olympics in 1976. Leonard would continue to pursue his Olympic dream while she and the baby, Ray Charles Leonard, Jr., lived with her parents. When Leonard boxed in the Olympics, he had a picture of Wilkinson taped to his sock.\\r\\nShortly before the Olympics, Wilkinson had filed an application to receive $156 a month in child support payments from Prince George's County. She named Leonard as the father and the county's state attorney's office filed a civil suit against Leonard to establish paternity and get support payments for the child. Leonard learned of the suit several days after returning home from the Olympics. The headline in the Washington Star read, \\"Sugar Ray Leonard Named in Welfare Dept. Paternity Suit\\".[18]\\r\\nWilkinson went to the Olympics to watch Leonard box, but she did not tell him about the suit and never asked him for any money. \\"I didn't feel like being bothered by all those complications by asking him for any money for support\\", she said. Leonard pledged he would support his son, even if he had to scrap plans to attend college.[19]\\r\\nLeonard had hoped to get lucrative endorsements following his gold medal win, but the negative publicity from the paternity suit chased off any big commercial possibilities. To make matters worse, his father was hospitalized with meningitis and his mother suffered a heart attack. With neither parent able to work, with his child and the mother of his child to support, and without any endorsement opportunities, Leonard decided to become a professional boxer.[20]\\r\\nWhen Leonard decided to turn professional, Janks Morton introduced him to Mike Trainer, a friend of his who was an attorney. Trainer talked 24 of his friends and clients into underwriting Leonard's career with an investment of $21,000 to be repaid within four years at 8% interest. Trainer then made Leonard the sole stockholder in Sugar Ray Leonard, Inc. Angelo Dundee, Muhammad Ali's trainer, was brought in to be Leonard's trainer and manager. Many of the people being considered wanted absolute control and a cut somewhere near the manager's traditional 33%. Dundee had a different proposition. Although he would prescribe the training procedures, he would leave the day-to-day work to Dave Jacobs and Janks Morton. He would also choose Leonard's opponents. For his services, Dundee would get 15% of Leonard's purse.[21]\\r\\nLeonard made his professional debut on February 5, 1977 before a crowd of 10,270 at the Civic Center in Baltimore. He was paid $40,044 for the fight. His opponent was Luis \\"The Bull\\" Vega, whom he defeated by a six-round unanimous decision.[22] After the fight, Leonard paid back his $21,000 loan to the investors.[23]\\r\\nIn his fourteenth professional fight, Leonard fought his first world-ranked opponent, Floyd Mayweather, who was ranked seventeenth. The fight took place on September 9, 1978.[citation needed] Leonard won by a tenth-round knockout.[24] A month later, Leonard defeated his old amateur nemesis Randy Shields by a ten-round unanimous decision.[25][26]\\r\\nOn August 12, 1979, Leonard knocked out Pete Ranzany in four rounds to win the NABF Welterweight Championship.[27] The following month, he made his first title defense against Andy Price. Many felt that Price would give Leonard a tough fight, but Leonard took him out in the first round, advancing his record to 25ÿ0 with 16 knockouts.[28]\\r\\nLeonard fought Wilfred Bentez for the WBC Welterweight Championship on November 30, 1979, at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. There was a capacity crowd of about 4,600. Leonard received $1 million and Benitez, a two-division champion with a record of 38ÿ0ÿ1, received $1.2 million.\\r\\nIt was a highly competitive and tactical battle. In the first round, Leonard rocked Benitez with a left hook that came off a jab and right cross. Late in the third, Leonard dropped Benitez on the seat of his pants with a stiff left jab. More embarrassed than hurt, Benitez got up quickly.\\r\\nBenitez started to do better in the fourth, slipping numerous punches and finding the range with his right hand. \\"I wasn't aware I was in a championship early because I hit him so easy\\", Leonard said. \\"But then he adjusted to my style. It was like looking in a mirror\\".\\r\\nIn the sixth, there was an accidental clash of heads, which opened a cut on the forehead of Benitez. Blood flowed down his forehead and the bridge of his nose but stayed out of his eyes.\\r\\nLeonard landed the harder punches and had Benitez hurt several times late in the fight, but Leonard couldn't put him away. Benitez was very slick. \\"No one, I mean no one, can make me miss punches like that\\", Leonard said.\\r\\nGoing into the final round, Leonard led by scores of 137ÿ130, 137ÿ133, and 136ÿ134. The two went toe-to-toe in the fifteenth. Late in the round, Leonard dropped Benitez with a left. He got up, but after a few more punches, the referee stopped the fight. The time was 2:54 of round fifteen.[29]\\r\\nThe Boxing Writers Association of America and The Ring named Leonard \\"Fighter of the Year\\" for 1979.\\r\\nLeonard made his first title defense in Landover, Maryland, on March 31, 1980. His opponent was Dave \\"Boy\\" Green. The British challenger had a record of 33ÿ2. In the fourth round, Leonard knocked Green out with a devastating left hook. Leonard called it \\"the hardest single punch I ever threw.\\"[30]\\r\\nOn June 20, 1980, Leonard returned to the Olympic Stadium in Montreal to defend his title against Roberto Durn before a crowd of 46,317. Durn, the former Undisputed World Lightweight Champion for 6 1/2 years, had a record of 71ÿ1 and was the #1 welterweight contender and considered the best \\"Pound for Pound\\" fighter in the world. Durn received $1.5 million and Leonard, working for a percentage of the closed-circuit gate as well as a guarantee, received over $9 million.\\r\\nAngelo Dundee counseled Leonard to box, to move side to side and not to get caught on the ropes. However, Leonard decided to fight Durn's way. \\"Flat-footed\\", he said. \\"I will not run.\\"[31]\\r\\nDurn forced the issue and took the fight to Leonard, cutting off the ring and denying Leonard space to fight his fight. Durn attacked at almost every turn. Leonard battled back again and again, but he had to work just to find room to breathe and swing, at times simply to survive. In the second, Durn rocked Leonard with a left hook, sending him into the ropes. Leonard started to do better by the fifth round, finding some punching room and throwing numerous multi-punch combinations. The two fought with great intensity throughout the fight. According to Bill Nack:\\r\\nIt was, from almost the opening salvo, a fight that belonged to Durn. The Panamanian seized the evening and gave it what shape and momentum it had. He took control, attacking and driving Leonard against the ropes, bulling him back, hitting him with lefts and rights to the body as he maneuvered the champion against the ropes from corner to corner. Always moving forward, he mauled and wrestled Leonard, scoring inside with hooks and rights. For three rounds Durn drove at Sugar Ray with a fury, and there were moments when it seemed the fight could not last five. Unable to get away, unable to counter and unable to slide away to open up the ring, Leonard seemed almost helpless under the assault. Now and then he got loose and counteredleft-right-left to Durn's bobbing headbut he missed punches and could not work inside, could not jab, could not mount an offense to keep Durn at bay.[31]\\r\\nDurn was awarded a unanimous decision, although it was mistakenly read as a majority decision in the ring. The scorecard of judge Angelo Poletti was incorrectly added and announced as 147ÿ147. He actually scored it 148ÿ147. In rounds, he had it three for Durn, two for Leonard, and ten even. Sports Illustrated called his scorecard \\"a monument to indecision.\\" Judges Raymond Baldeyrou and Harry Gibbs scored the fight 146ÿ144 and 145ÿ144, respectively. Associated Press had it 144ÿ141 for Durn, while The New York Times had Leonard ahead 144ÿ142.\\r\\n\\"I did the best I could\\", Leonard said. \\"I think I pretty much fought from the heart.\\" Asked if Leonard was the best he ever fought, Durn thought for a moment and then answered, \\"Si, si.\\" Durn said. \\"He does have a heart. That's why he's living.\\"[32][33]\\r\\nThe rematch, billed as \\"Stone vs. Sugar.. Once Again\\", took place November 25, 1980 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans in front of 25,038 fans. Leonard received $7 million and Durn received $8 million.\\r\\nDave Jacobs disagreed with the decision to have an immediate rematch with Durn and terminated his relationship with Leonard when the rematch was made. \\"My idea is that he should have a tuneup fight before he fights with Roberto again\\", Jacobs said. \\"I think he won the fight with Durn, but I don't think it is healthy for him to be fighting Durn right away\\".[34]\\r\\nAfter the Montreal fight Durn went on a partying binge and ballooned in weight. Leonard was aware of this, and in an interview for Beyond the Glory he said: \\"My intention was to fight Durn ASAP because I knew Durn's habits. I knew he would indulge himself, he'd gain 40ÿ50 lbs and then sweat it off to make 147.\\" Unlike the fight in Montreal, Leonard used his superior speed and movement to outbox and befuddle Durn. \\"The whole fight, I was moving, I was moving\\", Leonard said. \\"And Voom! I snapped his head back with a jab. Voom! I snapped it back again. He tried to get me against the ropes, I'd pivot, spin off and Pow! Come under with a punch.\\"\\r\\nIn round seven, Leonard started to taunt Durn. Leonard's most memorable punch came late in the round. Winding up his right hand, as if to throw a bolo punch, Leonard snapped out a left jab and caught Durn flush in the face. \\"It made his eyes water\\", Leonard said. He continued to taunt Durn mercilessly. He stuck out his chin, inviting Durn to hit it. Durn hesitated. Leonard kept it up, continuing to move, stop, and mug.\\r\\nIn the closing seconds of the eighth round, Durn turned his back to Leonard and quit, saying to referee Octavio Meyran, \\"No Mas.\\" Leonard was the winner by a technical knockout at 2:44 of round eight, regaining the WBC Welterweight Championship. Leonard led by scores of 68ÿ66, 68ÿ66 and 67ÿ66.[35]\\r\\nDurn said he quit because of stomach cramps, caused by overeating after the weigh-in. \\"At the end of the fifth round, I got cramps in my stomach and it kept getting worse and worse\\", Duran later said. \\"I felt weaker and weaker in my body and arms.\\" He then announced, \\"I am retiring from boxing right now.\\" During the night Durn was admitted to a hospital with stomach pains, and discharged the following day.\\r\\nEveryone was surprised by Durn's actions, none more so than his veteran trainers, Freddie Brown and Ray Arcel. \\"I was shocked\\", Brown said. \\"There was no indication that he was in pain or getting weak.\\"[36] Arcel was angry. \\"That's it\\", he said. \\"I've had it. This is terrible. I've handled thousands of fighters and never had anyone quit on me. I think he needs a psychiatrist more than he needs anything else.\\" Durn's manager, Carlos Eleta, said, \\"Durn didn't quit because of stomach cramps. He quit because he was embarrassed. I know this.\\"[37] According to Randy Gordon, who witnessed Durn's antics beforehand and was in his dressing room immediately afterwards, Durn quit because of his huge eating binge prior to the fight.[38]\\r\\n\\"I made him quit\\", Leonard said. \\"To make a man quit, to make Roberto Durn quit, was better than knocking him out.\\"[39]\\r\\nOn March 28, 1981, Leonard defended his title against Larry Bonds, the WBC sixth-ranked contender, at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. Bonds was a southpaw, which made him a good opponent for Leonard, given that his next opponent was scheduled to be the WBA Light Middleweight Champion Ayub Kalule, a southpaw.\\r\\nLeonard was the aggressor throughout, with Bonds circling the ring. He staggered Bonds with a right in the fourth round and dropped him with a follow-up combination. Bonds got up and continued to move, with Leonard in pursuit. Leonard dropped him again in the tenth. Bonds rose but Leonard didn't let him off the hook. The referee stopped the fight with Bonds taking punishment in a corner.[40]\\r\\nLeonard moved up to the junior middleweight division and faced Kalule on June 25, 1981 at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas. Kalule, who was 36ÿ0, had been the WBA Light Middleweight Champion for two years.\\r\\nKalule and his handlers had expected Leonard to use lateral movement against him, but Leonard took the fight to Kalule. After eight tough rounds, Leonard was ahead although Kalule appeared to be coming on strong in the eight and ninth. Leonard finally hurt him with a right to the head. Shortly afterward, Leonard dropped him with a flurry of punches. Kalule got up but the referee waved it off. Leonard celebrated his victory with a full 360-degree, no-hands flip.[41] Despite an official stoppage time of 2.59, the fight was actually stopped at 3.06 into the round, meaning Kalule should have been saved by the bell.[42]\\r\\nPromoted as \\"The Showdown\\", Leonard fought Thomas Hearns on September 16, 1981 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas to unify the World Welterweight Championship in a scheduled fifteen-rounder. They fought before a live crowd of 23,618. Hearns was paid $5.1 million, and Leonard made over $11 million. The fight grossed over $35 million. The live gate was $5.9 million, and the revenue from pay-per-view was $7.5 million.\\r\\nHearns, 32ÿ0 with 30 knockouts, won the WBA Welterweight Championship in 1980, scoring a second-round knockout of Jos \\"Pipino\\" Cuevas in Detroit, Michigan. He made three successful title defenses, stopping Luis Primera, Randy Shields, and Pablo Baez.\\r\\nThe fight began as expected, Leonard boxing from a distance and Hearns stalking. Leonard had difficulty with Hearns' long reach and sharp jab. By the end of round five, Leonard had a growing swelling under his left eye, and Hearns had built a considerable lead on the scorecards. Leonard, becoming more aggressive, hurt Hearns in the sixth with a left hook to the chin. Leonard battered Hearns in rounds six and seven, but Hearns regrouped. Hearns started to stick and move, and he started to pile up points again. The roles reversed: Leonard became the stalker and Hearns became the boxer. The fight billed as a classic showdown between a powerful knockout artist and the best boxer/puncher the welterweight division had seen in decades devolved into a tactical and boring fight.\\r\\nHearns won rounds nine through twelve on all three scorecards. Between rounds twelve and thirteen, Angelo Dundee told Leonard, \\"You're blowing it, son! You're blowing it!\\".\\r\\nLeonard, with a badly swollen left eye, came out roaring for the thirteenth round. After hurting Hearns with a right, Leonard exploded with a combination of punches. Hearns' legs were clearly gone and after more pressure from Leonard he was bundled through the ropes, no knockdown was given as it wasn't a punch that sent him there. Hearns managed to rise, but was dropped by a flurry of hard punches near the end of the round.\\r\\nIn round fourteen, after staggering Hearns with an overhand right, Leonard pinned Hearns against the ropes, where he unleashed another furious combination, prompting referee Davey Pearl to stop the contest and award Sugar Ray Leonard the Unified World Welterweight Championship. Hearns was leading by scores of 124ÿ122, 125ÿ122, and 125ÿ121.\\r\\nAfter the fight, there was controversy due to the scoring of rounds six and seven. Even though Leonard dominated, hurting Hearns and battering him, all three judges gave both rounds to Leonard by a 10ÿ9 margin. Many felt that the ten-point must scoring system was not properly used and those rounds should have been scored 10ÿ8.[43] Some also considered the stoppage premature. Veteran ringside commentator Don Dunphy said \\"They're stopping the fight. I don't believe it. Hearns was ahead on points.\\" However, Emanuel Steward, Hearns' manager and trainer, said, \\"I felt that the referee was justified in stopping the fight ... Tommy did not have enough energy to make it through the fight.\\"[44]\\r\\nThe fight was named \\"Fight of the Year\\" by The Ring.\\r\\nLeonard was named \\"Fighter of the Year\\" by The Ring and The Boxing Writers Association of America. He was also named \\"Athlete of the Year\\" by ABC's Wide World of Sports and \\"Sportsman of the Year\\" by Sports Illustrated.[45]\\r\\nOn February 15, 1982, Leonard defended the unified title against Bruce Finch, the WBC fourth-ranked contender. Leonard knocked him out in the third round.[46] Leonard's next fight was scheduled to be against Roger Stafford on May 14, 1982, in Buffalo, New York. While training, Leonard started to see floaters. He went to a doctor and discovered that he had a detached retina. The fight was cancelled, and Leonard had surgery to repair the retina on May 9, 1982.[47]\\r\\nOn November 9, 1982, Leonard invited Marvin Hagler and other boxing dignitaries to a charity event in Baltimore, Maryland to hear him announce whether he would continue his career. Standing in a boxing ring with Howard Cosell, the master of ceremonies, Leonard announced his retirement, saying a bout with Hagler would unfortunately never happen. Leonard maintained his eye was fully healed, but that he just didn't want to box anymore.[48]\\r\\nMissing the limelight and the competition, Leonard announced in December 1983 that he was returning to the ring. Leonard boasted that he would have a couple of ten-round bouts and then take on Milton McCrory, Donald Curry, Durn, Hearns and finally Hagler. This decision was met with a torrent of criticism from fans and the media, who felt Leonard was taking unnecessary risks with his surgically repaired eye.[49]\\r\\nA bout with Philadelphia's Kevin Howard, who was 20ÿ4ÿ1, was scheduled for February 25, 1984. The fight was postponed when Leonard had minor surgery on his right eye to fix a loose retina. This latest eye problem further fueled the flames of those who opposed Leonard's comeback.[50]\\r\\nBefore the fight with Howard, Dave Jacobs rejoined Leonard's team in a limited role. Jacobs had quit in 1980, disagreeing with Leonard's decision to have an immediate rematch with Durn.[51]\\r\\nLeonard and Howard fought on May 11, 1984, in Worcester, Massachusetts. Howard knocked Leonard flat on his back in the fourth round. It was the first knockdown of Leonard's professional career. Leonard came back to stop Howard in the ninth round, but the stoppage was disputed, with some feeling that the referee stopped the fight prematurely. Leonard was ahead on all three scorecards at the time of the stoppage. At the post-fight press conference, Leonard surprised everyone by announcing his retirement again, saying he just didn't have it anymore.[52]\\r\\nOn March 10, 1986, Marvin Hagler knocked out John Mugabi in eleven rounds to retain the Undisputed World Middleweight Championship for the twelfth time and advance his record to 62ÿ2ÿ2. \\"I was ringside\\", Leonard said. \\"I'm watching John 'The Beast' Mugabi fight Hagler. Of all people, John 'The Beast' Mugabi.\\" It was then that Leonard decided to come back and fight Hagler. He called Mike Trainer and said, \\"I can beat Hagler\\".\\r\\nOn May 1, 1986, Leonard announced on a Washington, D.C. talk show that he would return to the ring to fight Hagler. The announcement generated a lot of controversy because of Leonard's inactivity and eye injuries, yet it also excited many sports fans who had hoped to see them fight years earlier. Hagler took a few months to decide, then agreed to the match.[53]\\r\\nThe fight, promoted as \\"The Super Fight\\" and \\"The King of the Ring\\", was scheduled for April 6, 1987, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Leonard was guaranteed $11 million, and Hagler was guaranteed $12 million. Hagler was a heavy favorite. The odds started at 4ÿ1, then settled at 3ÿ1. A paying crowd 12,379 generated a live gate of $6.2 million. According to Bob Arum, the fight grossed $78 million which would equates to $170m in 2016.\\r\\nThe original fight plan for Leonard was to go toe-to-toe with Hagler and try to cut him, but the plan changed about five days before the fight. Leonard got hit by sparring partner Quincy Taylor and was badly buckled. \\"He almost knocked me out\\", Leonard said. After that, Leonard decided to box Hagler.[54]\\r\\nMany were surprised that Hagler, a natural southpaw, opened the fight boxing out of an orthodox stance. After the quick and slick Leonard won the first two rounds on all three scorecards, Hagler started the third round as a southpaw. Hagler did better, but Leonard's superior speed and boxing skill still allowed him to control the fight. Hagler looked stiff and mechanical and missed the speedy Leonard time and again prompting ringside commentator for the NBC network re-broadcast Gil Clancy to remark \\"...and is he ever missing...Leonard isn't doing anything to make him miss, he's just missing!\\"\\r\\nBy the fifth, Leonard, who was moving a lot, began to tire and Hagler started to get closer. Hagler buckled Leonard's knees with a right uppercut near the end of the round, which finished with Leonard on the ropes. Hagler continued to score somewhat effectively in round six. Leonard, having slowed down, was obliged to fight more and move less. However, he was able to outpunch Hagler along the ropes and got the better of several bristling exchanges. Hagler never seized total control of the fight as he had against Thomas Hearns two years earlier, when he brutalized Hearns and scored a third-round knockout. Hagler's punches lacked snap and, although he was scoring solidly to the body, he looked nothing like the powerful fighter who had dominated the middleweight division for the previous five years. Leonard's observation that the Hagler who beat John Mugabi was older and slower proved to be spot on. In rounds seven and eight, Hagler's southpaw jab was landing solidly and Leonard's counter flurries were less frequent.\\r\\nRound nine was the most exciting round of the fight. Hagler hurt Leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner. Leonard looked to be in trouble, but he furiously fought his way out of the corner. The action see-sawed back and forth for the rest of the round, with each man having his moments. However, Hagler's moments were more spectacular and one of Hagler's cornermen: Roger Perron (in an interview that took place on an episode of HBO's Legendary Nights episode segments in 2003) later stated that: \\"the ninth round was probably Marvin (Hagler)'s, best round\\".\\r\\nRound ten was tame by comparison, as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round but with Hagler having more spectacular moments. Despite Leonard's obvious fatigue, he boxed well in the eleventh. Every time Hagler scored, Leonard came back with something flashier and more eye-catching, if not as effective. But at that point in the fight, Hagler appeared to be slightly more ring-general and clearly more aggressive. Between rounds eleven and twelve, Leonard's trainer: Angelo Dundee, implored Sugar Ray to get up off his stool yelling \\"We got three minutes...new champ...new champ!\\" Leonard yelled \\"Yeah!\\" and played to the screaming crowd. Hagler's corner was much more reserved prompting Clancy to comment: \\"They're talking to him like it's an IBM meeting or something...no emotion.\\" In the final round, Hagler continued to chase Leonard. He hit Leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner. Leonard responded with a furious flurry, landing few punches but whipping the upset-hoping crowd into a frenzy. Hagler backed off, and Leonard danced away with Hagler in pursuit. The fight ended with Hagler and Leonard exchanging along the ropes. At the final bell, even uniformed ringside security rushed into the ring applauding and lauding Leonard's effort.[55]\\r\\nLeonard threw 629 punches and landed 306, while Hagler threw 792 and landed 291.[56]\\r\\nLeonard was awarded a controversial split-decision. Judge Dave Moretti scored it 115ÿ113 for Leonard, while judge Lou Filippo had it 115ÿ113 for Hagler. Judge Jos Guerra scored the fight 118ÿ110 for Leonard. Many felt that Hagler deserved the decision because he was the aggressor and landed the harder punches. Scottish boxing journalist Hugh McIlvanney wrote that Leonard's plan was to \\"steal rounds with a few flashy and carefully timed flurries....he was happy to exaggerate hand speed at the expense of power, and neither he nor two of the scorers seemed bothered by the fact that many of the punches landed on the champion's gloves and arms.\\"[57]\\r\\nMany others felt that Leonard deservedly got the decision, arguing that Leonard landed more punches and showed better defense and ring generalship. Jim Murray, long-time sports columnist for the Los Angeles Times, wrote, \\"It wasn't even close...He didn't just outpoint Hagler, he exposed him. He made him look like a guy chasing a bus. In snowshoes.... Leonard repeatedly beat Hagler to the punch. When he did, he hit harder. He hit more often.... He made Hagler into what he perceived him to be throughout his careera brawler, a swarmer, a man who could club you to death only if you stood there and let him. If you moved, he was lost.\\"[58]\\r\\nThe fight was named \\"Fight of the Year\\" and \\"Upset of the Year\\" by The Ring.\\r\\nDespite requests from the Hagler camp, Leonard was uninterested in a rematch and retired on May 27, 1987. \\"I'll try, I'll give it a shot\\", Leonard said of his latest retirement. \\"But you guys know me.\\"[59] A month after Hagler's formal retirement in June 1988 Leonard would announce another comeback.\\r\\nOn November 7, 1988, Leonard made another comeback, facing Don Lalonde at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. They fought for Lalonde's WBC Light Heavyweight Championship and the newly created WBC Super Middleweight Championship, which meant that Lalonde had to make 168?lbs. Many were critical of Leonard for stipulating that his opponenta natural 175 poundershould weigh less than his usual fighting weight, which could possibly weaken him. However, Lalonde later told HBO's Larry Merchant that he didn't have any trouble making weight.[60]\\r\\nLalonde, 31ÿ2 with 26 knockouts, was guaranteed at least $6 million and Leonard was guaranteed over $10 million.\\r\\nThis would be Leonard's first professional fight without Angelo Dundee. For Leonard's fight with Hagler, Dundee worked without a contract and received $175,000, which was less than 2% of Leonard's purse. Dundee was unhappy with that amount. He requested a contract for the Lalonde fight and Leonard refused. \\"I don't have contracts. My word is my bond\\", Leonard said. Janks Morton and Dave Jacobs trained Leonard for the Lalonde fight.[61][62]\\r\\nLalonde's size and awkwardness troubled Leonard. In the fourth round, a right hand to the top of Leonard's head dropped him for just the second time in his career. Early in the ninth, Lalonde hurt Leonard with a right to the chin. Leonard fired back and hurt Lalonde with a right. He drove him to the ropes and unleashed a furious assault. Lalonde tried to tie up Leonard, but got dropped with a powerful left hook. He rose but was soon down again, and the fight was stopped. Judges Chuck Giampa and Franz Marti had Leonard ahead by scores of 77ÿ74 and 77ÿ75, respectively. Judge Stuart Kirshenbaum had Lalonde ahead 76ÿ75.[63]\\r\\nAfter the fight, Leonard vacated the light heavyweight title, but kept the super middleweight title. Also, Leonard and Janks Morton split because of personal differences. Morton was replaced as co-trainer by Pepe Correa, who had worked with Leonard for most of the previous fifteen years.[64]\\r\\nOn June 12, 1989, Leonard defended the WBC Super Middleweight Championship in a rematch with Thomas Hearns at Caesar's Palace. It was promoted as \\"The War.\\" Hearns was guaranteed $11 million and Leonard was guaranteed $14 million.\\r\\nHearns dropped Leonard with a right cross in the third round, but Leonard came back and battered Hearns around the ring in the fifth. Early in the seventh round, Hearns hurt Leonard but punched himself out going for the knockout. With Hearns fatigued, Leonard came back and had a strong finish to the round. Rounds nine and ten were good rounds for Leonard, but he ran into trouble in the eleventh round. Three booming rights from Hearns sent Leonard down for the second time in the fight. Knowing he needed a big finish, Leonard fought furiously and had a big final round.\\r\\nThe judges scored the fight a draw and Leonard retained the title. Judge Jerry Roth scored the fight 113ÿ112 for Hearns, Judge Tom Kazmarek scored it 113ÿ112 for Leonard, and Judge Dalby Shirley scored it 112ÿ112. Shirley was the only judge to give Leonard a 10ÿ8 margin in the twelfth. If he had scored it 10ÿ9, as his two colleagues did, Hearns would have won by a split decision. The decision was soundly booed, as most felt that Hearns had won.[65] Eventually, Leonard admitted that Hearns deserved the decision.\\r\\nOn December 7, 1989, Leonard defended the title against Roberto Durn, who was the reigning WBC Middleweight Champion. Durn was guaranteed $7.6 million and Leonard's arrangement guaranteed him over $13 million.[66]\\r\\nFor the Durn fight, Leonard cut his entourage from twenty-one to six. Dave Jacobs was one of the people let go, leaving Correa as the sole trainer. Correa was instructed not to spare the whip. \\"For the first time in a long time, I allowed someone to push me\\", Leonard said.\\r\\nThe fight took place at the new Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. Leonard used constant lateral movement and won by a lopsided twelve-round unanimous decision over a listless Durn. The scores were 120ÿ110, 119ÿ109, and 116ÿ111. In a fight that many considered to be very boring, both fighters were booed often by the fans and many left the arena before the decision was announced. Pat Putnam of Sports Illustrated wrote, \\"Leonard gave them artistic perfection when they wanted heated battle, and they booed lustily. Most fight fans would not spend a dime to watch Van Gogh paint Sunflowers, but they would fill Yankee Stadium to see him cut off his ear.\\"[67] Although Leonard dominated the fight, he suffered several cuts. His lower lip was cut from a headbutt in the fourth round, his left eye was cut in the eleventh round, and his right eye was cut in the twelfth round. The cuts required a total of sixty stitches.[68]\\r\\nIn January 1990, Leonard relinquished the WBC Super Middleweight Championship, saying that he was unsure whether he would fight again.[69] When Leonard decided to continue his career, he offered Hagler a rematch, but Hagler decided to stay retired.[70] He then offered Hearns a third fight, but Hearns said he could no longer make the weight and moved up to the light heavyweight division.[71]\\r\\nOn February 9, 1991, Leonard went down to 154?lbs and fought WBC Light Middleweight Champion Terry Norris at Madison Square Garden. Leonard entered the bout as a 3-1 favorite but Norris dominated the fight, giving Leonard a heavy beating. He knocked Leonard down with a left hook in the second round, and in the seventh, he dropped Leonard again with a short right. Leonard had no answer for the skillful, younger, faster man. Leonard went the distance but lost by a lopsided decision. The scores were 120ÿ104, 119ÿ103, and 116ÿ110. After the verdict was announced, Leonard announced his retirement. \\"It took this fight to show me it is no longer my time\\", Leonard said. \\"Tonight was my last fight. I know how Hagler felt now.\\"[72]\\r\\nIn October 1996, the 40-year-old Leonard announced that he was coming out of retirement to fight 34-year-old Hctor Camacho for the lightly regarded International Boxing Council (IBC) Middleweight Championship. Camacho, a light-hitting southpaw, was a three-time world champion with a record of 62ÿ3ÿ1. However, Camacho was also considered to be past his prime. Leonard decided to fight Camacho after commentating on his fight with the 45-year-old Roberto Durn the previous year. Camacho won by a disputed unanimous decision, which Leonard called \\"an early Christmas gift\\".\\r\\nLeonard blamed his poor performance against Norris on lack of motivation, a rib injury, moving down in weight, and divorce, which was being litigated while he was in training. \\"It was stupid for me to fight Norris at 154 lbs\\", Leonard said. \\"This is different. I'm in the best shape possible.\\"[73]\\r\\nFor the Camacho fight, Leonard had a new trainer, Adrian Davis. \\"He's a great trainer, a throwback\\", Leonard said. \\"He has really helped me get ready.\\"[74]\\r\\nIn January 1997, it was announced that Leonard had been voted into the International Boxing Hall Of Fame in Canastota, New York. The rules state that a boxer must be retired for five years before being eligible for induction. When the vote took place, Leonard had been retired for more than five years, therefore, he was eligible, even though he had a fight scheduled. The induction ceremony was on June 15, 1997.[75]\\r\\nThe fight with Camacho took place on March 1, 1997, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Camacho applied pressure from the opening bell and started to score well in the third. He continued to score well in the fourth and opened a cut above Leonard's right eye. In the fifth, Camacho dropped Leonard with a right followed by two left uppercuts. Leonard got up, but was unable to ward off Camacho. The referee stopped the fight with Camacho teeing off on a defenseless Leonard on the ropes. It was the only time in Leonard's career that he was knocked out.\\r\\nAfterward, Leonard retired again, saying, \\"For sure, my career is definitely over for me in the ring.\\" However, less than a week after the fight, Leonard said he planned to fight again. He blamed his loss on a torn right calf muscle. His doctor suggested that he cancel the fight, but Leonard wanted to go through with it. Before the fight, he was given a shot of novocaine.[76]\\r\\nLeonard said he planned to have a series of tuneup fights before fighting a champion.[77] He was scheduled to fight Tony Menefee on February 15, 1998, in Australia, but he pulled out of the fight, saying that he didn't have the motivation. The Camacho fight was Leonard's last. He finished his career with a record of 36ÿ3ÿ1 with 25 knockouts.[78]\\r\\nLeonard has worked as a boxing analyst for ABC, CBS, NBC, ESPN, HBO and EPIX. His relationship with HBO lasted for more than a decade. It ended in 1990, after HBO was not offered an opportunity to bid on the telecast rights to Leonard's fight with Terry Norris. HBO believed it would be inappropriate for Leonard to continue with them if they couldn't bid on his fights. Leonard's attorney, Mike Trainer, said, \\"There never has been a linkage between his broadcasting and his fighting.\\"[79]\\r\\nLeonard has provided commercial endorsements for companies including Coca-Cola, EA Sports, Ford, Nabisco, Revlon and 7 Up. His most famous commercial was a 7 Up ad he did with his son, Ray Jr., Roberto Durn and Durn's son Roberto Jr. in the early 1980s.[80][81] Leonard is among the most sought-after motivational/inspirational speakers in the world today. His speech, entitled \\"Power\\" (Prepare, Overcome and Win Every Round), is consistently booked with major Fortune 500 companies throughout the United States and abroad.[82]\\r\\nLeonard has also worked as an actor. He has appeared in numerous television shows, including Half & Half, L.A. Heat, Married... with Children, Renegade and Tales From The Crypt. He has also appeared in several movies, including I Spy and most recently The Fighter (2010), starring Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. This movie brought back memories of his fight with Dicky Eklund. He also worked as an adviser in the 2011 robot boxing film Real Steel. Leonard served as host and mentor to the aspiring fighters on The Contender. Sylvester Stallone, who co-hosted during the first season, was one of the executive producers, along with Mark Burnett. When Leonard left the show, he was replaced as host by Tony Danza for the final season.[83]\\r\\nIn 2001, Leonard launched Sugar Ray Leonard Boxing Inc., a boxing promotional company, and announced the company's strategic partnership with ESPN. Together, Leonard and ESPN would produce and promote \\"Sugar Ray Leonard and ESPN II Presents Friday Night Fights\\", which would air the first Friday of every month for twelve months.[84] Leonard's boxing promotional company was dissolved in 2004. He had a falling out with partner Bjorn Rebney, whom he called \\"a cancer in my company.\\"[85] Speaking of his promotional company, Leonard said, \\"We did some great shows with evenly matched fights. I took great pride in it. But the TV show came about and made my decision a lot easier. I already had it in the back of my mind to dissolve the company. The working environment was not healthy.\\"[86]\\r\\nLeonard competed on season 12 of Dancing with the Stars, which premiered on Monday, March 21, 2011, on ABC. His partner was Anna Trebunskaya. He was voted off in Week 4 of the show.[87][88] During his appearance on The Colbert Report in 2011, Leonard was defeated by host Stephen Colbert in a thumb wrestling contest.[89] He appeared as a guest at the chef's table, along with Tito Ortiz, during the tenth season of Hell's Kitchen. He is the celebrity spokesperson for the Atlanta law firm John Foy and Associates, PC.\\r\\nLeonard was also the subject of a Seinfeld episode (season 6, episode 22) where George tries to flatter his boss by saying he looks like Sugar Ray Leonard. The real Leonard (a Seinfeld fan) mentioned that he was told about the episode by friends and family, but had never seen it for himself until a friend gave him the DVD set for a gift.\\r\\nLeonard married his high school sweetheart, Juanita Wilkinson, in January 1980. Their six-year-old son, Ray Jr., served as the ring bearer.[90] In 1984, they had another son, Jarrell.[91]\\r\\nThey were divorced in 1990. During divorce proceedings, Juanita Leonard testified that her husband physically abused her while under the influence of alcohol. She also said he was an occasional cocaine user. In his testimony, Leonard confirmed his wife's claims and went on to reveal that the problems of their marriage were not due to drug and alcohol use.[92]\\r\\nAfter the Los Angeles Times broke the story, Leonard held a press conference and publicly acknowledged that the accusations were true. He said he started using after he retired in 1982, following surgery to repair a detached retina. \\"I wanted more\\", Leonard said. \\"I wanted that arena. I didn't want anyone to tell me my career had to end.\\"\\r\\n\\"I decided to search for a substitute...I resorted to cocaine. I used when I felt bad, I used when I missed competing at that level\\", he said. \\"It was a crutch, something that enabled me to forget.\\"\\r\\nHe said he quit using drugs in early 1986, when he woke up one morning and \\"what I saw in the mirror was scary.\\"\\r\\n\\"I can never erase the pain or the scars I have made through my stupidity, my selfishness\\", Leonard said. \\"All I can do is say I'm sorry, but that is not enough.\\"[93]\\r\\nIn 2011, Sugar Ray revealed in an NPR broadcast that he had been free of alcohol since July 2006.\\r\\nIn 1989, Leonard was introduced to Bernadette Robi by Kenny G at a Luther Vandross concert. Robi is the daughter of Paul Robi, one of the original Platters and she is the ex-wife of Lynn Swann.\\r\\nLeonard and Robi were married at Leonard's $8.7 million estate in Pacific Palisades, California in August 1993. At the wedding ceremony, the grounds were converted into a garden with 10,000 roses and blossoms of other flowers flown in from the Netherlands.[94]\\r\\nLeonard is also the godfather of Khlo Kardashian and has appeared on many episodes of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\\r\\nFor many years, Leonard has been the International Chairman of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Walk for a Cure and is actively involved in raising both awareness and funds.\\r\\nLeonard testified before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs in 2009. The Senate hearing was titled \\"Type 1 Diabetes Research: Real Progress and Real Hope for a Cure.\\" He testified about the burden of diabetes and the need for continued research funding to find a cure.[95]\\r\\nLeonard and his wife, Bernadette, founded the Sugar Ray Leonard Foundation to support the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and its annual Walk for a Cure. In 2009, the foundation expanded to support programs that help people rebuild their communities in ten cities across the United States. It supports accessible housing, healthcare services, and educational services and job training.\\r\\nIn 2007 he was awarded The Ambassador Award of Excellence by the LA Sports & Entertainment Commission at the Riviera Country Club for his continued community involvement.[96]\\r\\nIn his autobiography The Big Fight: My Life in and out of the Ring, published in June 2011, Leonard reveals that as a young boxer he was the victim of sexual abuse from an Olympic trainer as well as another man, a benefactor.[97] He has since made public appearances to bring attention to the issue of child sex abuse, declaring himself a \\"poster child\\" for the cause and encouraging victims to report their abuse.[98]","input":"Who wins sugar ray leonard or floyd mayweather?"},{"output":"Stephen A. Schwarzman Building","context":"The Stephen A. Schwarzman Building of the New York Public Library, originally called the Central Building[4] and more widely known as the Main Branch or as the New York Public Library,[a] is the flagship building in the New York Public Library system and a prominent historic landmark in Midtown Manhattan. The branch, opened in 1911, is one of four research libraries in the library system. It currently contains area of 646,680 square feet (60,079?m2)[5] and four stories open to public. The main entrance steps are on Fifth Avenue opposite East 41st Street.\\r\\nThe Library's famous Rose Main Reading Room (Room 315) is a majestic 78 by 297 feet (24 by 91?m), with 52-foot (16?m)-high ceilings. The room is lined with thousands of reference works on open shelves along the floor level and along the balcony, lit by massive windows and grand chandeliers, and furnished with sturdy wood tables, comfortable chairs, and brass lamps. It is also equipped with computers providing access to library collections and the Internet as well as docking facilities for laptops. Readers study books brought to them from the library's closed stacks. There are special rooms named for notable authors and scholars, many of whom have done important research and writing at the Library. But the Library has always been about more than scholars; during the Great Depression, many members of the general public, out of work, used the Library to improve their lot in life, as they still do.[6]\\r\\nThe building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965,[3] listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966,[2] and designated a New York City Landmark in 1967.[1] It was renamed in 2008 after businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman, who donated a large sum of money for the refurbishment of the building.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarble on the library building is about three feet thick, and the building is Vermont marble and brick all the way through. The exterior is 20,000 blocks of stone, each one numbered in preparation for a renovation announced in 2007. It stretches 390 feet along Fifth Avenue.[7]\\r\\nTwo stone lions (made of Tennessee marble) lie at either side of the stairway to the entrance. The famous pair guarding the entrance were sculpted by Edward Clark Potter. Their original names, \\"Leo Astor\\" and \\"Leo Lenox\\" (in honor of the library's founders) were transformed into Lord Astor and Lady Lenox (although both lions are male), and in the 1930s they were nicknamed \\"Patience\\" and \\"Fortitude\\" by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who chose the names because he felt that the citizens of New York would need to possess these qualities to see themselves through the Great Depression. Patience is on the south side (the left as one faces the main entrance) and Fortitude on the north.[6]\\r\\nBefore the end pavilions are flagpoles, whose sculpted bronze bases designed by Thomas Hastings in 1912 were realized by the sculptor Raffaele Menconi, who often worked closely with New York architects of the Beaux-Arts generation and had a deft command of the 16th-century Italian Mannerist classical idiom that was required by Hasting's design. The bronzes were cast at Tiffany Studios in Long Island City. They were rededicated to New York's former Reform mayor, John Purroy Mitchell.\\r\\nThe consolidation of several libraries into the New York Public Library in 1901, along with the large Tilden bequest and a donation of $5.2 million from Andrew Carnegie,[10] allowed for the creation of an enormous library system befitting the nation's largest city. However, the founders also wanted an imposing main branch.\\r\\nA prominent, central site for it was available at the two-block section of Fifth Avenue between 40th and 42nd Streets, then occupied by the Croton Reservoir, which was obsolete and no longer needed (traces of the old reservoir still exist on the library floor). [9] Dr. John Shaw Billings, who was named the first director of the New York Public Library, recognized the viability of the location for his envisioned structure. His design for the new library formed the basis of the landmark building that became the central Research Library (now known as the Humanities and Social Science Library) on Fifth Avenue.[6]\\r\\nBillings's plan called for a massive reading room on top of seven floors of book-stacks, combined with the fastest system for getting books into the hands of those who requested to read them. Following a competition among the city's most famous architects, the relatively unknown firm of Carrre and Hastings was selected to design and construct the new library. The result, regarded as the apex of Beaux-Arts design, was the largest marble structure up to that time in the United States. The cornerstone was laid in May 1902.[6]\\r\\nWork progressed very gradually on the library, which ultimately cost $9 million to build. During the summer of 1905, giant columns were put into place and work on the roof was begun. By the end of 1906, the roof was finished and the designers commenced five years of interior work. In 1910, 75 miles (121 kilometres) worth of shelves were installed to hold the collections that were designated for being housed there, with substantial room left for future acquisitions. It would take an entire year to transfer and install the books which theretofore had been located in the Astor and Lenox libraries.[6]\\r\\nOn May 23, 1911, the main branch of the New York Public Library was officially opened. The ceremony was presided over by President William Howard Taft and was attended by Governor John Alden Dix and Mayor William Jay Gaynor.[6]\\r\\nThe following day, May 24, the public was invited. The response was sensational. Tens of thousands thronged to the Library's \\"jewel in the crown.\\" The opening day collection consisted of more than 1,000,000 volumes. The New York Public Library instantly became one of the nation's largest libraries and a vital part of the intellectual life of America. True to Dr. Billings' plan, library records for that day show that one of the very first items called for was N. I. Grot's Nravstvennye idealy nashego vremeni (\\"Ethical Ideas of Our Time\\") a study of Friedrich Nietzsche and Leo Tolstoy. The reader filed his slip at 9:08?a.m. and received his book six minutes later.[6]\\r\\nDr. Harry Miller Lydenberg served as director between 1934ÿ1941.[11]\\r\\nOver the decades, the research collection grew until, by the 1970s, it was clear that the collection would eventually outgrow the existing structure. Thus, it was decided to expand the library by burrowing under the west side of Bryant Park. In the 1980s the central research library added more than 125,000 square feet (11,600?m2) of space and several miles of bookshelf space to its already vast storage capacity to make room for future acquisitions. This expansion required a major construction project in which Bryant Park, directly west of the library, was closed to the public and excavated. The new library facilities were built below ground level. The park was then restored on top of the underground facilities and re-opened to the public.\\r\\nIn the three decades before 2007, the building's interior was gradually renovated. In December 2005, the Lionel Pincus and Princess Firyal Map Division space, with richly carved wood, marble, and metalwork, was restored.[7]\\r\\nOn December 20, 2007, the library announced that it would undertake a three-year, $50 million renovation of the building exterior, which had suffered damage from weathering and automobile exhaust. The Vermont marble structure and the sculpture elements on it were to be cleaned, 3,000 cracks were to be repaired, and restoration work would also be done on the roof, stairs, and plazas. All of the work was scheduled to be completed by the centennial in 2011.[12] New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, on behalf of the library, asked the mayor of Paris to lend to New York the services of Fran?ois Jousse, the city engineer responsible for lighting Paris' monuments, structures and official buildings. Library director Paul LeClerc said in 2007 that my ambition is for this to be the building you simply must see in New York at nighttime because it is so beautiful and it is so important.[7]\\r\\nAs of 2004, streaks were already blackening the white marble and pollution and moisture were corroding the ornamental statuary, causing architectural details to erode, including the edges of cornices and features on carved faces. Tiny particles of rubber scattered by passing car tires have accumulated on the building, mixing gradually with water to turn the marble into gypsum, which causes the outer layer to crumble in a sugaring effect, according to an article in The New York Times.[7]\\r\\nBy late 2007, library officials had not yet decided whether to try to restore damaged sculptural elements or just clean and \\"stabilize\\" them. Cleaning would be done either with lasers or by applying poultices and peeling them off.[7]\\r\\nIn 2008, the library announced that the main branch building would be renamed in honor of Stephen A. Schwarzman, in recognition of his unconditional donation of $100 million toward the renovation and expansion of the building.[13]\\r\\nIn late 2012, a Central Library Plan was announced, in which two nearby branches would be closed and their activities merged into the main building.[14] The plan was abandoned in May 2014.[15]\\r\\nIn May 2014, one of the \\"gilded-plaster rosettes\\" in the ceiling of the Rose Main Reading Room fell to the floor 50 feet below.[16] The NYPL closed the Rose Main Reading Room and the Bill Blass Public Catalog Room for renovations. The $12 million restoration project included recreating and replacing the rosette that fell, reinforcing each rosette with steel cables, and installing LED lighting.[17] The NYPL commissioned EverGreene Architectural Arts to recreate the mural in the Bill Blass Public Catalog Room, which had suffered irreparable discoloration, overpainting and water damage during its 105-year history.[18] The NYPL also installed a $2.6 million book delivery system, using a conveyor belt and 24 book carts that could each carry up to 30 pounds (14 kilograms) through the library's eleven levels.[19] The restored Rose Main Reading Room and Bill Blass Public Catalog Room reopened October 5, 2016.[20]\\r\\nFrom August 2017 through early 2020, the Main Branch is set to host an interim library at 42nd Street.[21] The interim library will host part of the collection of the NYPL Mid-Manhattan Branch, located across the street at Fifth Avenue and 40th Street, since the Mid-Manhattan Branch is slated to close for renovation until 2020.[22] The Mid-Manhattan Branch's collection of pictures would also be relocated to the Main Branch.[23]\\r\\nLeading up to the Main Branch, on 41st Street between Park and Fifth Avenues, is a series of plaques known as Library Way. Library Way comprises a series of illustrated bronze sidewalk plaques featuring quotes from famous authors, poets, and other notables. It features 48 unique plaques in all, duplicated (to thus total 96 plaques) embedded along the north and the south sides of 41st Street[24] The Wall Street Journal reports: \\"The quotes were selected during the 1990s by a panel that included representatives from the library; the Grand Central Partnership, which manages the Grand Central Business Improvement District; and the New Yorker magazine. And the plaques, which are graphically intriguing in their own right, were designed by Gregg LeFevre.\\"[25][26] Brochures are available at the Friends of the Library counter on the first floor of the New York Public Library (41st Street and Fifth Avenue).[27] [28]\\r\\nLibrary Way is one block north of the Mid-Manhattan Library, located at 455 Fifth Avenue (at 40th Street). Granite plaques have also been placed in the sidewalks of lower Broadway in honor of ticker-tape parades held there in the past. In the garment district from 39th to 41st Street on Broadway, plaques commemorate fashion designers including Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Geoffrey Beene.[29]\\r\\nThe Main Branch has frequently appeared or been referenced in artistic, literary, and cultural works.\\r\\nIt was featured in the 1978 film The Wiz when Dorothy and Toto stumble across it, one of its lions comes to life, and joins them on their journey out of Oz. It was a major location in the 2004 apocalyptic science fiction film The Day After Tomorrow. It is also featured prominently in the 1984 film Ghostbusters, when a librarian in the basement reports seeing a ghost which becomes violent when approached. Additionally, the building is featured as a wedding venue in the 2008 film Sex and the City. It was also prominently featured in the 2011 film The Adjustment Bureau.\\r\\nOther films in which the library appears include 42nd Street (1933), Portrait of Jennie (1948), Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), You're a Big Boy Now (1966), A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969), Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), Chapter Two (1979), Escape from New York (1981), Regarding Henry (1991), The Thomas Crown Affair (1999), and The Time Machine (2002).\\r\\nIn television, the library was featured in \\"The Library\\" episode of Seinfeld, in which Cosmo Kramer dates a librarian there, Jerry Seinfeld is accosted by a library cop named Mr. Bookman for late fees, and George Costanza encounters his high school gym teacher living homeless on its stairs. It is the setting for much of \\"The Persistence of Memory,\\" the eleventh part of Carl Sagan's Cosmos TV series.\\r\\nThe Library also appears in literature. Lynne Sharon Schwartz's Writing on the Wall (2005) features a language researcher at NYPL who grapples with her past following the September 11 attacks. Cynthia Ozick's novel Heir to the Glimmering World (2004) set just prior to World War II, involves a scholar who has fled from Nazi Germany researching the Karaite Jews at NYPL. Matthew Reilly's novel Contest (1996) sets an intergalactic gladiatorial fight in the NYPL, resulting in the building's total destruction.\\r\\nLawrence Blochman's Death Walks in Marble Halls (1942) features a murder committed using a brass spindle from a catalog drawer. Jane Smiley's Duplicate Keys (1984), also a murder mystery, featured an NYPL librarian who stumbles upon two bodies of people who died in 1930. Allen Kurzweil's novel The Grand Complication (2001) is the story of an NYPL librarian whose research skills are put to work finding a missing museum object.\\r\\nSeveral poems involve the Library, including E. B. White's \\"A Library Lion Speaks\\" and \\"Reading Room\\" in Poems and Sketches of E.B. White (1981); Richard Eberhart's \\"Reading Room, The New York Public Library,\\" in Collected Poems, 1930-1986 (1988); and Lawrence Ferlinghetti's \\"Library Scene, Manhattan,\\" in How to Paint Sunlight (2001). Excerpts from several of the many memoirs and essays mentioning the New York Public Library are included in the anthology Reading Rooms (1991), including reminiscences by Alfred Kazin, Henry Miller, and Kate Simon.","input":"What is the main branch of the new york public library?"},{"output":"Soviet Union","context":"World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history in absolute terms of total casualties.

World War II fatality statistics vary, with estimates of total deaths ranging from 50 million to more than 80 million.[2] The higher figure of over 80 million includes deaths from war-related disease and famine.

Research in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union has caused a revision of estimates of Soviet WW2 fatalities.[3] According to Russian government figures, USSR losses within postwar borders now stand at 26.6 million.[4][5] including 8.5 million due to war related famine and disease[6] In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland's dead at between 5.6 and 5.8 million.[7] Historian Rdiger Overmans of the Military History Research Office (Germany) published a study in 2000 that estimated the German military dead and missing at 5.3 million, including 900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany's 1937 borders, in Austria, and in east-central Europe.[8][9][10] The People's Republic of China puts its war dead at 20 million,[11] while the Japanese government puts its casualties due to the war at 3.1 million.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCompiling or estimating the numbers of deaths caused during wars and other violent conflicts is a controversial subject. Historians often put forward many different estimates of the numbers killed during World War II.[13] The authors of the Oxford Companion to World War II maintain that \\"casualty statistics are notoriously unreliable.\\"[14] The table below gives data on the number of dead for each country, along with population information to show the relative impact of losses. When scholarly sources differ on the number of deaths in a country, a range of war losses is given, in order to inform readers that the death toll is disputed. Since casualty statistics are sometimes disputed the footnotes to this article present the different estimates by official governmental sources as well as historians. Military figures include battle deaths (KIA) and personnel missing in action (MIA), as well as fatalities due to accidents, disease and deaths of prisoners of war in captivity. Civilian casualties include deaths caused by strategic bombing, Holocaust victims, German war crimes, Japanese war crimes, population transfers in the Soviet Union, Allied war crimes, and deaths due to war related famine and disease.\\r\\nThe sources for the casualties of the individual nations do not use the same methods, and civilian deaths due to starvation and disease are not given for Japan, Germany and several other highly stressed populations. The losses listed here are actual deaths; hypothetical losses due to a decline in births are not included with the total dead. The distinction between military and civilian casualties caused directly by warfare and collateral damage is not always clear-cut. For nations that suffered huge losses such as the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Germany, and Yugoslavia, sources can give only the total estimated population loss caused by the war and a rough estimate of the breakdown of deaths caused by military activity, crimes against humanity and war-related famine. The casualties listed here include 19 to 25 million war-related famine deaths in the USSR, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, India that are often omitted from other compilations of World War II casualties.[15][16] The footnotes give a detailed breakdown of the casualties and their sources, including data on the number of wounded where reliable sources are available.\\r\\nThe estimated breakdown for each Soviet republic of total war dead[13]^AY4\\r\\nThe source of the figures is Vadim Erlikman. Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke: spravochnik. Moscow, 2004. ISBN?5-93165-107-1. pp 21ÿ35. Erlikman, a Russian historian, notes that these figures are his estimates.\\r\\nIncluded in the figures of total war dead for each nation are victims of the Holocaust.\\r\\nThe Holocaust is the term generally used to describe the genocide of approximately six million European Jews during World War II. Martin Gilbert estimates 5.7 million (78%) of the 7.3 million Jews in German occupied Europe were Holocaust victims.[199] Estimates of Holocaust deaths range between 4.9 and 5.9 million Jews.[200]\\r\\nStatistical breakdown of Jewish dead:\\r\\nThe figures for the pre-war Jewish population and deaths in the table below are from The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust.[200] The low, high and average percentage figures for deaths of the pre-war population have been added.\\r\\nSome scholars maintain that the definition of the Holocaust should also include the other victims persecuted and killed by the Nazis.[212][213]\\r\\nThe following figures are from The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust, the authors maintain that \\"statistics on Gypsy losses are especially unreliable and controversial. These figures (cited below) are based on necessarily rough estimates\\".[224]\\r\\nIncluded with total war dead are victims of Japanese war crimes.\\r\\nThe total war dead in the USSR includes victims of Soviet oppression. The number of deaths in the Gulag labor camps increased as a result of wartime overcrowding and food shortages.[257] The Stalin regime deported the entire populations of ethnic minorities considered to be potentially disloyal.[258] Since 1990 Russian scholars have been given access to the Soviet-era archives and have published data on the numbers of people executed and those who died in Gulag labor camps and prisons.[259] The Russian scholar Viktor Zemskov puts the death toll from 1941ÿ1945 at about 1 million based on data from the Soviet archives.[260] The Soviet-era archive figures on the Gulag labor camps has been the subject of a vigorous academic debate outside Russia since their publication in 1991. J. Arch Getty and Stephen G. Wheatcroft maintain that Soviet-era figures more accurately detail the victims of the Gulag labor camp system in the Stalin era.[261][262] Robert Conquest and Steven Rosefielde have disputed the accuracy of the data from the Soviet archives, maintaining that the demographic data and testimonials by survivors of the Gulag labor camps indicate a higher death toll.[263][264] Rosefielde posits that the release of the Soviet Archive figures is disinformation generated by the modern KGB.[265] Rosefielde maintains that the data from the Soviet archives is incomplete; for example, he pointed out that the figures do not include the 22,000 victims of the Katyn massacre.[266] Rosefielde's demographic analysis puts the number of excess deaths due to Soviet repression at 2,183,000 in 1939ÿ40 and 5,458,000 from 1941ÿ1945.[267] Michael Haynes and Rumy Husun accept the figures from the Soviet archives as being an accurate tally of Stalin's victims, they maintain that the demographic data depicts an underdeveloped Soviet economy and the losses in World War Two rather than indicating a higher death toll in the Gulag labor camps.[268]\\r\\nIn August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated 150,000 Polish citizens were killed due to Soviet repression. Since the collapse of the USSR, Polish scholars have been able to do research in the Soviet archives on Polish losses during the Soviet occupation.[197] Andrzej Paczkowski puts the number of Polish deaths at 90,000ÿ100,000 of the 1.0 million persons deported and 30,000 executed by the Soviets.[269] In 2005 Tadeusz Piotrowski estimated the death toll in Soviet hands at 350,000.[270]\\r\\nThe Estonian State Commission for the Examination of Repressive Policies Carried out During the Occupations put civilian deaths due to the Soviet occupation in 1940ÿ1941 at 33,900 including (7,800 deaths) of arrested people, (6,000) deportee deaths, (5,000) evacuee deaths, (1,100) people gone missing and (14,000) conscripted for forced labor. After the reoccupation by the U.S.S.R., 5,000 Estonians died in Soviet prisons during 1944ÿ45.[271]\\r\\nThe following is a summary of the data from the Soviet archives:\\r\\nReported deaths for the years 1939ÿ1945 1,187,783, including: judicial executions 46,350; deaths in Gulag labor camps 718,804; deaths in labor colonies and prisons 422,629.[272]\\r\\nDeported to special settlements: (figures are for deportations to Special Settlements only, not including those executed, sent to Gulag labor camps or conscripted into the Soviet Army.

The death toll attributable to the flight and expulsions was estimated at 2.2 million by the West German government in 1958.[423] German government reports which were released to the public in 1987 and 1989 have caused some historians in Germany to put the actual total at 500,000 to 600,000.[424] English language sources put the death toll at 2 to 3 million based on the West German government statistical analysis of the 1950s.[425][426][427][428][429][430][431][432][433][434]\\r\\nThe German government figures of 2.0 to 2.5 million civilian deaths due to the expulsions have been disputed by scholars since the publication of the results of the German church search service survey and the report by the German Federal Archive.[444][450][451][452][453][454][455][456]\\r\\nPost war increase in natural deaths\\r\\n^T xGreece\\r\\n^TA xGuam\\r\\n^U xHungary\\r\\n^V xIceland\\r\\n^W xIndia\\r\\nBengal famine of 1943\\r\\n^X xIran\\r\\n^Y xIraq\\r\\n^Z xIreland\\r\\n^AA xItaly\\r\\n???????????Military war dead\\r\\n???????????Confirmed dead were 159,957 (92,767 pre-armistice, 67,090 post armistice)[478]\\r\\n???????????Missing and presumed dead(including POWs) were 131,419 (111,579 pre-armistice, 19,840 post armistice)[479]\\r\\n???????????Losses by branch of service: Army 201,405; Navy 22,034; Air Force 9,096; Colonial Forces 354; Chaplains 91; Fascist militia\\r\\n???????????10,066; Paramilitary 3,252; not indicated 45,078.[480]\\r\\n???????????Military Losses by theatre of war: Italy 74,725 (37,573 post armistice); France 2,060 (1,039 post armistice);\\r\\n???????????Germany 25,430 (24,020 post armistice); Greece, Albania, and Yugoslavia 49,459 (10,090 post armistice);\\r\\n???????????USSR 82,079 (3,522 post armistice); Africa 22,341 (1,565 post armistice), at sea 28,438 (5,526 post armistice);\\r\\n???????????other and unknown 6,844 (3,695 post armistice).[481]\\r\\n^AB xJapan\\r\\nMilitary dead\\r\\n?????????????Key: Location, Army dead, Navy dead, (Total dead)\\r\\n?????????????Japan Proper: 58,100, 45,800, (103,900)\\r\\n?????????????Bonin Islands: 2,700, 12,500, (15,200)\\r\\n?????????????Okinawa: 67,900, 21,500, (89,400)\\r\\n?????????????Formosa (Taiwan): 28,500, 10,600, (39,100)\\r\\n?????????????Korea: 19,600, 6,900, (26,500)\\r\\n?????????????Sakhalin, the Aleutian, and Kuril Islands: 8,200, 3,200, (11,400)\\r\\n?????????????Manchuria: 45,900, 800, (46,700)\\r\\n?????????????China (inc.

The exact number of dead and injured will never be known because of the confusion after the explosions. Persons unaccounted for might have been burned beyond recognition in the falling buildings, disposed of in one of the mass cremations of the first week of recovery, or driven out of the city to die or recover without any record remaining. No sure count of even the prepaid populations existed. Because of the decline in activity in the two port cities, the constant threat of incendiary raids, and the formal evacuation programs of the Government, an unknown number of the inhabitants had either drifter away from the cities or been removed according to plan. In this uncertain situation, estimates of casualties have generally ranged between 100,000 and 180,000 for Hiroshima, and between 50,000 and 100,000 for Nagasaki. The Survey believes the dead at Hiroshima to have been between 70,000 and 80,000, with an equal number injured; at Nagasaki over 35,000 dead and somewhat more than that injured seems the most plausible estimate.

Though their 2016 performances were billed as a farewell tour, the band remains active on a sporadic ad hoc basis, most recently with three performances at The Hollywood Bowl in July 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nHead Over Heels, a new musical featuring the songs of the Go-Go's, is scheduled to premiere on Broadway at the Hudson Theatre in the summer of 2018.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormed in Los Angeles in 1978, the Go-Go's initially consisted of Belinda Carlisle (vocals), Jane Wiedlin (guitar, vocals), Margot Olavarria (bass) and Elissa Bello (drums).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were formed as a punk band and had roots in the L.A. punk community.[7] They shared a rehearsal space with the Motels and Carlisle, under the name \\"Dottie Danger\\", had briefly been a member of punk rock band the Germs. Due to a bout of mononucleosis, she left the Germs before playing a gig.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band started out playing gigs at punk venues such as The Masque and the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles and the Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco alongside bands such as X, Fear, the Plugz and the Controllers. Charlotte Caffey (lead guitar, keyboards) was added later in 1978, and in the summer of 1979, Gina Schock replaced Bello on drums. With these lineup changes, the group began moving towards their more-familiar power pop sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group used to frequently meet at a now-defunct Denny's on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, and it was there that they chose the band's name.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring late 1979, the band recorded a five-song demo at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles, and in 1980, they supported the British ska revival group Madness in both Los Angeles and England. The Go-Gos subsequently spent half of 1980 touring England, earning a sizable following and releasing the demo version of \\"We Got the Beat\\" on Stiff Records, which became a minor UK hit.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring December 1980, original bassist Olavarria fell ill with hepatitis A and was replaced with Kathy Valentine, who had played guitar in bands such as Girlschool and the Textones. Valentine had not previously played bass guitar. Carlisle also related in her autobiography, Lips Unsealed, that according to the band's view, another reason for Olavarria's dismissal from the Go-Go's was that she frequently missed rehearsals, due largely to her dissatisfaction with the band's move away from punk and toward pop. In late 1982, Olavarria sued the remaining members of the band for wrongfully throwing her out. The suit was settled in 1984. Olavarria later joined Martin Atkins' band Brian Brain.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Go-Go's signed to I.R.S. Records in April 1981. Their debut album, Beauty and the Beat, was a surprise hit: it topped the U.S. charts for six weeks in 1982 and eventually received a double platinum certification. The album was also a success outside the U.S. charting at No. 2 in Canada, where it received a platinum certification, and No. 27 in Australia. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 413 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. \\"Our Lips Are Sealed\\" and a new version of \\"We Got the Beat\\" were popular singles in North America in early 1982. During this period, the Go-Go's became America's sweethearts and started building a fanbase.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982, the group was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe follow-up album, Vacation, received mixed reviews and sold less than Beauty and the Beat. However, the album was certified gold in the U.S. and spawned another top 10 US hit with the title track. Other singles released from the album were \\"Get Up and Go\\" and \\"This Old Feeling\\", neither of which made it into the Top 40. In 1983, Vacation was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Packaging. During the album's promotion, the group went on hiatus when Schock underwent surgery for a congenital heart defect.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984, the group returned with the Martin Rushent-produced album Talk Show. The album tracks \\"Head over Heels\\" and \\"Turn to You\\" were both Top 40 hits in the US. Despite the favorable reception, the album sold less than the previous two, not reaching the top 10 and not receiving any certification.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonality conflicts and creative differences within the group were also taking a toll, as were drug addiction problems for some band members. Wiedlin announced her departure from the group in October 1984. The band sought a replacement, selecting Paula Jean Brown (of Giant Sand) as their new bass guitarist, with Valentine moving to rhythm guitar. This lineup debuted at the 1985 Rock in Rio festival, playing two shows, but Carlisle and Caffey soon realized their hearts were no longer in the group and decided to disband the Go-Go's in May 1985.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, the Go-Go's classic lineup (Caffey, Carlisle, Schock, Valentine and Wiedlin) reunited to play a benefit concert for the California Environmental Protection Act, a 1990 ballot initiative. This led to more show dates later that year. The band also entered the studio with producer David Z to re-record a cover of \\"Cool Jerk\\" for a greatest hits compilation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1994, the same lineup got together again to release the 2-disc retrospective Return to the Valley of The Go-Go's, which featured three new recordings. The single \\"The Whole World Lost Its Head\\" peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts and \\"bubbled under\\" on the US charts at No. 108, but became the band's first and only Top 40 hit in the UK, peaking at No. 29. The band toured again to promote the release; ex-Bangle Vicki Peterson stood in on several dates for Caffey, who was pregnant.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, Schock sued the other members of the group, claiming that she had not been properly paid for her contributions since 1986 and that a songwriting agreement with Caffey had been breached. The suit was resolved by 1999 when the band reunited for a brief tour[11] and they finally began to resolve their personal differences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Go-Go's toured regularly from 1999 onward. In 2001, the band (still with the \\"classic\\" lineup) released an album of new material, God Bless the Go-Go's. Green Day's lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong co-wrote the only released single, \\"Unforgiven\\", which peaked at No. 22 on Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart. The album was well received by critics, and peaked at number No. 57 in the Billboard 200 chart.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in 2001, the Go-Go's, along with artists Elton John, Billy Joel, David Crosby and Paul Simon, performed at the concert \\"An All-Star Tribute to Brian Wilson\\" at Radio City Music Hall, hosted by the TNT network.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2010, Carlisle announced that the 2010 tour would be billed as the \\"Farewell Tour\\",[12] but this tour was cancelled when Wiedlin injured her knee while hiking near her home in Northern California, requiring surgery and up to a year of recovery time.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 2010, the idea of a farewell tour seemed to have been abandoned, with the Go-Go's touring frequently. In 2011, the Go-Go's announced the \\"Ladies Gone Wild\\" tour to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the release of Beauty and the Beat.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 11, 2011, the band received the 2,444th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at the site where punk rock club The Masque used to stand. They subsequently toured the US in 2012, with Abby Travis subbing for an injured Valentine during the latter part of the tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 8, 2013, the group's official website said \\"irreconcilable differences\\" had led to the departure of bassist Valentine.[15] On May 24, Valentine sued her former bandmates for \\"breach of fiduciary duty and abuse of control...in an attempt to deprive [her] of her position and interest in the group, including her right to receive her full one-fifth, 20% share of the benefits and revenues generated by the group substantial reputation, fame, and goodwill.\\"[16][17]  Valentine's last full show with the band had occurred on May 9, 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficially a quartet (Caffey, Carlisle, Schock, Wiedlin), the Go-Go's continued on, playing a series of tour dates in 2013 and 2014, including several double bills with the B-52's.[18] Abby Travis performed with the group as an adjunct member on bass.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, the band was inducted in the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame.[19]  That same year, the lawsuit that Valentine brought against her former bandmates was settled out of court.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a February 2016 blog post by Wiedlin on her personal website, she announced that a new Go-Go's tour would kick off in August 2016, stating that it would be the \\"Farewell Tour\\" that had originally been postponed in 2010 while she recovered from her knee injury. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 21, 2016, plans for the farewell tour (minus Valentine) were officially announced. The tour consisted of 18 dates kicking off on August 2 and ending on August 30. Kaya Stewart and Best Coast were the opening acts. A band statement said: \\"After a 38-year run, we are gearing up for one last blast of a summer tour\\".[21]  The farewell tour is meant to be the Go-Go's final extended tour, although the band has not actually broken up and still intends to perform on an occasional basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2018, the group announced on its website that it would play three dates in early July 2018 at the Hollywood Bowl, accompanied by the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nValentine rejoined the band to perform their first show together as a quintet in six years at New York's Bowery Ballroom on January 31, 2018, to announce the Broadway dates of their new musical, Head Over Heels. The new musicalset to premiere at New Yorks Hudson Theatre in summer 2018features the band's hits (including Get Up and Go\\" and Lust to Love) as well as Carlisles solo hits Mad About You and Heaven Is a Place on Earth.[23] The musical had a preview at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2015.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2018, posts on the group's official Facebook page confirmed that Valentine had rejoined the band, and the original quintet will perform several shows throughout the summer.[25]","input":"Who was the lead singer of the go gos?"},{"output":"seven","context":"Uno (/?u?no?/; from Italian and Spanish for 'one') (stylized as UNO) is an American shedding-type card game that is played with a specially printed deck. The game's general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family of card games. The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. It has been a Mattel brand since 1992. When his family and friends began to play more and more, he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made. He sold it from his barbershop at first, and local businesses began to sell it as well. Robins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak, a funeral parlor owner in Joliet, Illinois, for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game. Tezak formed International Games, Inc., to market UNO, with offices behind his funeral parlor. The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood, Illinois. In 1992, International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points, achieved (usually over several rounds of play) by a player discarding all of their cards and earning points corresponding to the value of the remaining cards still held by the other players.\\r\\nThe deck consists of 108 cards, of which there are 25 of each color (red, green, blue, and yellow), each color having two of each rank except zero. The ranks in each color are zero to nine, \\"Skip\\", \\"Draw Two\\", and \\"Reverse\\" (the last three being \\"action cards\\"). In addition, the deck contains four each of \\"Wild\\" and \\"Wild Draw Four\\" cards.\\r\\nTo start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, with the top card of the deck flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile. The player to the dealer's left plays first, unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card (see below). On a player's turn, they must do one of the following:\\r\\nPlay proceeds clockwise around the table.\\r\\nAction and Wild cards have the following effects:\\r\\nA player who plays their next-to-last-card must call \\"Uno\\" as a warning to the other players.[4]\\r\\nThe first player to get rid of their last card (\\"going out\\") wins the hand and scores points for the cards held by the other players. Number cards count their face value, all action cards count 20, and Wild and Wild Draw Four cards count 50. If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is played to go out, the next player in sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied.\\r\\nThe first player to score 500 points wins the game.\\r\\nIn a two-player game, the Reverse card acts like a Skip card; when played, the other player misses a turn.\\r\\nThe following rules are commonly used by players to alter the game:\\r\\nA strategy at Uno may be offensive (aiming to go out), or defensive (aiming to minimize the value of one's hand, in the event that another player goes out, thus getting those points). Part of the skill of playing Uno is knowing when to adopt an offensive or defensive strategy.\\r\\nAn offensive strategy would be holding on to Wild and Wild Draw Four cards, because they can be played near the end of the hand in order to go out (when it's harder to play a matching card). However, a defensive strategy would advise getting rid of such cards early, because they have a high point value.\\r\\nA defensive strategy would advise playing a high card in order to reduce the point value of the hand. However, an offensive strategy would suggest playing a 0 when the player wants to continue on the current color, because it is less likely to be matched by another 0 of a different color (there is only one 0 of each color, but two of each 1ÿ9).\\r\\nA player holding only one card is required to call out \\"Uno\\" or risk being penalized if caught. A player who calls \\"Uno\\" risks being the target of concerted action by the other players, who may be able to use action cards to prevent that player from going out. Depending on the level and seriousness of play, some players may deliberately avoid saying \\"Uno\\", in the hope of avoiding detection and then going out on the next turn. For this reason, it is useful to conceal how many cards are in your hand, and to keep track of how many cards every other player holds.\\r\\nLittle has been published on the optimal strategy for the game of Uno. Simulations of games may shed some light on the matter. Attempts to reduce point count in a player's hands can be \\"read\\" by other players if too transparent. This information can be exploited by other players, and it follows that a mixed strategy may be more appropriate.\\r\\nSome work has been done into the psychology of Uno as it relates to individual and group behavior.[5] Players may exhibit physical tells,[6] in which a subtle, often repeated, cue inadvertently reveals their state of mind during a game. Alternatively, they may change their playing style, switching from an aggressive card-shedding strategy to a more subdued one, or vice versa.\\r\\nThe new Uno action cards bear symbols which denote their action, except for the Wild cards which still bear the word \\"Wild.\\" Before the design change, such cards in English versions of the game had letters only. Especially old English versions can be denoted by the absence of the white rim that surrounds the edge of most Uno cards. Other versions use symbols and images in both old and new designs, especially ones with Wild cards that do not bear the word \\"Wild\\". The Xbox 360 version of the game uses the new English style of the cards. There are also language-free versions of the newer styles that do not bear the word \\"Wild\\" but have the same styling. There is a new version called \\"Uno Mod\\" where the cards have symbols instead of letters or numbers. This version also comes in a red and white case. It is one of several \\"Mod\\" games by Mattel, the others being Othello (game) Mod, Apples to Apples Mod, Phase 10 Mod, and Skip-Bo Mod.\\r\\nThere are many different themes and versions of Uno. These theme games may come with slightly different directions and special cards.\\r\\nNote: * indicates HIT Entertainment character, by which Mattel acquired HIT in 2012.\\r\\nCard sets only have 36 cards designed for children at least 3 years of age. These sets come in several variants, based on titles for children. My First Uno versions:\\r\\nUno versions available on the Xbox 360:\\r\\nSeveral sports teams each have 112-card sets, featuring players from those teams. The special cards in each deck vary depending on the card set itself. The following teams have confirmed Uno sets.\\r\\nMany variations from standard gameplay exist, such as Elimination Uno, Speed Uno, French Uno, Pirate Uno, and Pakistani Uno.[7]\\r\\nUno is a member of the shedding family of card games. The shedding family of card games consists of games where the objective is to get rid of all your cards while preventing the other players from getting rid of their cards.","input":"How many cards do you deal in uni?"},{"output":"October 6, 2017","context":"Heaven Upside Down is the tenth studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was released on October 6, 2017, by Loma Vista Recordings and Caroline International.[4] \\"We Know Where You Fucking Live\\" was issued as the album's lead single on September 11, with \\"Kill4Me\\" following on September 20.[5] The album is being supported by the Heaven Upside Down Tour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2015, the band's eponymous vocalist announced in an interview with KEGL that he, Tyler Bates, Twiggy and Gil Sharone had begun work on their tenth studio album.[6] He revealed several details about the upcoming record ÿ namely its working title of Say10 and an expected release date of February 14, 2017 ÿ in July 2016 during an interview with Ryan J. Downey at the APMAs, after Manson had been presented with their Icon Award.[7][8] The title dates back to Manson's high-school yearbook.[9] As with previous album The Pale Emperor, Manson and Bates worked on Say10 while the latter was composing score material for the American television series Salem;[10] the third season of which featured Manson as a recurring cast membera barber surgeon sociopath named Thomas Dinley.[11][12] Parts of the album were recorded in Louisiana while Manson was filming scenes for Salem.[13] The band had previously recorded their 1996 album Antichrist Superstar in the state.[10] In September, Manson announced that they were \\"putting the finishing touches\\" on the record.[10]\\r\\nThe album was not released on Valentine's Day,[14] with Manson later explaining to Loudwire that he was dissatisfied with the album at that point, and how the band went on to record a further three songs: \\"Revelation #12\\", \\"Saturnalia\\" and \\"Heaven Upside Down\\". He said: \\"Those three songs take place where, if [the album] were a film, it's the opening, the middle and the ending. Then there's the song after 'Heaven Upside Down', it's sort of the end title credits where it's really surmising the story of the record, which is to be interpreted by the listener.\\"[15] Manson compared the title track to material found on The Cure's 1987 album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me,[16] and praised Bates' production of the song: \\"He sent me a mix of this beat, and I put it on in my house, and it was just pulsating. It has this binaural frequency that really fucks with your head, its hypnotizing.\\" He went on to describe both it and \\"Saturnalia\\" as centrepieces of the record.[17]\\r\\nManson initially described Say10 as \\"not very much in any way like The Pale Emperor. The people who have heard the new songs said it reminded them of their favorite parts of Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animalsbut with a new, different approach. It's pretty violent in its nature for some reason, and it's not emotional in the same way. It's got a chip on its shoulder.\\"[10] He also said it was \\"by far the most thematic and over-complicated thing that I've done\\",[18] and said it contains some of his most politically charged lyrics.[9] He had previously indicated that he would not be voting in the 2016 US presidential election, explaining that: \\"I dont think that, as an artist, I can make as much of a difference voting as I can the commentaries I make in music\\".[19] Of the album's underlying concept, he said: \\"I thought originally that Say10 was very clever, but it's not as expansive or as defining as Heaven Upside Down. People say, 'Oh, what's Heaven Upside Down?' You decide. It doesn't have to be anything specific.\\"[17]\\r\\nThe concept of Heaven Upside Down was inspired by the death of Manson's father Hugh Warner, who died during the album's production. \\"Saturnalia\\" was the final track composed for the album, and references his death. The track also contains numerous astrological and mythological references, specifically the astrological transit of Saturn, the 2017 US solar eclipse, and the myth of Saturnus devouring his children.[16]\\r\\nOn November 8, 2016 ÿ the day of the US presidential election ÿ the band released a teaser clip of a new music video.[20] Directed by Tyler Shields,[21] it features a scene of Manson tearing pages from Revelation 13 out of a Bible, followed by shots of him brandishing a bloodstained knife and standing over a beheaded man dressed to resemble Donald Trumpin a suit and red tie.[22][23][24] Manson began posting a series of videos on his Instagram account from March 22 onwards, with the first featuring the Celebritarian Cross ÿ a variation on the Cross of Lorraine used by Manson for his Celebritarian Corporation art movement[25] ÿ with the caption: \\"6:19. The time has come.\\"[26] Numerous publications hypothesized whether 6:19 referred to a June 19 release date, a Bible verse, or the lyrics to the Eat Me, Drink Me track \\"If I Was Your Vampire\\".[14][27] A further three clips went on to be posted on Instagram, which all featured the Celebritarian Cross, air-raid sirens, and distant screaming,[28][29] with the latter video also revealing a hooded figure.[30][31]\\r\\nOn May 8, Manson revealed that the album had been renamed Heaven Upside Down, and that its recording had been completed.[32] An article posted by Vice magazine slated a July 9 release date for the album,[33] though this was most likely a mix-up regarding the release date of a four-part HBO series called The Defiant Oneson which Manson was scheduled to appear.[34] The band began their Heaven Upside Down Tour on July 20 in Budapest,[35] during which they debuted several new songs.[36] Manson and Bates' cover of Ministry's 1988 single \\"Stigmata\\" featured on the soundtrack to the Charlize Theron film Atomic Blonde, which was released on July 21.[37][38] \\"We Know Where You Fucking Live\\" was released as the album's lead single on September 11, after it premiered on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show.[39] The music video for the song was posted onto YouTube four days later,[40] and was directed by Bill Yukich and Perou.[41] A music video for \\"Say10\\", also directed by Yukich and featuring Johnny Depp, was released on October 10.[42]\\r\\nThe North American leg of the Heaven Upside Down Tour began on September 27. The tour also incorporates appearances from the band at several music festivals, including the Aftershock Festival on October 22,[43] at which Nine Inch Nails is also scheduled to appear. Manson indicated a possibility of joining the band on-stage there, after he and Trent Reznor mended a longstanding feud.[44] On September 29 at Pittsburgh's Stage AE, Manson injured his ankle after jumping off the stage.[45] The following night at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, Manson was crushed by a large stage prop.[46] He was carried out of the venue on a stretcher to a nearby hospital,[47] and the next nine dates of the tour were subsequently canceled, with these shows expected to be rescheduled for later dates.[48] It was also announced that the band have pulled out of the Aftershock Festival.[49]\\r\\nThe CD version of the album has no spine card; instead the booklet is extra long and laid below the disc tray. The booklet's layout is modeled to look like a Bible and is made of scritta paper, the same thin paper typically used in Bibles.\\r\\nHeaven Upside Down was well received by music critics upon its initial release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74, based on 11 reviews, indicating \\"generally positive reviews\\".[50]\\r\\nEleanor Goodman of Metal Hammer gave the album a positive review, writing that it finds Manson \\"glancing back to the past. Throwbacks to numerous stepping stones in [his] career are given a punk feellike the band have holed up in the Tate house again, or been rehearsing live for weeks to recapture the rawness of the Antichrist Superstar days.?... If The Pale Emperor was banger after low-down banger, and predecessor Born Villain went back to basics, this one sits somewhere in betweenstill bearing Tyler's mark but with a nod to other eras.\\" She went on to call it a \\"solid album that shows [Manson] can still do what he got famous doing: write biting, anti-establishment goth rock full of dark, playful imagery.\\"[1]\\r\\nGreg Kennelty of Metal Injection praised the album's consistency, saying: \\"I'll come right out and say it up top ÿ Heaven Upside Down, as a full album, is by far one of the most engaging listens I've had in 2017. It's an impeccably well-written album that constantly introduces new styles and aspects to its sound throughout, all while revolving around a very disquieting core tonality.\\" He concluded by calling it \\"a damn good album that flows exceptionally well, keeps you interested, and proves that Marilyn Manson absolutely has a place in both rock and metal in 2017. If you're expecting The Pale Emperor 2, then Heaven Upside Down is going to fall short of your expectations. However, if you're expecting a goth-laden Manson album that stands up strong against even his most classic works, then you're going to love this. Expect to see [the album] on some year-end lists, including my own.\\"[55] Neil Z. Yeung also praised the album in the review for AllMusic, writing that it saw Manson \\"at his most human. If The Pale Emperor was a welcome return to form that signaled a new day for the band, its successor is just as satisfying, if not better.\\"[3]\\r\\nIndustry forecasters have predicted that the album is on course to debut within the top ten of the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of between 25,000 to 32,000 copies.[56] It is also predicted to enter the UK Albums Chart at number five.[57]\\r\\nAll lyrics written by Marilyn Manson; all music composed by Tyler Bates.\\r\\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of the vinyl edition of Heaven Upside Down.[59]\\r\\nMarilyn Manson\\r\\nAdditional musicians\\r\\nProduction and design","input":"When is marilyn manson new album being released?"},{"output":"inflammation","context":"Subacromial bursitis is a condition caused by inflammation of the bursa that separates the superior surface of the supraspinatus tendon (one of the four tendons of the rotator cuff) from the overlying coraco-acromial ligament, acromion, coracoid (the acromial arch) and from the deep surface of the deltoid muscle.[1] The subacromial bursa helps the motion of the supraspinatus tendon of the rotator cuff in activities such as overhead work.\\r\\nMusculoskeletal complaints are one of the most common reasons for primary care office visits, and rotator cuff disorders are the most common source of shoulder pain.[2]\\r\\nPrimary inflammation of the subacromial bursa is relatively rare and may arise from autoimmune inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis; crystal deposition disorders such as gout or pseudogout; calcific loose bodies, and infection.[1] More commonly, subacromial bursitis arises as a result of complex factors, thought to cause shoulder impingement symptoms. These factors are broadly classified as intrinsic (intratendinous) or extrinsic (extratendinous). They are further divided into primary or secondary causes of impingement. Secondary causes are thought to be part of another process such as shoulder instability or nerve injury.[3]\\r\\nIn 1983 Neer described three stages of impingement syndrome.[4] He noted that \\"the symptoms and physical signs in all three stages of impingement are almost identical, including the 'impingement sign'..., arc of pain, crepitus, and varying weakness.\\" The Neer classification did not distinguish between partial-thickness and full-thickness rotator cuff tears in stage III.[4] This has led to some controversy about the ability of physical examination tests to accurately diagnose between bursitis, impingement, impingement with or without rotator cuff tear and impingement with partial versus complete tears.\\r\\nIn 2005, Park et al. published their findings which concluded that a combination of clinical tests were more useful than a single physical examination test. For the diagnosis of impingement disease, the best combination of tests were \\"any degree (of) a positive Hawkins-Kennedy test, a positive painful arc sign, and weakness in external rotation with the arm at the side,\\" to diagnose a full thickness rotator cuff tear, the best combination of tests, when all three are positive, were the painful arc, the drop-arm sign, and weakness in external rotation.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSubacromial bursitis often presents with a constellation of symptoms called impingement syndrome. Pain along the front and side of the shoulder is the most common symptom and may cause weakness and stiffness.[3] If the pain resolves and weakness persists other causes should be evaluated such as a tear of the rotator cuff or a neurological problem arising from the neck or entrapment of the suprascapular nerve. The onset of pain may be sudden or gradual and may or may not be related to trauma. Night time pain, especially sleeping on the affected shoulder, is often reported. Localized redness or swelling are less common and suggest an infected subacromial bursa. Individuals affected by subacromial bursitis commonly present with concomitant shoulder problems such as arthritis, rotator cuff tendinitis, rotator cuff tears, and cervical radiculopathy (pinched nerve in neck).\\r\\nImpingement may be brought on by sports activities, such as overhead throwing sports and swimming, or overhead work such as painting, carpentry, or plumbing. Activities that involve repetitive overhead activity, or directly in front, may cause shoulder pain. Direct upward pressure on the shoulder, such as leaning on an elbow, may increase pain.\\r\\nThe literature on the pathophysiology of bursitis describes inflammation as the primary cause of symptoms. Inflammatory bursitis is usually the result of repetitive injury to the bursa. In the subacromial bursa, this generally occurs due to microtrauma to adjacent structures, particularly the supraspinatus tendon. The inflammatory process causes synovial cells to multiply, increasing collagen formation and fluid production within the bursa and reduction in the?outside layer of lubrication?(Ishii et al., 1997).\\r\\nLess frequently observed causes of subacromial bursitis include hemorrhagic conditions, crystal deposition and infection.\\r\\nMany causes have been proposed in the medical literature for subacromial impingement syndrome. The bursa facilitates the motion of the rotator cuff beneath the arch, any disturbance of the relationship of the subacromial structures can lead to impingement. These factors can be broadly classified as intrinsic such as tendon degeneration, rotator cuff muscle weakness and overuse. Extrinsic factors include bone spurs from the acromion or AC joint, shoulder instability and neurologic problems arising outside of the shoulder.[3]\\r\\nIt is often difficult to distinguish between pain caused by bursitis or that caused by a rotator cuff injury as both exhibit similar pain patterns in the front or side of the shoulder (Hartley, 1990). Subacromial bursitis can be painful with resisted abduction due to the pinching of the bursa as the deltoid contracts (Buschbacher & Braddom, 1994). If the therapist performs a treatment direction test and gently applies joint traction or a caudal glide?during abduction (MWM), the painful arc may reduce if the problem is bursitis or adhesive capsulitis (as this potentially increases the subacromial space).\\r\\nThe following clinical tests, if positive, may indicate bursitis:\\r\\nIrritation or entrapment of the lower subscapular nerve, which innervates the subscapularis and teres major muscles, will produce muscle guarding at the shoulder that will restrict motion into external rotation, abduction, or flexion. The aforementioned tests will assist in diagnosing bursitis over other conditions. The diagnosis of impingement syndrome should be viewed with caution in people who are less than forty years old, because such individuals may have subtle glenohumeral instability.[6]\\r\\nX-rays may help visualize bone spurs, acromial anatomy and arthritis. Further, calcification in the subacromial space and rotator cuff may be revealed. Osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint may co-exist and is usually demonstrated on radiographs.\\r\\nMRI imagining can reveal fluid accumulation in the bursa and assess adjacent structures. In chronic cases caused by impingement tendinosis and tears in the rotator cuff may be revealed. At US, an abnormal bursa may show (1) fluid distension, (2) synovial proliferation, and/or (3) thickening of the bursal walls.[7] In any case, the magnitude of pathological findings does not correlate with the magnitude of the symptoms.[7]\\r\\nIn patients with bursitis who have rheumatoid arthritis, short term improvements are not taken as a sign of resolution and may require long term treatment to ensure recurrence is minimized. Joint contracture of the shoulder has also been found to be at a higher incidence in type two diabetics, which may lead to frozen shoulder (Donatelli, 2004).\\r\\nMany non-operative treatments have been advocated, including rest; oral administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; physical therapy; chiropractic; and local modalities such as cryotherapy, ultrasound, electromagnetic radiation, and subacromial injection of corticosteroids.[8]\\r\\nShoulder bursitis rarely requires surgical intervention and generally responds favorably to conservative treatment. Surgery is reserved for patients who fail to respond to non-operative measures. Minimally invasive surgical procedures such as arthroscopic removal of the bursa allows for direct inspection of the shoulder structures and provides the opportunity for removal of bone spurs and repair of any rotator cuff tears that may be found.\\r\\nIn 1997 Morrison et al.[9] published a study that reviewed the cases of 616 patients (636 shoulders) with impingement syndrome (painful arc of motion) to assess the outcome of non-surgical care. An attempt was made to exclude patients who were suspected of having additional shoulder conditions such as, full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff, degenerative arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint, instability of the glenohumeral joint, or adhesive capsulitis. All patients were managed with anti-inflammatory medication and a specific, supervised physical-therapy regimen. The patients were followed up from six months to over six years. They found that 67% (413 patients) of the patients improved, while 28% did not improve and went to surgical treatment. 5% did not improve and declined further treatment.\\r\\nOf the 413 patients who improved, 74 had a recurrence of symptoms during the observation period and their symptoms responded to rest or after resumption of the exercise program.\\r\\nThe Morrison study shows that the outcome of impingement symptoms varies with patient characteristics. Younger patients ( 20 years or less) and patients between 41 and 60 years of age, fared better than those who were in the 21 to 40 years age group. This may be related to the peak incidence of work, job requirements, sports and hobby related activities, that may place greater demands on the shoulder. However, patients who were older than sixty years of age had the \\"poorest results\\". It is known that the rotator cuff and adjacent structures undergo degenerative changes with ageing.\\r\\nThe authors were unable to posit an explanation for the observation of the bimodal distribution of satisfactory results with regard to age. They concluded that it was \\"unclear why (those) who were twenty-one to forty years old had less satisfactory results\\". The poorer outcome for patients over 60 years old was thought to be potentially related to \\"undiagnosed full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff\\".[9]\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nAnderson, D., M, (2000), Dorlands Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 29th ed, W.B.

It serves as the central point for the study of the history of baseball in the United States and beyond, displays baseball-related artifacts and exhibits, and honors those who have excelled in playing, managing, and serving the sport. The Hall's motto is \\"Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word Cooperstown is often used as shorthand (or a metonym) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, similarly to Canton for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hall of Fame was established in 1939 by Stephen Carlton Clark, the owner of a local hotel. Clark had sought to bring tourists to a city hurt by the Great Depression, which reduced the local tourist trade, and Prohibition, which devastated the local hops industry. A new building was constructed, and the Hall of Fame was dedicated on June 12, 1939. (Clark's granddaughter, Jane Forbes Clark, is the current chairman of the Board of Directors.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe erroneous claim that Civil War hero Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn expanded library and research facility opened in 1994.[2] Dale Petroskey became the organization's president in 1999.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, the Hall launched Baseball As America, a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years. The Hall of Fame has since also sponsored educational programming on the Internet to bring the Hall of Fame to schoolchildren who might not visit. The Hall and Museum completed a series of renovations in spring 2005. The Hall of Fame also presents an annual exhibit at FanFest at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game.\\r\\n\\r\\nJeff Idelson replaced Petroskey as president on April 16, 2008.[4] He had been acting as president since March 25, 2008, when Petroskey was forced to resign for having \\"failed to exercise proper fiduciary responsibility\\" and making \\"judgments that were not in the best interest of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong baseball fans, \\"Hall of Fame\\" means not only the museum and facility in Cooperstown, New York, but the pantheon of players, managers, umpires, executives, and pioneers who have been enshrined in the Hall. The first five men elected were Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson, chosen in 1936; roughly 20 more were selected before the entire group was inducted at the Hall's 1939 opening. As of  January?2018[update], 323 people had been elected to the Hall of Fame, including 226 former Major League Baseball players, 35 Negro league baseball players and executives, 22 managers, 10 umpires, and 30 pioneers, executives, and organizers. 114 members of the Hall of Fame have been inducted posthumously, including four who died after their selection was announced. Of the 35 Negro league members, 29 were inducted posthumously, including all 24 selected since the 1990s. The Hall of Fame includes one female member, Effa Manley.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newest members elected on January 24, 2018, are players Chipper Jones, Jim Thome, Vladimir Guerrero, and Trevor Hoffman.[6] They were officially inducted on July 29, 2018, alongside players Jack Morris and Alan Trammell.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers are currently inducted into the Hall of Fame through election by either the Baseball Writers' Association of America (or BBWAA), or the Veterans Committee,[8] which now consists of four subcommittees, each of which considers and votes for candidates from a separate era of baseball. Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election).[9] From a final ballot typically including 25ÿ40 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates. Any player named on 75% or more of all ballots cast is elected. A player who is named on fewer than 5% of ballots is dropped from future elections. In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee.[10] Players receiving 5% or more of the votes but fewer than 75% are reconsidered annually until a maximum of ten years of eligibility (lowered from fifteen years for the 2015 election).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder special circumstances, certain players may be deemed eligible for induction even though they have not met all requirements. Addie Joss was elected in 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may be placed on the ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. Roberto Clemente's induction in 1973 set the precedent when the writers chose to put him up for consideration after his death on New Year's Eve, 1972.\\r\\n\\r\\n Ogden Nash, Sport magazine (January 1949)[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe five-year waiting period was established in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; Joe DiMaggio received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for Joe DiMaggio because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement.\\r\\n\\r\\nContrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for Lou Gehrig (other than to hold a special one-man election for him): there was no waiting period at that time, and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season. However, the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was terminally ill, making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 10 years of his retirement from active play, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following changes to the election process for that body made in 2010 and 2016, it is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballotboth long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives). From 2011 through 2016, each candidate could be considered once every three years;[13]  now, the frequency depends on the era in which an individual made his greatest contributions.[14] A more complete discussion of the new process is available below.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2008 to 2010, following changes made by the Hall in July 2007, the main Veterans Committee, then made up of living Hall of Famers, voted only on players whose careers began in 1943 or later. These changes also established three separate committees to select other figures:\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers of the Negro Leagues have also been considered at various times, beginning in 1971. In 2005 the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro Leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. Following the 2010 changes, Negro Leagues figures were primarily considered for induction alongside other figures from the 1871ÿ1946 era, called the \\"Pre-Integration Era\\" by the Hall; since 2016, Negro Leagues figures are primarily considered alongside other figures from what the Hall calls the \\"Early Baseball\\" era (1871ÿ1949).\\r\\n\\r\\nPredictably, the selection process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players elected years ago remain the subjects of discussions as to whether they deserved election. For example, Bill James' book Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame? goes into detail about who he believes does and does not belong in the Hall of Fame.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actions and composition of the Veterans Committee have been at times controversial, with occasional selections of contemporaries and teammates of the committee members over seemingly more worthy candidates.[16][17][18][19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, the Veterans Committee was reformed to comprise the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees.[21] The revamped Committee held three elections, in 2003 and 2007, for both players and non-players, and in 2005 for players only. No individual was elected in that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members, most of whom were Hall members, were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt noted, \\"The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors.\\"[10] In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first election to be held under the 2007 revisions, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the 2008 election process. The next Veterans Committee elections for players were held in December 2008 as part of the 2009 election process; the main committee did not select a player, while the panel for preÿWorld War II players elected Joe Gordon in its first and ultimately only vote. The main committee voted as part of the election process for inductions in odd-numbered years, while the pre-World War II panel would vote every five years, and the panel for umpires, managers, and executives voted as part of the election process for inductions in even-numbered years.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther changes to the Veterans Committee process were announced by the Hall on July 26, 2010, effective with the 2011 election.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll individuals eligible for induction but not eligible for BBWAA consideration were considered on a single ballot, grouped by the following eras in which they made their greatest contributions:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hall used the BBWAA's Historical Overview Committee to formulate the ballots for each era, consisting of 12 individuals for the Expansion Era and 10 for the other eras. The Hall's board of directors selected a committee of 16 voters for each era, made up of Hall of Famers, executives, baseball historians, and media members. Each committee met and voted at the Baseball Winter Meetings once every three years. The Expansion Era committee held its first vote in 2010 for 2011 induction, with longtime general manager Pat Gillick becoming the first individual elected under the new procedure. The Golden Era committee voted in 2011 for the induction class of 2012, with Ron Santo becoming the first player elected under the new procedure. The Pre-Integration Era committee voted in 2012 for the induction class of 2013, electing three figures. Subsequent elections rotated among the three committees in that order through the 2016 election.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2016, however, the Hall of Fame announced a restructuring of the timeframes to be considered, with a much greater emphasis on modern eras. Four new committees were established:\\r\\n\\r\\nAll committees' ballots now include 10 candidates. At least one committee convenes each December as part of the election process for the following calendar year's induction ceremony. The Early Baseball committee convenes only in years ending in 0 (2020, 2030). The Golden Days committee convenes only in years ending in 0 and 5 (2020, 2025). The remaining two committees convene twice every 5 years. More specifically, the Today's Game and Modern Baseball committees alternate their meetings in that order, skipping years in which either the Early Baseball or Golden Days committee meets. This means that in the next two 5-year cycles, the Today's Game committee (having met in 2016) will meet in 2018, 2021, and 2023, while the Modern Baseball committee (which met in 2017) will meet in 2019, 2022 and 2024.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eligibility criteria for Era Committee consideration differ between players, managers, and executives.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the text on a player's or manager's plaque lists all teams for which the inductee was a member in that specific role, inductees are usually depicted wearing the cap of a specific team, though in a few cases, like umpires, they wear caps without logos. (Executives are not depicted wearing caps.) Additionally, as of 2015, inductee biographies on the Hall's website for all players and managers, and executives who were associated with specific teams, list a \\"primary team\\", which does not necessarily match the cap logo. The Hall selects the logo \\"based on where that player makes his most indelible mark.\\"[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Hall always made the final decision on which logo was shown, until 2001 the Hall deferred to the wishes of players or managers whose careers were linked with multiple teams. Some examples of inductees associated with multiple teams are the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all of the above cases, the \\"primary team\\" is the team for which the inductee spent the largest portion of his career except for Ryan, whose primary team is listed as the Angels despite playing one fewer season for that team than for the Astros.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, the Hall of Fame decided to change the policy on cap logo selection, as a result of rumors that some teams were offering compensation, such as number retirement, money, or organizational jobs, in exchange for the cap designation. (For example, though Wade Boggs denied the claims, some media reports had said that his contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays required him to request depiction in the Hall of Fame as a Devil Ray.)[24] The Hall decided that it would no longer defer to the inductee, though the player's wishes would be considered, when deciding on the logo to appear on the plaque. Newly elected members affected by the change include the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Hall of Fame, approximately 300,000 visitors enter the museum each year,[1] and the running total has surpassed 14 million.[citation needed] These visitors see only a fraction of its 40,000 artifacts, 3 million library items (such as newspaper clippings and photos) and 140,000 baseball cards.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hall has seen a noticeable decrease in attendance in recent years. A 2013 story on ESPN.com about the village of Cooperstown and its relation to the game partially linked the reduced attendance with Cooperstown Dreams Park, a youth baseball complex about 5 miles (8.0?km) away in the town of Hartwick. The 22 fields at Dreams Park currently draw 17,000 players each summer for a week of intensive play; while the complex includes housing for the players, their parents and grandparents must stay elsewhere. According to the story,[31]\\r\\nPrior to Dreams Park, a room might be filled for a week by several sets of tourists. Now, that room will be taken by just one family for the week, and that family may only go into Cooperstown and the Hall of Fame once. While there are other contributing factors (the recession and high gas prices among them), the Hall's attendance has tumbled since Dreams Park opened. The Hall drew 383,000 visitors in 1999. It drew 262,000 last year.\\r\\nA controversy erupted in 1982, when it emerged that some historic items given to the Hall had been sold on the collectibles market. The items had been lent to the Baseball Commissioner's office, gotten mixed up with other property owned by the Commissioner's office and employees of the office, and moved to the garage of Joe Reichler, an assistant to Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who sold the items to resolve his personal financial difficulties. Under pressure from the New York Attorney General, the Commissioner's Office made reparations, but the negative publicity damaged the Hall of Fame's reputation, and made it more difficult for it to solicit donations.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the banning of Pete Rose from MLB, the selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball's permanent suspension list, such as Rose or Shoeless Joe Jackson. Many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nJackson and Rose were both banned from MLB for life for actions related to gambling on their own teamsJackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to lose the 1919 World Series intentionally, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the Cincinnati Reds when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player or manager is directly involved.) Rose later admitted that he bet on the Reds in his 2004 autobiography. Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether these two should remain banned or have their punishment revoked. Writer Bill James, though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared the people who want to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to \\"those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer\\".[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed a law ordering the United States Mint to produce and sell commemorative, non-circulating coins to benefit the private, non-profit Hall.[37][38] The bill, H.R. 2527, was introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Rep. Richard Hanna, a Republican from New York, and passed the House on October 26, 2011.[39] The coins, which depict baseball gloves and balls, are the first concave designs produced by the Mint. The mintage included 50,000 gold coins, 400,000 silver coins, and 750,000 clad (Nickel-Copper) coins. The Mint released them on March 27, 2014, and the gold and silver editions quickly sold out. The Hall receives money from surcharges included in the sale price: a total of $9.5 million if all the coins are sold.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes","input":"Where's the baseball hall of fame located?"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,o){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),i(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),i(l,null,g(o.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(M,[["render",x]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/16.md","filePath":"qapage/16.md"}'),H={name:"qapage/16.md"},W=Object.assign(H,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{D as __pageData,W as default};
