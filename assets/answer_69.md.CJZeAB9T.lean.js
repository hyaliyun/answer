After a failed English attempt to settle Virginia in the 1580s by Walter Raleigh , permanent English settlement began in Virginia with Jamestown , Virginia , in 1607 . The Virginia Company colony was looking for gold but failed and the colonists could barely feed themselves . The famine during the harsh winter of 1609 forced the colonists to eat leather from their clothes and boots and resort to cannibalism . The colony nearly failed until tobacco emerged as a profitable export . It was grown on plantations , using primarily indentured servants for the intensive hand labor involved . After 1662 , the colony turned black slavery into a hereditary racial caste . By 1750 , the primary cultivators of the cash crop were West African slaves . While the plantations thrived because of the high demand for tobacco , most white settlers raised their families on subsistence farms . Warfare with the Virginia Indian nations had been a factor in the 17th century ; after 1700 there was continued conflict with natives east of the Alleghenies , especially in the French and Indian War ( 1754 - 1763 ) , when the tribes were allied with the French .

The Ancien Régime was ruled by the late Valois and Bourbon dynasties . The term is occasionally used to refer to the similar feudal systems of the time elsewhere in Europe . The administrative and social structures of the Ancien Régime were the result of years of state - building , legislative acts ( like the Ordinance of Villers - Cotterêts ) , internal conflicts and civil wars , but they remained and the Valois Dynasty 's attempts at re-establishing control over the scattered political centres of the country were hindered by the Huguenot Wars ( or Wars of Religion ) .

Despite , however , the notion of \`\` absolute monarchy '' ( typified by the king 's right to issue lettres de cachet ) and the efforts by the kings to create a centralized state , Ancien Régime France remained a country of systemic irregularities : administrative ( including taxation ) , legal , judicial , and ecclesiastic divisions and prerogatives frequently overlapped , while the French nobility struggled to maintain their own rights in the matters of local government and justice , and powerful internal conflicts ( like the Fronde ) protested against this centralization ."},{"query":"what channel is nbc in newport news va","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of broadcast television stations serving cities in the U.S. state of Virginia ."},{"query":"when does the next episode of my hero academia air","short_answer":"","abstract":"My Hero Academia ( 僕 の ヒーロー アカデミア , Boku no Hīrō Akademia ) is a Japanese superhero manga series written and illustrated by Kōhei Horikoshi .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands .

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases . In the first phase , the Archidamian War , Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica , while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy . The destruction of Athens ' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war , and Athens surrendered in the following year .

It is measured as the percentage change in quantity demanded for the first good that occurs in response to a percentage change in price of the second good . For example , if , in response to a 10 % increase in the price of fuel , the demand for new cars that are fuel inefficient decreased by 20 % , the cross elasticity of demand would be : − 20 % 10 % = − 2 ( \\\\ displaystyle ( \\\\ frac ( - 20 \\\\ % ) ( 10 \\\\ % ) ) = - 2 ) . A negative cross elasticity denotes two products that are complements , while a positive cross elasticity denotes two substitute products . Assume products A and B are complements , meaning that an increase in the price for A accompanies a decrease in the quantity demanded for B. Therefore , if the price of product B decreases , the demand curve for product A shifts to the right reflecting an increase in A 's demand , resulting in a negative value for the cross elasticity of demand . The exact opposite reasoning holds for substitutes ."},{"query":"when was the british broadcasting corporation (bbc) founded","short_answer":"1 January 1927","abstract":"The British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) is a British public service broadcaster .

Much of this is believed to be due to decreased production of prostaglandins and TXA2 . Aspirin 's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase ( COX ) enzyme . Cyclooxygenase is required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis . Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the COX enzyme . This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs ( such as diclofenac and ibuprofen ) , which are reversible inhibitors . However , other effects of aspirin , such as uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria , and the modulation of signaling through NF - κB , are also being investigated . Some of its effects are like those of salicylic acid , which is not an acetylating agent ."},{"query":"the first legislature in what became the united states was the","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who is the first woman president of india national congress","short_answer":"Pratibha Devisingh Patil","abstract":"Pratibha Devisingh Patil ( pronunciation ( help info ) ) ( born 19 December 1934 ) is an Indian politician who served as the 12th President of India from 2007 to 2012 .

From that point forward , however , as the Athenians ceded the initiative to their newly energized opponents , the tide of the conflict shifted . A massive reinforcing armada from Athens briefly gave the Athenians the upper hand once more , but a disastrous failed assault on a strategic high point and several crippling naval defeats damaged the besiegers ' fighting capacity and morale , and the Athenians were eventually forced to attempt a desperate overland escape from the city they had hoped to conquer .

Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms , businesses and companies , government , and public officials as PIOs and nongovernmental organizations , and nonprofit organizations .

It brought to an end the first phase of the power struggle between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Emperors and has been interpreted as containing within itself the germ of nation - based sovereignty that would one day be confirmed in the Peace of Westphalia ( 1648 ) . In part this was an unforeseen result of strategic maneuvering between the Church and the European sovereigns over political control within their domains . The King was recognised as having the right to invest bishops with secular authority ( \`\` by the lance '' ) in the territories they governed , but not with sacred authority ( \`\` by ring and staff '' ) . The result was that bishops owed allegiance in worldly matters both to the pope and to the king , for they were obliged to affirm the right of the sovereign to call upon them for military support , under his oath of fealty . Previous Holy Roman Emperors had thought it their right , granted by God , to name Church officials within their territories ( such as bishops ) and to confirm the Papal election ( and , at times of extraordinary urgency , actually name popes ) . In fact , the Emperors had been heavily relying on bishops for their secular administration , as they were not hereditary or quasi-hereditary nobility with family interests . A more immediate result of the Investiture struggle identified a proprietary right that adhered to sovereign territory , recognising the right of kings to income from the territory of a vacant diocese and a basis for justifiable taxation . These rights lay outside feudalism , which defined authority in a hierarchy of personal relations , with only a loose relation to territory . The pope emerged as a figure above and out of the direct control of the Holy Roman Emperor ."},{"query":"who's idea was the separation of powers","short_answer":"","abstract":"The separation of powers , often imprecisely and metonymically used interchangeably with the trias politica principle , is a model for the governance of a state .

Its reduced speed coupled with its deceptive delivery is meant to confuse the batter 's timing . It is meant to be thrown the same as a fastball , but farther back in the hand , which makes it release from the hand slower while still retaining the look of a fastball . A changeup is generally thrown to be 8 -- 15 miles per hour slower than a fastball . If thrown correctly , the changeup will confuse the batter because the human eye can not discern that the ball is coming significantly slower until it is around 30 feet from the plate . For example , a batter swinging at the ball as if it were a 90 mph fastball when it is coming in at 75 mph means they are swinging too early to hit the ball well , making the changeup very effective ."},{"query":"battle flag of the army of northern virgina","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Army of Northern Virginia was the primary military force of the Confederate States of America in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War .

These diagrams depict elements as points in the plane , and sets as regions inside closed curves . A Venn diagram consists of multiple overlapping closed curves , usually circles , each representing a set . The points inside a curve labelled S represent elements of the set S , while points outside the boundary represent elements not in the set S. Thus , for example , the set of all elements that are members of both sets S and T , S ∩ T , is represented visually by the area of overlap of the regions S and T. In Venn diagrams the curves are overlapped in every possible way , showing all possible relations between the sets . They are thus a special case of Euler diagrams , which do not necessarily show all relations . Venn diagrams were conceived around 1880 by John Venn . They are used to teach elementary set theory , as well as illustrate simple set relationships in probability , logic , statistics , linguistics and computer science ."},{"query":"does knights of the old republic have achievements","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"what was loess used for in ancient china","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Loess Plateau , also known as the Huangtu Plateau , is a 640,000 km ( 250,000 sq mi ) plateau located around the Wei River valley and the southern half of the Ordos Loop of the Yellow River in central China .

One of the two parties typically holds a majority in the legislature and is usually referred to as the majority or governing party while the other is the minority or opposition party .

In such systems , while chances for third party candidates winning election to major national office are remote , it is possible for groups within the larger parties , or in opposition to one or both of them , to exert influence on the two major parties . In contrast , in the United Kingdom and Australia and in other parliamentary systems and elsewhere , the term two - party system is sometimes used to indicate an arrangement in which two major parties dominate elections but in which there are viable third parties which do win seats in the legislature , and in which the two major parties exert proportionately greater influence than their percentage of votes would suggest ."},{"query":"whos the main character in pretty little liars","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Freeform teen drama Pretty Little Liars is based on the series of young adult novels written by Sara Shepard .

In nature complementarity is the base principle of DNA replication and transcription as it is a property shared between two DNA or RNA sequences , such that when they are aligned antiparallel to each other , the nucleotide bases at each position in the sequences will be complementary , much like looking in the mirror and seeing the reverse of things . This complementary base pairing allows cells to copy information from one generation to another and even find and repair damage to the information stored in the sequences . The degree of complementarity between two nucleic acid strands may vary , from complete complementarity ( each nucleotide is across from its opposite ) to no complementarity ( each nucleotide is not across from its opposite ) and determines the stability of the sequences to be together . Furthermore , various DNA repair functions as well as regulatory functions are based on base pair complementarity . In biotechnology , the principle of base pair complementarity allows the generation of DNA hybrids between RNA and DNA , and opens the door to modern tools such as cDNA libraries . While most complementarity is seen between two separate strings of DNA or RNA , it is also possible for a sequence to have internal complementarity resulting in the sequence binding to itself in a folded configuration ."},{"query":"who was the egyptian god of the nile","short_answer":"Hapi","abstract":"Hapi was the god of the annual flooding of the Nile in ancient Egyptian religion .

These experiments are important because they sparked many more studies on the effects of observational learning . The studies not only give us new data , but this data has practical implications , e.g. how children can be influenced by watching violent media ."},{"query":"who did republican romans depict in veristic sculptural form","short_answer":"","abstract":"Verism is the artistic preference of contemporary everyday subject matter instead of the heroic or legendary in art and literature ; it is a form of realism .

When factor analysis ( a statistical technique ) is applied to personality survey data , some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person . For example , someone described as \`\` conscientious '' is more likely to be described as \`\` always prepared '' rather than \`\` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors . For example , extraversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness , assertiveness , excitement seeking , warmth , activity , and positive emotions ."},{"query":"what is the principal resource extracted in the niger delta","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Niger Delta is the delta of the Niger River sitting directly on the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic Ocean in Nigeria .

One of the most well - known and heavily studied hotspots in the world , the Hawaii plume is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian -- Emperor seamount chain , a chain of volcanoes over 5,800 kilometres ( 3,600 mi ) long . Four of these volcanoes are active , two are dormant , and more than 123 are extinct , many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls . The chain extends from south of the island of Hawai ʻi to the edge of the Aleutian Trench , near the eastern edge of Russia . While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries , the Hawaii hotspot is located far from plate boundaries . The classic hotspot theory , first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson , proposes that a single , fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then , cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate , become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years . According to this theory , the nearly 60 ° bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate . In 2003 , fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory , suggesting that hotspots are mobile , not fixed , and that the 47 - million - year - old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot 's motion rather than the plate 's ."},{"query":"what colour does the church use during the season of christmas","short_answer":"White","abstract":"Liturgical colours are those specific colours used for vestments and hangings within the context of Christian liturgy .
