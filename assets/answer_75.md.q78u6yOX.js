The encoding material sits a top a thicker substrate ( usually polycarbonate ) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer . The encoding pattern follows a continuous , spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track . The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine , and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more , depending on the drive type , disc format , and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc ( inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed ) . Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves . This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material , usually lacquer . The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label , sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself . Unlike the 31⁄2 - inch floppy disk , most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches , fingerprints , and other environmental problems ."},{"query":"elton john and billy joel face to face","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"what adds a phosphate group to adp to form atp","short_answer":"oxidative phosphorylation","abstract":"Phosphorylation allows coupling and addition of a phosphoryl group . This particular biochemistry probably represents the origins of catecholamine overload ( PO ) to a molecule . In biology , phosphorylation and its counterpart , dephosphorylation , are critical for many cellular processes . A large fraction of proteins ( between 1 / 3 to 2 / 3 of the proteome in eukaryotes ) are temporarily phosphorylated , as are many sugars , lipids , and other molecules . Phosphorylation is especially important for protein function as this modification activates ( or deactivates ) almost half of the enzymes , thereby regulating their function . Protein phosphorylation is considered the most abundant post-translational modification in eukaryotes . Phosphorylation can occur on Serine , Threonine and Tyrosine side chains ( often called ' residues ' ) through phosphoester bond formation , on Histidine , Lysine and Arginine through phosphoramidate bonds , and on Aspartic Acid and Glutamic Acid through mixed anhydride linkages . Recent evidence confirms widespread Histidine phosphorylation at both the 1 and 3 N - atoms of the imidazole ring Recent work from 2017 ( preprinted at BioRxiv ) suggests widespread human protein phosphorylation on multiple non-canonical amino acids , including motifs containing phosphorylated histidine , aspartate , glutamate , arginine and lysine in HeLa cell extracts . Due to the chemical lability of these phosphorylated residues , and in marked contrast to Ser , Thr and Tyr phosphorylation , the analysis of phosphorylated Histidine using standard biochemical and mass spectrometric approaches is much more challenging and special procedures and separation techniques are required for their preservation alongside classical Ser , Thr and Tyr phosphorylation ."},{"query":"what is the worst school in the world","short_answer":"","abstract":"This list of school massacres by death toll contains those cases that occurred at kindergartens , schools and universities , as well as their affiliated buildings .

IOLs were conventionally made of an inflexible material ( PMMA ) , although this has largely been superseded by the use of flexible materials . Most IOLs fitted today are fixed monofocal lenses matched to distance vision .

It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system , suppressing the more complex details below the current level . The programmer works with an idealized interface ( usually well defined ) and can add additional levels of functionality that would otherwise be too complex to handle . For an example , a programmer writing code that involves numerical operations may not be interested in the way numbers are represented in the underlying hardware ( e.g. whether they 're 16 bit or 32 bit integers ) , and where those details have been suppressed it can be said that they were abstracted away , leaving simply numbers with which the programmer can work . In addition , a task of sending an email message across continents would be extremely complex if the programmer had to start with a piece of fiber optic cable and basic hardware components . By using layers of complexity that have been created to abstract away the physical cables and network layout , and presenting the programmer with a virtual data channel , this task is manageable ."},{"query":"what type of spatial relationships can be captured by topology","short_answer":"","abstract":"A spatial relation , specifies how some object is located in space in relation to some reference object .

The visual cliff consists of a sheet of Plexiglas that covers a cloth with a high - contrast checkerboard pattern .

In nature complementarity is the base principle of DNA replication and transcription as it is a property shared between two DNA or RNA sequences , such that when they are aligned antiparallel to each other , the nucleotide bases at each position in the sequences will be complementary , much like looking in the mirror and seeing the reverse of things . This complementary base pairing allows cells to copy information from one generation to another and even find and repair damage to the information stored in the sequences . The degree of complementarity between two nucleic acid strands may vary , from complete complementarity ( each nucleotide is across from its opposite ) to no complementarity ( each nucleotide is not across from its opposite ) and determines the stability of the sequences to be together . Furthermore , various DNA repair functions as well as regulatory functions are based on base pair complementarity . In biotechnology , the principle of base pair complementarity allows the generation of DNA hybrids between RNA and DNA , and opens the door to modern tools such as cDNA libraries . While most complementarity is seen between two separate strings of DNA or RNA , it is also possible for a sequence to have internal complementarity resulting in the sequence binding to itself in a folded configuration ."},{"query":"ok go this too shall pass marching band","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"impacts on the sarcophagus around the nuclear reactor at chernobyl","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus or Shelter Object ( Ukrainian : Об'єкт \`\` Укриття '' ) is a massive steel and concrete structure covering the nuclear reactor No. 4 building of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant .

Payroll taxes generally fall into two categories : deductions from an employee 's wages , and taxes paid by the employer based on the employee 's wages . The first kind are taxes that employers are required to withhold from employees ' wages , also known as withholding tax , pay - as - you - earn tax ( PAYE ) , or pay - as - you - go tax ( PAYG ) and often covering advance payment of income tax , social security contributions , and various insurances ( e.g. , unemployment and disability ) . The second kind is a tax that is paid from the employer 's own funds and that is directly related to employing a worker . These can consist of fixed charges or be proportionally linked to an employee 's pay . The charges paid by the employer usually cover the employer 's funding of the social security system , medicare , and other insurance programs . The economic burden of the payroll tax falls almost entirely on the worker , regardless of whether the tax is remitted by the employer or the employee , as the employers ' share of payroll taxes is passed on to employees in the form of lower wages than would otherwise be paid . Because payroll taxes fall exclusively on wages and not on returns to financial or physical investments , payroll taxes may contribute to underinvestment in human capital such as higher education ."},{"query":"where is the femur bone located in your body","short_answer":"is the most proximal ( closest to the hip joint ) bone of the leg","abstract":"The femur ( / ˈfiːmər / , pl . femurs or femora / ˈfɛmərə , ˈfɛmrə / ) or thigh bone , is the most proximal ( closest to the hip joint ) bone of the leg in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping , such as most land mammals , birds , many reptiles such as lizards , and amphibians such as frogs .
