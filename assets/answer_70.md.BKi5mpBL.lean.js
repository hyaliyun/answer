The renal tubule extends from the capsule . The capsule and tubule are connected and are composed of epithelial cells with a lumen . A healthy adult has 0.8 to 1.5 million nephrons in each kidney .

As the fluid from the capsule flows down into the tubule , it is processed by the epithelial cells lining the tubule : water is reabsorbed and substances are exchanged ( some are added , others are removed ) ; first with the interstitial fluid outside the tubules , and then into the plasma in the adjacent peritubular capillaries through the endothelial cells lining that capillary .

The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic ( recurring ) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases : a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat , meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns . The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in the table , with only two : hydrogen and helium . This situation can be explained by modern theories of atomic structure . In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure , this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital . Period 1 elements obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell . The maximum number of electrons that these elements can accommodate is two , both in the 1s orbital .

The ability of an organism or organ to respond to external stimuli is called sensitivity . When a stimulus is applied to a sensory receptor , it normally elicits or influences a reflex via stimulus transduction . These sensory receptors can receive information from outside the body , as in touch receptors found in the skin or light receptors in the eye , as well as from inside the body , as in chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors . An internal stimulus is often the first component of a homeostatic control system . External stimuli are capable of producing systemic responses throughout the body , as in the fight - or - flight response . In order for a stimulus to be detected with high probability , its level must exceed the absolute threshold ; if a signal does reach threshold , the information is transmitted to the central nervous system ( CNS ) , where it is integrated and a decision on how to react is made . Although stimuli commonly cause the body to respond , it is the CNS that finally determines whether a signal causes a reaction or not ."},{"query":"who is the mom on how i meet your mother","short_answer":"","abstract":"How I Met Your Mother ( often abbreviated to HIMYM ) is an American sitcom that originally aired on CBS from September 19 , 2005 to March 31 , 2014 .

The song tells the story of an old woman who swallowed increasingly large animals , each to catch the previously swallowed animal . There are many variations of phrasing in the lyrics , especially for the description of swallowing each animal . The spider and fly are described in each verse , but the other animals are only described when they are introduced starting with the bird . The absurdity stems from the increasingly improbable solutions that only worsen the initial problem and are more likely to cause the woman 's death : the logic of swallowing of even more animals of preposterous sizes without dying , contrasted with the expected , matter - of - fact recounting of her death from swallowing an animal larger than herself , when in fact the swallowing of any animal as a solution was absurd . This song for children appeals to their initial logic that a fly can be swallowed by an old lady . A spider would also be seen as logical and physically possible . As you get to the bird , it slowly becomes clear for the child that it 's part of an imaginary scenario leading to a whole horse being swallowed . The last sentence brings the child back to a rational understanding that the old lady is in fact dead of course as physically this is impossible making place for children 's amusement and laughter ."},{"query":"elvis presley can't help falling in love meaning","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Ca n't Help Falling in Love '' is a pop ballad originally recorded by American singer Elvis Presley and published by Gladys Music , Elvis Presley 's publishing company .

It primarily describes people living in developed countries , but it is also experienced by young people in urban wealthy families in the Global South . The term describes young adults who do not have children , do not live in their own home , or do not have sufficient income to become fully independent . Arnett suggests emerging adulthood is the distinct period between 18 and 25 years of age where adolescents become more independent and explore various life possibilities . Arnett argues that this developmental period can be isolated from adolescence and young adulthood . Emerging adulthood is a new demographic , is contentiously changing , and some believe that twenty - somethings have always struggled with \`\` identity exploration , instability , self - focus , and feeling in - between '' .

Bacterial genomes can range in size anywhere from about 130 kbp to over 14 Mbp . A study that included , but was not limited to , 478 bacterial genomes , concluded that as genome size increases , the number of genes increases at a disproportionately slower rate in eukaryotes than in non-eukaryotes . Thus , the proportion of non-coding DNA goes up with genome size more quickly in non-bacteria than in bacteria . This is consistent with the fact that most eukaryotic nuclear DNA is non-gene coding , while the majority of prokaryotic , viral , and organellar genes are coding . Right now , we have genome sequences from 50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla . Second - generation sequencing has yielded many draft genomes ( close to 90 % of bacterial genomes in GenBank are currently not complete ) ; third - generation sequencing might eventually yield a complete genome in a few hours . The genome sequences reveal much diversity in bacteria . Analysis of over 2000 Escherichia coli genomes reveals an E. coli core genome of about 3100 gene families and a total of about 89,000 different gene families . Genome sequences show that parasitic bacteria have 500 -- 1200 genes , free - living bacteria have 1500 -- 7500 genes , and archaea have 1500 -- 2700 genes . A striking discovery by Cole et al. described massive amounts of gene decay when comparing Leprosy bacillus to ancestral bacteria . Studies have since shown that several bacteria have smaller genome sizes than their ancestors did . Over the years , researchers have proposed several theories to explain the general trend of bacterial genome decay and the relatively small size of bacterial genomes . Compelling evidence indicates that the apparent degradation of bacterial genomes is owed to a deletional bias ."},{"query":"when was the suez canal opened how has it benefited india","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Suez Canal ( Arabic : قناة السويس ‎ ‎ qanāt as - suwēs ) is an artificial sea - level waterway in Egypt , connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea through the Isthmus of Suez .

Rowling have become some of the most widely read works of children 's literature in history , with readers of all ages and in many countries . In April 2011 worldwide sales of Harry Potter books were estimated to be about 450 million copies , . Oddly enough , it has been difficult to accurately determine with any degree of certainty exactly how many languages Harry Potter has been translated into . As best as can be determined ( as of 2017 ) , The Philosopher 's Stone has been officially translated from the original English into 74 other languages , the most recent being , Scots , which was released on 2017 - 11 - 23 . Both Bloomsbury 's and J.K. Rowling 's sites have recently stated that the books have been translated into 79 languages ( their count would now likely be 81 with the subsequent 2017 - 11 - 23 release of Scots and the 2017 - 11 - 25 release of a new Mongolian translation ) ; however , it has been argued that number actually represents the number of authorized translations ( of The Philosopher 's Stone ) plus the original English . The number of authorized translations is not equal to the number of languages because there have been multiple authorized translations into the same language . Specifically , there have been two separate translations into each of : Mandarin Chinese , Mongolian , Portuguese , Romanian , Russian and Turkish ( 6 languages ) . English is often included in the list of translations even though technically it should not be ( indeed , it is why our list here counts up to 75 ) . Thus : 81 − 1 English − 6 double - translations = 74 . It is also worthwhile to emphasize that not all seven books have been translated into these 74 languages ."},{"query":"what can cause flu like symptoms without fever","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of infectious diseases , other than the most common ones , that cause flu - like syndrome ( influenza - like illness ) :"},{"query":"this nb town has a giant axe statue","short_answer":"Nackawic","abstract":"Coordinates : 45 ° 59 ′ 38 '' N 67 ° 13 ′ 59 '' W \uFEFF / \uFEFF 45.994 ° N 67.233 ° W \uFEFF / 45.994 ; - 67.233"},{"query":"what's the difference between a ceo and a c o o","short_answer":"","abstract":"The chief operating officer ( COO ) , also called the chief operations officer , is one of the highest - ranking executive positions in an organization , comprising part of the \`\` C - Suite '' .

Some of these federal programs included the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) , the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) . These programs included support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly as well as new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and changes to the monetary system . Most programs were enacted between 1933 -- 1938 , though some were later . They included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders , most during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the \`\` 3 Rs '' : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 -- 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as an alleged enemy of business and growth and liberals accepting some of it and promising to make it more efficient . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated most presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress from 1939 -- 1964 ."},{"query":"a shape with three sets of parallel sides","short_answer":"","abstract":"A Reuleaux triangle ( ʁœlo ) is a shape formed from the intersection of three circular disks , each having its center on the boundary of the other two .

In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS .

These cuboidal granulosa cells , also known as the granulosa radiata , form more layers throughout the maturation process , and remain attached to the zona pellucida after the ovulation of the Graafian follicle . For fertilization to occur , sperm cells rely on hyaluronidase ( an enzyme found in the acrosome of spermatozoa ) to disperse the corona radiata from the zona pellucida of the secondary ( ovulated ) oocyte , thus permitting entry into the perivitelline space and allowing contact between the sperm cell and the nucleus of the oocyte ."},{"query":"who plays liesl in the sound of music","short_answer":"Charmian Carr","abstract":"Charmian Carr ( born Charmian Anne Farnon ; December 27 , 1942 -- September 17 , 2016 ) was an American actress and singer best known for her role as Liesl , the eldest Von Trapp daughter in the 1965 film version of The Sound of Music ."},{"query":"when was lagos annexed by the colonial masters","short_answer":"6 August 1861","abstract":"Lagos Colony was a British colonial possession centred on the port of Lagos in what is now southern Nigeria .

The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors .

Thus , scenario analysis , which is one of the main forms of projection , does not try to show one exact picture of the future . Instead , it presents several alternative future developments . Consequently , a scope of possible future outcomes is observable . Not only are the outcomes observable , also the development paths leading to the outcomes . In contrast to prognoses , the scenario analysis is not based on extrapolation of the past or the extension of past trends . It does not rely on historical data and does not expect past observations to remain valid in the future . Instead , it tries to consider possible developments and turning points , which may only be connected to the past . In short , several scenarios are fleshed out in a scenario analysis to show possible future outcomes . Each scenario normally combines optimistic , pessimistic , and more and less probable developments . However , all aspects of scenarios should be plausible . Although highly discussed , experience has shown that around three scenarios are most appropriate for further discussion and selection . More scenarios risks making the analysis overly complicated ."},{"query":"where is the florida georgia game played at","short_answer":"Jacksonville , Florida","abstract":"The Florida -- Georgia football rivalry is an American college football rivalry game played annually by the University of Florida Gators and the University of Georgia Bulldogs .

It is also less commonly known as a balanced parliament or a legislature under no overall control . If the legislature is bicameral , and the government is responsible only to the lower house , then \`\` hung parliament '' is used only with respect to that chamber . It is the objective of parliamentary systems for the parliament to be able to form a stable government , preferably one that lasts until the next election . This requires the government to be able to muster up sufficient votes in parliament to pass important legislation , especially the government 's budget . It also needs sufficient votes to defeat votes of no - confidence in the government . If the state of the parliament is such that a majority government can not be formed , the government may be referred to as a \`\` minority government '' . The term hung parliament is used mainly in systems with two parties or two party blocs . Most general elections in such a system will result in one or other party having an absolute majority and thus quickly forming a new government ; a \`\` hung parliament '' is an exception to this pattern , and may by some be considered anomalous or undesirable , and by others ideal as it blocks the dangers of absolute power . One or both main parties may seek to form a coalition government with smaller third parties , or a minority government relying on confidence and supply support from third parties or independents . If these efforts fail , a dissolution of parliament and a fresh election may be the last resort ."},{"query":"when did fresh prince of bel air start","short_answer":"September 10 , 1990","abstract":"Quincy Jones Andy Borowitz Susan Borowitz Kevin Wendle ( Season 1 ) Winifred Hervey ( Seasons 2 -- 3 ) Gary H.

The U.S. involvement in South Vietnam stemmed from 20 long years of political and economic action . These had the common incentive of ending the growing communist domination in Vietnam . At the time , French forces , allies of the U.S. , were backed by America -- President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam . From the spring of 1950 , their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states ( Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia ) . Eventually , U.S. missions were carried out at a more constant rate by sending out increasing number of military assistance from the United States . Their main intent was to restrict the Communist domination that was present in the government of Vietnam as it would soon lead to a chain of neighbouring countries adopting the same . This would have resulted in a change in balance of power throughout Southeast Asia . Essentially , the U.S. saw their major security interests being disturbed due to the rise of the communist expansion and strived to take any measure to end it .

It is based on common language descriptors .

For example , someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as \`\` always prepared '' rather than \`\` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors . For example , extraversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness , assertiveness , excitement seeking , warmth , activity , and positive emotions ."},{"query":"who's got the most home runs in the american league","short_answer":"Trumbo , Mark Mark Trumbo","abstract":"In baseball , a home run is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle all the bases ending at home plate , scoring himself and each runner who was already on base , with no errors by the defensive team on the play .

This means a good 's demand is increased when the price of another good is decreased . Conversely , the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is increased . If goods A and B are complements , an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in ; less of each good will be demanded . A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward ; more of each good will be demanded . Basically this means that since the demand of one good is linked to the demand of another good , if a higher quantity is demanded of one good , a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other , and if a lower quantity is demanded of one good , a lower quantity will be demanded of the other . The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way : if the price of one good rises , so will the price of the other , and vice versa . With substitute goods , however , the price and quantity demanded of one good is related inversely to the price and quantity demanded of a substitute good , meaning that if the price or quantity demanded of one good rises , the price or quantity demanded of its substitute will fall ."},{"query":"when was the last nuclear plant built in the us","short_answer":"September 2017","abstract":"Nuclear power in the United States is provided by 99 commercial reactors with a net capacity of 100,350 megawatts ( MW ) , 65 pressurized water reactors and 34 boiling water reactors .

This means a good 's demand is increased when the price of another good is decreased . Conversely , the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is increased . If goods A and B are complements , an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in ; less of each good will be demanded . A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward ; more of each good will be demanded . Basically this means that since the demand of one good is linked to the demand of another good , if a higher quantity is demanded of one good , a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other , and if a lower quantity is demanded of one good , a lower quantity will be demanded of the other . The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way : if the price of one good rises , so will the price of the other , and vice versa . With substitute goods , however , the price and quantity demanded of one good is related inversely to the price and quantity demanded of a substitute good , meaning that if the price or quantity demanded of one good rises , the price or quantity demanded of its substitute will fall ."},{"query":"when did the us join world war one","short_answer":"April 6 , 1917","abstract":"The American entry into World War I came in April 1917 , after more than two and a half years of efforts by President Woodrow Wilson to keep the United States out of the war .
