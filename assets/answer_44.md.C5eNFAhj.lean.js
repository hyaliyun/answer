Management by objectives is the process of defining specific objectives within an organization that management can convey to organization members , then deciding on how to achieve each objective in sequence . This process allows managers to take work that needs to be done one step at a time to allow for a calm , yet productive work environment . This process also helps organization members to see their accomplishments as they achieve each objective , which reinforces a positive work environment and a sense of achievement . An important part of MBO is the measurement and comparison of an employee 's actual performance with the standards set . Ideally , when employees themselves have been involved with the goal - setting and choosing the course of action to be followed by them , they are more likely to fulfill their responsibilities . According to George S. Odiorne , the system of management by objectives can be described as a process whereby the superior and subordinate jointly identify common goals , define each individual 's major areas of responsibility in terms of the results expected of him or her , and use these measures as guides for operating the unit and assessing the contribution of each of its members ."},{"query":"traditionally a person of low status who worked on the land","short_answer":"Landed gentry","abstract":"Landed gentry or gentry is a largely historical British social class consisting in theory of landowners who could live entirely from rental income , or at least had a country estate .

The membrane potential alters the conformation of the channel proteins , regulating their opening and closing . Cell membranes are generally impermeable to ions , thus they must diffuse through the membrane through transmembrane protein channels . They have a crucial role in excitable cells such as neuronal and muscle tissues , allowing a rapid and co-ordinated depolarization in response to triggering voltage change . Found along the axon and at the synapse , voltage - gated ion channels directionally propagate electrical signals . Voltage - gated ion - channels are usually ion - specific , and channels specific to sodium ( Na ) , potassium ( K ) , calcium ( Ca ) , and chloride ( Cl ) ions have been identified . The opening and closing of the channels are triggered by changing ion concentration , and hence charge gradient , between the sides of the cell membrane ."},{"query":"when was in god we trust put on currency","short_answer":"1957","abstract":"\`\` In God We Trust '' is the official motto of the United States .

Until Moseley 's work , \`\` atomic number '' was merely an element 's place in the periodic table , and was not known to be associated with any measureable physical quantity . Moseley was able to show that the frequencies of certain characteristic X-rays emitted from chemical elements are proportional to the square of a number which was close to the element 's atomic number ; a finding which supported Van den Broek and Bohr 's model of the atom in which the atomic number is the same as the number of positive charges in the nucleus of the atom .

It is the energy associated with the motion and position of an object . The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in an isolated system that is only subject to conservative forces , the mechanical energy is constant . If an object is moved in the opposite direction of a conservative net force , the potential energy will increase and if the speed ( not the velocity ) of the object is changed , the kinetic energy of the object is changed as well . In all real systems , however , nonconservative forces , like frictional forces , will be present , but often they are of negligible values and the mechanical energy 's being constant can therefore be a useful approximation . In elastic collisions , the mechanical energy is conserved but in inelastic collisions , some mechanical energy is converted into heat .

It is measured as the percentage change in quantity demanded for the first good that occurs in response to a percentage change in price of the second good . For example , if , in response to a 10 % increase in the price of fuel , the demand for new cars that are fuel inefficient decreased by 20 % , the cross elasticity of demand would be : − 20 % 10 % = − 2 ( \\\\ displaystyle ( \\\\ frac ( - 20 \\\\ % ) ( 10 \\\\ % ) ) = - 2 ) . A negative cross elasticity denotes two products that are complements , while a positive cross elasticity denotes two substitute products . Assume products A and B are complements , meaning that an increase in the price for A accompanies a decrease in the quantity demanded for B. Therefore , if the price of product B decreases , the demand curve for product A shifts to the right reflecting an increase in A 's demand , resulting in a negative value for the cross elasticity of demand . The exact opposite reasoning holds for substitutes ."},{"query":"little sisters of the poor us supreme court","short_answer":"","abstract":"Zubik v.

A central bank uses OMO as the primary means of implementing monetary policy . The usual aim of open market operations is - aside from supplying commercial banks with liquidity and sometimes taking surplus liquidity from commercial banks - to manipulate the short - term interest rate and the supply of base money in an economy , and thus indirectly control the total money supply , in effect expanding money or contracting the money supply . This involves meeting the demand of base money at the target interest rate by buying and selling government securities , or other financial instruments .

It is the most specialised position in the sport . The goalkeeper 's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from successfully moving the ball over the defended goal - line ( between the posts and under the crossbar ) . This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line . Within the penalty area goalkeepers are able to use their hands , making them ( outside of throw - ins ) the only players on the field permitted to handle the ball . The only time when a goalkeeper is not allowed to use their hands inside their box is when a field player of their own team does a direct pass . The most common way to know that it is a direct pass , and not an indirect pass , is when the field player has control of the ball . Goalkeepers are allowed to pick up the ball during an indirect hit from a teammate ( headers , chest , knee thigh , and when the ball bounces off the player ) . Goalkeepers usually perform goal kicks , and also give commands to their defense during corner kicks , direct and indirect free kicks , and marking . Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch , giving them a unique perspective on play development .

The central question for classical pluralism is how power and influence are distributed in a political process . Groups of individuals try to maximize their interests . Lines of conflict are multiple and shifting as power is a continuous bargaining process between competing groups . There may be inequalities but they tend to be distributed and evened out by the various forms and distributions of resources throughout a population . Any change under this view will be slow and incremental , as groups have different interests and may act as \`\` veto groups '' to destroy legislation . The existence of diverse and competing interests is the basis for a democratic equilibrium , and is crucial for the obtaining of goals by individuals . A polyarchy -- a situation of open competition for electoral support within a significant part of the adult population -- ensures competition of group interests and relative equality . Pluralists stress civil rights , such as freedom of expression and organization , and an electoral system with at least two parties . On the other hand , since the participants in this process constitute only a tiny fraction of the populace , the public acts mainly as bystanders . This is not necessarily undesirable for two reasons : ( 1 ) it may be representative of a population content with the political happenings , or ( 2 ) political issues require continuous and expert attention , which the average citizen may not have ."},{"query":"which would be considered an instrument or method of measuring relative time","short_answer":"","abstract":"Measurement is the assignment of a number to a characteristic of an object or event , which can be compared with other objects or events .
