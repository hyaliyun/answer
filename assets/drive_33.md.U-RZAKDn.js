An example of this would be a sudden thought of causing harm to a loved one which causes the person to worry that they might actually hurt them. To ensure that the contents of the intrusive thought are unrealised, the person may avoid their loved one. Since the intrusive thought is egodystonic, the person is unlikely to actually hurt their loved one, but the person worries that since they are capable of having the thought they may be capable of performing the action (or that the thought signifies some deep truth about their personality). Intrusive thoughts are commonly experienced but are usually dismissed as being unpleasant or silly and are quickly forgotten. However, the shock of the thought can cause a person to focus on it and the compulsive behaviours that the person uses to reduce the distressing obsession can increase the saliency and frequency of the thought."},{"question":"When did John Bowlby live?","answer":"John Bowlby lived from 1907 to 1990."},{"question":"Who is Bowlby?","answer":"John Bowlby is a psychologist known for his work on attachment theory, which emphasizes the importance of early relationships in shaping an individual's emotional and social development."},{"question":"Who developed the notion of self-actualization?","answer":"Abraham Maslow developed the notion of self-actualization."},{"question":"What is self-actualisation","answer":"Self-actualisation refers to the highest level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and involves achieving one's full potential and striving for personal growth."},{"question":"What is the main concept of humanistic therapy?","answer":"The main concept of humanistic therapy is that individuals have an inherent capacity to reach their full potential, and that the therapeutic relationship should be supportive, empathetic, and non-judgmental.

However, both fields are interested in understanding how human behaviour is shaped."},{"question":"Please compare the cognitive development theories of Piaget and Vygotsky.","answer":"Piaget's cognitive development theory suggests that children learn by actively constructing knowledge through their experiences with the environment. This theory proposes that children go through four stages of development, each characterised by a different way of thinking. Vygotsky's cognitive development theory, on the other hand, emphasises the role of social interactions and language in cognitive development. This theory suggests that children learn by actively engaging with others, and that development is shaped by the cultural context in which they exist. While both theories are interested in understanding how cognitive development occurs, Vygotsky's theory places more emphasis on social factors than Piaget's theory."},{"question":"Please compare the theories of sensation and perception.","answer":"Sensation refers to the process of receiving and transmitting information from the environment through the senses, while perception refers to the process of interpreting and making meaning of that information. Theories of sensation focus on the physical aspects of sensing, such as the physiology of the senses and the properties of sensory stimuli. Theories of perception, on the other hand, focus on the cognitive processes involved in interpreting sensory information, such as attention and memory. While both areas are concerned with understanding how humans perceive and interpret their environment, sensation focuses on the physical aspects of this process, while perception focuses on the cognitive aspects."},{"question":"Please compare cognitive psychology and structuralism.","answer":"Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes such as attention, perception, and memory. Structuralism, on the other hand, is an early psychological theory that emphasised the importance of breaking down experience into its basic parts in order to understand it. Structuralism suggested that complex experiences could be understood by analysing the basic elements (such as sensation and perception) that made them up. While both approaches are interested in understanding mental processes, cognitive psychology is more concerned with the active processing of information, while structuralism is more concerned with the passive analysis of experience."},{"question":"Please compare the theories of motivation in psychology.","answer":"There are several theories of motivation in psychology, including Maslow's hierarchy of needs, drive reduction theory, and self-determination theory. Maslow's hierarchy of needs suggests that individuals are motivated by a series of basic needs, such as physiological needs and safety needs, that must be satisfied before pursuing higher-level needs. Drive reduction theory suggests that motivation is driven by the desire to reduce physiological needs, such as hunger and thirst.
