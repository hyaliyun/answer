This term can be used formally or informally . In Western Europe and the Americas , abolitionism is a historical movement in effort to end the African and Indian slave trade and set slaves free . King Charles I of Spain , usually known as Emperor Charles V , was following the example of Louis X of France who abolished slavery within the Kingdom of France in 1315 . He passed a law which would have abolished colonial slavery in 1542 , although this law was not passed in the largest colonial states , and was not enforced . In the late 17th century , the Roman Catholic Church , taking up a plea by Lourenço da Silva de Mendouça , officially condemned the slave trade , which was affirmed vehemently by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839 . The abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century , however , when English and American Quakers began to question the morality of slavery . James Oglethorpe was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery , banning it in the Province of Georgia on humanitarian grounds , and arguing against it in Parliament , and eventually encouraging his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause .

It primarily describes people living in developed countries , but it is also experienced by young people in urban wealthy families in the Global South . The term describes young adults who do not have children , do not live in their own home , or do not have sufficient income to become fully independent . Arnett suggests emerging adulthood is the distinct period between 18 and 25 years of age where adolescents become more independent and explore various life possibilities . Arnett argues that this developmental period can be isolated from adolescence and young adulthood . Emerging adulthood is a new demographic , is contentiously changing , and some believe that twenty - somethings have always struggled with \`\` identity exploration , instability , self - focus , and feeling in - between '' .

Most species whose cells have nuclei ( Eukaryotes ) are diploid , meaning they have two sets of chromosomes -- one set inherited from each parent . However , polyploidy is found in some organisms and is especially common in plants . In addition , polyploidy occurs in some tissues of animals that are otherwise diploid , such as human muscle tissues . This is known as endopolyploidy . Species whose cells do not have nuclei , that is , Prokaryotes , may be polyploid organisms , as seen in the large bacterium Epulopiscium fishelsoni ( 1 ) . Hence ploidy is defined with respect to a cell . Most eukaryotes have diploid somatic cells , but produce haploid gametes ( eggs and sperm ) by meiosis . A monoploid has only one set of chromosomes , and the term is usually only applied to cells or organisms that are normally diploid . Male bees and other Hymenoptera , for example , are monoploid .

Another name for food web is consumer - resource system . Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels : 1 ) the autotrophs , and 2 ) the heterotrophs . To maintain their bodies , grow , develop , and to reproduce , autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances , including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide . These chemical reactions require energy , which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis , although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs . A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere , to mixotrophs ( such as carnivorous plants ) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere , and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter . The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways , such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs . The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange . There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory , carnivory , scavenging and parasitism . Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs , such as sugars , provides energy . Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes , from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods , and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales ."},{"query":"who played peter kays nan in car share","short_answer":"","abstract":"Peter Kay 's Car Share is a British sitcom set around supermarket assistant manager John Redmond ( Peter Kay ) and promotions rep Kayleigh Kitson ( Sian Gibson ) , and their participation in a company car - sharing scheme ."},{"query":"who is the she that gollum refers to","short_answer":"Shelob","abstract":"Shelob is a fictional giant spider from J.R.R.

It is composed of a renal corpuscle and a renal tubule . The renal corpuscle consists of a tuft of capillaries called a glomerulus and an encompassing Bowman 's capsule . The renal tubule extends from the capsule . The capsule and tubule are connected and are composed of epithelial cells with a lumen . A healthy adult has 0.8 to 1.5 million nephrons in each kidney . Blood is filtered as it passes through three layers : the endothelial cells of the capillary wall , its basement membrane , and between the foot processes of the podocytes of the lining of the capsule . The tubule has adjacent peritubular capillaries that run between the descending and ascending portions of the tubule . As the fluid from the capsule flows down into the tubule , it is processed by the epithelial cells lining the tubule : water is reabsorbed and substances are exchanged ( some are added , others are removed ) ; first with the interstitial fluid outside the tubules , and then into the plasma in the adjacent peritubular capillaries through the endothelial cells lining that capillary . This process regulates the volume of body fluid as well as levels of many body substances . At the end of the tubule , the remaining fluid -- urine -- exits : it is composed of water , metabolic waste , and toxins ."},{"query":"who has held the office of chief minister the longest in india","short_answer":"Jyoti Basu","abstract":"4 Sons 4 Daughters"},{"query":"when was you tube launched 1=in 2007 2=in 2005","short_answer":"","abstract":"Billie Paul Piper ( born Leian Paul Piper ; 22 September 1982 ) is an English actress , dancer , and former singer , from Swindon , Wiltshire .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands .

Seawater is slightly basic ( meaning pH > 7 ) , and ocean acidification involves a shift towards pH - neutral conditions rather than a transition to acidic conditions ( pH < 7 ) . An estimated 30 -- 40 % of the carbon dioxide from human activity released into the atmosphere dissolves into oceans , rivers and lakes . To achieve chemical equilibrium , some of it reacts with the water to form carbonic acid .

It is also known as the inheritance of acquired characteristics or soft inheritance . It is inaccurately named after the French biologist Jean - Baptiste Lamarck ( 1744 -- 1829 ) , who incorporated the action of soft inheritance into his evolutionary theories as a supplement to his concept of orthogenesis , a drive towards complexity . The theory is cited in textbooks to contrast with Darwinism . This paints a false picture of the history of biology , as Lamarck did not originate the idea of soft inheritance , which was known from the classical era onwards . It was not the primary focus of Lamarck 's theory of evolution ; further , in On the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) , Charles Darwin supported the idea of \`\` use and disuse inheritance '' , though rejecting other aspects of Lamarck 's theory ."},{"query":"who did twinkle end up with in fire and ice","short_answer":"Kunj","abstract":""},{"query":"a surprise attack on christmas night won this battle for washington and the colonists","short_answer":"","abstract":"George Washington 's crossing of the Delaware River , which occurred on the night of December 25 -- 26 , 1776 , during the American Revolutionary War , was the first move in a surprise attack organized by George Washington against the Hessian forces in Trenton , New Jersey , on the morning of December 26 .

It is measured as the percentage change in quantity demanded for the first good that occurs in response to a percentage change in price of the second good . For example , if , in response to a 10 % increase in the price of fuel , the demand for new cars that are fuel inefficient decreased by 20 % , the cross elasticity of demand would be : cross body − 20 % 10 % = − 2 ( \\\\ displaystyle ( \\\\ frac ( - 20 \\\\ % ) ( 10 \\\\ % ) ) = - 2 ) . A negative cross elasticity denotes two products that are complements , while a positive cross elasticity denotes two substitute products . Assume products A and B are complements , meaning that an increase in the price for A accompanies a decrease in the quantity demanded for B. Therefore , if the price of product B decreases , the demand curve for product A shifts to the right reflecting an increase in A 's demand , resulting in a negative value for the cross elasticity of demand . The exact opposite reasoning holds for substitutes ."},{"query":"when did barney and robin get back together","short_answer":"the eighth season","abstract":"Barnabas \`\` Barney '' Stinson is a fictional character portrayed by Neil Patrick Harris and created by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas for the CBS television series How I Met Your Mother .
