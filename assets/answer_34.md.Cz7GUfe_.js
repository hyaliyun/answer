Photosynthetic prokaryotic organisms that produced O as a waste product lived long before the first build - up of free oxygen in the atmosphere , perhaps as early as 3.5 billion years ago . The oxygen they produced would have been rapidly removed from the atmosphere by weathering of reducing minerals , most notably iron . This \`\` mass rusting '' led to the deposition of iron oxide on the ocean floor , forming banded iron formations . Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the Great Oxygenation Event . This mass oxygenation of the atmosphere resulted in rapid buildup of free oxygen . At current rates of primary production , today 's concentration of oxygen could be produced by photosynthetic organisms in 2,000 years . In the absence of plants , the rate of oxygen production by photosynthesis was slower in the Precambrian , and the concentrations of O attained were less than 10 % of today 's and probably fluctuated greatly ; oxygen may even have disappeared from the atmosphere again around 1.9 billion years ago . These fluctuations in oxygen concentration had little direct effect on life , with mass extinctions not observed until the appearance of complex life around the start of the Cambrian period , 541 million years ago . The presence of O provided life with new opportunities . Aerobic metabolism is more efficient than anaerobic pathways , and the presence of oxygen undoubtedly created new possibilities for life to explore . Since the start of the Cambrian period , atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15 % and 35 % of atmospheric volume . The maximum of 35 % was reached towards the end of the Carboniferous period ( about 300 million years ago ) , a peak which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at that time . Whilst human activities , such as the burning of fossil fuels , affect relative carbon dioxide concentrations , their effect on the much larger concentration of oxygen is less significant ."},{"query":"information about places where loud noise is prohibited","short_answer":"","abstract":"Noise regulation includes statutes or guidelines relating to sound transmission established by national , state or provincial and municipal levels of government .

Much of the literary record of Japanese poetry begins when Japanese poets encountered Chinese poetry during the Tang dynasty ( although the Chinese classic anthology of poetry , Shijing , was well known by the literati of Japan by the 6th century ) . Under the influence of the Chinese poets of this era Japanese began to compose poetry in Chinese kanshi ) ; and , as part of this tradition , poetry in Japan tended to be intimately associated with pictorial painting , partly because of the influence of Chinese arts , and the tradition of the use of ink and brush for both writing and drawing . It took several hundred years to digest the foreign impact and make it an integral part of Japanese culture and to merge this kanshi poetry into a Japanese language literary tradition , and then later to develop the diversity of unique poetic forms of native poetry , such as waka , haikai , and other more Japanese poetic specialties . For example , in the Tale of Genji both kanshi and waka are frequently mentioned . The history of Japanese poetry goes from an early semi-historical / mythological phase , through the early Old Japanese literature inclusions , just before the Nara period , the Nara period itself ( 710 to 794 ) , the Heian period ( 794 to 1185 ) , the Kamakura period ( 1185 to 1333 ) , and so on , up through the poetically important Edo period ( 1603 and 1867 , also known as \`\` Tokugawa '' ) and modern times ; however , the history of poetry often is different than socio - political history ."},{"query":"who was the bill of rights made for","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Bill of Rights is the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution .

By this sacrament Christians believe they are freed from sins committed after Baptism . The sacrament of Penance is considered the normal way to be absolved from mortal sin , by which one would otherwise possibly condemn oneself to Hell . Catholic theology regarding the forgiveness of sins debates whether Christ at the judgment of the individual after their death would allow those with unconfessed mortal sins a chance to repent and save themselves - especially those who had not made plans to confess , or were not mentally ill , coerced , or suicidal ( which the Church has said all would reduces one 's culpability ) . While persons with certain unconfessed mortal sins that were under some form of censure still at their death might not be allowed a Catholic Funeral Mass and burial rites , and while Catholics with unconfessed mortal sins may not receive Communion ( unless in some circumstances , ameliorating factors were present ) , these matters , though related , are not the same as whether an individual with unconfessed serious sins is condemned to Hell ."},{"query":"how many eps is game of thrones season 7","short_answer":"7","abstract":"Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D.B.

The defining characteristic of \`\` common law '' is that it arises as precedent . In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is , a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts , and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts . If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past , the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision ( a principle known as stare decisis ) . If , however , the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases ( called a \`\` matter of first impression '' ) , and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question , judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue ( one party or the other has to win , and on disagreements of law , judges make that decision ) . The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision , and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants . Common law , as the body of law made by judges , stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process , and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch ( the interactions are explained later in this article ) . Stare decisis , the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results , lies at the heart of all common law systems ."},{"query":"how did the great lakes form and what are their names","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"what is deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca)","short_answer":"","abstract":"Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) is an American immigration policy that allows some individuals who were brought to the United States illegally as children to receive a renewable two - year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit in the U.S. Unlike the proposed DREAM Act , DACA does not provide a path to citizenship for recipients .

This boundary is located at approximately 2891 km ( 1796 mi ) depth beneath the Earth 's surface . The boundary is observed via the discontinuity in seismic wave velocities at that depth . This discontinuity is due to the differences between the acoustic impedances of the solid mantle and the molten outer core . P - wave velocities are much slower in the outer core than in the deep mantle while S - waves do not exist at all in the liquid portion of the core . Recent evidence suggests a distinct boundary layer directly above the CMB possibly made of a novel phase of the basic perovskite mineralogy of the deep mantle named post-perovskite . Seismic tomography studies have shown significant irregularities within the boundary zone and appear to be dominated by the African and Pacific large low - shear - velocity provinces ( LLSVPs ) . The ~ 200 km thick layer of the lower mantle directly above the boundary is referred to as the D '' ( \`\` D double - prime '' or \`\` D prime prime '' ) and is sometimes included in discussions regarding the core -- mantle boundary zone . The D '' name originates from the mathematician Keith Bullen 's designations for the Earth 's layers . His system was to label each layer alphabetically , A through G , with the crust as ' A ' and the inner core as ' G ' . In his 1942 publication of his model , the entire lower mantle was the D layer . In 1950 , Bullen found his ' D ' layer to actually be two different layers . The upper part of the D layer , about 1800 km thick , was renamed D ′ ( D prime ) and the lower part ( the bottom 200 km ) was named D '' ."},{"query":"what is the most important meeting of the non aligned movement","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) is a group of countries that are not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc .

The first began during the Jacksonian Era and led to widespread use of imprisonment and rehabilitative labor as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the American Civil War . The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States . These periods of prison construction and reform produced major changes in the structure of prison systems and their missions , the responsibilities of federal and state agencies for administering and supervising them , as well as the legal and political status of prisoners themselves ."},{"query":"who has most hat tricks in la liga","short_answer":"Cristiano Ronaldo","abstract":"Below is the list of players that have scored a hat - trick in a La Liga match since the league 's creation , in 1929 .

When factor analysis ( a statistical technique ) is applied to personality survey data , some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person . For example , someone described as \`\` conscientious '' is more likely to be described as \`\` always prepared '' rather than \`\` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors . For example , extraversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness , assertiveness , excitement seeking , warmth , activity , and positive emotions ."},{"query":"when is the last time a hurricane hit the west coast","short_answer":"1997","abstract":"A California hurricane is a tropical cyclone that affects the state of California .

The central question for classical pluralism is how power and influence are distributed in a political process . Groups of individuals try to maximize their interests . Lines of conflict are multiple and shifting as power is a continuous bargaining process between competing groups . There may be inequalities but they tend to be distributed and evened out by the various forms and distributions of resources throughout a population . Any change under this view will be slow and incremental , as groups have different interests and may act as \`\` veto groups '' to destroy legislation . The existence of diverse and competing interests is the basis for a democratic equilibrium , and is crucial for the obtaining of goals by individuals . A polyarchy -- a situation of open competition for electoral support within a significant part of the adult population -- ensures competition of group interests and relative equality . Pluralists stress civil rights , such as freedom of expression and organization , and an electoral system with at least two parties . On the other hand , since the participants in this process constitute only a tiny fraction of the populace , the public acts mainly as bystanders . This is not necessarily undesirable for two reasons : ( 1 ) it may be representative of a population content with the political happenings , or ( 2 ) political issues require continuous and expert attention , which the average citizen may not have ."},{"query":"where did the power rest under the articles of confederation","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Articles of Confederation , formally the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union , was an agreement among the 13 original states of the United States of America that served as its first constitution .

Management by objectives is the process of defining specific objectives within an organization that management can convey to organization members , then deciding on how to achieve each objective in sequence . This process allows managers to take work that needs to be done one step at a time to allow for a calm , yet productive work environment . This process also helps organization members to see their accomplishments as they achieve each objective , which reinforces a positive work environment and a sense of achievement . An important part of MBO is the measurement and comparison of an employee 's actual performance with the standards set . Ideally , when employees themselves have been involved with the goal - setting and choosing the course of action to be followed by them , they are more likely to fulfill their responsibilities . According to George S. Odiorne , the system of management by objectives can be described as a process whereby the superior and subordinate jointly identify common goals , define each individual 's major areas of responsibility in terms of the results expected of him or her , and use these measures as guides for operating the unit and assessing the contribution of each of its members ."},{"query":"which figure in the pan-african movement organized the first pan-african conference in 1900 apex","short_answer":"Henry Sylvester Williams","abstract":"The First Pan-African Conference was held in London from 23 to 25 July 1900 ( just prior to the Paris Exhibition of 1900 \`\` in order to allow tourists of African descent to attend both events '' ) .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the \`\` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the façade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power princeps senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government that lasted for 300 years is thus called the Principate . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the princeps . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire ."},{"query":"who won the battle at lexington and concord","short_answer":"","abstract":"Strategic American victory"},{"query":"white spider red markings on back - enoplognatha ovata","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"legend of the naga pearls movie actress name","short_answer":"","abstract":"Legend of the Naga Pearls ( Chinese : 鲛 珠 传 ) is a 2017 Chinese fantasy adventure film directed by Yang Lei , starring Darren Wang , Zhang Tianai and Sheng Guansen .

The historical ties between the two countries are long and complex , including conquest , wars , and alliances at various points in history . The Roman era saw both areas , except Scotland and Northern Ireland , conquered by Rome , whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day , and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas ; however , the language barrier remained . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO , the western military alliance led by the United States . In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship , especially on defence and foreign policy issues ; the two countries tend , however , to disagree on a range of other matters , most notably the European Union . The British press relishes the chance to refer to France and Britain as \`\` historic rivals '' or emphasize the perceived ever - lasting competition that still opposes the two countries ."},{"query":"who does carrie end up with in homeland","short_answer":"","abstract":"Carrie Anne Mathison , played by actress Claire Danes , is a fictional character and the protagonist of the American television drama / thriller series Homeland on Showtime , created by Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon .

Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world . The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self - organizing tendencies . The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking . The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception . In the introduction of the vol 126 ( 2016 ) special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception , the authors concluded that \`\` even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists , there is little theoretical coherence . What happened to the Gestalt school that always aspired to provide a unified vision of psychology ? Perhaps there is , in fact , little that holds the classic phenomena of Gestalt psychology together .

Titled ' Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse ' , Hall 's essay offers a theoretical approach of how media messages are produced , disseminated , and interpreted . As an important member of the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies , Hall had a major influence on media studies . His model claims that television and other media audiences are presented with messages that are decoded , or interpreted in different ways depending on an individual 's cultural background , economic standing , and personal experiences . In contrast to other media theories that disempower audiences , Hall proposed that audience members can play an active role in decoding messages as they rely on their own social contexts , and might be capable of changing messages themselves through collective action . In simpler terms , encoding / decoding is the translation of a message that is easily understood . When you decode a message , you extract the meaning of that message in ways that make sense to you . Decoding has both verbal and non-verbal forms of communication : Decoding behavior without using words means observing body language and its associated emotions . For example , some body language signs for when someone is upset , angry , or stressed would be a use of excessive hand / arm movements , red in the face , crying , and even sometimes silence . Sometimes when someone is trying to get a message across to someone , the message can be interpreted differently from person to person . Decoding is all about the understanding of what someone already knows , based on the information given throughout the message being received . Whether there is a large audience or exchanging a message to one person , decoding is the process of obtaining , absorbing , understanding , and sometimes using the information that was given throughout a verbal or non-verbal message ."},{"query":"difference between statement of work and purchase order","short_answer":"","abstract":"A statement of work ( SoW ) is a document routinely employed in the field of project management .

Unlike a direct free kick , a goal may not be scored directly from the kick ; the ball must first come into contact with another player ( from either team ) .

This law was absorbed into the Laws of the Game in 1877 and later adapted to allow indirect free kicks as a result of dangerous play . An indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team when a player infringes certain technical requirements of the laws ( e.g. touching the ball a second time following a restart , or the keeper touching the ball with his hands when a teammate has used his foot to pass it back to the keeper ) . An indirect free kick is also awarded to the opposing team when play is stopped to caution or send - off a player when no specific foul has occurred ( e.g. when play is stopped to caution a player for dissenting the decision of the referee ) .
