The brain can thus be described as being divided into left and right cerebral hemispheres. Each of these hemispheres has an outer layer of grey matter, the cerebral cortex, that is supported by an inner layer of white matter. In eutherian (placental) mammals, the hemispheres are linked by the corpus callosum, a very large bundle of nerve fibers. Smaller commissures, including the anterior commissure, the posterior commissure and the fornix, also join the hemispheres and these are also present in other vertebrates. These commissures transfer information between the two hemispheres to coordinate localized functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three known poles of the cerebral hemispheres: the occipital pole, the frontal pole, and the temporal pole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central sulcus is a prominent fissure which separates the parietal lobe from the frontal lobe and the primary motor cortex from the primary somatosensory cortex.\\r\\n\\r\\nMacroscopically the hemispheres are roughly mirror images of each other, with only subtle differences, such as the Yakovlevian torque seen in the human brain, which is a slight warping of the right side, bringing it just forward of the left side. On a microscopic level, the cytoarchitecture of the cerebral cortex, shows the functions of cells, quantities of neurotransmitter levels and receptor subtypes to be markedly asymmetrical between the hemispheres.[1][2] However, while some of these hemispheric distribution differences are consistent across human beings, or even across some species, many observable distribution differences vary from individual to individual within a given species.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach cerebral hemisphere has an outer layer of cerebral cortex which is of grey matter and in the interior of the cerebral hemispheres is an inner layer or core of white matter known as the centrum semiovale.[3] The interior portion of the hemispheres of the cerebrum includes the lateral ventricles, the basal nuclei, and the white matter.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the upper part of either hemisphere be removed, at a level about 1.25?cm. above the corpus callosum, the central white matter will be exposed as an oval-shaped area, the centrum ovale minus, surrounded by a narrow convoluted margin of gray substance, and studded with numerous minute red dots (puncta vasculosa), produced by the escape of blood from divided bloodvessels.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the remaining portions of the hemispheres be slightly drawn apart a broad band of white substance, the corpus callosum, will be observed, connecting them at the bottom of the longitudinal fissure; the margins of the hemispheres which overlap the corpus callosum are called the labia cerebri.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach labium is part of the cingulate gyrus already described; and the slit-like interval between it and the upper surface of the corpus callosum is termed the callosal sulcus.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the hemispheres be sliced off to a level with the upper surface of the corpus callosum, the white substance of that structure will be seen connecting the two hemispheres.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe large expanse of medullary matter now exposed, surrounded by the convoluted margin of gray substance, is called the centrum ovale majus. The blood supply to the centrum ovale is from the superficial middle cerebral artery.[3] The cortical branches of this artery descend to provide blood to the centrum ovale.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cerebral hemispheres are derived from the telencephalon. They arise five weeks after conception as bilateral invaginations of the walls.\\r\\nThe hemispheres grow round in a C-shape and then back again, pulling all structures internal to the hemispheres (such as the ventricles) with them.\\r\\nThe intraventricular foramina (also called the foramina of Monro) allows communication with the lateral ventricles.\\r\\nThe choroid plexus is formed from ependymal cells and vascular mesenchyme.\\r\\n\\r\\nBroad generalizations are often made in popular psychology about certain functions (e.g. logic, creativity) being lateralized, that is, located in the right or left side of the brain. These claims are often inaccurate, as most brain functions are actually distributed across both hemispheres. Most scientific evidence for asymmetry relates to low-level perceptual functions rather than the higher-level functions popularly discussed (e.g. subconscious processing of grammar, not \\"logical thinking\\" in general).[6][7] In addition to this lateralization of some functions, the low-level representations also tend to represent the contralateral side of the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's Areas (language) where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. These areas frequently correspond to handedness however, meaning the localization of these areas is regularly found on the hemisphere opposite to the dominant hand. Function lateralization such as semantics, prosodic, intonation, accentuation, prosody, etc. has since been called into question and largely been found to have a neuronal basis in both hemispheres.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nPerceptual information is processed in both hemispheres, but is laterally partitioned: information from each side of the body is sent to the opposite hemisphere (visual information is partitioned somewhat differently, but still lateralized). Similarly, motor control signals sent out to the body also come from the hemisphere on the opposite side. Thus, hand preference (which hand someone prefers to use) is also related to hemisphere lateralization.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some aspects, the hemispheres are asymmetrical; the right side is slightly bigger. There are higher levels of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine on the right and higher levels of dopamine on the left.  There is more white matter (longer axons) on the right and more grey matter (cell bodies) on the left.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinear reasoning functions of language such as grammar and word production are often lateralized to the left hemisphere of the brain. In contrast, holistic reasoning functions of language such as intonation and emphasis are often lateralized to the right hemisphere of the brain. Other integrative functions such as intuitive or heuristic arithmetic, binaural sound localization, etc. seem to be more bilaterally controlled.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nInfarcts of the centrum ovale can occur.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a treatment for epilepsy the corpus callosum may be severed to cut the major connection between the hemispheres in a procedure known as a  corpus callosotomy.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hemispherectomy is the removal or disabling of one of the hemispheres of the brain. This is a rare procedure used in some extreme cases of seizures which are unresponsive to other treatments.\\r\\n\\r\\nLateral surface.

Russian team has been partially banned from the 2016 Rio Olympics and might be made subject to a blanket ban from the 2018 Winter Olympics due to a serious doping scandal.[4] On 5 December 2017 the IOC announced that Russia is banned with immediate effect.[5] Certain Russian athletes will be allowed to participate at the Olympics under a neutral flag.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFootball (also known as soccer) is the number one sport in the country.[6][7][8][9] A high proportion of men are interested in it to a certain extent (and many children play it regularly) and women also join men when it comes to the national team. The Russian league has a fairly high degree of competitiveness. Many notable talented foreign players have been and are playing in the Russian league as well as local talented players worthy of a spot in the starting eleven of the best clubs.[10][11][12]\\r\\nRussia was awarded the FIFA World Cup 2018 on 2 December 2010.

Russia is amongst the most successful and dominant country of the sport,[citation needed] along with Brazil, Spain and Portugal.\\r\\nThe Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is mostly made up of Russian teams and is widely considered the second best league in the world. Russian teams have won every KHL championship.\\r\\nRussia has won the World Championships several times:\\r\\nThe Russian women's national volleyball team is ranked number 6 in the FIVB World Rankings.\\r\\nRecord for achievements of the Russian women's volleyball team:\\r\\nThe Russian volleyball junior team continue to excel, in the FIVB men ranking for junior and youth, Russia is placed first the men.\\r\\nOne traditionally popular sport is bandy (informally called \\"Russian hockey\\"). It's considered a national sport,[16] and is one of the biggest spectator sports.[17] According to one survey, it is the third most popular sport in Russia.[18] Most of the modern rules were written in England by Charles Goodman Tebbutt, but the Russians claim to be the inventors of the game, and indeed there were bandy-like games played in Russia before the modern rules were standardized. When Federation of International Bandy was founded in 1955, by the Soviet Union and three Nordic countries, a common set of rules were agreed upon. Mostly the English ruled prevailed. However, one important exception was the boards from the Soviet rules.\\r\\nThe Soviet national team won all the Bandy World Championships from the start 1957 until 1979. Russia is almost always one of the two best and has never missed out on a medal. The attendance has decreased in the last few years. It's still one of the biggest spectator sports though. After 10 rounds of the 2011ÿ2012 Russian Bandy League the average attendance was 3,887.[19] The club with biggest public support is HC Kuzbass from Kemerovo. About 26,000 watched the opening game against Dynamo Moscow. Yenisey is the current (2015) champion of the domestic league.\\r\\nThe national team for women took the silver medal in the six first World Championships. In the 2014 WCS, the first gold medal came.\\r\\nBandy is the only sport to enjoy the patronage of the Russian Orthodox Church since they're very interested in strengthening their national traditions.[20]\\r\\nBandy is a team winter sport played on ice, in which skaters use sticks to direct a ball into the opposing team's goal. The rules of the game have many similarities to those of association football. The game is played on a rectangle of ice, the same size as a football field. Each team has eleven players, one of whom is the goalkeeper. A standard bandy match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. The offside rule is also similar to that observed in football.\\r\\nBiathlon is the most popular winter sport in Russia and ranking 1st in overall polls and TV viewership for the winter seasons. Russia has had many successful biathletes and has won Olympic and World medals.

From 1897ÿpresent, official Russian national championships in figure skating were held. The first national champion of Russia in figure skating was Alexandr Nikitich Panshin, who won the Russian nationals from 1897 to 1900.\\r\\nBetween 1924 and 1990 Russian national championships in figure skating were not held.

Domestic matches are covered in the local media, and the intra-city derby match between sides Krasny Yar and Enisei-STM can attract large crowds.\\r\\nRugby football in the Russian Empire pre-dated the Russian Revolution by a number of years, but it was only played sporadically. It appears to have been the first (non-indigenous) football code to be played in Russia, around a decade before the introduction of association football.[23] Mr Hopper, a Scotsman, who worked in Moscow arranged a match in the 1880s; the first football match was in 1892.[23] In 1886, however, the Russian police clamped down on rugby because they considered it \\"brutal, and liable to incite demonstrations and riots\\"[23] Condemnation by the tsar's police probably deterred many people from playing, and records of rugby over the next thirty years are sparse.\\r\\nRussia qualified and competed in the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand as Europe 2 after finishing second in the 2008ÿ10 ENC. This was the team's debut in the tournament, where they faced Australia, Ireland, Italy and the United States in Group C of the tournament.

In 2015 May, the ANZAC Day Cup was played for the first time in Saint Petersburg at the Kolomyagi Stadium. The visiting team representing Moscow was the Lazy Koalas. The result was very lopsided, but the fact that a formal game was played outside Australia at all for such an insignificant sport was considered a success. Scores: Lazy Koalas (Moscow) 921 defeated Saint Petersburg 13 with the game called off at halftime due to a mercy rule taking effect. In 2016 Russian national team took part in AFL Europe Cup in Lisbon\\r\\nSince the end of the Soviet era, tennis has grown in popularity and Russia has produced a number of famous tennis players.

The three-person crew stayed aboard the station for 136 days, from November 2000 to March 2001. It was the beginning of an uninterrupted human presence on the station which continues as of November 2017. Expedition 2, which also had three crew members, immediately followed Expedition 1.\\r\\nThe official start of the expedition occurred when the crew docked to the station on 2 November 2000, aboard the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TM-31, which had launched two days earlier.[2] During their mission, the Expedition 1 crew activated various systems on board the station, unpacked equipment that had been delivered, and hosted three visiting Space Shuttle crews and two unmanned Russian Progress resupply vehicles. The crew was very busy throughout the mission,[4] which was declared a success.\\r\\nThe three visiting Space Shuttles brought equipment, supplies, and key components of the space station. The first of these, STS-97, docked in early December 2000, and brought the first pair of large U.S. photovoltaic arrays, which increased the station's power capabilities fivefold.[NASA 4] The second visiting shuttle mission was STS-98, which was docked in mid-February 2001, delivered the US$1.4?billion research module Destiny, which increased the mass of the station beyond that of Mir for the first time.[NASA 5] Mid-March 2001 saw the final shuttle visit of the expedition, STS-102, whose main purpose was to exchange the Expedition 1 crew with the next three-person long-duration crew, Expedition 2.[NASA 6] The expedition ended when Discovery undocked from the station on 18 March 2001.\\r\\nThe Expedition 1 crew consisted of an American commander and two Russians. The commander, Bill Shepherd, had been in space three times before, all on shuttle missions which lasted at most a week. The Russians, Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei K. Krikalev, both had previous long-duration spaceflights on Mir, with Krikalev having spent over a full year in space.[NASA 7][NASA 8][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commander, Bill Shepherd, was a former Navy SEAL, whose only spaceflights were on shuttle missions, and at the beginning of the mission his total time in space was about two weeks.[NASA 9] Questions had been raised by the Russian space agency about the choice of Shepherd as mission commander due to his lack of experience.[5] Flight engineer Sergei Krikalev had spent over a year in orbit, mostly on Mir, and would become the first person to visit the ISS twice.[NASA 10] He had felt excitement to have been one of the first people to enter the Zarya module (the first component of the space station) in 1998, during STS-88, and was looking forward to returning.[NASA 11] Yuri Gidzenko was designated commander and pilot of the two-day Soyuz mission to the station, had one previous spaceflight, which was a 180-day stay aboard Mir.[NASA 7]\\r\\nShepherd was only the second U.S. astronaut to be launched in a Russian spacecraft, the first being Norman Thagard, who launched on Soyuz TM-21 to visit Mir in 1995.[NASA 12] Shepherd expected one of the biggest challenges for the ISS would be the compatibility of technologies, such as that between Russian and U.S. technologies.[NASA 13]\\r\\nThe first component of the space station was the Zarya module, which was launched unmanned in November 1998.[NASA 14] Following this launch, and prior to Expedition 1, there were five manned Space Shuttle flights and two unmanned Russian flights to the ISS.[NASA 15] Some of these flights delivered large modules, such as the pressurized Unity and Zvezda modules, and the first piece of the Integrated Truss Structure. The manned flights were used for partial assembly of the ISS, as well as to start unpacking the supplies and equipment that were being delivered.[5] Prior to Expedition 1, Krikalev expected the ISS to be very similar to his experience on Mir ten years previous, due to the physical similarities of the stations' components.[NASA 11]\\r\\nThe launch of the Expedition 1 crew occurred a week before the United States presidential election, so it got little attention in the United States.[6] At the time of the mission, the station was expected to be completed in 2006, and be continuously inhabited until at least 2015.[7] Due to several delays, including the fallout from the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, the station was completed in late 2011, thanks to STS-134.[NASA 16]\\r\\nThe crew of three were on board the International Space Station for four and a half months, from early November 2000 to mid-March 2001. Major events during this time include the three-week-long Space Shuttle visits, which occurred in early December, mid-February, and at the end of the expedition in March.\\r\\nThe three-member Expedition 1 crew successfully launched on 31 October 2000, at 07:52 UTC, atop a Soyuz-U rocket on Soyuz TM-31 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan; they used launch pad Gagarin's Start, from which the first human to fly in space, Yuri Gagarin, was launched in 1961.[8][9][NASA 12] After 33 orbits of the Earth, and a series of rendezvous maneuvers performed by Gidzenko, they docked the Soyuz capsule to the aft port of the Zvezda Service Module on 2 November 2000, at 09:21 UTC.[5] Ninety minutes after docking, Shepherd opened the hatch to Zvezda and the crew members entered the complex.\\r\\nAlpha\\r\\nAt the end of the first day on the station, Shepherd requested the use of the radio call sign \\"Alpha\\", which he and Krikalev preferred it to the more cumbersome \\"International Space Station\\".[5] The name \\"Alpha\\" had previously been used for the station in the early 90's,[10] and following the request, its use was authorized for the whole of Expedition 1.[11] Shepherd had been advocating the use of a new name to project managers for some time. Referencing a naval tradition in a pre-launch news conference he had said: \\"For thousands of years, humans have been going to sea in ships. People have designed and built these vessels, launched them with a good feeling that a name will bring good fortune to the crew and success to their voyage.\\"[12] Yuri Semenov, the President of Russian Space Corporation Energia at the time, disapproved of the name \\"Alpha\\"; he felt that Mir was the first space station, and so he would have preferred the names \\"Beta\\" or \\"Mir 2\\" for the ISS.[11][13][14]\\r\\nIn their first weeks on board, the Expedition 1 crew members activated critical life support systems and computer control, as well as unpacked supplies left behind for them by previous supply missions. At this time the station did not have enough electricity to heat all three pressurized modules, so Unity was left unused and unheated.[15] Unity had been used for the past two years to allow U.S. flight controllers to command ISS systems and read station system data.\\r\\nThe Russian unmanned resupply spacecraft Progress M1-4 docked to the station on 18 November. The Progress spacecraft's automatic docking system failed, necessitating a manual docking controlled by Gidzenko using the TORU docking system.[16] Although manual dockings are routine, they have caused some concern among flight controllers since an attempt in 1997 which resulted in the spacecraft colliding with Mir, causing significant damage.[17]\\r\\nThe astronauts had a heavy workload in the first month, as Shepherd told reporters in a space-to-ground interview: \\"To me, the biggest challenge is trying to pack 30 hours into an 18-hour work day.\\"[18] Some of the early tasks took longer than scheduled. For example, the activation of a food warmer in Zvezda's galley was scheduled for 30 minutes, but it took the astronauts a day and a half to turn it on.[19]\\r\\nEndeavour docked with the ISS on 2 December 2000, on mission STS-97, bringing four more Americans and a Canadian temporarily to the station. The shuttle also brought the first pair of U.S. provided photovoltaic arrays, which would provide crucial electricity for further development of the station. In total, STS-97 brought 17?tons of equipment to the ISS, which also included expandable metal girders, batteries, electronics and cooling equipment.[7]\\r\\nThree spacewalks were conducted by the crew of STS-97, all of which were completed prior to opening the hatch between shuttle and station. On 8 December, the hatch between the two was opened and the two crews greeted each other for the first time. It had remained closed to maintain their respective atmospheric pressures.[NASA 17] The Expedition 1 crew took this opportunity to leave the station and tour the inside of the space shuttle, which was thought to be good for their psychological well-being.[15]\\r\\nProgress M1-4\\r\\nPrior to Endeavour docking, the Russian resupply spacecraft Progress M1-4, which came to the station in mid-November, was undocked to make room for the space shuttle.[20] This Progress spacecraft remained undocked for the duration of STS-97, parked in orbit about a mile away from the station. It docked manually again with the station on 26 December by Gidzenko, after Endeavour left. The automatic docking system for this Progress spacecraft had failed on the first docking in November.[NASA 18] The crew spent much of the following week unloading the Progress spacecraft.[NASA 19]\\r\\nChristmas and New Year\\r\\nOn Christmas Day, the Expedition 1 crew were given the day off work. They opened presents delivered by Endeavour and the Progress supply ship.[21] They also each took turns speaking to their families. In the following days they did several video downlinks, some with Russian TV stations.[NASA 18] The crew had a quiet New Year. Citing a Naval tradition, for the New Year's entry of the station's log, Shepherd provided a poem on behalf of the crew.[NASA 20]\\r\\nOn 9 February 2001, Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to the ISS, bringing the five American crew members of STS-98 temporarily to the station. The mission was originally planned for mid-January, but was delayed due to NASA's concerns about some cables on the shuttles.[22] This mission brought the U.S. built Destiny laboratory, which has a mass of 16 short tons. It was installed with the use of the shuttle's robotic Canadarm, controlled by Marsha Ivins. Astronauts Thomas D. Jones and Robert L. Curbeam helped with the installation during a spacewalk. The Destiny module had a cost of US$1.4?billion, and would be used primarily for scientific research.[NASA 21][23] During the spacewalk an ammonia coolant leak created a contamination scare, which happened when Curbeam was hooking up coolant lines to Destiny.[24] The other two spacewalks went ahead without any problems. While the Shuttle was docked, the control of the station's orientation was switched from propellants to electrically powered gyroscopes, which had been installed in September 2000. The gyroscopes had not been used earlier due to the lack of key navigational electronics.[NASA 22]\\r\\nBy the end of STS-98, the crew of Expedition 1 had been on the station for over three months, and Shepherd stated that he was \\"ready to come home\\".[25] NASA used several techniques to prevent the three crew members from suffering the effects of the \\"three-month wall\\" psychological barrier, which had caused depression in previous astronauts. For example, they allowed more time for the crew to speak to their families via videophone, and they also encouraged them to watch movies and listen to music they like.[15]\\r\\nProgress M-44\\r\\nOn 28 February the third Progress spacecraft to visit the ISS, Progress M-44, docked to the Zvezda module. It brought air, food, rocket fuel and other equipment.[26] It remained docked until Expedition 2, when it was intentionally burnt up during atmospheric reentry, like all Progress spacecraft.\\r\\nSpace Shuttle Discovery docked on 10 March 2001, bringing to the ISS the new long-duration three-person crew of Expedition 2, as well as four short-term crew members of STS-102. A few hours after docking, the hatch opened, and all ten astronauts greeted each other, setting a new record for the number people simultaneously in the ISS.[NASA 23] The day after docking, American astronauts Jim Voss and Susan Helms began a spacewalk which ended up being nearly nine hours long, and still holds the record for the longest spacewalk ever performed, as of August 2010. The length of the spacewalk was partially due to some mistakes, including Voss accidentally releasing a small tool. Unable to retrieve it, NASA engineers tracked the tool, and decided to use Discovery's thrusters on 14 March to boost the station four kilometers higher, to ensure the ISS would not collide with the piece of space debris.[27]\\r\\nTransferring expedition crews\\r\\nBy 14 March, the expedition crews had completed the change over, but until the shuttle undocked, Shepherd officially remained commander of the station.[28] The morning of the 14th the astronauts' wake-up call was the song \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go\\" by The Clash, at the request of Shepherd's wife.[27] Shepherd, a former Navy SEAL, said during the change over ceremony: \\"May the good will, spirit and sense of mission we had enjoyed on board endure. Sail her well.\\"[29] The commander of Discovery, Jim Wetherbee, said \\"\\"For Captain Shepherd and his crew, we hold you in admiration as we prepare to bring you home. This has been an arduous duty for you. This ship was not built in a safe harbor. It was built on the high seas.\\"[29]\\r\\nThe crew's four and a half-month tour aboard the ISS officially ended on 18 March 2001, when Discovery undocked. The Expedition 1 crew returned home to Earth on STS-102, landing on 21 March 2001, on a rare night landing at 2:30?am local time.[30] Two days after the landing, coincidentally, Mir was intentionally burned up during atmospheric reentry, ending its 15 years in orbit.\\r\\nIn a typical day, each crew member divided his time between physical exercise, station assembly and maintenance, experiments, communications with ground personnel, personal time, and bio-needs activities (such as rest and eating).[31] The crew's daily schedule usually operated on UTC; for example, a typical morning had been scheduled to begin with an electronic wake-up tone at about 05:00 UTC.[NASA 12] But during the expedition, a more typical wake-up time was actually between 06:00 and 07:00 UTC.[NASA 18][NASA 24] The crew's sleep habits were sometimes shifted to accommodate the schedules of visiting shuttles or resupply vehicles.[NASA 25]\\r\\nFollowing the wake-up call, the crew was given some time to clean up, have breakfast, and read e-mail which had been uplinked to them from flight controllers.[NASA 12] Their work day included a lunch break at midday (UTC), and ended with a mid-afternoon planning session with flight controllers, regarding the next day's activities.[NASA 12][19] Most days ended with some entertainment, with the crew watching all or part of a movie; this was thought to be good for crew bonding as well as their psychological well-being.[15] After watching 2010, the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey, Shepherd commented, \\"[There is] something strange about watching a movie about a space expedition when you're actually on a space expedition\\".[NASA 24]\\r\\nAn important part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March.[NASA 18][NASA 26] The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.[NASA 26]\\r\\nUntil the Unity module was available for use a month into the mission, the astronauts used the Russian VHF communications gear (also called the \\"Regul radio link\\") in Zvezda and the Zarya module to communicate with the Russian Mission Control Center (known as \\"TsUP\\") in Korolev, outside Moscow.[5][32][33] The Russian technology didn't have the use of satellites, so they were restricted to ground passes (called a \\"comm pass\\") which lasted for only 10ÿ20 minutes. With the arrival of the solar arrays on STS-97, they activated the S-band Early Communication gear in the Unity Module, allowing for more continuous communication with Mission Control in Houston via NASA's network of Tracking and Data Relay Satellites.\\r\\nDuring STS-106 in September 2000, the equipment for a ham radio was delivered to the station. The first 'ham' contact with the ground by the Expedition 1 crew was on 13 November 2000 on a pass over Moscow, shortly followed by contact with Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.[NASA 27][34] The crew reported that \\"Voice quality of ham radio continues to be well above any of our other links.\\"[NASA 27]\\r\\nThe Amateur Radio on the International Space Station project had the crew of the station to make brief windows to radio contact with schools and clubs on the ground. The first school to be contacted by the ISS was Luther Burbank School in southwest Chicago. The contact had been planned for 19 December 2000, but due to technical problems, it was delayed to 21 December 2000.[NASA 28] Due to the speed of the space station, the window of radio contact only lasted for 5ÿ10 minutes, which was usually enough for 10 to 20 questions.[NASA 29]\\r\\nUnlike subsequent expeditions, the crew of Expedition 1 had a somewhat modest amount of science experiments to conduct, due to the priority placed on station construction.[NASA 12] The plasma crystal experiment, known as PKE-Nefedov, was one of the first natural science experiments conducted on the space station. It was a collaboration between the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany, and the Institute for High Energy Densities (part of the Russian Academy of Sciences).[35][36]\\r\\nLike previous missions, the astronauts took many photos of Earth from the station, over 700 in total, which have been made freely available.[NASA 30] These Crew Earth Observations, are intended to record dynamic events on the Earth's surface such as storms, fires, or volcanoes.[NASA 31] For example, a photo from 1 January 2001 shows Mount Cleveland, Alaska, with a plume of smoke, prior to its eruption the following month.[NASA 32] On 23 January 2001, the crew observed a unique perspective of a plume of volcanic ash coming from Popocatpetl, an active volcano 70 kilometres southeast of Mexico City.[NASA 33]\\r\\nAn example of a low-maintenance experiment was the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions.[NASA 34] The goal was to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted.[NASA 34] Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, which resulted in a more accurate protein structure model.[NASA 34]\\r\\nAnother research activity was measuring the crew's heart rates and the station's carbon dioxide levels to determine the effect of exercise on the station.[NASA 12]\\r\\nThroughout the mission the Expedition 1 crew filmed footage for use in the IMAX documentary film, Space Station 3D.[37] Highlights of the footage include the first entry into the Destiny module, during STS-98; the Expedition 1 crew showering and shaving in zero gravity; and the docking of STS-102, followed by the change over to the Expedition 2 crew.[37]\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.","input":"When did humans first occupy the international space station?"},{"output":"Catholic Bible","context":"The Catholic Bible is the Bible comprising the whole 73-book canon recognized by the Catholic Church, including the deuterocanonical books.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catholic Bible is composed of the 46 books of the Old Testament and the 27 books of the New Testament.\\r\\nOf these books, Tobit, Judith, 1 and 2 Maccabees, Wisdom, Sirach, Baruch, parts of Esther and parts of Daniel are deuterocanonical, and are found in the Bibles of Eastern Christianity. These books are usually not found in the Protestant Bible, but are sometimes included in a separate inter-testamental section called the \\"Apocrypha\\".\\r\\nIn another sense, a \\"Catholic Bible\\" is a Bible published in accordance with the prescriptions of Catholic canon law, which states:\\r\\nBooks of the sacred scriptures cannot be published unless the Apostolic See or the conference of bishops has approved them. For the publication of their translations into the vernacular, it is also required that they be approved by the same authority and provided with necessary and sufficient annotations.\\r\\nWith the permission of the Conference of Bishops, Catholic members of the Christian faithful in collaboration with separated brothers and sisters can prepare and publish translations of the sacred scriptures provided with appropriate annotations.[1]\\r\\nWithout diminishing the authority of the texts of the books of Scripture in the original languages, the Council of Trent declared the Vulgate the official translation of the Bible for the Latin Church, but did not forbid the making of translations directly from the original languages.[2][3] Before the middle of the 20th century, Catholic translations were often made from that text rather than from the original languages. Thus Ronald Knox, the author of what has been called the Knox Bible, wrote: \\"When I talk about translating the Bible, I mean translating the Vulgate.\\"[4] Today, the version of the Bible that is used in official documents in Latin is the Nova Vulgata, a revision of the Vulgate that among other changes makes it conform more closely to manuscripts in the original languages.\\r\\nThis does not mean keeping to any particular edition in the original language. Thus, in translating the Hebrew Bible, evidence from Qumran manuscripts and ancient versions in Greek, Aramaic or Syriac is sometimes used to adjust the Masoretic Text. The aim is to get as close as possible to what \\"was written by the inspired author himself and has more authority and greater weight than any, even the very best, translation whether ancient or modern\\".[5]\\r\\nThe principles expounded in Pope Pius XII's encyclical Divino afflante Spiritu regarding exegesis or interpretation, as in commentaries on the Bible, apply also to the preparation of a translation. These include the need for familiarity with the original languages and other cognate languages, the study of ancient codices and even papyrus fragments of the text and the application to them of textual criticism, \\"to insure that the sacred text be restored as perfectly as possible, be purified from the corruptions due to the carelessness of the copyists and be freed, as far as may be done, from glosses and omissions, from the interchange and repetition of words and from all other kinds of mistakes, which are wont to make their way gradually into writings handed down through many centuries\\".[6]\\r\\nThe following are English versions of the Bible that correspond to this description:\\r\\n1The New Testament was published in 1582, the Old Testament in two volumes, one in 1609, the other in 1610.\\r\\n2Released in parts between 1913ÿ1935 with copious study and textual notes. The New Testament with condensed notes was released in 1936 as one volume.\\r\\n3NT released in 1941. The OT contained material from the Challoner Revision until the entire OT was completed in 1969. This Old Testament became the basis for the 1970 NAB\\r\\n4New Testament only; Gospels by James Kleist, rest by Joseph Lilly.\\r\\n5Also known as the \\"Today's English Version\\"\\r\\n6The Jerusalem Bible except for the Book of Psalms, which is replaced by the Grail Psalms, and with the word \\"Yahweh\\" altered to \\"the Lord\\", as directed by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments for Bibles intended to be used in the liturgy.[11]\\r\\nIn addition to the above Catholic English Bibles, all of which have an imprimatur granted by a Catholic bishop, the authors of the Catholic Public Domain Version[12] of 2009 and the 2013 translation from the Septuagint by Jesuit priest Nicholas King[13] refer to them as Catholic Bibles. These versions have not been granted an imprimatur, but do include the Catholic biblical canon of 73 books.\\r\\nLectionaries for use in the liturgy differ somewhat in text from the Bible versions on which they are based. Many liturgies, including the Roman, omit some verses in the biblical readings that they use.[14] This sometimes necessitates grammatical alterations or the identification of a person or persons referred to in a remaining verse only by a pronoun, such as \\"he\\" or \\"they\\".\\r\\nAnother difference concerns the usage of the Tetragrammaton. Yahweh appears in some Bible translations such as the Jerusalem Bible (1966) throughout the Old Testament. Long-standing Jewish and Christian tradition holds that these names are not to be spoken in worship or printed in liturgical texts out of reverence.[11][15] A 2008 letter from the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments explicitly forbids the use of the Divine Name in worship texts, stating: \\"For the translation of the biblical text in modern languages, intended for the liturgical usage of the Church, what is already prescribed by n. 41 of the Instruction Liturgiam authenticam is to be followed; that is, the divine tetragrammaton is to be rendered by the equivalent of Adonai/Kyrios; Lord, Signore, Seigneur, Herr, Se?or, etc.\\"\\r\\nAs a result, Bibles used by English-speaking Catholics for study and devotion typically do not match the liturgical texts read during mass, even when based on the same translation. Today, publishers and translators alike are making new efforts to more precisely align the texts of the Lectionary with the various approved translations of the Catholic Bible.\\r\\nCurrently, there is only one lectionary reported to be in use corresponding exactly to an in-print Catholic Bible translation: the Ignatius Press lectionary based on the Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic (or Ignatius) Edition (RSV-2CE) approved for liturgical use in the Antilles[16] and by former Anglicans in the personal ordinariates.[17]\\r\\nIn 2007 the Catholic Truth Society published the \\"CTS New Catholic Bible,\\" consisting of the original 1966 Jerusalem Bible text revised to match its use in lectionaries throughout most English-speaking countries, in conformity with the directives of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments[11][15] and the Pontifical Biblical Commission.[18] In it, \\"Yahweh\\" has been replaced by \\"the LORD\\" throughout the Old Testament, and the Psalms have been completely replaced by the 1963 Grail Psalter.\\r\\nIn 2012, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops \\"announced a plan to revise the New Testament of the New American Bible Revised Edition so a single version can be used for individual prayer, catechesis and liturgy\\" in the United States.[19] After developing a plan and budget for the revision project, work began in 2013 with the creation of an editorial board made up of five people from the Catholic Biblical Association (CBA). The revision is now underway and, after the necessary approvals from the bishops and the Vatican, is expected to be done around the year 2025.[20]\\r\\nBibles used by Catholics differ in the number and order of books from those typically found in bibles used by Protestants, as Catholic bibles remained unchanged following the Reformation and so retain seven books that were rejected principally by Martin Luther. Its canon of Old Testament texts is somewhat larger than that in translations used by Protestants, which are typically based exclusively on the shorter Hebrew and Aramaic Masoretic Text. On the other hand, its canon, which does not accept all the books that are included in the Septuagint,[21] is shorter than that of some churches of Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy, which recognize other books as sacred scripture.\\r\\nThe Greek Orthodox Church generally considers Psalm 151 to be part of the Book of Psalms and accepts the \\"books of the Maccabees\\" as four in number, but generally places 4 Maccabees in an appendix, along with the Prayer of Manasseh.[22] There are differences from Western usage in the naming of some books (see, for instance, Esdras#Differences in names). Greek Orthodox generally consider the Septuagint to be divinely inspired no less than the Hebrew text of the Old Testament books.\\r\\nThe Bible of the Tewahedo Churches differs from the Western and Greek Orthodox Bibles in the order, naming, and chapter/verse division of some of the books. The Ethiopian \\"narrow\\" biblical canon includes 81 books altogether: The 27 books of the New Testament; the Old Testament books found in the Septuagint and that are accepted by the Eastern Orthodox (more numerous than the Catholic deuterocanonical books);[23] and in addition Enoch, Jubilees, 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras, Rest of the Words of Baruch and 3 books of Meqabyan (Ethiopian books of Maccabees entirely different in content from the 4 Books of Maccabees of the Eastern Orthodox). A \\"broader\\" Ethiopian New Testament canon includes 4 books of \\"Sinodos\\" (church practices), 2 \\"Books of Covenant\\", \\"Ethiopic Clement\\", and \\"Ethiopic Didascalia\\" (Apostolic Church-Ordinances). This \\"broader\\" canon is sometimes said to include with the Old Testament an 8-part history of the Jews based on the writings of Titus Flavius Josephus, and known as \\"Pseudo-Josephus\\" or \\"Joseph ben Gurion\\" (Yosf walda Koryon).[24][25]","input":"What bible version does the catholic church use?"},{"output":"three","context":"The Lord of the Rings is a film series consisting of three high fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson. They are based on the novel The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The films are subtitled The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). They are a New Zealand-American venture produced by WingNut Films and The Saul Zaentz Company and distributed by New Line Cinema.\\r\\nConsidered to be one of the biggest and most ambitious film projects ever undertaken, with an overall budget of $281 million (some sources say $310-$330 million),[2] the entire project took eight years, with the filming for all three films done simultaneously and entirely in New Zealand, Jackson's native country.[3] Each film in the series also had special extended editions released on DVD a year after their respective theatrical releases. While the films follow the book's general storyline, they do omit some of the novel's plot elements and include some additions to and deviations from the source material.\\r\\nSet in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the films follow the hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) as he and a Fellowship embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, and thus ensure the destruction of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron (Sala Baker). The Fellowship eventually splits up and Frodo continues the quest together with his loyal companion Sam (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis). Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Pippin, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) unite to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in the War of the Ring.\\r\\nThe series was received with overwhelming praise and was a major financial success, with the films collectively being among the highest-grossing film series of all time. The films were critically acclaimed and heavily awarded, winning 17 out of 30 total Academy Award nominations. The final film in the series, The Return of the King, won all 11 of its Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, which also tied it with Ben-Hur and Titanic for most Academy Awards received for a film. The series received wide praise for its innovative special and visual effects.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector Peter Jackson first came into contact with The Lord of the Rings when he saw Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film The Lord of the Rings. Jackson \\"enjoyed the film and wanted to know more.\\"[7] Afterwards, he read a tie-in edition of the book[8] during a twelve-hour train journey from Wellington to Auckland when he was seventeen.[9]\\r\\nIn 1995, Jackson was finishing The Frighteners and considered The Lord of the Rings as a new project, wondering \\"why nobody else seemed to be doing anything about it\\".[9] With the new developments in computer-generated imagery following Jurassic Park, Jackson set about planning a fantasy film that would be relatively serious and feel real. By October, he and his partner Fran Walsh teamed up with Miramax Films boss Harvey Weinstein to negotiate with Saul Zaentz who had held the rights to the book since the early 1970s, pitching an adaptation of The Hobbit and two films based on The Lord of the Rings. Negotiations then stalled when Universal Studios offered Jackson a remake of King Kong.[10] Weinstein was furious, and further problems arose when it turned out Zaentz did not have distribution rights to The Hobbit; United Artists, which was in the market, did. By April 1996, the rights question was still not resolved.[10]\\r\\nJackson decided to move ahead with King Kong before filming The Lord of the Rings, prompting Universal to enter a deal with Miramax to receive foreign earnings from The Lord of the Rings while Miramax received foreign earnings from King Kong.[10] It was also revealed that Jackson originally wanted to finish King Kong before The Lord of the Rings began. But due to location problems, he decided to start with The Lord of the Rings franchise instead.\\r\\nWhen Universal cancelled King Kong in 1997,[11] Jackson and Walsh immediately received support from Weinstein and began a six-week process of sorting out the rights. Jackson and Walsh asked Costa Botes to write a synopsis of the book and they began to re-read the book. Two to three months later, they had written their treatment.[12] The first film would have dealt with what would become The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and the beginning of The Return of the King, ending with Saruman's death, and Gandalf and Pippin going to Minas Tirith. In this treatment, Gwaihir and Gandalf visit Edoras after escaping Saruman, Gollum attacks Frodo when the Fellowship is still united, and Farmer Maggot, Glorfindel, Radagast, Elladan and Elrohir are present. Bilbo attends the Council of Elrond, Sam looks into Galadriel's mirror, Saruman is redeemed before he dies and the Nazg?l just make it into Mount Doom before they fall.[12] They presented their treatment to Harvey and Bob Weinstein, the latter of whom they focused on impressing with their screenwriting as he had not read the book. They agreed upon two films and a total budget of $75?million.[12]\\r\\nDuring mid-1997,[13] Jackson and Walsh began writing with Stephen Sinclair.[12] Sinclair's partner, Philippa Boyens, was a major fan of the book and joined the writing team after reading their treatment.[13] It took 13ÿ14 months to write the two film scripts,[13] which were 147 and 144 pages respectively. Sinclair left the project due to theatrical obligations. Amongst their revisions, Sam is caught eavesdropping and forced to go along with Frodo, instead of Sam, Merry, and Pippin figuring out about the One Ring themselves and voluntarily going along after confronting Frodo about it, as occurs in the original novel. Gandalf's account of his time at Orthanc was pulled out of flashback and Lothl܇rien was cut, with Galadriel doing what she does in the story at Rivendell. Denethor attends the Council with his son. Other changes included having Arwen rescue Frodo, and the action sequence involving the cave troll. The writers also considered having Arwen absorb owyn's role entirely by having her kill the Witch-king.[12]\\r\\nTrouble struck when Marty Katz was sent to New Zealand. Spending four months there, he told Miramax that the films were more likely to cost $150?million, and with Miramax unable to finance this, and with $15?million already spent, they decided to merge the two films into one. On 17 June 1998, Bob Weinstein presented a treatment of a single two-hour film version of the book. He suggested cutting Bree and the Battle of Helm's Deep, \\"losing or using\\" Saruman, merging Rohan and Gondor with owyn as Boromir's sister, shortening Rivendell and Moria as well as having Ents prevent the Uruk-hai from kidnapping Merry and Pippin.[12] Upset by the idea of \\"cutting out half the good stuff\\"[13] Jackson balked, and Miramax declared that any script or work completed by Weta Workshop was theirs.[12] Jackson went around Hollywood for four weeks,[13] showing a thirty-five-minute video of their work, before meeting with New Line Cinema's Mark Ordesky.[14] At New Line Cinema, Robert Shaye viewed the video, and then asked why they were making two films when the book was published as three volumes (this was later corrected: New Line only made this choice out of economical reasons);[15] he wanted to make a film trilogy. Now Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens had to write three new scripts.[13]\\r\\nThe expansion to three films allowed much more creative freedom, although Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens had to restructure their script accordingly. The three films do not correspond exactly to the trilogy's three volumes, but rather represent a three-part adaptation. Jackson takes a more chronological approach to the story than did Tolkien. Frodo's quest is the main focus, and Aragorn is the main sub-plot,[16] and many sequences (such as Tom Bombadil) that do not contribute directly to those two plots were left out. Much effort was put into creating satisfactory conclusions and making sure exposition did not bog down the pacing. Amongst new sequences, there are also expansions on elements Tolkien kept ambiguous, such as the battles and the creatures. During shooting, the screenplays continued to evolve, in part due to contributions from cast members looking to further explore their characters.[13] Most notable amongst these rewrites was the character Arwen, who was originally planned as a warrior princess, but reverted to her book counterpart, who remains physically inactive in the story (though she sends moral and military support).[17]\\r\\nTo develop fight and sword choreography for the series, the filmmakers employed Hollywood sword-master Bob Anderson. Anderson worked directly with the talent including Viggo Mortensen and Karl Urban to develop the film's many sword fights and stunts.[18] Bob Anderson's role in The Lord of the Rings series was highlighted in the film Reclaiming the Blade. This documentary on sword martial arts also featured Weta Workshop and Richard Taylor, The Lord of the Rings illustrator John Howe and actors Viggo Mortensen and Karl Urban. All discussed their roles and work on the series as related to the sword.[19]\\r\\nJackson began storyboarding the series with Christian Rivers in August 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.[20] Jackson hired long-time collaborator Richard Taylor to lead Weta Workshop on five major design elements: armour, weapons, prosthetics/make-up, creatures, and miniatures. In November 1997,[13] famed Tolkien illustrators Alan Lee and John Howe joined the project. Most of the imagery in the films is based on their various illustrations.[21] Production designer Grant Major was charged with the task of converting Lee and Howe's designs into architecture, creating models of the sets, while Dan Hennah worked as art director, scouting locations and organising the building of sets.\\r\\nJackson's vision of Middle-earth was described as being \\"Ray Harryhausen meets David Lean\\" by Randy Cook.[22] Jackson wanted a gritty realism and historical regard for the fantasy, and attempted to make the world rational and believable. For example, the New Zealand Army helped build Hobbiton months before filming began so the plants could really grow.[23] Creatures were designed to be biologically believable, such as the enormous wings of the fell beast to help it fly.[24] In total, 48,000 pieces of armour, 500 bows, and 10,000 arrows were created by Weta Workshop.[25] They also created many prosthetics, such as 1,800 pairs of Hobbit feet for the lead actors,[13] as well as many ears, noses, and heads for the cast, and around 19,000 costumes were woven and aged.[13] Every prop was specially designed by the Art Department, taking the different scales into account.[13]\\r\\nPrincipal photography for all three films was conducted concurrently in many locations within New Zealand's conservation areas and national parks. Filming took place between 11 October 1999 and 22 December 2000, a period of 438 days. Pick-up shoots were conducted annually from 2001 to 2003. The series was shot at over 150 different locations,[25] with seven different units shooting, as well as soundstages around Wellington and Queenstown. Along with Jackson directing the whole production, other unit directors included John Mahaffie, Geoff Murphy, Fran Walsh, Barrie Osbourne, Rick Porras, and any other assistant director, producer, or writer available. Jackson monitored these units with live satellite feeds, and with the added pressure of constant script re-writes and the multiple units interpreting his envisioned result, he only got around four hours of sleep a night.[17] Due to the remoteness of some of the locations, the crew would also bring survival kits in case helicopters could not reach the location to bring them home in time.[13] The New Zealand Department of Conservation was criticised for approving the filming within national parks without adequate consideration of the adverse environmental effects and without public notification.[26] The adverse effects of filming battle scenes in Tongariro National Park meant that the park later required restoration work.[27]\\r\\nThe following is a list of cast members who voiced or portrayed characters appearing in the extended version of The Lord of the Rings film series.\\r\\nEach film had the benefit of a full year of post-production time before its respective December release, often finishing in OctoberÿNovember, with the crew immediately going to work on the next film. In this period's later part, Jackson would move to London to supervise the scoring and continue editing, while having a computer feed for discussions to The Dorchester Hotel, and a \\"fat pipe\\" of Internet connections from Pinewood Studios to look at the special effects. He had a video link and 5.1 surround sound to organise meetings, and listen to new music and sound effects generally wherever he was. The extended editions also had a tight schedule at the start of each year to complete special effects and music.[31]\\r\\nTo avoid pressure, Jackson hired a different editor for each film. John Gilbert worked on the first film, Mike Horton and Jabez Olssen on the second and longtime Jackson collaborator Jamie Selkirk and Annie Collins on the third. Daily rushes would often last up to four hours, with scenes being done throughout 1999ÿ2002 for the rough (4? hours) assemblies of the films.[13] In total, 1828?km (six million feet) of film[25] was edited down to the 11 hours and 23?minutes (683?minutes) of Extended running time. This was the final area of shaping of the films, when Jackson realised that sometimes the best scripting could be redundant on screen, as he picked apart scenes every day from multiple takes.\\r\\nThe first film's editing was relatively easygoing, with Jackson coming up with the concept of an Extended Edition later on, although after a screening to New Line they had to re-edit the beginning for a prologue. The Two Towers was always acknowledged by the crew as the most difficult film to make, as \\"it had no beginning or end\\", and had the additional problem of inter-cutting storylines appropriately. Jackson even continued editing the film when that part of the schedule officially ended, resulting in some scenes, including the reforging of And~ril, Gollum's back-story, and Saruman's demise, being moved to The Return of the King. Later, Saruman's demise was cut from the theatrical edition (but included in the Extended edition) when Jackson felt it was not starting the third film effectively enough.[32] As with all parts of the third film's post-production, editing was very chaotic. The first time Jackson actually saw the completed film was at the Wellington premiere.\\r\\nMany filmed scenes remain unused, even in the Extended Editions. Promotional material for The Fellowship of the Ring contained an attack by Orcs from Moria on Lothl܇rien after the Fellowship leaves Moria, replaced with a more suspenseful entrance for the Fellowship. Also cut were scenes from the book, including Frodo seeing more of Middle-earth at Parth Galen and an extended Council of Elrond,[13] and new scenes with an attack upon Frodo and Sam at the river Anduin by an Uruk-hai.[13] The major cut to The Two Towers featured Arwen and Elrond visiting Galadriel at Lothl܇rien, with Arwen then leading the Elven reinforcements to Helm's Deep.[17] This scene, and a flashback to Arwen and Aragorn's first meeting, was cut during a revision of the film's plot; the Elves' appearance was explained with a telepathic communication between Elrond and Galadriel.[17]\\r\\nowyn was to have a greater role in defending the refugees in the Glittering Caves from Uruk-hai intruders,[33] while in Osgiliath, Faramir was to have a vision of Frodo becoming like Gollum,[17] with Frodo and Sam having an extended fight sequence.[34] Filmed for The Return of the King were two scenes present in the book; Sam using the Phial of Galadriel to pass the Watchers at Cirith Ungol, and further epilogue footage, with endings for Legolas and Gimli, owyn and Faramir's wedding and Aragorn's death and funeral.[35] Sauron was to fight Aragorn at the Black Gate, but with Jackson deciding the scene was inappropriate, a computer-generated Troll was used instead.[22] To give context for Wormtongue killing Saruman, and Legolas in turn killing Wormtongue, it was to be revealed Wormtongue poisoned Thodred.[36] The final scene cut was Aragorn having his armour fitted for the Battle of the Black Gate by the trilogy's armourers, which was the final scene filmed during principal photography.[22] Peter Jackson has stated that he would like to include some of these unused scenes in a future \\"Ultimate Edition\\" home video release, also including out-takes.[37]\\r\\nHoward Shore composed, orchestrated, conducted, and produced the trilogy's music. He was hired in August 2000[38] and visited the set, and watched the assembly cuts of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King. In the music, Shore included many (85 to 110) leitmotifs to represent various characters, cultures, and places - the largest catalogue of leitmotives in the history of cinema, surpassing - for comparison - that of the entire Star Wars saga. For example, there are multiple leitmotifs just for the hobbits and the Shire. Although the first film had some of its score recorded in Wellington,[13] virtually all of the trilogy's score was recorded in Watford Town Hall and mixed at Abbey Road Studios. Jackson planned to advise the score for six weeks each year in London, though for The Two Towers he stayed for twelve. As a Beatles fan, Jackson had a photo tribute done there on the zebra crossing.[17]\\r\\nThe score is primarily played by the London Philharmonic Orchestra (ranging from 93 to 120 players throughout the recording), London Voices, London Oratory School Schola boy choir, and many artists such as Ben Del Maestro, Enya, Rene Fleming, James Galway, Annie Lennox and Emilana Torrini contributed. Even actors Billy Boyd, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Miranda Otto (extended cuts only for the latter two), and Peter Jackson (for a single gong sound in the second film) contributed to the score. Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens served as librettists, writing lyrics to various music and songs, which David Salo translated into Tolkien's languages. The third film's end song, \\"Into the West\\", was a tribute to a young filmmaker Jackson and Walsh befriended named Cameron Duncan, who died of cancer in 2003.[22]\\r\\nShore composed a main theme for The Fellowship rather than many different character themes, and its strength and weaknesses in volume are depicted at different points in the series. On top of that, individual themes were composed to represent different cultures. Infamously, the amount of music Shore had to write every day for the third film increased dramatically to around seven minutes.[22] The music for the series turned out to be a success and has been voted best movie soundtrack of all time for the six years running, passing up Schindler's list, Gladiator, Star Wars (1977), and Out of Africa respectively.[39]\\r\\nSound technicians spent the early part of the year trying to find the right sounds. Some, such as animal sounds like those of tigers and walruses, were bought. Human voices were also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the Nazg?l scream and David Farmer the Warg howls. Other sounds were unexpected: the fell beast's screech is taken from that of a donkey, and the m?makil's bellow comes from the beginning and end of a lion's roar. In addition, ADR was used for most of the dialogue.\\r\\nThe technicians worked with New Zealand locals to get many of the sounds. They re-recorded sounds in abandoned tunnels for an echo-like effect in the Moria sequence. 20,000 New Zealand cricket fans provided the sound of the Uruk-hai army in The Two Towers, with Jackson acting as conductor during the innings break of a one-day international cricket match between England and New Zealand at Westpac Stadium.[17] They spent time recording sounds in a graveyard at night, and also had construction workers drop stone blocks for the sounds of boulders firing and landing in The Return of the King. Mixing took place between August and November at \\"The Film Mix\\", before Jackson commissioned the building of a new studio in 2003. The building, however, had not yet been fully completed when they started mixing for The Return of the King.[22]\\r\\nThe first film has around 540 effect shots, the second 799, and the third 1,488 (2,730 in total). The total increases to 3,420 with the extended editions. 260 visual effect artists began work on the series, and the number doubled by The Two Towers. The crew, led by Jim Rygiel and Randy Cook, worked long hours, often overnight, to produce special effects within a short space of time. Jackson's active imagination was a driving force. For example, several major shots of Helm's Deep were produced within the last six weeks of post-production of The Two Towers, and the same happened again within the last six weeks on The Return of the King.\\r\\nThe trilogy's online promotional trailer was first released on 27 April 2000, and set a new record for download hits, registering 1.7?million hits in the first 24 hours of its release.[40] The trailer used a selection from the soundtrack for Braveheart and The Shawshank Redemption among other cuts. In 2001, 24?minutes of footage from the series, primarily the Moria sequence, was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, and was very well received.[41] The showing also included an area designed to look like Middle-earth.[25]\\r\\nThe Fellowship of the Ring was released 19 December 2001. It grossed $47?million in its U.S. opening weekend and made around $871?million worldwide. A preview of The Two Towers was inserted just before the end credits near the end of the film's theatrical run.[42] A promotional trailer was later released, containing music re-scored from the film Requiem for a Dream.[43] The Two Towers was released 18 December 2002. It grossed $62?million in its first U.S. weekend and out-grossed its predecessor with $926?million worldwide. The promotional trailer for The Return of the King was debuted exclusively before the New Line Cinema film Secondhand Lions on 23 September 2003.[44] Released 17 December 2003, its first U.S. weekend gross was $72?million, and became the second film (after Titanic) to gross over $1?billion worldwide.\\r\\nEach film was released on standard two-disc edition DVDs containing previews of the next film. The success of the theatrical cuts brought about four-disc Extended Editions, with new editing, added special effects and music.[45] The extended cuts of the films and the included special features were spread over two discs, and a limited collector's edition was also released. The Fellowship of the Ring was released on 12 November 2002, containing 30?minutes more footage, an Alan Lee painting of the Fellowship entering Moria, and the Moria Gate on the back of the sleeve; an Argonath-styled bookend was included with the Collector's Edition. The Two Towers, released on 18 November 2003, contained 44?minutes extra footage and a Lee painting of Gandalf the White's entrance; the Collector's Edition contained a Smagol statue, with a crueller-looking statue of his Gollum persona available by order for a limited time.\\r\\nThe Return of the King was released on 14 December 2004, having 51?minutes more footage, a Lee painting of the Grey Havens and a model of Minas Tirith for the Collector's Edition, with Minas Morgul available by order for a limited time. The Special Extended DVD Editions also had in-sleeve maps of the Fellowship's travels. They have also played at cinemas, most notably for a 16 December 2003 marathon screening (dubbed \\"Trilogy Tuesday\\") culminating in a late afternoon screening of the third film. Attendees of \\"Trilogy Tuesday\\" were given a limited edition keepsake from Sideshow Collectibles containing one random frame of film from each of the three movies. Both versions were put together in a Limited Edition \\"branching\\" version, plus a new feature-length documentary by Costa Botes. The complete series was released in a six-disc set on 14 November 2006.\\r\\nWarner Bros. released the trilogy's theatrical versions on Blu-ray Disc in a boxed set on 6 April 2010.[46] An extended edition Blu-ray box set was made available for pre-order from Amazon.com in March 2011 and was released on 28 June 2011.[47] Each film's extended Blu-ray version is identical to the extended DVD version; the total running time is longer due to added credit sequence listing the names of \\"Lord of the Rings fan-club members\\" who contributed to the project.[48][49]\\r\\nIn 2014, brand new Blu-ray steelbook editions of the five-disc Extended Editions were released. The first, The Fellowship of the Ring, was released on 24 March 2014.[50] The discs are identical to those found in the previous five-disc Blu-ray set.[51]\\r\\nUnadjusted for inflation, The Lord of the Rings film series is the highest-grossing film trilogy worldwide of all time, higher even than other film franchises such as the original Star Wars trilogy and The Godfather trilogy.[56] The film series grossed a total of $2.91 billion[57] and also tied a record with Ben-Hur and Titanic for the total number of Academy Awards won for a single film, with The Return of the King receiving eleven Oscars.[58]\\r\\nThe majority of critics have also praised the series, with Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times writing that \\"the trilogy will not soon, if ever, find its equal\\".[59] Some were critical of the films' pacing and length: \\"It's a collection of spectacular set pieces without any sense of momentum driving them into one another\\" according to Philadelphia Weekly.[60]\\r\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the films received approval ratings of 91%, 96%, and 95% respectively.[61][62][63] Metacritic, based on its ratings for each film (92, 88, and 94 respectively),[64][65][66] features the series within the top ten of the best films of the decade.[67] As of July 2016, every film is placed in the top 200 of Metacritic's 'Best Movies of all Time' list.[68] In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the films an average grade of A-, A, and A+ respectively on an A+ to F scale.[69]\\r\\nThe series appears in the Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association's Top 10 Films, Time magazine's All-Time 100 Movies, and James Berardinelli's Top 100.[70] In 2007, USA Today named the series as the most important films of the past 25 years.[71] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, \\"best-of\\" list, saying, \\"Bringing a cherished book to the big screen? No sweat. Peter Jackson's trilogy  or, as we like to call it, our preciousssss  exerted its irresistible pull, on advanced Elvish speakers and neophytes alike.\\"[72] Paste Magazine named it one of the 50 Best Movies of the Decade (2000ÿ2009), ranking it at No. 4.[73] In another Time magazine list, the series ranks second in \\"Best Movies of the Decade\\".[74] Empire magazine voted the films at #1 on the '32 Greatest Film Trilogies'.[75] In addition, six characters and their respective actors made the list of 'The 100 Greatest Movie Characters', also compiled by Empire, with Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of Aragorn ranking No. 15, Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf ranking No. 30, Ian Holm's portrayal of Bilbo Baggins (shared with Martin Freeman for his portrayal of the same character in The Hobbit films) ranking No. 61, Andy Serkis' portrayal of Gollum ranking No. 66, Sean Astin's portrayal of Samwise Gamgee ranking No. 77, and Orlando Bloom's portrayal of Legolas ranking No. 94.[76]\\r\\nThe three films together were nominated for a total of 30 Academy Awards, of which they won 17, a record for any movie trilogy (the three nominations for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug along with the single nomination for The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies brings the series' total to 37 nominations). The Fellowship of the Ring earned thirteen nominations, the most of any film at the 74th Academy Awards, winning four. The Return of the King won in every category in which it was nominated, setting the current Oscar record for the highest clean sweep, and its 11 Academy Awards wins ties the record held by Ben-Hur and Titanic (though both of those films had additional nominations that they ultimately lost). The Return of the King became only the second sequel to win the Oscar for Best Picture (after The Godfather Part II) and the first and only fantasy film to receive this honor, though this has been widely perceived as an award by proxy for the entire series (the first two films were also nominated for Best Picture).[77] No actors in any of the three films won Oscars, and Ian McKellen was the only actor in the trilogy to receive a nomination, for his work in The Fellowship of the Ring.[77]\\r\\nAs well as Academy Awards, each film in the series won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, the MTV Movie Award for Best Movie, and the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film. The first and third films also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film. The soundtrack for The Two Towers did not receive a nomination because of a rule prohibiting a soundtrack including music from a previous soundtrack to be eligible for nomination. This rule was changed in time for The Return of the King to receive the Oscar for Best Music Score. The New York Film Critics Circle awarded The Return of the King its Best Picture Award at the 2003 Awards Ceremony, hosted by Andrew Johnston, chair of the organization at that time, who called it \\"a masterful piece of filmmaking.\\"[78]\\r\\nThe film series provoked both positive and negative reaction from fans and scholars of the novels, and was sometimes seen as changing parts Tolkien felt thematically necessary in terms of characters, themes, events and subtlety. Some fans of the book who disagreed with such changes have released fan edits of the films such as The Lord of the Rings: The Purist Edition,[79][80] which removed many of the changes to bring them closer to the original.\\r\\nVarious changes to characters such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Arwen, Denethor, Faramir, Gimli, and Frodo, when considered together, were seen by some to alter the tone and themes found in the books. Several critics contend that the portrayal of women, especially Arwen, in the films is thematically faithful to (or compatible with) Tolkien's writings despite some differences.[81][82][83][84] Wayne G. Hammond, a Tolkien scholar,[85][86] said of the first two films that he found them to be \\"travesties as adaptations... faithful only on a basic level of plot\\" and that many characters had not been depicted faithfully to their appearance in the novel.[87][88] Other critics have argued that Tolkien's characters were weakened and misinterpreted by their portrayal in the films.[89][90][91]\\r\\nChanges to events (such as the Elves participating at the Battle of Helm's Deep,[92] Faramir taking the hobbits to Osgiliath,[93] and the deletion of the chapter \\"The Scouring of the Shire\\") are also seen as changing Tolkien's themes.[93]\\r\\nJanet Brennan Croft criticized the films using Tolkien's own terms \\"anticipation\\" and \\"flattening\\", which she used in critiquing a proposed film script. She contrasts Tolkien's subtlety with Jackson's tendency to show \\"too much too soon\\".[94]\\r\\nSupporters of the series assert that it is a worthy interpretation of the book and that most of the changes were necessary.[21] Many who worked on the series are fans of the book, including Christopher Lee, who (alone among the cast) had actually met Tolkien in person,[95] and Boyens once noted that no matter what, it is simply their interpretation of the book. Jackson once said that to simply summarize the story on screen would be a mess, and in his own words, \\"Sure, it's not really The Lord of the Rings... but it could still be a pretty damn cool movie.\\"[96][97] Other fans also claim that, despite any changes, the films serve as a tribute to the book, appealing to those who have not yet read it, and even leading some to do so. The Movie Guide for The Encyclopedia of Arda (an online Tolkien encyclopedia) states that Jackson's films were exceptional since filming the whole story of The Lord of the Rings was probably impossible.[98] This notion is partially supported by a review published in 2005 that otherwise criticized a lack of \\"faithfulness to Tolkien's spirit and tone.\\"[99] Douglas Kellner argues that the conservative community spirit of Tolkien's Shire is reflected in Jackson's films as well as the division of the Fellowship into \\"squabbling races\\".[100] In a 2006 review, film theorist Kristin Thompson was critical about the fact that film studies were undertaken by literary researchers and about the frequent denigration of Jackson's work in the collected essays.[101]\\r\\nThe release of the films saw a surge of interest in The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's other works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture.[103] It was rumored that the Tolkien family became split on the series, with Christopher Tolkien and his son Simon Tolkien feuding over whether or not it was a good idea to adapt.[104] Christopher has since denied these claims, saying, \\"My own position is that The Lord of the Rings is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form. The suggestions that have been made that I 'disapprove' of the films, even to the extent of thinking ill of those with whom I may differ, are wholly without foundation.\\" He added that he had never \\"expressed any such feeling\\".[105] In 2012, however, he described the films as having \\"eviscerated\\" the book, and criticized the resulting \\"commercialisation\\" of his father's work.[102][106]\\r\\nAs a result of the series' success, Peter Jackson has become a major player in the film business (sometimes called a mogul) in the mold of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, in the process befriending some industry heavyweights like Bryan Singer and Frank Darabont. Jackson has since founded his own film production company, Wingnut Films, as well as Wingnut Interactive, a video game company. He was also finally given a chance to remake King Kong in 2005. The film was a critical and box office success, although not as successful as The Lord of the Rings series. Jackson has been called a \\"favourite son\\" of New Zealand.[107] In 2004, Howard Shore toured with The Lord of the Rings Symphony, playing two hours of the score. Along with the Harry Potter films, the series has renewed interest in the fantasy film genre. Tourism for New Zealand is up, possibly due to its exposure in the series,[108] with the country's tourism industry waking up to an audience's familiarity.[109]\\r\\nIn December 2002, The Lord of the Rings Motion Picture Trilogy: The Exhibition opened at the Te Papa museum in Wellington, New Zealand. As of 2007, the exhibition has traveled to seven other cities around the world. A musical adaptation of the book was launched in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 2006, but it closed after mostly poor reviews. A shortened version opened in London, United Kingdom, in the summer of 2007. The success of the films has also spawned numerous video games and many other kinds of merchandise.\\r\\nThe legacy of The Lord of the Rings is also that of court cases over profits from the trilogy. Sixteen cast members (Noel Appleby?(de), Jed Brophy, Mark Ferguson, Ray Henwood, Bruce Hopkins, William Johnson, Nathaniel Lees, Sarah McLeod, Ian Mune, Paul Norell, Craig Parker, Robert Pollock, Martyn Sanderson, Peter Tait and Stephan Ure?(de)) sued over the lack of revenue from merchandise bearing their appearance. The case was resolved out of court in 2008. The settlement came too late for Appleby, who died of cancer in 2007.[110] Saul Zaentz also filed a lawsuit in 2004 claiming he had not been paid all of his royalties. The next year, Jackson himself sued the studio over profits from the first film, slowing development of the prequels until late 2007.[111] The Tolkien Trust filed a lawsuit in February 2008, for violating Tolkien's original deal over the rights that they would earn 7.5% of the gross from any films based on his works.[112] The Trust sought compensation of $150?million.[113] A judge denied them this option, but allowed them to win compensation from the act of the studio ignoring the contract itself.[114] On 8 September 2009, a settlement of this dispute between the Trust and New Line was announced, clearing a potential obstacle to the making of a new film based on The Hobbit.[115]\\r\\nNumerous video games have been released to supplement the film series. The releases include: The Two Towers, Pinball, The Return of the King, The Third Age, The Third Age (GBA), Tactics, The Battle for Middle-earth, The Battle for Middle-earth II, The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king, The Lord of the Rings Online, Conquest, Aragorn's Quest, War in the North, Lego The Lord of the Rings, Guardians of Middle-earth, Lego The Hobbit (video game), and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.\\r\\nPeter Jackson also directed three films based on Tolkien's earlier 1937 novel The Hobbit. The first film, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, was released on 12 December 2012,[116] the second film, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, was released on 13 December 2013, and the third film, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, was released on 17 December 2014.[117] Several actors from The Lord of the Rings, including Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood, Ian Holm (as older Bilbo), Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett and Orlando Bloom reprised their roles.","input":"How many lord of the rings films were there?"},{"output":"emphasized a Union blockade of the Southern ports, and called for an advance down the Mississippi River to cut the South in two","context":"The Anaconda Plan is the name applied to a U.S. Union Army outline strategy for suppressing the Confederacy at the beginning of the American Civil War.[1] Proposed by General-in-Chief Winfield Scott, the plan emphasized a Union blockade of the Southern ports, and called for an advance down the Mississippi River to cut the South in two. Because the blockade would be rather passive, it was widely derided by a vociferous faction of Union generals who wanted a more vigorous prosecution of the war, and who likened it to the coils of an anaconda suffocating its victim. The snake image caught on, giving the proposal its popular name.\\r\\nIn the early days of the Civil War, General-in-Chief Winfield Scott's proposed strategy for the war against the South had two prominent features: first, all ports in the seceding states were to be rigorously blockaded; second, a strong column of perhaps 80,000 men should use the Mississippi River as a highway to thrust completely through the Confederacy. A spearhead, a relatively small amphibious force of army troops transported by boats and supported by gunboats, should advance rapidly, capturing the Confederate positions down the river in sequence. They would be followed by a more traditional army, marching behind them to secure the victories. The culminating battle would be for the forts below New Orleans; when they fell, the river would be in Federal hands from its source to its mouth, and the rebellion would be cut in two.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScott's plan had elements similar to a plan created before the Civil War. That antebellum plan was intended to crush a limited domestic insurrection by closing ports and using the Army to pressure civilians to demand surrender. It was not intended to deal with a new political organization with a regular army.[3]\\r\\nThe complete strategy could not be implemented immediately, as no warships of the type imagined for the Mississippi campaign existed. The U.S. Navy was also too small to enforce the blockade in the first months of the war. It would take time to gather and train the forces needed to carry out the Mississippi thrust, time that the critics of the plan were unwilling to concede. Hence, Scott's plan was subjected to a great deal of ridicule. His opponents called for an immediate overland campaign, directed primarily at the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. Their stated belief was that if a few strongholds were taken, the Confederacy would collapse.\\r\\nThe conflict was not the brief affair that Scott's critics imagined. In the four years of war, the Federal Navy enforced a blockade that certainly weakened the South, although its effect on the war effort is still debated. Furthermore, the Confederacy was split in two by a campaign based on the Mississippi River, and a consensus has now been established that this Southern defeat was at least as important in the final collapse of the Rebellion as the land battles in the East that had so long attracted both public and historians' attention. The form of the Northern victory thus turned out to look very much like what Scott had proposed in the early days. Consequently, the Anaconda has been somewhat rehabilitated, and general histories of the Civil War often credit it with guiding President Abraham Lincoln's strategy throughout.\\r\\nThe Anaconda had a historical development, both in its origin and the way it played out in the experience of battle. The blockade had already been proclaimed by President Lincoln. On April 19, 1861, a week after the bombardment of Fort Sumter that marked the outbreak of the war, he announced that the ports of all the seceded states, from South Carolina through Texas, would be blockaded; later, when Virginia and North Carolina also seceded, their coastlines were added.[4] This executive order was not rescinded until the end of the war, so the blockade existed independently of Scott's plan.\\r\\nIn the early days of the secession movement, the status of the border states Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware, all of which allowed slavery, was unclear.[5] All except Delaware had strong pro-Southern interests. Missouri was torn by internal conflict that mimicked in miniature the larger war that was convulsing the nation; Maryland was kept in the Union by jailing many of the opposition faction; and Kentucky tried to keep the peace by proclaiming its neutrality, whereby it would aid neither the North nor the South if they would agree to leave the state alone.\\r\\nBecause Congress was not in session to authorize Presidential initiatives to suppress the rebellion, the burden of raising troops for the war fell on the loyal state governments. Ohio was particularly active in doing so, and early acquired the services of George B. McClellan, who was to serve as the commander of its militia, with rank Major General of Volunteers. In a few weeks, as the state militias were incorporated into the national service, the militias of Indiana and Illinois were added to his command. From this power base, he felt enabled on April 27, 1861 to write a letter to General Winfield Scott outlining his strategy.[6] He proposed an immediate march on Richmond, by this time the capital of the Confederacy, directed up the Kanawha River; alternatively, if Kentucky were to leave the Union, a march directly across that state should take Nashville, after which he would \\"act on circumstances.\\"\\r\\nScott's endorsement of McClellan's letter, which he submitted to the President, shows that he considered it, but not favorably. First, the Kanawha was not suited for water transport, so the march on Richmond would have to be overland, and thus subject to breakdowns of men, horses, and equipment. More serious was that western Virginia (West Virginia had not yet parted from Virginia) was still very much pro-Union; according to Scott's estimate, its populace stood five out of seven opposed to secession. An invasion as proposed would alienate many of these people, and would subject both enemies and friends to the ravages of war. The same argument could be applied to Kentucky. Perhaps most damaging, the war as proposed would subjugate the Confederacy piecemeal, with by necessity the border states bearing most of the burden, \\"instead of enveloping them all (nearly) at once by a cordon of ports on the Mississippi to its mouth from its junction with the Ohio, and by blockading ships on the sea board.\\"[7]\\r\\nThe germ of Scott's Anaconda Plan for suppressing the insurrection is seen in the endorsement. In a few days, he had given it more thought, and he submitted his own proposal in a letter to McClellan on May 3, 1861. A second letter, dated May 21, was his final outline of the plan.\\r\\nGeneral Scott was not able to impose his strategic vision on the government. Aged and infirm, he had to retire before the year was out. He was replaced as General-in-Chief by none other than George B. McClellan.\\r\\nUnder McClellan and his eventual successor in the West, Maj. Gen. Henry Wager Halleck, the Mississippi became a somewhat neglected theater for operations in the West. Halleck, with McClellan's approval, believed in turning the enemy's Mississippi River strongholds rather than attacking them directly, so he moved away from the river.[8] As he saw it, the Tennessee rather than the Mississippi was the \\"great strategic line of the Western campaign.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe Navy Department, however, remained committed to the idea of opening the Mississippi. The department, in the person of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox, early decided on the capture of New Orleans by a naval expedition from the Gulf of Mexico, after which all other towns bordering the river would fall rather than face bombardment.[10] The task of taking New Orleans was entrusted to Captain (later Admiral) David Glasgow Farragut, who followed his own plans for the battle; running his fleet past the forts that defended the city from the south on the night of April 24, 1862, he forced the city to surrender.[11] After repairing his ships from the damage they had suffered while passing the forts, he sent them up the river, where they successively sought and obtained the surrender of Baton Rouge and Natchez. The string of easy conquests came to an end at Vicksburg, Mississippi, however, as the Confederate position there occupied bluffs high enough to render them impregnable to the naval gunnery of the day.\\r\\nFollowing the loss of Island No. 10 shortly before Farragut took New Orleans, the Confederates had abandoned Memphis, Tennessee, leaving only a small rear guard to conduct a delaying operation. In early June, this was swept aside by the gunboats of the Western Gunboat Flotilla (soon thereafter to be transformed into the Mississippi River Squadron) and a collection of War Department rams, and the Mississippi was open down to Vicksburg. Thus that city became the only point on the river not in Federal hands.[12]\\r\\nAgain, the Army under Halleck did not grasp the opportunity that was provided. He failed to send even a small body of troops to aid the ships, and soon Farragut was forced by falling water levels to withdraw his deep-draft vessels to the vicinity of New Orleans.[13] The Army did not attempt to take Vicksburg until November, and then it was under the leadership of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, after Halleck had been called to Washington to replace McClellan as General-in-Chief.[14]\\r\\nBy the time that Grant became commander in the West, the Confederate Army had been able to fortify Vicksburg and Port Hudson to the south. This 130 miles stretch (210?km measured along roads, somewhat longer on the river), including the confluence of the Red River with the Mississippi, became the last contact between the eastern Confederacy and the Trans-Mississippi. Having no doubt of its importance, the government of Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond strengthened both positions. Command at Vicksburg in particular passed from Brig. Gen. Martin L. Smith to Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn to Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton; the size of the defending army increased in step with the advancing rank of its commander.[15]\\r\\nThe campaign for Vicksburg eventually settled into a siege, terminated on July 4, 1863, with Pemberton's surrender of all the forces under his command. At that time, his army numbered approximately 29,500 men.[16]\\r\\nWhen word of the loss of Vicksburg reached the garrison at Port Hudson, Maj. Gen. Franklin Gardner, the commander there, knew that further resistance was pointless. On July 9, 1863, he surrendered the post and its garrison to the Federal Army of the Gulf and its commander, Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks.[17] Henceforth, in the phrase of Abraham Lincoln, \\"The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea.\\"\\r\\nThe Anaconda Plan as proposed by Scott relied on the blockade, as he stated it, \\"so as to envelop the insurgent States and bring them to terms with less bloodshed than by any other plan.\\"[18] Insofar as he foresaw direct combat, it was to be more or less confined to the central thrust down the Mississippi River. Almost surely he did not anticipate the level of violence that it provoked. For that matter, the blockade itself had to be modified by events, provoking much of the bloodshed that he hoped to avoid.\\r\\nScott's proposal for the blockade was not properly a strategy, although it is often referred to as such by historians. It did not estimate the forces that would be needed to guard the 3000 or more miles (4800?km) of coastline in the seceded states. It did not consider an allocation of resources. It did not set out a time line, or even name points of particular concern. Much of this was later done by the Blockade Strategy Board, a group meeting at the request of the Navy Department but also with representatives from both the Army and the Treasury Department (Coast Survey).[19] During the summer of 1861, the board issued a series of reports recommending how best to maintain the blockade, taking into account the topography of the coast, the relative merits of the various southern ports, the opposition likely to be encountered, and the nature of the ships that would be used by both sides. The board recommendations concerning the Gulf coast were rather rudimentary and largely ignored, but the blockade on the Atlantic coast followed their plan reasonably closely.[20] -- See also: Blockade runners of the American Civil War.\\r\\nAll parties recognized from the start that the blockading ships would have to be powered by steam. The limited endurance of steamships then implied that one of the first requirements would be possession of a harbor that would serve as a coaling station near the southern end of the blockading line, as otherwise blockaders would spend too much of their time going to and from home port seeking replenishment. All suitable harbors south of the Chesapeake Bay, however, were held by seceded states. In order to establish the blockade, therefore, at least one of them would have to be taken by the Federal forces. Thus, the blockade was immediately transformed from a purely open-water operation to one of at least limited occupation of enemy territory.\\r\\nAlthough the board recommended that Fernandina, Florida be taken as the southern anchor of the blockade, two other positions were captured before Fernandina. A pair of minor forts on the Outer Banks of North Carolina near Cape Hatteras were taken by Union forces on August 28ÿ29, 1861,[21] and on November 7 a major fleet operation at Port Royal, South Carolina resulted in the capture of a deep-water harbor midway between Savannah and Charleston.[22] The Hatteras expedition had been planned as a raid; the plan called for it to be held only long enough to block up Hatteras Inlet. However, it was transformed into an incursion, and led early in the next year to a full invasion (the so-called Burnside Expedition, which included the capture of Roanoke Island) that established the Army permanently in eastern North Carolina. Port Royal in Union hands was soon used a base to make the blockade of Savannah almost complete, but Charleston was not so easily sealed off. Use of its harbor by blockade runners was curtailed, but to close it completely required some of the bitterest and most persistent ground action of the war.[23]\\r\\nWhen Fernandina was seized in early March 1862, the war was almost a year old, and some important changes had taken place. Following the Confederate defeats at Forts Henry and Donelson in Tennessee and Roanoke Island in North Carolina, the War Department in Richmond decided to concentrate its armies in vital interior areas, removing them from much of the coast. Only a few major ports would be defended.[24] Only three of these were on the Atlantic seaboard: Wilmington, Charleston, and Savannah. In fact, only the first two were consequential; a mere eight steam-powered blockade runners entered Georgia or northern Florida ports throughout the entire war.[25]\\r\\nThe blockade of Charleston merged into the campaign against the city waged by both the Army and the Navy, not completed until the last days of the war. Rather early in the war, the Federal Navy tried to block the harbor entrance by sinking ballast-laden hulks in the channels, but this proved ineffective or worse.[26] Later, ships used in the blockade were used for the abortive assault on Fort Sumter on April 7, 1863.[27] They also provided artillery support for the infantry attacks on Battery Wagner on July 11 and July 18, 1863. After both of these attempts to take the battery failed, the ships remained active in the ensuing siege that eventually resulted in its capture.[28] Following this, the Union was able to mount its own guns at the mouth of the harbor, and although the city continued to resist, it was no longer the preferred terminus for blockade runners.\\r\\nWhile all this was going on, the local defenders were not passive. Extensive efforts to break the blockade included the use of torpedoes (mines) and armored ships to sink or otherwise render inoperative the Federal vessels. Imaginative methods to achieve the same end resulted in the development and deployment of submarines and torpedo boats.[29]\\r\\nBy contrast, the blockade of Wilmington was fairly conventional, and is the focus of most debate concerning the efficacy of the blockade. After the middle of July 1863, when Charleston was largely sealed off, most of the trade between the Confederacy and northern Europe was conducted through Wilmington. The port retained its primacy until near the end of the Rebellion, when Fort Fisher, at the mouth of the Cape Fear River, was captured by Union forces in January 1865.[30]\\r\\nThe blockade of Confederate ports on the Gulf of Mexico was less important than that on the Atlantic. Not only were they farther from the centers of blockade-running activity in Bermuda and Nassau,[31] but ships trying to reach them from the Atlantic Ocean would have to run past the Florida Keys, which remained in Federal control throughout the war and served as the base for the Gulf (later, East Gulf) Blockading Squadron. The same decision by the Confederate War Department that led to the abandonment of most of the Atlantic coast except for the major ports applied to the Gulf as well, with the result that only Mobile, New Orleans, and Galveston were defended. (Brownsville, Texas/Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, at the mouth of the Rio Grande, is a special case that will not be treated here because of its international implications.[32]) Galveston was captured by Federal forces on October 4, 1862, but was retaken by the Rebels on New Year's Day of the next year. It remained accessible to blockade runners for the rest of the war but, like all of the Trans-Mississippi, was rendered worthless to the Rebellion when the loss of Vicksburg completed Federal control of the Mississippi River.[33]\\r\\nThe Blockade Strategy Board had recommended that Ship Island, which lies in the Gulf between Mobile and New Orleans, be taken and used as a base for the (West) Gulf Blockading Squadron. This was easily done, as on September 16, 1861 it was abandoned by its Rebel defenders, who feared that they might be cut off from the mainland. Their fears were justified; the next day, USS?Massachusetts arrived and offloaded Federal troops to take possession.[34] Almost immediately, however, the island was transformed from base and coaling station to a more important function; it became the staging area for the approaching attack on the Mississippi River forts that shielded New Orleans.\\r\\nAfter New Orleans fell to the Union fleet under Farragut on April 29, 1862, Mobile was the only serious problem for the blockade. It remained so, much like Wilmington, until late in the war. In August 1864, Farragut got permission from the Navy Department and troops from the War Department to seize the forts at the entrance to Mobile Bay. Following his famous \\"Damn the torpedoes\\" run past the forts, they fell and were occupied by Federal soldiers. Mobile itself remained in Confederate control, but it was no longer useful as a port.[35]\\r\\nAlthough a century and a half has elapsed since the end of the Civil War, the importance of the Anaconda Plan remains to some extent a matter of debate. Clearly, the war was not the relatively bloodless affair that General Scott promised in his original proposal. Most historians regard this as merely a modification of the basic strategy in the course of events. At least one serious historian, however, denies that there ever was anything like a coherent strategy for subduing the South. Rowena Reed[36] contends that the central government in Washington was unable to impose its will on the field commanders, so that the war was a series of independent campaigns, each of which was conducted according to the whims of whatever general happened to be in charge. According to her view, the Anaconda is a later, conceptual imposition of order on events for which order did not exist at the time that they took place.\\r\\nFor the historians who contend that a rational plan did exist, the debate, like the plan itself, has two parts. The importance of the campaign to capture the Mississippi River, and thereby lop off the Trans-Mississippi, is acknowledged. Virtually all present-day historians agree that the Union's Western campaign was at least as significant as that in the East. To the extent that fighting in the West before mid-1863 can be regarded as preparing for or culminating in the capture of Vicksburg, the Anaconda has been validated.\\r\\nThe worth of the Union blockade, however, remains controversial. No one seriously contends that it alone would have won the war for the North. But while it is conceded not to have been sufficient, the question remains: Was it necessary? That is, would the South have endured had not the blockade sapped the strength of the Rebel armies beyond the tipping point?\\r\\nThose who deny the importance of the blockade advance two principal arguments. First, it was never very effective. Over the course of the war, more than three-quarters of all attempts to evade the blockade were successful. The one-quarter that did not get through can be written off as operational losses. This was because the blockade runners were small, and built for speed rather than capacity.\\r\\nSecond and perhaps more important, the Southern armies were not hamstrung for lack of material, at least owing to the blockade. The supply problems they did face were most often caused by the poor condition of Confederate railroads in the American Civil War.[37]\\r\\nThose who believe that the blockade was decisive argue that the Southern forces were strangled at the end. They point out that the collapse of the Army of Northern Virginia, which in 1865 was virtually all that remained of the Confederacy, followed soon after the loss of Wilmington to the Union. The timing, they contend, was not merely coincidental. Furthermore, the defeat of its armies was not the only way the South lost. The purpose of the blockade was not only to capture the ships that attempted to evade it, but also to discourage others. The blockade runners may have been numerous, but they were built for speed rather than the ability to carry cargo. The more conventional cargo vessels, and their spacious holds, went elsewhere. Unable to sell goods (particularly cotton) on the world market, the Confederate government was already strained financially as early as 1862. As its economy steadily degenerated, it suffered from a general loss of confidence on the part of its citizens.[38]\\r\\nAbbreviations used in these notes:","input":"What was the basic idea behind the anaconda plan?"},{"output":"Mian Mir","context":"Baba Sain Mir Mohammed Sahib (c. 1550 ÿ 22 August 1635), popularly known as Mian Mir or Miyan Mir, was a famous Sufi Muslim saint who resided in Lahore, specifically in the town of Dharampura (in present-day Pakistan). He was a direct descendant of Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab. He belonged to the Qadiri order of Sufism. He is famous for being a spiritual instructor of Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan.[1][2] He is identified as the founder of the Mian Khel branch of the Qadiri order. His younger sister Bibi Jamal Khatun was a disciple of his and a notable Sufi saint in her own right.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMian Mir was a friend of God-loving people and he would shun worldly, selfish men, greedy Emirs and ambitious Nawabs who ran after faqirs to get their blessings. To stop such people from coming to see him, Mian Mir posted his mureeds (disciples) at the gate of his house.[5]\\r\\nOnce, Jahangir, the Mughal emperor, with all his retinue came to pay homage to the great faqir. He came with all the pomp and show that befitted an emperor. Mian Mir's sentinels however, stopped the emperor at the gate and requested him to wait until their master had given permission to enter. Jahangir felt slighted. No one had ever dared delay or question his entry to any place in his kingdom. Yet he controlled his temper and composed himself. He waited for permission. After a while, he was ushered into Mian Mir's presence. Unable to hide his wounded vanity, Jahangir, as soon as he entered, told Mian Mir in Persian: Ba dar-e-darvis darbane naa-bayd (\\"On the doorstep of a faqir, there should be no sentry\\").[citation needed]\\r\\nPir Mian Mir, whose mind and soul were one with god, caring little for the emperor's irritation, replied in Persian: Babayd keh sag-e-dunia na ayad (\\"They are there so that the dogs of the world/selfish men may not enter\\").[citation needed]\\r\\nThe emperor was embarrassed and asked for forgiveness. Then, with folded hands, Jahangir requested Mian Mir to pray for the success of the campaign which he intended to launch for the conquest of the Deccan. Meanwhile, a poor man entered and, bowing his head to Mian Mir, made an offering of a rupee before him. The Sufi asked the devotee to pick up the rupee and give it to the poorest, neediest person in the audience. The devotee went from one dervish to another but none accepted the rupee. The devotee returned to Mian Mir with the rupee saying: \\"Master, none of the dervishes will accept the rupee. None is in need, it seems.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\n\\"Go and give this rupee to him,\\" said the faqir, pointing to Jahangir. \\"He is the poorest and most needy of the lot. Not content with a big kingdom, he covets the kingdom of the Deccan. For that, he has come all the way from Delhi to beg. His hunger is like a fire that burns all the more furiously with more wood. It has made him needy, greedy and grim. Go and give the rupee to him.\\"\\r\\nSai Mian Mir, holds a pivotal legendary place in Sikhism and in Sikh history. Sikh people around the world learn about him, his spiritual contribution and his place in Sikh history. A major Pakistani newspaper reporter described his recent visit to the shrine, \\"I met many Sikh Yatris who had come to pay homage to this great saint. Many of them were from Pakistan, while some had come from India. Mostly Sikh Yatris come here during the birthday celebration of Guru Nanak.\\"[5] The reporter asked the Sikh Yatris as to why they like to visit Mian Mir's shrine, \\"To us, Mian Mir Sahab is as divine as the saints of Sikhism. Sufis and Gurus, and their message, transcends geographical and cultural boundaries. They are the beacons of light.\\"[5]\\r\\nGuru Arjan Dev Ji, (1563 ÿ 1606) the fifth Sikh Guru, often visited Lahore, the birthplace of his father (the fourth Guru, Guru Ram Das) to meet his relatives. On the occasion of one of such visits, he called on Mian Mir. Both men eventually became close friends.[6] Mian Mir was a well-known saint. \\"Being a man of God, no barriers of caste or creed marked his thought. He loved those who loved God.\\"[6]\\r\\nGuru Arjan Dev was responsible for the construction of many public water tanks and buildings. In 1588, he planned to build a temple in the centre of the holy water tank called Amritsar or the pool of the nectar of immortality. As the temple was to be thrown open to people of all religions, castes, creeds and climes, he invited Mian Mir to lay the foundation stone of the Harmandir Sahib of Amritsar, the most sacred temple of Sikhs (now known worldwide as the Golden Temple).[6] Mian Mir came to the city of Amritsar wearing a religious mendicant's long cloak made up of patches of coarse wool and a cone-shaped cap, with a rose flower on top.\\r\\nMian Mir was given one of the warm welcomes for which Guru Arjan Dev was famous. The two holy men embraced each other in sincere love and regard. The purpose of the temple was disclosed to the Sufi saint. Mian Mir was delighted at the fine objectives the Guru had in mind. The foundation-stone was laid in January 1588.[7] \\"Never before and, for that matter, never after has the foundation stone of the highest religious seat of a religion ever been laid by the head of another religion. This remains the unique privilege of the Sikh temple.\\"[6][8]\\r\\nIn 1606, Guru Arjan Dev Ji was implicated in the affair of Prince Khusraw, who had rebelled against his father, Emperor Jahangir. He was imprisoned in the Lahore Fort and tortured. When Sai Mian Mir heard about it, he came to see the Guru. He found Guru Arjan Dev Ji calm and serene, having completely resigned himself to the will of God. Mian Mir suggested to Guru Ji whether he should intercede with Emperor Jahangir on his behalf. Guru Ji forbade him saying that God's will must have its course unchecked, as it was not proper to interfere with its working.[citation needed] Another intervention by Sai Mian Mir has been described according to the Sakhi (account of events) of Guru Arjan Dev Ji's arrest and torture. After he was tortured for several days, Mian Mir visited Guru Arjan Dev Ji, and when he saw the ghastly scene, he cried out and said, \\"O Master! I cannot bear to see these horrors inflicted on thee. If you permit me, I would demolish this tyrant rule\\" (Mian Mir is said to have possessed supernatural powers). The Guru smiled and asked Sai Mian Mir to look towards the skies. It is said that Mian Mir saw an immense number of Angels & Supernatural Beings begging the Guru's permission to destroy the wicked. The Guru addressed Mian Mir, \\".. This is the Will of my Master (God), and I cheerfully submit and surrender to His Sweet Will.\\"\\r\\nA couple of years after the death of Guru Arjan Dev Ji, his son and successor Guru Har Gobind, who was thirteen years of age was called on Mian Mir at Lahore.[citation needed]\\r\\nGuru Tegh Bahadur, the son of Guru Har Gobind Ji and the ninth Guru, as a child met Sai Mian Mir Ji who blessed him.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter having lived a long life of piety and virtuosity, Hazrat Mian Mir died on 22 August 1635 (7 Rabi' al-awwal, 1045 according to the Islamic Calendar). He was eighty-eight years old.\\r\\nHis funeral oration was read by Mughal prince Dara Shikoh, who was a highly devoted disciple of the Saint. There is a hospital named after him in his hometown Lahore, called Mian Mir Hospital.[9]\\r\\nHe was buried at a place which was about a mile from Lahore near Alamganj, that is at the south-east of the city. Hazrat Mian Mir's spiritual successor was Hazrat Mullah Shah Badakhshi.

To join the EU, a state needs to fulfil economic and political conditions called the Copenhagen criteria (after the Copenhagen summit in June 1993), which require a stable democratic government that respects the rule of law, and its corresponding freedoms and institutions. According to the Maastricht Treaty, each current member state and the European Parliament must agree to any enlargement.  The process of enlargement is sometimes referred to as European integration. This term is also used to refer to the intensification of co-operation between EU member states as national governments allow for the gradual harmonisation of national laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe EU's predecessor, the European Economic Community,[1] was founded with the Inner Six member states in 1958, when the Treaty of Rome came into force. Since then, the EU's membership has grown to twenty-eight, with the latest member state being Croatia, which joined in July 2013.  The most recent territorial enlargement of the EU was the incorporation of Mayotte in 2014. The most notable territorial reductions of the EU, and its predecessors, were the exit of Algeria upon independence in 1962 and the exit of Greenland in 1985.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2018, accession negotiations are under way with Serbia (since 2014), Montenegro (since 2012) and Turkey (since 2005).  Serbia and Montenegro have been described by President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and Enlargement commissioner Johannes Hahn as the front-runner candidates, and projected that they would join by 2025, during the next mandate of the European Commission.[2][3][4] Negotiations with Turkey have also been ongoing at a slower pace, particularly since the 2016 Turkish coup d'tat attempt due to objections from the EU to the Turkish government's response.[5]  Additionally, the United Kingdom is negotiating its withdrawal from the EU, following a referendum in which a majority voted in favour of leaving the EU.\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean Commission\\r\\n\\r\\nCouncil of the EU\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the EU treaties, membership of the European Union is open to \\"any European State which respects the values referred to in Article 2 and is committed to promoting them\\" (TEU Article 49).

These steps are primarily presided over by the European Commission (Enlargement Commissioner and DG Enlargement), but the actual negotiations are technically conducted between the Union's Member States and the candidate country.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore a country applies for membership it typically signs an association agreement to help prepare the country for candidacy and eventual membership. Most countries do not meet the criteria to even begin negotiations before they apply, so they need many years to prepare for the process. An association agreement helps prepare for this first step.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of the Western Balkans, a special process, the Stabilisation and Association Process exists to deal with the special circumstances there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a country formally applies for membership, the Council asks the Commission to prepare an opinion on the country's readiness to begin negotiations. The Council can then either accept or reject the Commission's opinion (The Council has only once rejected the Commission's opinion when the latter advised against opening negotiations with Greece).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Council agrees to open negotiations the screening process then begins. The Commission and candidate country examine its laws and those of the EU and determine what differences exist. The Council then recommends opening negotiations on \\"chapters\\" of law that it feels there is sufficient common ground to have constructive negotiations. Negotiations are typically a matter of the candidate country convincing the EU that its laws and administrative capacity are sufficient to execute European law, which can be implemented as seen fit by the member states. Often this will involve time-lines before the Acquis Communautaire (European regulations, directives & standards) has to be fully implemented.\\r\\n\\r\\nA chapter is said to be closed when both sides have agreed it has been implemented sufficiently, however it can still be re-opened if the Commission feels that the candidate has fallen out of compliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo assess progress achieved by countries in preparing for accession to the European Union, the European Commission submits regular reports (yearly) to the European Council. These serve as a basis for the Council to make decisions on negotiations or their extension to other candidates.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the negotiations are complete a treaty of accession will be signed, which must then be ratified by all of the member states of the Union, as well as the institutions of the Union, and the candidate country. Once this has been completed it will join the Union on the date specified in the treaty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire process, from application for membership to membership has typically taken about a decade, although some countries, notably Sweden, Finland, and Austria have been faster, taking only a few years. The process from application for association agreement through accession has taken far longer, as much as several decades (Turkey for example first applied for association in the 1950s and has yet to conclude accession negotiations).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is an example of an accession processEstonia's path to membership from the 2004 enlargement. Ease of accession depends on the state: how integrated it is with the EU before hand, the state of its economy and public institutions, any outstanding political issues with the EU and (historically) how much law to date the EU has built up that the acceding state must adopt. This outline also includes integration steps taken by the accession country after it attains membership.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnlargement has been one of the EU's most successful foreign policies,[10] yet has equally suffered from considerable opposition from the start. French President Charles de Gaulle opposed British membership[citation needed]. A later French President Fran?ois Mitterrand opposed Greek, Spanish and Portuguese membership fearing that the former dictatorships were not ready and it would reduce the union to a free-trade area.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reasons for the first member states to apply, and for them to be accepted, were primarily economic while the second enlargement was more political. The southern Mediterranean countries had just emerged from dictatorships and wanted to secure their democratic systems through the EEC, while the EEC wanted to ensure the same thing and that their southern neighbours were stable and aligned to NATO.[12] These two principal forces, economic gain and political security, have been behind enlargements since. However, with the recent large enlargements in 2004, public opinion in Europe has turned against further expansion.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has also been acknowledged that enlargement has its limits; the EU cannot expand endlessly.[10] Former Commission President Romano Prodi favoured granting \\"everything but institutions\\" to the EU's neighbour states; allowing them to co-operate deeply while not adding strain on the EU's institutional framework.[10] This has in particular been pushed by France and Germany as a privileged partnership for Turkey, membership for which has faced considerable opposition on cultural and logistical grounds.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was proposed by Robert Schuman in his declaration on 9 May 1950 and involved the pooling of the coal and steel industries of France and West Germany.[34] Half of the project states, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, had already achieved a great degree of integration amongst themselves with the organs of Benelux and earlier bilateral agreements. These five countries were joined by Italy and they all signed the Treaty of Paris on 23 July 1952. These six members, dubbed the 'inner six' (as opposed to the 'outer seven' who formed the European Free Trade Association who were suspicious of such plans for integration) went on to sign the Treaties of Rome establishing two further communities, together known as the European Communities when they merged their executives in 1967.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1962, Spain, ruled by the military dictator Francisco Franco, issued its first attempt to join the European Communities. Spanish Foreign Affairs minister Fernando Mara Castiella sent the request form to French Prime Minister Maurice Couve de Murville.[35] This request was rejected by all the member countries in 1964; Spain was not a democracy at the time, and thus unable to enter the EEC.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Community did see some loss of territory due to the decolonialisation occurring in their era. Algeria, which was an integral part of France, had a special relationship with the Community.[37] Algeria gained independence on 5 July 1962 and hence left the Community. There was no enlargement until the 1970s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Kingdom, which had refused to join as a founding member, changed its policy following the Suez crisis and applied to be a member of the Communities. Other EEC members were also inclined to British membership on those grounds. French President Charles de Gaulle vetoed British membership.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce de Gaulle had left office, the door to enlargement was once again opened. The EEC economy had also slowed down and British membership was seen as a way to revitalise the community.[12] Only after a 12-hour talk between British Prime Minister Edward Heath and French President Georges Pompidou took place did Britain's third application succeed.[38] After Britain was accepted Prime Minister Edward Heath said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"For my part, I have no doubt at all that the discussions which we have had will prove of real and lasting benefit, not only to Britain and France, but to Europe as a whole.\\"[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the deal for British entry, France agreed to allow the EEC its own monetary resources. However France made that concession only as Britain's small agriculture sector would ensure that Britain would be a net contributor to the Common Agricultural Policy dominated EEC budget.[12] Applying together with the UK, as on the previous occasions, were Denmark, Ireland, and Norway.[39] These countries were so economically linked to the UK that they considered it necessary to join the EEC if the UK did.[12] However the Norwegian government lost a national referendum on membership and hence did not accede with the others on 1 January 1973. Gibraltar joined the Community with the United Kingdom at this point, as can be seen in the long title of the UK European Communities Act 1972.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next enlargement would occur for different reasons. The 1970s also saw Greece, Spain, and Portugal emerge from dictatorship. These countries desired to consolidate their new democratic systems by binding themselves into the EEC. Equally, the EEC was unsure about which way these countries were heading and wanted to ensure stability along its southern borders.[12] However Fran?ois Mitterrand initially opposed their membership fearing they were not ready and it would water the community down to a free trade area.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreece joined the EU in 1981 followed by Spain and Portugal in 1986.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 1985, however, saw the first time a territory voted to leave the Community, when Greenland was granted home rule by Denmark and the territory used its new powers and voted to withdraw from the Community (See member state territories).\\r\\n\\r\\nMorocco and Turkey applied for membership in 1987. Morocco's application was turned down as it was not considered European, while Turkey's application was considered eligible on the basis of the 1963 Ankara Association Agreement, but the opinion of the Commission on the possible candidate status was by then negative. Turkey received candidate status only in 1999 and began official membership negotiations in 2005, which are still in progress as of 2018.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 1970s, Europe experienced a downturn which led to leaders launching of the Single European Act which set to create a single market by 1992. The effect of this was that EFTA states found it harder to export to the EEC and businesses (including large EFTA corporations such as Volvo) wished to relocate within the new single market making the downturn worse for EFTA. EFTA states began to discuss closer links with the EEC despite its domestic unpopularity.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustria, Finland and Sweden were neutral in the Cold War so membership of an organisation developing a common foreign and security policy would be incompatible with that. With the end of the Cold War in 1989, that obstacle was removed, and the desire to pursue membership grew stronger.[41] On 3 October 1990, the reunification of East and West Germany brought East Germany into the Community without increasing the number of member states.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Community later became the European Union in 1993 by virtue of the Maastricht Treaty, and established standards for new entrants so their suitability could be judged. These Copenhagen criteria stated in 1993 that a country must be a democracy, operate a free market, and be willing to adopt the entire body of EU law already agreed upon. Also in 1993 the European Economic Area was established with the EFTA states except Switzerland. Most of the new EEA states pursued full EU membership as the EEA did not sufficiently satisfy the needs of their export based corporations. The EU has also preferred these states to integrate via the EEA rather than full membership as the EEC wished to pursue monetary integration and did not wish for another round of enlargement to occupy their attention. However, with the EEA's credibility dented following rejection by businesses and Switzerland, the EU agreed with full membership. This was more readily accepted with the prospect of poorer countries wishing to join; contributions from richer countries would help balance the EU budget.[41] On 1 January 1995 Austria, Finland, and Sweden acceded to the EU marking its fourth enlargement. The Norwegian government lost a second national referendum on membership.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with the Mediterranean countries in the 1980s, the countries in Central and Eastern Europe had emerged from dictatorships and wanted to consolidate their democracies. They also wanted to join the project of European integration and ensure they did not fall back into the Russian sphere of influence. The EU and NATO offered a guarantee of this, and the EU was also seen as vital to ensuring the economic success of those countries. However, the EU's desire to accept these countries' membership applications was less than rapid. The collapse of communism came quickly and was not anticipated. The EU struggled to deal with the sudden reunification of Germany with the addition of its poorer 17 million people and, while keeping its monetary union project on track, it was still at that early stage pointing the EFTA countries in the direction of the EEA rather than full membership.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nStates in Central and Eastern Europe persisted and eventually the above-mentioned issues were cleared. The US also pressured the EU to offer membership as a temporary guarantee; it feared expanding NATO too rapidly for fear of frightening Russia. Although eventually trying to limit the number of members, and after encouragement from the US, the EU pursued talks with ten countries and a change of mind[clarification needed] by Cyprus and Malta helped to offset slightly the influx of large poorer member states from Central and Eastern Europe.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, eight Central and Eastern European countries (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia), plus two Mediterranean countries (Malta and Cyprus) were able to join on 1 May 2004. This was the largest single enlargement in terms of people, and number of countries, though not in terms of GDP.[43] The less developed nature of these countries was of concern to some of the older member states. Some countries, such as the UK, immediately opened their job market to the accession states, whereas most others placed temporary restrictions on the rights of work of the citizens of these states to their countries. The movement westward of some of the labour force of the newly acceded countries that occurred in the aftermath of the enlargement initially spawned clichs among the public opinion and media of some western countries (such as the \\"Polish plumber\\"), despite the generally conceded benefit to the economies concerned.[44] The official EU media (the speeches of the European Commission) frequently referred to the enlargement to the CEE region as \\"an historical opportunity\\" and \\"morally imperative\\", which reflected the desire of the EU to admit these countries as members, even though they were less developed than the Western European countries.[45]\\r\\nFollowing this Romania and Bulgaria, though were deemed initially as not fully ready by the Commission to join in 2004, acceded nevertheless on 1 January 2007. These, like the countries joining in 2004, faced a series of restrictions as to their citizens not fully enjoying working rights on the territory of some of the older EU members. Bulgaria and Romania are not yet members of the Schengen area; however, their citizens can travel visa-free to the other EU countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe socio-economic research on the attitudes towards the integration from both hosting and visiting countries has revealed divergent views.The analysis shows, there are a number of possible factors of the rationalization and understanding of the practices on what the enlargement has been and should be like. Attitudes of even skeptical citizens, do not discard the possibility on future sustainable enlargements. The years subsequent to the EU accession will lead to extensive dialogues between policy-makers, governments, and European citizens about the path for a constructive development.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2003 European Council summit in Thessaloniki set integration of the Western Balkans as a priority of EU expansion. The EU's relations with the Western Balkans states were moved from the \\"External Relations\\" to the \\"Enlargement\\" policy segment in 2005. Those states which have not been recognised as candidate countries are considered \\"potential candidate countries\\".[47] The move to Enlargement directorate was a consequence of the advancement of the Stabilisation and Association process.\\r\\n\\r\\nCroatia joined on 1 July 2013, following ratification of the 2011 Accession Treaty by all other EU countries.  Albania and the several successor states of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have all adopted EU integration as an aim of foreign policy. \\r\\n\\r\\nArticle 49 of the Maastricht Treaty (as amended) says that any European state that respects the \\"principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law\\", may apply to join the Union. The Copenhagen European Council set out the conditions for EU membership in June 1993 in the so-called Copenhagen criteria (see Criteria above for details). The Western Balkan states had to sign Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAAs) before applying for membership.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkey applied for membership in 1987.  The Western Balkans have been prioritised for membership since emerging from war during the breakup of Yugoslavia. Albania, Macedonia,[24] Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey are all recognized as official candidates, and the latter three are undergoing membership talks.[65] Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo*[66] are recognized as potential candidates for membership by the EU.[65]  Bosnia has submitted an application for EU membership, while Bosnia and Kosovo have an SAA with the EU.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2014, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker announced that the EU has no plans to expand in the next five years.[67] Juncker has described Serbia and Montenegro as front-runner candidates, and projected that they would join by 2025.[68][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 February 2018, the European Commission published its expansion plan,[70] which covers the six Western Balkan countries. The plan envisages that all six applicants could achieve accession as members of the European Union after 2025. In May 2018, Bulgaria - holding the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union - hosted a summit on the Western Balkans, which aimed to facilitate accession by the six, including enhanced regional security cooperation and regional connectivity.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was noteworthy that the Summit referred to 'partners' rather than states: this reflects the issue that Kosovo is only partially recognised as a state.[72] States that did not, in 2018, recognise Kosovo include fellow Western Balkan applicant, Serbia, and other EU members: Spain, Slovakia, Cyprus, Romania, and Greece. The European Commission is sensitive to the issue which was addressed in a speech by the EU's High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the European Parliament Plenary Session on the Western Balkan Strategy: \\" shared, unequivocal, concrete perspective for European Union integration for each and every one of the six partners. Each at its own pace, with its own specificities and under different conditions, but the direction is clear and is one \\"[73].\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all enlargement negotiations have ended with the accession of a new member state. Norway completed membership negotiations twice, in 1972 and 1994, but both times membership was rejected in a referendum. Switzerland applied for membership in May 1992 but subsequently froze its application,[74][75] and formally withdrew it in 2016.[76][77] Iceland lodged its application following an economic collapse in 2008, but froze accession negotiations in 2013. In 2017 however, Iceland's newly elected government announced that it may seek to begin talks with the EU on possible future membership once again.[78] However, this did not happen as the government only survived for eight months. New elections were called in October 2017, leading to a new left-right coalition government in November 2017. Following the elections, all the parties of the governing coalition oppose EU membership, along with two of the opposition parties, summing up to at least two-thirds of the MPs. Additionally, for more than eight years every single opinion poll published in Iceland has had a solid majority against joining the EU.[79]","input":"Which country was the last to join the eu?"},{"output":"near Rochester, New York","context":"Miniature golf, also known as minigolf, or putt-putt, is an offshoot of the sport of golf focusing solely on the putting aspect of its parent game. It is played on courses consisting of a series of holes (usually a multiple of 9) similar to its parent, but characterized by their short length (usually within 10 yards from tee to cup), the use of artificial putting surfaces such as carpet, astroturf and/or concrete, a geometric layout often requiring non-traditional putting lines such as bank shots, and artificial obstacles such as tunnels/tubes, ramps, concrete/metal/fiberglass forms, and moving obstacles such as windmills. When miniature golf retains many of these characteristics but without the use of any props or obstacles, it is purely a mini version of its parent game.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the international sports organization World Minigolf Sport Federation (WMF)[1] prefers to use the name \\"minigolf\\", the general public in different countries has also many other names for the game: miniature golf, mini-golf, midget golf, goofy golf, shorties, extreme golf, crazy golf, adventure golf, mini-putt, putter golf and so on. The name Putt-Putt is the trademark of an American company[2] that builds and franchises miniature golf courses in addition to other family-oriented entertainment, and the term \\"putt-putt\\" is sometimes used colloquially to refer to the game itself. The term \\"Minigolf\\" was formerly a registered trademark of a Swedish company that built its own patented type of minigolf courses. Resort towns such as Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Branson, Missouri; Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; and Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin are known for their numerous minigolf courses.[3]\\r\\nGeometrically-shaped minigolf courses made of artificial materials (carpet) began to emerge during the early 20th century. The earliest documented mention of such a course is in the 8 June 1912 edition of The Illustrated London News, which introduces a minigolf course called Gofstacle.[4]\\r\\nThe first standardized minigolf courses to enter commercial mass-production were the Thistle Dhu (\\"This'll Do\\") course 1916 in Pinehurst, North Carolina, and the 1927 Tom Thumb patent of Garnet Carter from Lookout Mountain, Tennessee. Thomas McCulloch Fairbairn (inventor), a golf fanatic, revolutionized the game in 1922 with his formulation of a suitable artificial greena mixture of cottonseed hulls, sand, oil, and dye. With this discovery, miniature golf became accessible everywhere; by the late 1920s there were over 150 rooftop courses in New York City alone, and tens of thousands across the United States.[5] This American minigolf boom of early 20th century came to an end during the economic depression in the late 1930s. Nearly all minigolf courses in the United States were closed and demolished before the end of the 1930s.[6] A rare surviving example from this period is the Parkside Whispering Pines Miniature Golf Course located near Rochester, New York, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.[7]\\r\\nThe first miniature golf course in Canada was at the Maples Inn in Pointe-Claire, Quebec. The \\"Mapes\\" was constructed as a summer home in the 1890s but was renovated into a club in 1902, opened to the public in 1914, and had a miniature golf course in 1930. The popular nightspot burned in 1985. (See: West Island Chronicle, June 29, 2008.)\\r\\nOne of the first documented minigolf courses in mainland Europe was built in 1926 by Fr. Schr?der in Hamburg, Germany. Mr. Schr?der had been inspired by his visit to the United States, where he had seen minigolf courses spreading across the country.[8]\\r\\nIn 1930 Edwin O. Norrman and Eskil Norman returned to Sweden from the United States, where they had stayed for several years and witnessed the golden days of the American minigolf boom. In 1931 they founded a company \\"Norman och Norrmans Miniatyrgolf\\", and began manufacturing standardized minigolf courses for the Swedish market. During the following years they spread this new leisure activity across Sweden, by installing minigolf courses in public parks and other suitable locations.[8]\\r\\nSwedish minigolf courses typically had a rectangular wooden frame surrounding the playing area made of tennis field sand[9] (while the American manufacturers used newly developed and patented felt as the surface of their minigolf courses). Felt did not become popular as a surface material in Sweden until in the mid-1960sbut since then it has become practically the only surface material used in Scandinavia and Britain, due to its favorable playing qualities in wet weather. (Minigolf courses with a felt surface can be played in rainy weather, because water soaks through the felt into the ground. The other commonly used surface materials, beton and eternite, cannot be used in rainy weather, because the rainwater pools on them, stopping the ball from rolling.)\\r\\nThe Swedish Minigolf Federation (Svenska Bangolff?rbundet)[10] was founded in 1937, being the oldest minigolf sport organization in the world. National Swedish championships in minigolf have been played yearly since 1939.[11] In other countries minigolf sport federations were not founded until the late 1950s, due to the post-war economical depression.\\r\\nIn 1954, the minigolf course in Ascona (Switzerland) opened, the oldest course worldwide following the norms of Paul Bongni.\\r\\nThe earliest documented minigolf competitions were played in the United States. The first National Tom Thumb Open minigolf tournament was arranged in 1930, with a total cash purse $10,000 (the top prize being $2,000). Qualification play-offs were played in all of the 48 states, and the final competition on Lookout Mountain, Chattanooga, Tennessee attracted over 200 players representing thirty states.[12] After the Depression ten years later, minigolf died out as a competition sport in America, and has begun to recover only during the most recent decades. The American minigolf sport boom of the 1930s inspired many European countries, and the sport of minigolf lived on in Europe even after the American game fell into Depression.\\r\\nIn 1938 Joseph and Robert Taylor from Binghamton, New York started building and operating their own miniature golf courses. These courses differed from the ones in the late 20s and early 30s; they were no longer just rolls, banks, and curves, with an occasional pipe thrown in. Their courses not only had landscaping, but also obstacles, including windmills, castles, and wishing wells.\\r\\nImpressed by the quality of the courses, many customers asked if the Taylors would build a course for them. By the early 1940s, Joe and Bob formed Taylor Brothers, and were in the business of building miniature golf courses and supplying obstacles to the industry. During both the Korean and Vietnam Wars, many a G.I. played on a Taylor Brothers prefabricated course that the U.S. Military had contracted to be built and shipped overseas.\\r\\nBy the late 50s almost all supply catalogs carried Taylor Brothers' obstacles. In 1961 Bob Taylor, Don Clayton of Putt-Putt, and Frank Abramoff of Arnold Palmer Miniature Golf organized the first miniature golf association known as NAPCOMS (or the \\"National Association of Putting Course Operators, Manufacturers, and Suppliers\\"). Their first meeting was held in New York City. Though this organization only lasted a few years it was the first attempt to bring miniature golf operators together to promote miniature golf.\\r\\nIn 1955, Lomma Golf, Inc., founded by Al Lomma and his brother Ralph Lomma, led the revival of wacky, animated trick hazards. These hazards required both accurately aimed shots and split-second timing to avoid spinning windmill blades, revolving statuary, and other careening obstacles.\\r\\nThe book Tilting At Windmills (How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love Sport) by Andy Miller tells the story of the formerly sports-hating author attempting to change by competing in miniature golf, including events in Denmark and Latvia.\\r\\nIn the United States, National Miniature Golf Day is held yearly on the second Saturday of May. The event had its inaugural celebration on May 12, 2007, and was officially recognized and published in 2008's edition of Chase's Calendar of Events.\\r\\nMinigolf has so far not reached wide popularity outside Europe and North America.[citation needed] The reason is probably economic, at least to some extent: the less wealthy countries invest their limited sports funds into such sports that enjoy widest public attention and media coverage, leaving the less popular sports with little or no funding at all. (Minigolf is one of the most popular outdoor games in Europe and America, though, but only as an occasional leisure activity, not as a competitive sport.)\\r\\nBy the 1950s the American Putt-Putt company was exporting their minigolf courses to South Africa, Australia, Japan, Korea, India, Iran, Italy, Pakistan, Argentina, Brazil, and the Eastern Bloc.[13] Minigolf courses are found in all parts of the world, but their popularity is by far highest in the USA, the UK, New Zealand, Scandinavia, and central Europe.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe sport of miniature golf is governed internationally by the World Minigolf Sport Federation (WMF), headquartered in G?teborg, Sweden. The WMF is a member of SportAccord. It organises World Championships for youth and elite players, and Continental Championships in Europe, Asia and the USA, held in alternate years.\\r\\nAll competitions approved by World Minigolfsport Federation are played on standardized courses, whose design has been checked to be suitable for competitive play. The WMF currently approves four different course types:\\r\\nThe world record on one round of minigolf is 18 strokes on 18 holes. More than a thousand players have officially achieved this score on eternite. On other playing systems a perfect round of 18 holes-in-one is extremely rare, and has never been scored in an official national or international tournament. Unofficial 18-rounds on concrete and felt courses have been reported in Sweden.[18]\\r\\nIn addition to classical outdoor miniature golf, indoor \\"glow in the dark\\" miniature golf has achieved some popularity, especially in colder climates like Canada[19] and Finland.[20] It can be played throughout the year, and climate control allows building elaborate obstacles that would not withstand inclement weather. There are also a variety of portable miniature golf fairways or 'tracks'[21] that can be set up as temporary courses indoors or outdoors. The fairways are usually constructed of wooden or glass fibre frames. Portable fairways are often used for summer festivals and fairs, corporate events, team-building events, and product launches.\\r\\nThe 18th and final holes of many miniature golf courses are designed to literally capture the ball, effectively preventing the player from playing additional rounds without purchasing another game. This may be accomplished with a \\"drain\\" or trap-door hole setup that channels the ball to a lockbox. One popular method of theming the 18th hole in the United States is to use a gated, ramped target area depicting the face of a clown; if the ball lands \\"in\\" the clown's nose, a bell might sound and the player would win a discount ticket for another game.\\r\\nNearly all European countries have an official national federation for promoting minigolf as a competition sport. The bi-annual European Championships attract competitors from more than twenty European countries. As of 2012, Chris Beattie has been the holder of the European Championship title.[22] Outside Europe only a small number of countries have participated in international minigolf competitions. These countries include USA, Japan, China, India and Taiwan. A national minigolf federation exists also in Moldova, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, but none of these countries has ever participated in international competitions, and probably are not arranging many domestic competitions either.[23]\\r\\nWorld Minigolfsport Federation represents some 40,000 registered competition players from 37 countries.[24] The national minigolf federation of Germany has 11,000 members with a competing license,[25] and the Swedish federation has 8,000 registered competition players.[18] Other strong minigolf countries include Austria and Switzerland, each having a few thousand licensed competition players. Also Italy, Czech Republic and Netherlands have traditionally been able to send a strong team to international championships, even if they cannot count their licensed players in thousands.\\r\\nThe sceptre of competitive minigolf rests quite firmly in mainland Europe: no player from other countries (such as UK, USA, Japan et cetera) has ever reached even the top 50 in World Championships (in men's category).[22] Nearly all national federations outside Europe were founded only quite recently (within the last 10 years), and it will take time before the players of these countries learn all secrets of the game. USA has a longer history of minigolf competitions, but the standardized European competition courses are practically unknown in USA, and therefore the American players have been unable to learn the secrets of European minigolf. On the traditional American courses the best American players are able to challenge the European top players into a tough and exciting competition.[26]\\r\\nThe British Minigolf Association (BMGA) has an additional ÿ and quite surprising ÿ problem on their way to greater success in competitive minigolf. While the minigolf federations in mainland Europe receive annual funding from the government, in England the national sports organisation Sport England has refused to accept BMGA as its member ÿ which means that BMGA is left without the public funding that other forms of sports enjoy. The rules of Sport England declare that only one variant of each sport can be accepted as member ÿ and minigolf is interpreted as a variant of golf.[24]\\r\\nNo person is known to be earning his living by competing in minigolf. Many course owners and employees naturally earn their living by working at minigolf courses, and some of the best minigolf players earn their living from minigolf-related work, such as giving putting lessons to golf players.[27] Many miniature golf courses also offer other forms of entertainment such as carousels, go-cart tracks, batting cages, and redemption arcades.\\r\\nThe highest money prizes are paid in the United States, where the winner of a major competition may earn up to 5,000 US dollars. In mainland Europe the money prizes are generally quite low, and in many cases honor is the only thing at stake in the competition. International championships usually award no money prizes at all.\\r\\nIn the US there are two organizations offering national tournaments: the Professional Putters Association and the US Pro Mini-Golf Association (USPMGA). The USPMGA represents the United States in the World Minigolfsport Federation, having been an active member since 1995. USPMGA President Robert Detwiler is also the WMF representative for North and South America.\\r\\nNew Israeli Minigolf Association was established in February 2010 in Israel. Setting up, for the first time, league playing according to the rules of WMF and USPMGA. Now, a series of lush and inviting minigolf parks in prime locations are building around Israel and will be offering this need of adventure to the public at very attractive surrounding.\\r\\nWorld Minigolfsport Federation (WMF), a member of AGFIS, organises World Championships biennially (on odd-numbered years), while the continental championships in Europe and Asia are organized on even-numbered years. Many of these competitions are arranged for three age groups: juniors (under 20 years), adults (no age limit), and seniors (over 45 years).[28] Men and women compete separately in their own categories, except in some team competitions and pair competitions. The difference in the playing skills of men and women is very small on top level, however: it is not unheard-of that the best player in a major international tournament is female. Typically the winner in women's category would be very close to medals also in men's category.[29]\\r\\nWorld and European Championships have so far never been arranged on MOS courses (which are popular in USA and UK, and were approved by WMF for competition use only a few years ago). International competitions are typically arranged on two courses of 18 holes, of which one course is eternite, and the other course is usually concrete, less commonly felt. In the future, the WMF is expected to use also MOS courses in international championships ÿ which will give American and British players a chance to show their skills on their own traditional course types.\\r\\nThe most prestigious MOS minigolf competitions in the world are the US Masters, US Open, British Open, Kent Open, World Crazy Golf Championships and the World Adventuregolf Masters.","input":"Where is the worlds oldest mini golf located?"},{"output":"The Battle of Verdun","context":"","input":"What was the longest lasting military engagement of ww2?"},{"output":"7,102 at the 2010 U.S. Census","context":"Ocean City (OC or OCMD), officially the Town of Ocean City, is an Atlantic resort town in Worcester County, Maryland. Ocean City is widely known in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States and is a frequent destination for vacationers in that area. The population was 7,102 at the 2010 U.S. Census, although during summer weekends the city hosts between 320,000 and 345,000 vacationers, and up to 8 million visitors annually.[4] During the summer, Ocean City becomes the second most populated municipality in Maryland, after Baltimore.[citation needed] It is part of the Salisbury metropolitan area.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land upon which the city was built, as well as much of the surrounding area, was obtained by Englishman Thomas Fenwick from the Native Americans.

They came to fish off the shore, to enjoy the natural beauty of the Atlantic Ocean pounding against the long strip of sandy beach, to collect seashells, or just to sit back and watch the rolling surf.\\r\\nSoon after, other simple boarding houses were built on the strip of sand, with the activity attracting prominent businessmen from the Maryland Eastern Shore, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Wilmington. They came not so much to visit as to survey the spit. A decision was made to develop it and 250 lots were cut into it, and a corporation was formed to help with the development of the land. The corporation stock of 4,000 shares sold for $25 each.\\r\\nPrior to 1870, what is now Ocean City was known as \\"The Ladies' Resort to the Ocean.\\"\\r\\nThe Atlantic Hotel, the first major hotel in the town, opened July 4, 1875. The Atlantic Hotel was originally owned by the Atlantic Hotel Company, but eventually Charles W. Purnell bought it in 1923. It is still currently owned and operated by the Purnell family.[5] Besides the beach and ocean, it offered dancing and billiard rooms to the visitors of its more than 400 rooms, and for years it was the northern-most attraction in Ocean City. By 1878 tourists could come by the Wicomico & Pocomoke Railroad from Berlin to the shores of Sinepuxent Bay across from the town. By 1881, a line was completed across Sinepuxent Bay to the shore, bringing rail passengers on the Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railroad directly into the town to a train station on Philadelphia Avenue and returning to larger city markets with locally caught fish from Ocean City.\\r\\nThe Ocean City Inlet was formed during a significant hurricane in 1933, which also destroyed the train tracks across the Sinepuxent Bay. The inlet separated what is now Ocean City from Assateague Island. The Army Corps of Engineers took advantage of nature's intervention and made the inlet at the south end of Ocean City permanent. The inlet eventually helped to establish Ocean City as an important Mid-Atlantic fishing port as it offered easy access to the fishing grounds of the Atlantic Ocean.\\r\\nIn the late 1930s, the Army Corps of Engineers dredged a new channel on the bayside of Ocean City to allow larger boats to have access to Sinepuxent Bay. The dredge was pumped back onto the western shore of Ocean City allowing the creation of Chicago Avenue and St. Louis Avenue, leading to new development where previously only marshland had been.[6]\\r\\nOcean City has become a well-known city in Maryland due to the rapid expansion of Ocean City that took place during the post-war boom. In 1952, with the completion of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, Ocean City became easily accessible to people in the BaltimoreÿWashington metropolitan area. In 1964, with the completion of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, a whole new pathway to the south was opened. Ocean City became one of the largest vacation areas of the East Coast.\\r\\nBy the 1970s, big business flourished and gave birth to the construction of more than 15,000 condominium units, creating a spectacular sight of high-rise condominiums that assured every investor of a glimpse of the ocean and pounding surf. However, throughout the 1980s, and into the 1990s, the width of the beach began to shrink, prompting the first of a series of beach replenishment projects.\\r\\nThe original pier was destroyed by a fire in 1994. There was a small water park and giant walk-through haunted house with live actors near the end of the pier and a New Orleans-style Hollywood in Wax Museum on the boardwalk side. In the late 1980s the Wax Museum was turned into a Photon laser tag arena. The building now houses the Ripley's Believe it or Not! museum.\\r\\nIn 2002, Ocean City undertook the most recent of many, multimillion-dollar, beach restoration programs, in an attempt to slow the westward migration of its beaches. The program pumped tons of sand from offshore and deposited it onto the beach. A dune line was also re-established in front of Ocean City's building line. Another similar project began after the 2006 tourist season closed.\\r\\nThe Sandy Point Site and St. Paul's by-the-sea Protestant Episcopal Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[7]\\r\\nToday, the Ocean City area continues to sprawl westward across the bay and toward Berlin and Ocean Pines. It was part of the Ocean Pines Micropolitan Statistical Area until that was subsumed by the Salisbury Metropolitan Area. The resort area accommodates approximately 8 million visitors per year.[8]\\r\\nThe town supports a year-round population of about 8,000, with the town itself being a major employer. Summer employment in Ocean City rises many multiples above that level, supported by a large number of college-age and young adultsmany native to Eastern Europe and Irelandattracted by numerous job opportunities. In the summer, businesses and government agencies are augmented with about 100 seasonal police officers, plus extra firefighters and other workers.\\r\\nTourism in the off-season has picked up pace over the past decade. Today, Ocean City, Maryland has become one of the most popular vacation areas of the East Coast. Warmer months like June, July, and August attract the most tourists due to the opening of the beaches as well as the many different activities available to do. A \\"shoulder-season\\" has been established that ranges in the spring from St. Patrick's Day until Memorial Day Weekend and in the fall from Labor Day Weekend until late October. Many establishments stay open into November and December depending on local events and weather. Numerous special events take place within the town during this shoulder-season, including Sunfest, Springfest, Bike Week, Cruisin' Weekend, Winterfest of Lights and Reach the Beach, which take place on the Boardwalk and/or in the Roland E. Powell Convention Center. Increased traffic from golfers and these special events have convinced many seasonal restaurants and hotels to open sooner and close down later in the year.\\r\\nIn 2006, the city erected the Ocean City Firefighter's Memorial to honor local firefighters as well as firefighters who died in the September 11 attacks. In addition to a statue of a firefighter, the monument incorporates a piece of steel beam from one of the towers destroyed at the World Trade Center.[9] Ocean City is home to the annual Maryland State Firefighters Convention. This is a week-long event in June, that honors the state's firefighters with events and contests at the Convention Center, and ends with a parade.\\r\\nNorth Ocean City houses many high-rise beachfront condominiums and hotels such as Century I, The Sea Watch, The Pyramid, The Plaza, Golden Sands Club, and The Carousel. This area is easily recognizable because of its city-like skyline. Restaurants and retail stores stretch north from the Inlet area all the way to Fenwick Island, DE.\\r\\nOcean City now extends just more than 9?mi (14?km) from the southern inlet to the Delaware line. The strip now supports hotels, motels, apartment houses, shopping centers, residential communities, and condominiums. The southern tip houses the Ocean City Boardwalk. The boardwalk is the main shopping district and entertainment area of the town. The boardwalk has many prominent businesses including Fisher's Caramel Popcorn and Thrashers French Fries. Other notable boardwalk businesses are Dolle's Salt Water Taffy, the Atlantic Stand, and Dumser's Dairyland. The Boardwalk has two amusement parks, Trimpers Rides and The Pier, which was recently renamed Jolly Roger at The Pier, after its sister uptown local amusement park. The downtown neighborhood, Old Town, is marked by Victorian style houses and other older buildings, many of which have been razed in recent years to construct more parking lots, hotels, and condos.\\r\\nOcean City has a long history of fishing, both commercial and recreational. The town bills itself as the \\"White Marlin Capital of the World.\\" During the summer numerous charter and private boats fish for billfish, tuna, wahoo, and other game fish. In early August, one of the largest fishing tournaments in the world, the White Marlin Open, is held. Prize money for the largest White Marlin, Blue Marlin, and Tuna can range over 1 million dollars.\\r\\nOcean City is located at 382329N 750411W? / ?38.391526N 75.069712W? / 38.391526; -75.069712.[10]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.37 square miles (94.20?km2), of which, 4.41 square miles (11.42?km2) is land and 31.96 square miles (82.78?km2) is water.[1]\\r\\nOcean City is on the barrier spit called Fenwick Island, which encompasses Ocean City, South Bethany, Delaware, and Fenwick Island, Delaware. Ocean City's southern point is an inlet formed by the 1933 ChesapeakeÿPotomac hurricane. Rainfall and tides swelled the rivers and bays surrounding Ocean City until the overflowing water cut a 50-foot crevasse from the bay to the ocean. Ocean City businessmen had long sought funding to create an inlet to support a harbor, so residents seized upon the opportunity and built jetties to ensure the city's land remained divided from what is now Assateague Island.[11]\\r\\nOcean City has a humid subtropical climate (K?ppen Cfa), with hot, humid summers, cool winters, and precipitation fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. Due to its location on the Atlantic coast, daytime temperatures in spring and summer are moderated, with an average of only 10 days annually reaching 90?F (32?C). Conversely, in winter there is an average of 5.8 days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing.The temperature usually falls between 27 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit, and is very rare to ever fall below 16 degrees Fahrenheit or rise above 91 degrees Fahrenheit. However, in 2010 the temperature rose to 103 degrees Fahrenheit, which was the highest recorded temperature in history. The coldest temperature ever recorded was -6 degrees Fahrenheit in 1957. The prominence of the Outer Banks of North Carolina to the south means direct hits from tropical storms and hurricanes are rare, although they sometimes brush the area.\\r\\nAs of the census[2] of 2010, there were 7,102 people, 3,852 households, and 1,784 families residing in the town.

The Mayor is elected at-large to two-year terms while the City Council is elected at-large to staggered four-year terms. The City Council elects a Council President who presides over and sets the agenda for City Council meetings. The Mayor represents the town to state and local agencies. Both the Mayor and City Council hire a City Manager who is in charge of all daily operations of the town and serves as its chief financial officer.[16] As of 2017, the Mayor of Ocean City is Rick Meehan and the members of City Council are Council President Lloyd Martin, Council Secretary Mary Knight, Dennis Dare, Tony DeLuca, John Gehrig Jr., Wayne Hartman, and Matt James.[17]\\r\\nPolice services in Ocean City is provided by the Ocean City Police Department, which consists of 105 full-time officers and between 100 and 110 seasonal officers.[18] Fire protection in Ocean City is provided by the Ocean City Fire Department, which consists of over 200 volunteer members and over 100 career members.[19]\\r\\nOcean City's elections are non-partisan.\\r\\nOcean City Municipal Airport, located 3 miles (4.8?km) west of downtown Ocean City serves general aviation and charter aircraft. Full service FBO available at this airport, as well as FAA and Cessna Pilot Center approved flight school.[20] Nearby Salisbury-Ocean City Wicomico Regional Airport provides commercial air service for Ocean City.\\r\\nOcean City has only a single major north?south thoroughfare, Maryland Route 528, known as the Coastal Highway for most of its length, and as Philadelphia Avenue at its southern end. MD 528 continues north into Delaware as Delaware Route 1. Between S. 1st Street and 33rd Street, Philadelphia Avenue is paralleled by Baltimore Avenue to the east, which is unsigned Maryland Route 378 south of 15th Street. In downtown Ocean City, Baltimore Avenue is one-way northbound and Philadelphia Avenue is one-way southbound. Most east-west streets are numbered, starting at N. Division Street in the south, and continue until 146th Street at the Delaware/Maryland border. Between S. Division Street and N. Division Street are several streets named after counties on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. South of S. Division Street is S. 1st Street and S. 2nd Street at the Ocean City Inlet. Locations in the city are usually given as Oceanside (east of Coastal Highway) or Bayside (west of Coastal Highway).\\r\\nThree bridges connect the spit to the mainland. U.S. Route 50 crosses the Harry W. Kelley Memorial Bridge and connects to MD 528 at N. Division Street. Ocean City is the eastern terminus of US 50. Near Sacramento, California along US 50 is a mileage sign stating the distance to Ocean City, MD as 3,073 miles (4,946?km). Maryland Route 90, a two-lane freeway, crosses the Assawoman Bay Bridge and connects to MD 528 at 62nd Street. Delaware Route 54 can also be used to reach Ocean City, as it meets Coastal Highway just north of the border.\\r\\nThe Hugh T. Cropper Inlet Parking Lot is located just north of the Ocean City Inlet adjacent to the beach and boardwalk and offers 1,200 spaces, with paid parking from April to October. The West Ocean City Park and Ride offers free parking, with bus service into Ocean City.[21] There are several smaller paid parking lots and on-street parking enforced by parking meters in the downtown area along with a few paid parking lots in the northern part of Ocean City.[22]\\r\\nOcean City also has a public transportation system referred to as the \\"Beach Bus\\". The Coastal Highway Beach Bus runs along pretty much the entire length of the city 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The bus begins at the South Division Street Transit Center near the Ocean City Inlet and follows Baltimore Avenue northbound and Philadelphia Avenue southbound through downtown Ocean City to 15th Street. From here, the Beach Bus follows Philadelphia Avenue north to 33rd Street and continues north along Coastal Highway to 145th Street near the Delaware border, reaching its northern terminus at the 144th Street Transit Center. There is also a park-and-ride service into Ocean City from the West Ocean City Park and Ride. Patrons can park their cars at the Park and Ride's lot in West Ocean City off U.S. Route 50 and take a separate bus into the city to connect with the Coastal Highway Beach Bus at the South Division Street Transit Center. This service also serves the Tanger Outlets in West Ocean City.[23] During the summer season, the city hires additional operators for the highest periods of ridership. These seasonal bus drivers are frequently retirees from other transit authorities as well as school bus drivers across the state of Maryland who are off during the summer season while schools are not in session.\\r\\nOcean City's transit service connects with Shore Transit where patrons can travel to or from destinations on the Eastern Shore such as Salisbury on Route 203 and Pocomoke City on Route 503. This connection point is the West Ocean City Park and Ride in the summer and the S. Division Street transit center in the offseason.[24][25][26][27] Shore Transit also operates the seasonal Route 593 from the West Ocean City Park and Ride to Ocean Downs, Ocean Pines, and the Walmart in Berlin between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day.[28] Between Mid-May and Mid-September, DART First State's Beach Bus Route 208 bus also connects Ocean City transit at the 144th Street transit center with the Delaware Beaches, running to the Rehoboth Beach Park and Ride. Here, connections can be made with other Beach Bus routes, regular DART service, or shuttle service from the Cape May-Lewes Ferry to Cape May, New Jersey.[29] Greyhound Lines provides intercity bus service between the Baltimore Greyhound Terminal in Baltimore and the West Ocean City Park and Ride, with service on the portion between Salisbury and Ocean City operated by Shore Transit. BayRunner Shuttle offers shuttle service from the Baltimore-Washington International Airport and the BWI Rail Station to the West Ocean City Park and Ride.[30]\\r\\nThe Ocean City Transits fleet consists mainly of Thomas built buses. The CL960 model and the TL960 model both in 40-foot (12?m) lengths. They do run Eldorado National XHF buses in a 35-foot (11?m) length which run on Coastal Highway in the off season and the West Ocean City Park and Ride in the summer season. Ocean City did purchase a new order of at least 8 Blue Bird Xcel 102s in a 40-foot (12?m) length recently. They were purchased to replace the oldest set of Thomas built buses on the Ocean City fleet, which were also numbered as 270s. In past years, Ocean City received somewhere about 10-17 Articulated buses that are being retired by MTA Maryland which were built by North American Bus Industries in 1995-96. The buses were frequently borrowed every summer to maintain the increase in ridership and crowding of their current 40-foot vehicles.\\r\\nOcean City also maintains a fleet of open-air shuttles which run along the Boardwalk called the Boardwalk Tram. The trams run the entire length of the boardwalk from S. Division Street to 27th Street between Memorial Day weekend and the middle of September, and also during special event weekends such as Springfest or Sunfest. South of 5th Street, the tram has a separate concrete path it runs on parallel to the boardwalk. North of this, a marked lane down the middle of the boardwalk warns pedestrians of the shuttle. Passengers board and alight at any point along the route by notifying the driver.[23]\\r\\nDelmarva Power provides electricity to Ocean City.[31] Sandpiper Energy, a subsidiary of Chesapeake Utilities, provides natural gas to the town.[32][33] The Town of Ocean City Municipal Water Department provides water to the town, operating 25 wells, 3 treatment plants, 6 above-ground storage tanks, and an underground storage tank.[34] The Public Works department provides wasterwater service to Ocean City, operating the Ocean City Wastewater Treatment Plant.[35] Trash and recycling collection in Ocean City is handled by the Public Works department, with the town's trash transported by Covanta Energy to the Energy Resource Recovery Facility in Fairfax, Virginia, a waste-to-energy plant.[36][37]\\r\\nThe Ocean City Boardwalk currently runs from South 2nd Street at the Ocean City Inlet in South Ocean City (by the Ocean City Life Saving Museum) up to 27th Street in South Ocean City. The boardwalk is home to food, shops, arcades, and amusements.[38] Originally called the \\"Atlantic Avenue\\", the first Ocean City boardwalk was constructed in 1902. After being damaged by a storm in 1962, the boardwalk was rebuilt to stretch a total of 2.25 miles, which is still its current length today. Many years later the boardwalk would suffer extensive storm damage during Hurricane Gloria in 1985 which pummeled Ocean City with 89 MPH winds, however the boardwalk was refurbished and a concrete sea wall was soon constructed following the storm to prevent further damage, and the aftermath of Hurricane Gloria led to the first phase of extensive beach replenishment projects in Ocean City. It wouldn't be until 2012, that the Ocean City Boardwalk was damaged again as a result of Hurricane Sandy. The boardwalk was flooded and half of it was destroyed as a result of the water coming so far onto shore.[39] The boardwalk has since been rebuilt back to its original length and still attracts many tourists & families. As a historical landmark the Ocean City boardwalk has been consistently rated as one of the \\"best boardwalks for food\\" in USA Today, and was rated one of the Top Ten Boardwalks to Visit in the US by National Geographic. Also located in South Ocean City is Trimper's Rides amusement park. Trimper's Rides is a historic amusement park that was founded in 1893 as \\"The Windsor Resort\\", and is over 100 years old. The famous Trimper's Carousel (first built in the 1920s), was voted one of the \\"Best Carousels in America\\" by Travel & Leisure in 2012,[40] and is one of the oldest running carousels operating today in the world.\\r\\nThe Midtown section of Ocean City stretches from 28th Street to 90th Street and is home to dining along the bay and nightlife.[38] Located in Midtown are the Jolly Roger Amusement Park and the Roland E. Powell Convention Center.\\r\\nNorth Ocean City stretches from 91st Street up to the Delaware border at 146th Street. This section of the city has numerous condos along with movie theaters. North Ocean City is also the location of Northside Park, which has sports fields, gyms, a playground, and a jogging path.[38] With a greater number of tourists visiting Ocean City during the summer months from the neighboring Washington DC, Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Western & Northern Maryland areas, many high rise condominiums were first built in North Ocean City in the 1970s over-looking the Atlantic Ocean. The high rise condominiums are currently located in North Ocean City, starting with the 21 story 9400 up on 94th St and continue up to the Carousel on 118th St. Many of these buildings are over 20 stories tall and offer some of the best oceanfront views of the Atlantic Ocean in the area, and several of the high rise condominiums now feature upscale amenities such as spas, restaurants, indoor & outdoor pools as well. The highest of the high rise condominiums in Ocean City is the 25-floor Century I Condominiums.[41]\\r\\nIn Ocean City, there have been several shark sightings. More and more sharks have been spotted close to shore on beaches in Delaware and Ocean City. Some biologists believe that this may be a result of the fishermen who are attempting to catch sand sharks through bait that they have placed in the ocean. Besides sand sharks, there have been sightings of Tiger Sharks as well. On August 1, 2014, a 12.8 foot long, 1,000-pound tiger shark was spotted in the middle of the Isle of Wight Bay, located in Ocean City. The female shark was nicknamed Septima by scientists, and has traveled over thousands of miles along the East Coast since being tagged in South Carolina.[42] However, even though there has been an increase in shark sightings, there havent been any recorded fatalities from shark attacks in Ocean City, Maryland. North Ocean City in recent years has seen more deer sightings and red foxes as well as development has increased on the barrier island as well.[43]\\r\\nThere are many historic landmarks located in Ocean City, Maryland. Some historical sites include the anchor from the Sailboat Wreck, the original Atlantic Hotel and the Ocean City Life Saving Station Museum.\\r\\nThe anchor from the Sailboat Wreck is located on the Ocean City Boardwalk. The anchor, which is 2 ? tons, was recovered from the Sailboat Wreck in 1870 by the commercial clam vessel Star Light.[44] It is now located on the boardwalk for people to admire the history of it. The Atlantic Hotel, located at 401 S Baltimore Ave, is another historical site that is also still open for business. After a fire that destroyed the original and first ever hotel in Ocean City, Maryland, the Atlantic Hotel was rebuilt in 1926 and is one of the oldest and most historic hotels in Ocean City.[45] The Ocean City Life-Saving Station Museum is another historical site originally called the Ocean City Life-Saving Station. The station was part of the coastal system and was important for the saving of vessels and lives in distress. It was built in 1891, and after much debate over having it demolished, the station was saved and eventually dedicated as a museum in 1978. The museum attracts people due to the interesting facts and exhibits of ocean life, nature, and life-saving services.[46]\\r\\nOcean City is known for its \\"Senior Week\\" activities. Recently graduated high school seniors from Maryland and surrounding states travel to Ocean City to spend a week with friends and away from parental supervision. Senior Week traditionally begins the first week after graduation. The Town of Ocean City has a \\"Play it Safe\\" campaign with scheduled events to keep the graduates safe.[47] There are also a number of other events that take place during senior week which include the OC Car Show,[48] Dew Tour,[49] H20 Under 21 Events,[50] and the senior week boardwalk events.[51]\\r\\nFirst opened in June 1976, Ocean Bowl Skatepark in South Ocean City, MD was the very first skate park to open on the East Coast in the United States, and is the longest running municipal skatepark in the United States today. Due to time, wear and the current needs of skaters, the original bowl and legendary steel halfpipe ramp were torn down in the Fall of 1997 and the newly constructed skatepark opened in July 1998 on the same site. The park has attracted the National Dew Tour for several years running,[52] and many pro skateboarders from around the world have skated the legendary Ocean Bowl park.\\r\\nAside from the boardwalk, other attractions in Ocean City, Maryland include mini-golfing. Old Pro Golf, the most well known chain of mini-golf in Ocean City, is located at several different addresses in Ocean City. The indoor and outdoor Old Pro Golf is located at 6801 Coastal Highway, which is in close proximity to the Golden Sands condominium complex. Herbert J. and Aileen Schoellkopf founded the Old Pro Golf business in 1965. Herbert became obsessed with the game of golf and began building and designing hundreds of golf courses. He first built the outdoor dinosaur golf course at 6801 Coastal Highway, and then eventually added the indoor golf course to attract more people.[53] The city is home to the Brine Beach Lax Festival on the second week of June.\\r\\nThe Town of Ocean City has an emergency advisory radio system broadcast on two FM frequencies. WPSB-LP is broadcast at 99.5 FM from the Public Safety Radio Tower at 65th Street while WWOP-LP is broadcast at 100.3 FM from a tower near Ocean Pines. The system is meant to inform the public of emergency conditions such as severe weather and broadcasts 24-hour community information during non-emergency situations.[54] The studios are located at the Ocean City Public Safety Building on 65th Street. Signs throughout Ocean City advise motorists of the station, with flashing lights advising them to tune in for emergency information. The emergency advisory radio system was launched on August 25, 2014 through a $55,000 grant through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program from the Maryland Emergency Management Agency and sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.[55]\\r\\nOcean City has three sister cities:","input":"What is the population of ocean city maryland?"},{"output":"Joe Elliott","context":"Def Leppard are an English rock band formed in 1977 in Sheffield as part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement. Since 1992, the band has consisted of Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Savage (bass, backing vocals), Rick Allen (drums, backing vocals), Phil Collen (lead and rhythm guitar, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (rhythm and lead guitar, backing vocals). This is the band's longest lasting line-up.\\r\\nThe band's strongest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their 1981 album, High 'n' Dry, was produced by Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, who helped them begin to define their style, and the album's standout track \\"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\\" became one of the first rock videos played on MTV in 1982. The band's next studio album, Pyromania in January 1983, with \\"Photograph\\" and \\"Rock of Ages\\" as the lead singles, turned Def Leppard into a household name. In the U.S., Pyromania was certified diamond (10G platinum). In 2003, the album ranked number 384 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[6]\\r\\nDef Leppard's fourth album Hysteria, released in 1987, topped the UK and U.S. album charts. As of 2009, it has reached beyond the success of Pyromania, having been certified 12G platinum for sales of over 12 million in the U.S. and has gone on to sell over 25 million copies worldwide.[7] The album spawned seven hit singles, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one \\"Love Bites\\", alongside \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\", \\"Hysteria\\", \\"Armageddon It\\", \\"Animal\\", \\"Rocket\\", and \\"Women\\". Their next studio album, Adrenalize (the first following the death of guitarist Steve Clark), reached number one in UK and U.S. charts in 1992, and contained several hits, including \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" and \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\". Their 1993 album, Retro Active, contained the acoustic hit song \\"Two Steps Behind\\". Their greatest-hits album Vault, released in 1995, featured the UK hit \\"When Love & Hate Collide\\".\\r\\nAs one of the world's best-selling music artists, Def Leppard have sold more than 100 million records worldwide,[8] and have two albums with RIAA diamond certification, Pyromania and Hysteria.[9] They are one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling over 10 million copies in the U.S.[10][11] The band were ranked No.?31 in VH1's \\"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\\"[12] and ranked No.?70 in \\"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRick Savage, Tony Kenning, and Pete Willis, all students at Tapton School in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, formed a band called Atomic Mass in 1977. The band originally consisted of Willis on guitar, Savage on bass (after originally playing guitar), and Kenning on drums. Only 18 at the time, Joe Elliott tried out for the band as a guitarist following a chance meeting with Willis after missing a bus, in November 1977. During his audition it was decided that he was better suited to be the lead singer. Their first ever gig was in the dining hall in A Block in Westfield School in Mosborough, Sheffield.[14]\\r\\nThe band adopted a name proposed by Elliott, \\"Deaf Leopard\\", which was originally a band name he thought up while writing reviews for imaginary rock bands in his English class (and in at least partial reference to Led Zeppelin).[15] At Kenning's suggestion, the spelling was slightly modified in order to make the name seem less like that of a punk band. In January 1978, Steve Clark joined the band. According to Elliott, he successfully auditioned for the band by playing Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Free Bird\\" in its entirety.[16]\\r\\nIn November, just prior to recording sessions for what would be a three-song release known as The Def Leppard E.P., Kenning abruptly left the band; he would later form the band Cairo. He was replaced for those sessions by Frank Noon. By the end of the month, Rick Allen, then only 15 years old, had joined the band as its full-time drummer. Sales of the EP soared after the track \\"Getcha Rocks Off\\" was given extensive airtime by renowned BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, considered at the time to be a champion of punk rock and new wave music.[17]\\r\\nThroughout 1979, the band developed a loyal following among British hard rock and heavy metal fans and were considered among the leaders of the new wave of British heavy metal movement. Their growing popularity led to a record deal with the major label Phonogram/Vertigo (Mercury Records in the US). Def Leppard's original management, MSB, a local duo consisting of Pete Martin and Frank Stuart-Brown, were fired after Martin and Joe Elliott got into a fistfight over an incident on the road. The band approached Peter Mensch of Leber-Krebs management, who had booked them on a tour of the UK supporting AC/DC. Mensch, who admitted that he had had his eye on the band, became their manager.[18]\\r\\nDef Leppard's debut album, On Through the Night, was released on 14 March 1980. Although the album hit the Top 15 in the UK, many early fans were turned off by the perception that the band was trying too hard to appeal to American audiences by recording songs such as \\"Hello America\\" and touring more in the US (supporting Pat Travers, AC/DC, and Ted Nugent). A performance at the Reading Festival in August was marred when audience members expressed their displeasure by pelting the band with beer cans and bottles filled with urine. This incident was partially blamed on a cover story in Sounds music newspaper by the journalist Geoff Barton entitled \\"Has the Leppard changed its spots?\\" accusing the band of selling out to the American market. In a documentary on the band recorded for BBC 2, Barton recalls feelings of guilt over the story and having a \\"stand-up row\\" with the band's manager, Mensch, backstage at the show.[18][19][20] In the documentary series Metal Evolution, Joe Elliott says that the media had exaggerated the event and all bands on the day had experienced the 'abuse' from the crowd.[21]\\r\\nThe band had by then caught the attention of AC/DC producer Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, who agreed to work on their second album, High 'n' Dry, released on 11 July 1981. Lange's meticulous approach in the studio helped them begin to define their sound. Despite the album's unimpressive sales figures, the band's video for \\"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\\" became one of the first metal videos played on MTV in 1982, bringing the band increased visibility in the U.S.[22] The band continued to use the up-and-coming music television industry to reach fans over the years with their unique videos and the extravagance of their concerts.[23] After the album's release, European and American tours followed. The band opened for Ozzy Osbourne and Blackfoot.[24]\\r\\nPhil Collen, former guitarist with the glam band Girl, on 12 July 1982 replaced Pete Willis, who had been fired the previous day because of excessive alcohol consumption on the job. (Willis would later resurface with the bands Gogmagog and Roadhouse.) This personnel change took place during the recording of their third album, Pyromania, which was released on 20 January 1983 and also produced by Lange. The cover artwork depicted an animated picture of a huge flame emerging from the top floor of a skyscraper, with a bullseye aimed at the flame. Though many stores would not carry the album due to the cover art, the band did not change the artwork. The lead single, \\"Photograph\\", turned Def Leppard into a household name, supplanting Michael Jackson's \\"Beat It\\" as the most requested video clip on MTV and becoming a staple of rock radio (dominating the US Album Rock Charts for six weeks), and sparked a headline tour across the U.S.[25]\\r\\nFueled by \\"Photograph\\" and subsequent singles \\"Rock of Ages\\" and \\"Foolin'\\", Pyromania went on to sell six million copies in 1983 (more than 100,000 copies every week in that year) and only was held from the top of the US album charts by Michael Jackson's Thriller. With the album's massive success, Pyromania was the catalyst for the 1980s pop-metal movement.[26] In 2004, Pyromania was certified Diamond having sold over 10 million copies in the US.[27] Def Leppard's US tour in support of Pyromania began opening for Billy Squier in March and ended with a headlining performance before an audience of 55,000 at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, California in September. As a testament to the band's popularity at the time, a US Gallup poll in 1984 saw Def Leppard voted as favourite rock band over peers such as The Rolling Stones, AC/DC, and Journey. However, in their native England, Duran Duran secured the number one spot.\\r\\nFollowing their breakthrough, the band moved to Dublin in February 1984 for tax purposes to begin writing the follow-up to Pyromania. Mutt Lange initially joined in on the songwriting sessions but then suddenly declined to return as producer due to exhaustion. Instead, Jim Steinman (of Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell fame) was brought in.\\r\\nOn 31 December 1984, drummer Rick Allen lost his left arm in a car crash on the A57 in the hills outside the band's home city of Sheffield. Allen was driving with his Dutch girlfriend, Miriam Barendsen, when his Corvette swerved off the road on a sharp bend and went through a drystone wall. Despite the severity of the accident, Allen was committed to continuing his role as Def Leppard's drummer, and realised that he could use his legs to do some of the drumming work previously done with his arms.[28] He then worked with Simmons to design a custom electronic drum kit.[29] The other members of the band supported Allen's recovery and never sought a replacement. Allen was placed in a separate studio to practice his new drums. After a few months, Allen gathered the band together and performed the intro to the Led Zeppelin version of \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" to showcase his progress to the band. Joe Elliott reports this as being a \\"very emotional moment.\\" During this period, Mutt Lange returned as producer. Def Leppard brought in Jeff Rich in August 1986 to play alongside Allen during Def Leppard's warm-up mini tour of Ireland. When the band couldn't fit two drum kits on stage at a gig, he and the band realized Allen could drum alone.[30] Allen's comeback was sealed at the 1986 Monsters of Rock festival in England, with an emotionally charged ovation after his introduction by Joe Elliott.[31]\\r\\nAfter over three years of recording, Def Leppard's fourth album, Hysteria, was released on 3 August 1987. One of the first singles from the album, \\"Animal\\", became the band's first Top 10 hit in the UK, reaching No.?6 on the UK Singles Chart.[32] \\"Animal\\" also started their run of ten consecutive U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 singles.[33] Hysteria immediately topped the UK Album Charts in its first week of release, and has since spent 105 weeks on the chart.[32] Initial US album sales were relatively slow (compared to Pyromania) until the release of the fourth single, \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\". The song hit Number?2, and Hysteria finally reached the top of the U.S. Billboard 200 in July 1988.[34] Often regarded as the band's signature song, \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" was ranked No.?2 on VH1's \\"100 Greatest Songs of the 80s\\" in 2006.[35]\\r\\nThe band's UK success saw them nominated for the 1988 Brit Award for Best British Group.[36] In October 1988, the power ballad \\"Love Bites\\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[33] In January 1989, the band scored another US Top?5 hit with \\"Armageddon It\\", and by spring of 1989 the final single \\"Rocket\\" was in the Top 20.[33] Wanting to give fans something new after the massive radio and video airplay for not only the 7 singles but also the Album tracks that Radio DJs were playing off the album, the band performed \\"Tear It Down\\", a Hysteria B-side at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. Due to positive fan reaction the song was reworked for their following album Adrenalize.\\r\\nHysteria is one of only a handful of albums that has charted seven singles or more on the US Hot 100: \\"Women\\" (#80), \\"Animal\\" (#19), \\"Hysteria\\" (#10), \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" (#2), \\"Love Bites\\" (#1), \\"Armageddon It\\" (#3), and \\"Rocket\\" (#12).[33] It remained on the charts for three years and has sold over 25?million copies worldwide.[7] Equally successful was the accompanying 16-month tour, in which the band performed in the round. This concept proved wildly popular with fans (as seen in the videos for \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" and \\"Armageddon It\\") and was used again for the Adrenalize tour.\\r\\nAt the 1989 Brit Awards held at the Royal Albert Hall in London, Def Leppard were again a nominee for Best British Group, and the band performed \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" at the ceremony.[37][38] At the 1989 American Music Awards, Def Leppard won Favorite Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Artist, as well as Favorite Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Album (for Hysteria).[39]\\r\\nFollowing Hysteria, the band quickly set out to work on their fifth album, hoping to avoid another lengthy gap. Steve Clark's alcoholism worsened to the point that he was constantly in and out of rehab. Recording sessions suffered from this distraction, and in mid-1990, Clark was granted a six-month leave of absence from the band. Clark died from a mix of prescription drugs and alcohol on 8 January 1991, in his London home.[40]\\r\\nThe remaining band members decided to carry on and recorded the album as a four-piece, with Collen mimicking Clark's style on his intended guitar parts. Def Leppard's fifth album, Adrenalize, was finally released on 31 March 1992. The album simultaneously entered at number one on both the UK and US album charts, staying on the latter for 5 weeks.[34][41] The first single, \\"Let's Get Rocked\\", was an instant smash hit, and the band performed the song at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards where it was nominated for Best Video of the Year.[42] In April 1992, Def Leppard appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium, London, performing a three-song set of \\"Animal\\", \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" and Queen's \\"Now I'm Here\\" with guitarist Brian May.[43] Joe Elliott later performed \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" with the remaining members of Queen and Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash.[44]\\r\\nIn a period between late 1991 and early 1992, auditions for another guitarist commenced. Among the guitarists who auditioned included Adrian Smith, John Sykes, and Gary Hoey. Ultimately, the band chose Vivian Campbell in February 1992, formerly of Dio and Whitesnake. Another world tour followed but the band's fortunes began to be affected by the rise of alternative rock, including grunge. Amidst the increasing popularity of alternative rock, the band decided to balance their original image as rebellious rock stars with a slightly friendlier energy, combining heavy metal with melodies and hooks more reminiscent of pop music.[45][46]\\r\\nA collection of b-sides and unreleased tracks recorded between 1984 and 1993, called Retro Active, was released in October 1993, preceded by the success of \\"Two Steps Behind\\" (from the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Last Action Hero). Another single, \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\", hit the Top?5 in Canada, becoming one of their biggest hits there. Retro Active has sold 3?million copies worldwide to date. Two years later, Def Leppard issued their first greatest hits collection, Vault: Def Leppard Greatest Hits (1980ÿ1995), which reached number 3 in the UK, and sold over 5?million copies in the US.[32][47] Alternate track listings of the album were issued for North America, the UK, and Japan. The compilation included a new track, the power ballad \\"When Love & Hate Collide\\", which became their biggest ever hit in the UK, hitting No.?2 on the UK Singles Chart.[48]\\r\\nOn 23 October 1995, the band entered the Guinness Book of World Records by performing three concerts on three continents in one day (Tangiers, Morocco; London, England; and Vancouver, Canada).[49]\\r\\nSlang, released in May 1996, marked a drastic musical departure for the band by featuring darker lyrics and a stripped-down alternative rock edge. The band rehearsed and played the songs together in the studio instead of recording parts separately, resulting in a much more live-sounding album.[50] The US audience reception for Slang and its subsequent tour was a major dropoff from a decade earlier, but Q Magazine nonetheless listed Slang as one of their Top Ten Albums of 1996.[51] This album was the first recorded performance of Rick Allen playing a semi-acoustic drum kit since his accident, and not his electronic set as was first used with Hysteria.\\r\\nVH1 revived the band's fortunes in the US in 1998 by featuring them on one of the first episodes of Behind the Music. Reruns of the episode yielded some of the series' highest ratings and brought the band's music back into the public consciousness (following years of burial by the alternative rock climate). The episode was even parodied on Saturday Night Live. In an effort to capitalise on this new momentum, Def Leppard returned to its classic sound with the 1999 album Euphoria. The first single, \\"Promises\\", reunited the band with Mutt Lange and hit the US Mainstream Rock charts at No.?1 for 3 weeks. The album was certified gold in the US and Canada.\\r\\nOn 5 September 2000, Def Leppard were inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard by their friend Brian May of Queen. In 2001, VH1 produced and aired Hysteria - The Def Leppard Story, a biopic that included Anthony Michael Hall as Mutt Lange and Amber Valletta as Lorelei Shellist (Steve Clark's girlfriend). The docudrama covered the band's history between 1977 through 1986, recounting the trials and triumphs of Rick Allen and Steve Clark. 18 July broadcast still produced some of the channel's highest-ever ratings and is available on DVD.\\r\\nDef Leppard's tenth album, X, saw the band's musical direction moving more towards pop and further away from the band's hard rock roots. X quickly disappeared from the charts, ultimately becoming the band's least successful release. However, the accompanying tour played to the band's strongest audiences since Adrenalize.\\r\\nAn expanded and updated best-of collection, Best Of, was released internationally in October 2004. The North America-only version, Rock of Ages ÿ The Definitive Collection, was released the following May. Def Leppard participated at the Live 8 show in Philadelphia and toured in the summer with Bryan Adams. In 2005, the band left their longtime management team, Q-Prime, and signed with HK Management.\\r\\nOn 23 May 2006, Def Leppard released an all-covers album titled Yeah!. The disc pays homage to classic rock songs of their childhood, originally recorded by Blondie, The Kinks, Sweet, ELO, and Badfinger among others. It debuted at No.?16 in the US, their tenth consecutive Top?20 album.[34]\\r\\nThe band, along with Queen, Kiss, and Judas Priest, were the inaugural inductees of VH1 Rock Honors on 31 May 2006.[52] During the show, The All-American Rejects paid homage to the band with a cover of \\"Photograph\\". Soon afterwards, they embarked on a US tour with Journey. That October, Hysteria was re-released in a two-disc deluxe edition format, which combined the original remastered album with b-sides, remixes, and bonus tracks from single releases. Def Leppard began their \\"Downstage Thrust Tour\\", on 27 June, which took them across the US and into Canada. Support bands were Foreigner and Styx.\\r\\nOn 28 April 2008, Def Leppard released their first album of new studio material in six years, Songs from the Sparkle Lounge. The album debuted at No.?5 on the Billboard 200 in the US. The first single was entitled \\"Nine Lives\\" and featured country singer Tim McGraw, who co-wrote the song with Joe Elliott, Phil Collen, and Rick Savage.\\r\\nA tour in support of the album began on 27 March 2008 in Greensboro, North Carolina,[53] with Styx and REO Speedwagon joining the band on US dates. The band also played several European rock festivals. An arena tour of the UK took place in June in which the band co-headlined with Whitesnake and was supported by US southern rockers Black Stone Cherry. The band then returned to Europe before coming back for a second leg of the UK tour in June. The first of these dates was at the Glasgow SECC on 17 June. Again they were joined by Whitesnake; however, hard rock band Thunder supported at some of these shows. Black Stone Cherry continued to support most of the dates, including some of the Thunder ones. Six shows which were cancelled during the USA/Canada leg of their world tour due to illnesses affecting Joe Elliott and Phil Collen would be rescheduled and played in August of that year. On 11 June, Def Leppard announced further dates for their 2008 World Tour. The extension saw them visit Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Whitesnake continued to support Def Leppard for their Indian and Japanese dates. Def Leppard toured 41 US cities plus Toronto, Canada, during mid-2009 with Poison and Cheap Trick and also played the Download Festival with Whitesnake and ZZ Top.\\r\\nIn October 2008, Def Leppard played with country star Taylor Swift in a taped show in Nashville, Tennessee, in a show called CMT Crossroads: Taylor Swift and Def Leppard. This was released as a DVD on 16 June 2009 exclusively at Wal-Mart.[54] The release was the best-selling DVD of week, and the 10th best selling Wal-Mart music release.[55] A fan of the band since childhood, Taylor Swift chose Def Leppard to perform together for the show, and their crossover performance of \\"Photograph\\" was up for both Performance of the Year and Wide Open Country Video of the Year at the CMT Music Awards in 2009.[54] Taylor Swift said of the performance, \\"Performing with Def Leppard was awesome! They are the coolest guys on the planet! It was the coolest thing in the world to have my band on stage with them...It was the most amazing feeling in the world...\\"[56] Joe Elliott from Def Leppard said, \\"What an absolute pleasure it was to work with Taylor and her band who are a great set of musicians. Myself and Taylor blended really well together, I think, and everybody, both bands and the crowd, had a great time. I'm really glad we had the opportunity to do this.\\"[57]\\r\\nIn October 2009 the band announced that they would be cancelling the last leg of the 2009 North American tour, a total of 23 shows. The band cited, \\"unforeseen personal matters\\", as the reason for the cancellations.[58] At the time, the band denied rumours about a breakup, saying, \\"We're not splitting. Not at all. We often joke, what else would we do? You just can't imagine doing anything else.\\"[58][59]\\r\\nAfter taking a year off from touring in 2010, the band announced on 22 February 2011 that they would be releasing their first live album in the summer. Mirror Ball ÿ Live & More, a two-disc live album, with three new studio tracks, was released in parts of Europe on 3 June, the rest of Europe on 6 June, and on 7 June in the US; it was announced at the same time that Def Leppard would perform at the Download Festival on 10 June 2011.[60] Of the three new studio tracks, two were released as singles, the first single being \\"Undefeated\\" released in April 2011, followed by \\"It's All About Believin'\\" released in May 2012.\\r\\nDef Leppard embarked on a two-month U.S. tour in the summer of 2011, with Heart.,[61] as well as another seven shows in Australia in October with The Choirboys and Heart,[62] two shows in Japan in November,[63] and six shows in the United Kingdom in December with Steel Panther and M?tley Cre.[64] The following year, they then toured with Poison and Lita Ford in the US during the summer of 2012 from 20 June through 15 September, dubbed the \\"Rock Of Ages 2012 Tour\\".[65][66]\\r\\nThe year after, Def Leppard played an eleven show residency at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada from 22 March through 13 April 2013. The residency, referred to as Viva! Hysteria, featured a two part show, with the first half featuring Def Leppard opening for themselves, under the alias \\"Ded Flatbird\\", (jokingly called the best Def Leppard cover band in the world), when they would then play songs they very rarely play live, going all the way back to \\"Good Morning Freedom\\", a b-side from the single \\"Hello America\\" released in February 1980, an era usually left untouched by the band. The opening set varied each night, from playing the best hits from albums like On Through the Night, Slang, and Euphoria, to being the entire first half of High 'n' Dry. The second half, and \\"main event\\" was Def Leppard, as themselves playing their best-selling album, Hysteria, from start to finish. A live album, also titled Viva! Hysteria was released on 22 October 2013. This was the first time the band has played an album live from start to finish.[67][68] The band has re-recorded several hits and even the entire album Hysteria in an effort to circumvent their record label from future royalties, though of these re-recordings, only \\"Rock Of Ages\\", \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\", and \\"Hysteria\\" have been released.[69][70][71]\\r\\nIn June 2013, Vivian Campbell announced that he had developed Hodgkin's lymphoma, a malignant form of cancer that affects the Reed-Sternberg cells, located in the lymph nodes.[72] He continued performing with Def Leppard, and no shows were cancelled or rescheduled. The sole idea of cancelling any shows and not doing anything disgusted Vivian, believing performing would be the best way to remain optimistic.[73] In November 2013, he announced he was in remission. However, the cancer has since reemerged, and he is now receiving chemotherapy once again. Should the cancer once again enter remission, he will undergo a stem-cell transplant.\\r\\nOn 11 February 2014, the band released a remastered deluxe edition of their 1996 album Slang after much delay. The album, still coveted by many loyal fans of the band, now features 30 tracks including demos, B-sides, and unreleased material.[74] From 23 June 2014 to 31 August 2014, Def Leppard and Kiss toured 42 cities, with a dollar per ticket donated to such military charities as Wounded Warrior Project.[75] Def Leppard contributed one song Helen Wheels to the Paul McCartney tribute album The Art of McCartney released on 18 November 2014. Joe Elliott also contributed another track Hi, Hi, Hi.\\r\\nAt certain recent points in time, the band had projects, such as a cartoon and a documentary in development. However, these projects seem to be shelved indefinitely. The band had originally planned to do another residency in Las Vegas, this time in honour of Pyromania (called Viva! Pyromania), but due to the \\"Heroes 2014\\" tour with Kiss, and the recording of their new studio album, the project had been pushed back indefinitely.[76][77] The new album was originally planned to be an EP, but the set-list increased to 15 songs by June 2014.[78] The album was released on October 30, 2015 with a tour following.[79]\\r\\nIn December 2014, the band announced a 13-date Canadian tour in April and May 2015.[80] This was followed in February 2015 with the announcement of a 2015 US summer tour with Styx and Tesla from June to October 2015.[81] The tour was then extended to include dates in Japan and Australia throughout November, and a tour of the UK and Ireland with Whitesnake in December. Def Leppard then returned to North America with Styx and Tesla in early 2016.\\r\\nThe eleventh studio album, titled Def Leppard, was recorded in 2014 and 2015, and released on 30 October 2015.[82] The band released the lead single from their self-titled album on 15 September 2015, titled \\"Let's Go\\", with a music video for the song being released on 30 October.[83] The 14 track album debuted at number 10 in the U.S. and number 11 in the UK.[84]\\r\\nDuring the break following their 2015 tour, Def Leppard led the Hysteria on the High Seas concert cruise aboard the MSC Divina in January 2016. Joe Elliott became ill with laryngitis on the night of their cruise performance.[85] This led to the band performing without Elliott for the first time in their history. Vivian Campbell and Phil Collen sang lead vocals on two songs of the shortened seven song set in addition to two songs with vocals by Andrew Freeman and two more with Eric Martin and Kip Winger.[85] in addition to this, Campbell and Freeman's Last in Line bandmate Jimmy Bain, former bassist of Dio died of lung cancer aboard the ship the same night, causing Last in Line to cancel their show the following day.[86] Back on land, Elliott struggled through the first concert of the 2016 tour, resulting in Tesla's Jeff Keith joining Elliott on lead. The following day's concert was also postponed \\"due to illness\\", with Rick Allen reporting on Twitter \\"The Doctor basically said that if Joe continues to sing without resting his throat for a month he might do permanent damage..\\"[87]\\r\\nBy July 2016, the band were performing regularly again and intended to complete 48 dates.[88] When the tour stopped at DTE Energy Music Theatre in Clarkston, Michigan on 15 July, the show was recorded for future release. On 10 February 2017, the band released And There Will be a Next Time... Live from Detroit, a double live album and concert video.[89] In August 2017 the band celebrated the 30th anniversary of Hysteria by releasing a collectors edition box. The singles were also re-released on vinyl.[90]\\r\\nIn January 2018, Def Leppard announced it would embark on a 58 date North American tour with Journey.[91] In addition, the group's discography was made available for streaming and digital download after a deal was quietly reached between the band and Universal Music Group.[92]\\r\\nDef Leppard's music is a mixture of hard rock, AOR, pop and heavy metal elements, with its multi-layered, harmonic vocals and its melodic guitar riffs. However, even though they were often considered one of the top bands of the new wave of British heavy metal movement of the late 1970s, in the mid-1980s the band were associated with the growing glam metal scene, mainly due to their mainstream success and glossy production.[94] Pyromania has been cited as the catalyst for the 1980s pop-metal movement.[26] Def Leppard, however, expressed their dislike of the \\"glam metal\\" label, as they thought it did not accurately describe their look or musical style.[95] By the release of the Hysteria album, the band had developed a distinctive sound featuring electronic drums and effects-laden guitar sounds overlaid with a multi-layered wall of husky, harmonised vocals. Def Leppard has been cited as an influence by a wide range of musical acts, from heavy metal and thrash metal bands such as Slayer,[96] Pantera,[97] and Metallica[98] as part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement as well as by popular contemporary artists Matt Nathanson[99] and Taylor Swift.[100]\\r\\nWith Pyromania and Hysteria both certified Diamond by the RIAA, Def Leppard are one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling over 10?million copies each in the US, alongside the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Van Halen.[11] Both Pyromania and Hysteria feature in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[6][28]\\r\\nDef Leppard was among the most successful of the new wave of British heavy metal bands in the early 1980s. They combined the raw power of metal with a pop emphasis on melody, catchy hooks and vocal harmonies that, particularly later on, contrasted sharply with harsher contemporary metal and punk bands.[101] Their early albums such as On Through the Night (1980) appealed to metal fans and influenced the likes of Dimebag Darrell of Pantera[97] and Jeff Hanneman of Slayer.[96] Their hugely popular later albums, such as Hysteria (1987), appeared irregular due to their perfectionism in the studio, but appealed to a broad range of music fans.[101]\\r\\nIn 2006, the band received a Sheffield Legends plaque in their hometown of Sheffield, England.[102] Despite their huge commercial success, Elliott has said in an interview that he feels the band does not receive its fair share of respect from the British music press and he claimed the band had been barred from the BBC's Later with Jools Holland series because they were \\"not cool enough\\".[103]\\r\\nPhil Collen played guitar, uncredited, on Sam Kinison's \\"Wild Thing\\" from 1988. The video featured members of bands such as Poison, Bon Jovi, M?tley Cre, Guns N' Roses, Ratt, and Aerosmith. Collen also produced and played on the 1991 album On The Edge from Australian band BB Steal.\\r\\nJoe Elliott sang lead vocals on two tracks on Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood's 1992 solo album, Slide on This. His then-wife Karla appeared in the videos for \\"Always Wanted More\\" and \\"Somebody Else Might\\". Various members of Def Leppard have played on tribute records for Jeff Beck, AC/DC and Alice Cooper.\\r\\nA fan of his local football club Sheffield United F.C., Elliott performed on two tracks to the soundtrack of the 1996 Sheffield-set motion picture, When Saturday Comes (featuring fellow Sheffield native Sean Bean as a star football player), the title track and an instrumental, \\"Jimmy's Theme\\".[104] Elliott sang and co-wrote the opening track, \\"Don't Look Down\\" on Mick Ronson's farewell album Heaven and Hull. A promotional video was issued for the song as well.\\r\\nCybernauts was a side project consisting of Elliott and Collen teamed with members of The Spiders From Mars (David Bowie's former band), minus the late Mick Ronson. The group played several shows, covering Bowie's Ziggy Stardust-era songs and released one internet only album (since deleted).\\r\\nVivian Campbell has played with two side bands in recent years, Clock and the Riverdogs, and recorded a solo album, Two Sides of If, released in 2005.

Kings of Chaos played Stone Fest in Australia along with a few dates in South America in 2013.\\r\\nPhil Collen formed a blues project by the name of Delta Deep with vocalist Debbi Blackwell Cook which released an eponymous debut in 2015.[105]","input":"Who are the current members of def leppard?"},{"output":"September 29, 1948","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAtlanta television had its roots in Atlanta Journal (now Atlanta Journal-Constitution)-owned radio station WSB-AM. The Journal had launched the south's first radio station, WSB AM (\\"Welcome South Brother\\"), on 740?kHz (now 750) on March 15, 1922. In the late 1920s, the Journal experimented with a mechanical version of television, but eventually abandoned it. The earliest experiments with television involved a spinning disc with multiple holes in it, which provided movement' on a projected surface.\\r\\nTelevision finally came to Atlanta-area and northern- and upper central-Georgia viewers on September 29, 1948 (called \\"T-Day\\" by the Journal) with the debut of WSB-TV, broadcasting on VHF channel 8. The newspaper led up to the TV station's launch, with front-page countdowns designed to boost excitement and sell TV sets. The inaugural WSB-TV program, which began with a recording of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" and a close-up shot of a tiny American flag waving in the wind powered by an electric fan, featured announcer John Cone (\\"WSB-TV is on the air!\\"), newscaster Jimmy Bridges, and a host of local dignitaries.\\r\\nWSB-TV originally broadcast from the Biltmore Hotel. They moved to a building at 1601 West Peachtree Street, about two miles (3?km) north on Peachtree Street in 1956. The building, designed to look like a southern mansion, was christened \\"White Columns\\".\\r\\nWSB-TV, in its abbreviated 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. broadcast day, aired a mix of kinescopes (film copies) which might arrive three days late from the NBC television network (WSB-AM had been a longtime NBC radio network affiliate, and most of the new television equipment was from NBC's corporate cousin, RCA), Atlanta Crackers baseball remote broadcasts from the club's stadium on Ponce de Leon Avenue, local news, and kids shows (Woody Willow, a marionette show featuring several stringed characters created and performed by Don and Ruth Gilpin, and a show featuring a man who built toys). A great many old movies were shown, and the station employed a unique censorship system in which monitors actually cut bits from film that were deemed \\"not family material\\" before broadcast. This was a slow and tedious process, handled by two women with scissors, and they usually removed any hint of unsavory language and even scenes in which a man and a woman (even married couples) might be seen in or on a bed.\\r\\nAn early unique use of television occurred when a system-wide transit strike crippled the city and downtown commerce suffered, in an era before shopping malls had been developed in the suburban areas. WSB-TV broadcast, for a time, a daily four-hour \\"infomercial\\" (to use the modern term) for Rich's department store, which was affected economically when shoppers could not travel via bus to its downtown location.\\r\\nIn its earliest days, the station aired a test pattern for many hours each day, ostensibly to let people align their new-fangled television sets. It served, however, as extremely cheap \\"programming\\" which allowed an audience to gather as someone showed off his or her new set to his or her envious friends. The test pattern, in black and white, featured multiple shades of grey and a large picture of a Native American (the ubiquitous and now-classic Indian Head test card). Early employee Mike McDougald recounted, \\"I would drive from WSB-AM to WSB-TV and see people congregated outside the store windows watching the test pattern. They were fascinated by it.\\" Virtually all employees of the new WSB-TV were \\"imports\\" from the radio station, leaving the radio side somewhat hampered by the loss of talent. WSB-AM continued to thrive, however, and actually supported the new television venture for several years until television moved into the \\"black\\".\\r\\nCrosstown radio station WAGA-AM (now WYZE, 1480 AM), owned by The Fort Industries (later renamed \\"Storer Broadcasting\\"), launched a station on channel 5 in the fall of 1949, taking CBS, DuMont and occasionally, ABC shows. The new television operation was squeezed into a converted residential house on Peachtree Street, with a tall tower built in the backyard of the property. WAGA-TV's mascot, owned by the station's janitor, was a (real) Yorkshire terrier named \\"Waga\\".\\r\\nIn addition to CBS shows, WAGA aired a daily hillbilly music show with local personality Jon Farmer, Atlanta Crackers baseball (taken from WSB and later lost to newcomer WLW-A), interview shows featuring politicians like Senator Herman Talmadge and local newscasts featuring a newsreader sitting at a modest desk with a world map on the wall behind.\\r\\nI was little girl when my father, Bill McCain was News Director at WAGA. Jim Bailey was the station Manager. As I recall, William was the name of the Janitor/guy Friday, errand runner. I used to ride around in the station's station wagon with him when he did errands. As I recall the dog \\"WAGA\\" was a black Scotty, not a Yorkshire terrier. Jon Farmer and his wife Phyllis were good family friends. They also had a ballroom dance show together (as I recall) that ran on Saturday evenings.. Source is myself..\\r\\nWSB-TV and WAGA-TV served Atlanta for two years before a third station arrived. In March 1950, the Cox-owned Atlanta Journal and its crosstown rival, the Atlanta Constitution, merged. The Constitution owned a construction permit for a proposed WCON-TV on the more desirable channel 2 (reaching a larger broadcast range due to lower frequency), which was to have been the city's full-time ABC network station. With the merger, WSB-TV instead moved to channel 2 amid great publicity. WCON-TV thus never opened for business, and its sister radio station, WCON AM 550, was reassigned to nearby Gainesville, Georgia, where it is now WDUN.\\r\\nWSB-TV's move to channel 2 opened an opportunity for a new station to operate on channel 8. In 1951, a group of Atlanta businessmen, including an executive from the local Davison's department store chain, pooled their capital and launched WLTV as Atlanta's first full-time ABC affiliate. WLTV's studios were installed in a small building directly behind WSB-TV's property, because that allowed the station to utilize WSB's old channel 8 transmitting tower. WLTV operated on a very tight budget and offered a smattering of local programming like cooking and fashion shows, \\"rip-and-read\\" local news coverage, and a show featuring the city's famous mayor, William B. Hartsfield, who answered viewer mail on his program. The station also offered the first \\"all Negro\\" program in Atlanta, a Saturday evening variety show.\\r\\nIn late 1953, eager entrepreneurs around the country were constructing UHF TV stations to meet the demand of television-hungry viewers. Southeast radio group owner Robert Rounsaville took the plunge, opening a UHF station off Atlanta's Peachtree Street in the same restored house where his \\"good music\\" station, WQXI AM 790, operated. An employee remembered that the station owned a huge, lumbering TV camera that had to be transported from room to room within the building to broadcast local talk shows. The AM station promoted the TV station incessantly, but the September 1953 beginning was met with indifference from Atlantans. Without much in the way of programming apart from old movies, an occasional show from the crumbling DuMont network, and a local Saturday night \\"Barn Dance,\\" there was little incentive for viewers to spend approximately $40 for a UHF converter. As such, WQXI-TV survived about nine months.\\r\\nWhile not an Atlanta station, Macon's first TV outlet received little attention from viewers or the press. In 1954, competing Macon AM radio stations WBML and WNEX pooled money, along with Macon businessman William Fickling, (later a healthcare tycoon) and launched WETV on channel 41. The NBC affiliate pre-dated the market's dominant CBS affiliate WMAZ, channel 13, by several months. As in Atlanta and other cities, few viewers were willing to pay extra for the special receiver needed to watch the UHF station, and after several shakeups (where channel 41 became WNEX and then WOKA), it ceased operations. WMAZ would then become the central Georgia region's sole commercial television outlet for over a dozen years, until NBC returned in 1968 on another UHF station, WCWB-TV (now WMGT-TV). By that time, television manufacturers had been required by the Federal Communications Commission (under the All-Channel Receiver Act) to enable sets to receive UHF channels, without special external equipment.\\r\\nIn 1953, Cincinnati-based Crosley Broadcasting Corporation purchased WLTV (channel 8), providing a much-needed infusion of capital and a new name, \\"WLW-A\\", in keeping with the company's WLW group branding for its stations in Indiana and Ohio. Among the personalities from WLW-A's early days: Dick Van Dyke, who hosted a twice-daily lip synch show where he and Phil Erickson (together known as The Merry Mutes), along with a female partner, mouthed the lyrics to hit records. WLW-A continued to operate in the shadow of WSB-TV, both physically and in the minds of 1950s viewers. It wasn't until ABC began to get ratings traction with its late-1950s Warner Bros. Western shows that the station came of age.\\r\\nMy father, Bill McCain, went to WLW-A following his stent at WAGA, as News Director. His News followed Dick Van Dyke in the afternoons. When I would be in Atlanta visiting my father he would take me to the station. On occasion Dick Van Dyke would entertain me while my father did the News. I remember a few years later, my father remarking that Dick Van Dyke was the one of the most talented people he had ever met. I guess so... I have a copy of what must be the forerunner of TV Guide, with the program lineups of the stations in Atlanta in early 50's.\\r\\nThe station is now WXIA on channel 11 (physical channel 10).\\r\\nTwo months after Crosley set up shop in Atlanta, up the road, about 50 miles (80?km) to the northwest, the owners of a local AM radio station in Rome decided to get into television.\\r\\nWROM AM operated WROM-TV, channel 9, from 1953 until 1958, branding it \\"Dixie's Largest Independent.\\" The station ran a late-afternoon and prime-time schedule of old movies, \\"hillbilly\\" music performances (which were common on Southern TV stations in the 1950s and 1960s) and occasionally, ABC-TV network fare such as Omnibus.\\r\\nWROM's beginning, and its subsequent move to Chattanooga years later, changed Atlanta TV history and caused a fruit-basket turnover of Southeastern U.S. TV frequencies. As soon as channel 9 in Rome and channel 8 in Atlanta began operating simultaneously, viewers in northwestern Atlanta and in northwestern Georgia to the south of Rome began experiencing trouble tuning in either station. Crosley also wanted to increase transmitting power at its new station, which necessitated a change to present-day channel 11 (now WXIA-TV).\\r\\nBy 1958, WROM's owners were making moves to cash in on their investment. The station began carrying a full prime-time slate of ABC network programs, overlapping programming with WLWA.\\r\\nIn 1959, WROM's owners accepted an offer to sell their TV outlet to Martin Theaters, (reportedly for one million dollars) the company that also purchased Columbus, Georgia's WDAK-TV. Chattanooga had only two VHF stations at the time, WRGP (now WRCB)-TV, channel 3, (NBC) and pioneer broadcasting outlet WDEF-TV, channel 12 (CBS). Chattanooga offered channel 9's investors a better economic model than Rome, so the station moved and became Chattanooga ABC affiliate WTVC. That move 60 miles to the north opened opportunities for other television broadcasters within the state of Georgia.\\r\\nAtlanta regained channel 8 as an available frequency, though it was reclassified as a non-commercial educational facility, clearing the way for the University of Georgia's Athens-based station, WGTV (which, years later, relocated to its transmitter and tower to Stone Mountain to better serve Atlanta as part of Georgia Public Broadcasting's state network). Columbus, Georgia's NBC affiliate, WDAK-TV, channel 28, was able to move to VHF channel 9 (now WTVM, an ABC affiliate), while Dothan, Alabama's CBS affiliate, WTVY, moved from channel 9 to the more powerful (and thus desirable) channel 4, and Columbus' CBS affiliate, WRBL, moved from channel 4 over to channel 3.\\r\\nIronically, Rome partially lost a second television frequency 40 years later, when UHF station channel 14 moved east to Bear Mountain near Waleska and Canton (north of Atlanta) after several years of operation. Though a strong radio market covering most of northwestern Georgia, the Rome metro area simply could not support television capable of competing with Chattanooga and Atlanta, both just 60 miles (100?km) distant north and southeast. Rome still remain's the city of license for the station, however, and it is one of two full-power TV stations having a northwest Georgia city of license, along with GPB's WCLP-TV 18 (now WNGH-TV 18.x, on RF channel 33) in Fort Mountain State Park near Chatsworth.\\r\\nSince prior to the 2009 digital-only TV mandate, all local TV stations except WGTV 8 transmit digitally on channels other than their analog ones, with TV channels from 52 to 69 (the 700?MHz band) being taken mostly for 4G LTE mobile phones in a large spectrum auction (FCC auction 73). (WGCL-TV 46 remained on for another month as the designated \\"nightlight\\" station, WUVM-LP 4 and WTBS-LP 6 continue in analog as of April 2017[update].) Unlike other major media markets, no Atlanta TV stations will be taken off the air due to the 600MHz auction which ended in early 2017, but UHF channels 38 to 51 are being taken away, which will result in a \\"repack\\" of at least half of the local stations onto low UHF channels 14 to 36 in late summer 2019, and WGTV from 8 to 7 in 2020. All stations will still retain their historic channel numbers through the use of virtual channels, but re-scanning of TV tuners will be required after the changes.","input":"When did the souths first television station wsb-tv atlanta ga begin operation?"},{"output":"on October 24, 1929","context":"The Wall Street Crash of 1929, also known as Black Tuesday (October 29),[1] the Great Crash, or the Stock Market Crash of 1929, began on October 24, 1929 (\\"Black Thursday\\"), and was the most devastating stock market crash in the history of the United States, when taking into consideration the full extent and duration of its after effects.[2] The crash, which followed the London Stock Exchange's crash of September, signalled the beginning of the 12-year Great Depression that affected all Western industrialized countries.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Roaring Twenties, the decade that followed World War I and led to the crash,[4] was a time of wealth and excess. Building on post-war optimism, rural Americans migrated to the cities in vast numbers throughout the decade with the hopes of finding a more prosperous life in the ever-growing expansion of America's industrial sector.[5] While the American cities prospered, the overproduction of agricultural produce created widespread financial despair among American farmers throughout the decade.[5] This would later be blamed as one of the key factors that led to the 1929 stock market crash.[6]\\r\\nDespite the dangers of speculation, many believed that the stock market would continue to rise forever. On March 25, 1929, after the Federal Reserve warned of excessive speculation, a mini crash occurred as investors started to sell stocks at a rapid pace, exposing the market's shaky foundation.[7] Two days later, banker Charles E. Mitchell announced his company the National City Bank would provide $25 million in credit to stop the market's slide.[7] Mitchell's move brought a temporary halt to the financial crisis and call money declined from 20 to 8 percent.[7] However, the American economy showed ominous signs of trouble:[7] steel production declined, construction was sluggish, automobile sales went down, and consumers were building up high debts because of easy credit.[7] Despite all these economic trouble signs and the market breaks in March and May 1929, stocks resumed their advance in June and the gains continued almost unabated until early September 1929 (the Dow Jones average gained more than 20% between June and September). The market had been on a nine-year run that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average increase in value tenfold, peaking at 381.17 on September 3, 1929.[7] Shortly before the crash, economist Irving Fisher famously proclaimed, \\"Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.\\"[8] The optimism and financial gains of the great bull market were shaken after a well publicized early September prediction from financial expert Roger Babson that \\"a crash was coming\\". The initial September decline was thus called the \\"Babson Break\\" in the press. This was the start of the Great Crash, although until the severe phase of the crash in October, many investors regarded the September \\"Babson Break\\" as a \\"healthy correction\\" and buying opportunity.\\r\\nOn September 20, the London Stock Exchange crashed when top British investor Clarence Hatry and many of his associates were jailed for fraud and forgery.[9] The London crash greatly weakened the optimism of American investment in markets overseas.[9] In the days leading up to the crash, the market was severely unstable. Periods of selling and high volumes were interspersed with brief periods of rising prices and recovery.\\r\\nSelling intensified in mid-October. On October 24 (\\"Black Thursday\\"), the market lost 11 percent of its value at the opening bell on very heavy trading. The huge volume meant that the report of prices on the ticker tape in brokerage offices around the nation was hours late, so investors had no idea what most stocks were actually trading for at that moment, increasing panic. Several leading Wall Street bankers met to find a solution to the panic and chaos on the trading floor.[10] The meeting included Thomas W. Lamont, acting head of Morgan Bank; Albert Wiggin, head of the Chase National Bank; and Charles E. Mitchell, president of the National City Bank of New York. They chose Richard Whitney, vice president of the Exchange, to act on their behalf.\\r\\nWith the bankers' financial resources behind him, Whitney placed a bid to purchase a large block of shares in U.S. Steel at a price well above the current market. As traders watched, Whitney then placed similar bids on other \\"blue chip\\" stocks. This tactic was similar to one that ended the Panic of 1907. It succeeded in halting the slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered, closing with it down only 6.38 points for the day. The rally continued on Friday, October 25, and the half day session on Saturday the 26th but, unlike 1907, the respite was only temporary.\\r\\nOver the weekend, the events were covered by the newspapers across the United States. On October 28, \\"Black Monday\\",[11] more investors facing margin calls decided to get out of the market, and the slide continued with a record loss in the Dow for the day of 38.33 points, or 13%.\\r\\nThe next day, \\"Black Tuesday\\", October 29, 1929, about 16 million shares traded as the panic selling reached its peak. Some stocks actually had no buyers at any price that day (\\"air pockets\\"). The Dow lost an additional 30 points, or 12 percent.[12][13][14][15] The volume of stocks traded on October 29, 1929, was a record that was not broken for nearly 40 years.[13]\\r\\nOn October 29, William C. Durant joined with members of the Rockefeller family and other financial giants to buy large quantities of stocks to demonstrate to the public their confidence in the market, but their efforts failed to stop the large decline in prices. Due to the massive volume of stocks traded that day, the ticker did not stop running until about 7:45?p.m. The market had lost over $30 billion in the space of two days which included $14 billion on October 29 alone.[16]\\r\\nAfter a one-day recovery on October 30, where the Dow regained an additional 28.40 points, or 12 percent, to close at 258.47, the market continued to fall, arriving at an interim bottom on November 13, 1929, with the Dow closing at 198.60. The market then recovered for several months, starting on November 14, with the Dow gaining 18.59 points to close at 217.28, and reaching a secondary closing peak (i.e., bear market rally) of 294.07 on April 17, 1930. The following year, the Dow embarked on another, much longer, steady slide from April 1931 to July 8, 1932, when it closed at 41.22its lowest level of the 20th century, concluding an 89 percent loss rate for all of the market's stocks. For most of the 1930s, the Dow began slowly to regain the ground it lost during the 1929 crash and the three years following it, beginning on March 15, 1933, with the largest percentage increase of 15.34 percent, with the Dow Jones closing at 62.10, with an 8.26 point increase. The largest percentage increases of the Dow Jones occurred during the early and mid-1930s. In late 1937, there was a sharp dip in the stock market, but prices held well above the 1932 lows. The market would not return to the peak closing of September 3, 1929, until November 23, 1954.[18][19]\\r\\nThe crash followed a speculative boom that had taken hold in the late 1920s. During the latter half of the 1920s, steel production, building construction, retail turnover, automobiles registered, even railway receipts advanced from record to record. The combined net profits of 536 manufacturing and trading companies showed an increase, in the first six months of 1929, of 36.6% over 1928, itself a record half-year. Iron and steel led the way with doubled gains.[20] Such figures set up a crescendo of stock-exchange speculation which had led hundreds of thousands of Americans to invest heavily in the stock market. A significant number of them were borrowing money to buy more stocks. By August 1929, brokers were routinely lending small investors more than two-thirds of the face value of the stocks they were buying. Over $8.5 billion was out on loan,[21] more than the entire amount of currency circulating in the U.S. at the time.[16][22]\\r\\nThe rising share prices encouraged more people to invest; people hoped the share prices would rise further. Speculation thus fueled further rises and created an economic bubble. Because of margin buying, investors stood to lose large sums of money if the market turned downor even failed to advance quickly enough. The average P/E (price to earnings) ratio of S&P Composite stocks was 32.6 in September 1929,[23] clearly above historical norms.[24] As per the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, this exuberance also resulted in a large number of people placing their savings and money in leverage investment products like Goldman Sachs' \\"Blue ridge trust\\" and \\"Shenandoah trust\\". These too crashed in 1929 resulting in losses of $475 billion in today's dollars to banks.[25]\\r\\nGood harvests had built up a mass of 250 million bushels of wheat to be \\"carried over\\" when 1929 opened. By May there was also a winter-wheat crop of 560 million bushels ready for harvest in the Mississippi Valley. This oversupply caused a drop in wheat prices so heavy that the net incomes of the farming population from wheat were threatened with extinction. Stock markets are always sensitive to the future state of commodity markets, and the slump in Wall Street predicted for May by Sir George Paish arrived on time. In June 1929, the position was saved by a severe drought in the Dakotas and the Canadian West, plus unfavorable seed times in Argentina and eastern Australia. The oversupply would now be wanted to fill the big gaps in the 1929 world wheat production. From 97S per bushel in May, the price of wheat rose to $1.49 in July. When it was seen that at this figure the American farmers would get rather more for their smaller crop than for that of 1928, up went stocks again and from far and wide orders came to buy shares for the profits to come.\\r\\nIn August, the wheat price fell when France and Italy were bragging of a magnificent harvest, and the situation in Australia improved. This sent a shiver through Wall Street and stock prices quickly dropped, but word of cheap stocks brought a fresh rush of \\"stags\\", amateur speculators and investors. Congress had also voted for a 100 million dollar relief package for the farmers, hoping to stabilize wheat prices. By October though, the price had fallen to $1.31 per bushel.[26]\\r\\nOther important economic barometers were also slowing or even falling by mid-1929, including car sales, house sales, and steel production. The falling commodity and industrial production may have dented even American self-confidence, and the stock market peaked on September 3 at 381.17 just after Labor Day, then started to falter after Roger Babson issued his prescient \\"market crash\\" forecast. By the end of September, the market was down 10% from the peak (the \\"Babson Break\\"). Selling intensified in early and mid October, with sharp down days punctuated by a few up days. Panic selling on huge volume started the week of October 21 and intensified and culminated on October 24, the 28th and especially the 29th (\\"Black Tuesday\\").[27]\\r\\nThe president of the Chase National Bank said at the time: \\"We are reaping the natural fruit of the orgy of speculation in which millions of people have indulged. It was inevitable, because of the tremendous increase in the number of stockholders in recent years, that the number of sellers would be greater than ever when the boom ended and selling took the place of buying.\\"[28]\\r\\nIn 1932, the Pecora Commission was established by the U.S. Senate to study the causes of the crash. The following year, the U.S. Congress passed the GlassÿSteagall Act mandating a separation between commercial banks, which take deposits and extend loans, and investment banks, which underwrite, issue, and distribute stocks, bonds, and other securities.\\r\\nAfter the experience of the 1929 crash, stock markets around the world instituted measures to suspend trading in the event of rapid declines, claiming that the measures would prevent such panic sales. However, the one-day crash of Black Monday, October 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.6%, was worse in percentage terms than any single day of the 1929 crash (although the combined 25% decline of October 28ÿ29, 1929 was larger than October 19, 1987, and remains the worst two-day decline ever).\\r\\nThe American mobilization for World War II at the end of 1941 moved approximately ten million people out of the civilian labor force and into the war.[29] World War II had a dramatic effect on many parts of the economy, and may have hastened the end of the Great Depression in the United States.[30] Government-financed capital spending accounted for only 5 percent of the annual U.S. investment in industrial capital in 1940; by 1943, the government accounted for 67 percent of U.S. capital investment.[30]\\r\\nTogether, the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression formed the largest financial crisis of the 20th century.[31] The panic of October 1929 has come to serve as a symbol of the economic contraction that gripped the world during the next decade.[32] The falls in share prices on October 24 and 29, 1929 were practically instantaneous in all financial markets, except Japan.[33]\\r\\nThe Wall Street Crash had a major impact on the U.S. and world economy, and it has been the source of intense academic debatehistorical, economic, and politicalfrom its aftermath until the present day. Some people believed that abuses by utility holding companies contributed to the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Depression that followed.[34] Many people blamed the crash on commercial banks that were too eager to put deposits at risk on the stock market.[35]\\r\\nIn 1930, 1,352 banks held more than $853 million in deposits; in 1931, one year later, 2,294 banks went down with nearly $1.7 billion in deposits. Many businesses failed (28,285 failures and a daily rate of 133 in 1931).\\r\\nThe 1929 crash brought the Roaring Twenties to a shuddering halt.[36] As tentatively expressed by economic historian Charles P. Kindleberger, in 1929, there was no lender of last resort effectively present, which, if it had existed and were properly exercised, would have been key in shortening the business slowdown[s] that normally follows financial crises.[33] The crash marked the beginning of widespread and long-lasting consequences for the United States. Historians still debate the question: did the 1929 Crash spark The Great Depression,[37] or did it merely coincide with the bursting of a loose credit-inspired economic bubble? Only 16% of American households were invested in the stock market within the United States during the period leading up to the depression, suggesting that the crash carried somewhat less of a weight in causing the depression.\\r\\nHowever, the psychological effects of the crash reverberated across the nation as businesses became aware of the difficulties in securing capital market investments for new projects and expansions. Business uncertainty naturally affects job security for employees, and as the American worker (the consumer) faced uncertainty with regards to income, naturally the propensity to consume declined. The decline in stock prices caused bankruptcies and severe macroeconomic difficulties including contraction of credit, business closures, firing of workers, bank failures, decline of the money supply, and other economically depressing events.\\r\\nThe resultant rise of mass unemployment is seen as a result of the crash, although the crash is by no means the sole event that contributed to the depression. The Wall Street Crash is usually seen as having the greatest impact on the events that followed and therefore is widely regarded as signaling the downward economic slide that initiated the Great Depression. True or not, the consequences were dire for almost everybody. Most academic experts agree on one aspect of the crash: It wiped out billions of dollars of wealth in one day, and this immediately depressed consumer buying.[37]\\r\\nThe failure set off a worldwide run on US gold deposits (i.e. the dollar), and forced the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates into the slump. Some 4,000 banks and other lenders ultimately failed. Also, the uptick rule,[38] which allowed short selling only when the last tick in a stock's price was positive, was implemented after the 1929 market crash to prevent short sellers from driving the price of a stock down in a bear raid.[39]\\r\\nThe stock market crash of October 1929 led directly to the Great Depression in Europe. When stocks plummeted on the New York Stock Exchange, the world noticed immediately. Although financial leaders in the United Kingdom, as in the United States, vastly underestimated the extent of the crisis that would ensue, it soon became clear that the world's economies were more interconnected than ever. The effects of the disruption to the global system of financing, trade, and production and the subsequent meltdown of the American economy were soon felt throughout Europe.[40]\\r\\nDuring 1930 and 1931, in particular, unemployed workers went on strike, demonstrated in public, and otherwise took direct action to call public attention to their plight. Protests often focused on the so-called Means Test, which the government had instituted in 1931 as a way to limit the amount of unemployment payments made to individuals and families. For working people, the Means Test seemed an intrusive and insensitive way to deal with the chronic and relentless deprivation caused by the economic crisis. The strikes were met forcefully, with police breaking up protests, arresting demonstrators, and charging them with crimes related to the violation of public order.[40]\\r\\nEconomists and historians disagree as to what role the crash played in subsequent economic, social, and political events. The Economist argued in a 1998 article that the Depression did not start with the stock market crash,[41] nor was it clear at the time of the crash that a depression was starting. They asked, \\"Can a very serious Stock Exchange collapse produce a serious setback to industry when industrial production is for the most part in a healthy and balanced condition?\\" They argued that there must be some setback, but there was not yet sufficient evidence to prove that it will be long or that it need go to the length of producing a general industrial depression.[42]\\r\\nBut The Economist also cautioned that some bank failures were also to be expected and some banks may not have any reserves left for financing commercial and industrial enterprises. They concluded that the position of the banks is the key to the situation, but what was going to happen could not have been foreseen.[42]\\r\\nAcademics see the Wall Street Crash of 1929 as part of a historical process that was a part of the new theories of boom and bust. According to economists such as Joseph Schumpeter, Nikolai Kondratiev and Charles E. Mitchell, the crash was merely a historical event in the continuing process known as economic cycles. The impact of the crash was merely to increase the speed at which the cycle proceeded to its next level.\\r\\nMilton Friedman's A Monetary History of the United States, co-written with Anna Schwartz, advances the argument that what made the \\"great contraction\\" so severe was not the downturn in the business cycle, protectionism, or the 1929 stock market crash in themselves ÿ but instead, according to Friedman and Schwartz, what plunged the country into a deep depression was the collapse of the banking system during three waves of panics over the 1930ÿ33 period.[43]\\r\\n Media related to Wall Street Crash of 1929 at Wikimedia Commons","input":"When did the 1929 stock market crash happen?"},{"output":"December 17, 1989","context":"","input":"When did the simpsons first air on television?"},{"output":"Jingle Bells","context":"Music in space is music played in or broadcast from a spacecraft in outer space.[1][not in citation given] According to the Smithsonian Institution, the first musical instruments played in outer space were an 8-note Hohner \\"Little Lady\\" harmonica and a handful of small bells carried by American astronauts Wally Schirra and Thomas P.

The word vascular, meaning relating to the blood vessels, is derived from the Latin vas, meaning vessel. A few structures (such as cartilage and the lens of the eye) do not contain blood vessels and are labeled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arteries and veins have three layers, but the middle layer is thicker in the arteries than it is in the veins:\\r\\nCapillaries consist of little more than a layer of endothelium and occasional connective tissue.\\r\\nWhen blood vessels connect to form a region of diffuse vascular supply it is called an anastomosis (pl. anastomoses). Anastomoses provide critical alternative routes for blood to flow in case of blockages.\\r\\nThere is a layer of muscle surrounding the arteries and the veins which help contract and expand the vessels. This creates enough pressure for blood to be pumped around the body. Blood vessels are part of the circulatory system, together with the heart and the blood.\\r\\nThere are various kinds of blood vessels:\\r\\nThey are roughly grouped as arterial and venous, determined by whether the blood in it is flowing away from (arterial) or toward (venous) the heart. The term \\"arterial blood\\" is nevertheless used to indicate blood high in oxygen, although the pulmonary artery carries \\"venous blood\\" and blood flowing in the pulmonary vein is rich in oxygen. This is because they are carrying the blood to and from the lungs, respectively, to be oxygenated.\\r\\nBlood vessels do not actively engage in the transport of blood (they have no appreciable peristalsis), but arteriesand veins to a degreecan regulate their inner diameter by contraction of the muscular layer. This changes the blood flow to downstream organs, and is determined by the autonomic nervous system. Vasodilation and vasoconstriction are also used antagonistically as methods of thermoregulation.\\r\\nOxygen (bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells) is the most critical nutrient carried by the blood. In all arteries apart from the pulmonary artery, hemoglobin is highly saturated (95ÿ100%) with oxygen. In all veins apart from the pulmonary vein, the hemoglobin is desaturated at about 75%. (The values are reversed in the pulmonary circulation.)\\r\\nThe blood pressure in blood vessels is traditionally expressed in millimetres of mercury (1 mmHg = 133 Pa). In the arterial system, this is usually around 120 mmHg systolic (high pressure wave due to contraction of the heart) and 80 mmHg diastolic (low pressure wave). In contrast, pressures in the venous system are constant and rarely exceed 10 mmHg.\\r\\nVasoconstriction is the constriction of blood vessels (narrowing, becoming smaller in cross-sectional area) by contracting the vascular smooth muscle in the vessel walls. It is regulated by vasoconstrictors (agents that cause vasoconstriction). These include paracrine factors (e.g. prostaglandins), a number of hormones (e.g. vasopressin and angiotensin) and neurotransmitters (e.g. epinephrine) from the nervous system.\\r\\nVasodilation is a similar process mediated by antagonistically acting mediators. The most prominent vasodilator is nitric oxide (termed endothelium-derived relaxing factor for this reason).\\r\\nPermeability of the endothelium is pivotal in the release of nutrients to the tissue. It is also increased in inflammation in response to histamine, prostaglandins and interleukins, which leads to most of the symptoms of inflammation (swelling, redness, warmth and pain).\\r\\nVascular resistance occurs where the vessels away from the heart oppose the flow of blood. Resistance is an accumulation of three different factors: blood viscosity, blood vessel length, and vessel radius.[2]\\r\\nBlood viscosity is the thickness of the blood and its resistance to flow as a result of the different components of the blood. Blood is 92% water by weight and the rest of blood is composed of protein, nutrients, electrolytes, wastes, and dissolved gases. Depending on the health of an individual, the blood viscosity can vary (i.e. anemia causing relatively lower concentrations of protein, high blood pressure an increase in dissolved salts or lipids, etc.).[2]\\r\\nVessel length is the total length of the vessel measured as the distance away from the heart. As the total length of the vessel increases, the total resistance as a result of friction will increase.[2]\\r\\nVessel radius also affects the total resistance as a result of contact with the vessel wall. As the radius of the wall gets smaller, the proportion of the blood making contact with the wall will increase. The greater amount of contact with the wall will increase the total resistance against the blood flow.[3]\\r\\nBlood vessels play a huge role in virtually every medical condition. Cancer, for example, cannot progress unless the tumor causes angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) to supply the malignant cells' metabolic demand. Atherosclerosis, the formation of lipid lumps (atheromas) in the blood vessel wall, is the most common cardiovascular disease, the main cause of death in the Western world.[4]\\r\\nBlood vessel permeability is increased in inflammation. Damage, due to trauma or spontaneously, may lead to hemorrhage due to mechanical damage to the vessel endothelium. In contrast, occlusion of the blood vessel by atherosclerotic plaque, by an embolised blood clot or a foreign body leads to downstream ischemia (insufficient blood supply) and possibly necrosis. Vessel occlusion tends to be a positive feedback system; an occluded vessel creates eddies in the normally laminar flow or plug flow blood currents. These eddies create abnormal fluid velocity gradients which push blood elements such as cholesterol or chylomicron bodies to the endothelium. These deposit onto the arterial walls which are already partially occluded and build upon the blockage.[5]\\r\\nVasculitis is inflammation of the vessel wall, due to autoimmune disease or infection.\\r\\nocular group: central retinal","input":"What blood vessels carry blood to the heart?"},{"output":"10,000 years ago","context":"Smilodon is an extinct genus of machairodont felid. It is one of the most famous prehistoric mammals, and the best known saber-toothed cat. Although commonly known as the saber-toothed tiger, it was not closely related to the tiger or other modern cats. Smilodon lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 myaÿ10,000 years ago). The genus was named in 1842, based on fossils from Brazil. Three species are recognized today: S.?gracilis, S.?fatalis, and S.?populator. The two latter species were probably descended from S.?gracilis, which itself probably evolved from Megantereon. The largest collection of Smilodon fossils has been obtained from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California.\\r\\nOverall, Smilodon was more robustly built than any extant cat, with particularly well-developed forelimbs and exceptionally long upper canine teeth. Its jaw had a bigger gape than that of modern cats, and its upper canines were slender and fragile, being adapted for precision killing. S.?gracilis was the smallest species at 55 to 100?kg (120 to 220?lb) in weight. S.?fatalis had a weight of 160 to 280?kg (350 to 620?lb) and height of 100?cm (39?in). Both of these species are mainly known from North America, but remains from South America have also been attributed to them. S.?populator from South America was the largest species, at 220 to 400?kg (490 to 880?lb) in weight and 120?cm (47?in) in height, and was among the largest known felids. The coat pattern of Smilodon is unknown, but it has been artistically restored with plain or spotted patterns.\\r\\nIn North America, Smilodon hunted large herbivores such as bison and camels, and it remained successful even when encountering new prey species in South America. Smilodon is thought to have killed its prey by holding it still with its forelimbs and biting it, but it is unclear in what manner the bite itself was delivered. Scientists debate whether Smilodon had a social or a solitary lifestyle; analysis of modern predator behavior as well as of Smilodon's fossil remains could be construed to lend support to either view. Smilodon probably lived in closed habitats such as forests and bush, which would have provided cover for ambushing prey. Smilodon died out at the same time that most North and South American megafauna disappeared, about 10,000 years ago. Its reliance on large animals has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the exact cause is unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1830s, Danish naturalist Peter Wilhelm Lund and his assistants collected fossils in the calcareous caves near the small town of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Among the thousands of fossils found, he recognized a few isolated cheek teeth as belonging to a hyena, which he named Hyaena neogaea in 1839. After more material was found (including canine teeth and foot bones), Lund concluded the fossils instead belonged to a distinct genus of felid, though transitional to the hyenas. He stated it would have matched the largest modern predators in size, and was more robust than any modern cat. Lund originally wanted to name the new genus Hyaenodon, but realizing this had recently become preoccupied by another prehistoric predator, he instead named it Smilodon populator in 1842. He explained the Ancient Greek meaning of Smilodon as ? (smil), a scalpel or two-edged knife, and Ѵ?? (odont~s), tooth. This has also been translated as \\"tooth shaped like double-edged knife\\". He explained the species name populator as \\"the destroyer\\", which has also been translated as \\"he who brings devastation\\". By 1846, Lund had acquired nearly every part of the skeleton (from different individuals), and more specimens were found in neighboring countries by other collectors in the following years.[1][2] Though some later authors used Lund's original species name neogaea instead of populator, it is now considered an invalid nomen nudum (\\"naked name\\"), as it was not accompanied with a proper description and no type specimens were designated.[3] Some South American specimens have been referred to other genera, subgenera, species, and subspecies, such as Smilodontidion riggii, Smilodon (Prosmilodon) ensenadensis, and S.?bonaeriensis, but these are now thought to be junior synonyms of S.?populator.[4]\\r\\nFossils of Smilodon were discovered in North America from the second half of the 19th century onwards.[1] In 1869, American paleontologist Joseph Leidy described a maxilla fragment with a molar, which had been discovered in a petroleum bed in Hardin County, Texas. He referred the specimen to the genus Felis (which was then used for most cats, extant as well as extinct) but found it distinct enough to be part of its own subgenus, as F. (Trucifelis) fatalis.[5] The species name means \\"fate\\" or \\"destiny\\", but it is thought Leidy intended it to mean \\"fatal\\".[6] In an 1880 article about extinct American cats, American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope pointed out that the F.?fatalis molar was identical to that of Smilodon, and he proposed the new combination S.?fatalis.[7] Most North American finds were scanty until excavations began in the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, where hundreds of individuals of S.?fatalis have been found since 1875.[1] S.?fatalis has junior synonyms such as S.?mercerii, S.?floridanus, and S.?californicus.[4] American paleontologist Annalisa Berta considered the holotype of S.?fatalis too incomplete to be an adequate type specimen, and the species has at times been proposed to be a junior synonym of S.?populator.[3] Swedish paleontologists Bj?rn Kurtn and Lars Werdelin supported the distinctness of the two species in 1990.[8]\\r\\nIn his 1880 article about extinct cats, Cope also named a third species of Smilodon, S.?gracilis. The species was based on a partial canine, which had been obtained in a cave near the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania. Cope found the canine to be distinct from that of the other Smilodon species due to its smaller size and more compressed base.[7] Its specific name refers to the species' lighter build.[9] This species is known from fewer and less complete remains than the other members of the genus.[10] S.?gracilis has at times been considered part of genera such as Megantereon and Ischyrosmilus.[11] S.?populator, S.?fatalis and S.?gracilis are currently considered the only valid species of Smilodon, and features used to define most of their junior synonyms have been dismissed as variation between individuals of the same species (intraspecific variation).[4][3] One of the most famous of prehistoric mammals, Smilodon has often been featured in popular media and is the state fossil of California.[1]\\r\\nLong the most completely known saber-toothed cat, Smilodon is still one of the best-known members of the group, to the point where the two concepts have been confused. The term \\"saber-tooth\\" refers to an ecomorph consisting of various groups of extinct predatory synapsids (mammals and close relatives), which convergently evolved extremely long maxillary canines, as well as adaptations to the skull and skeleton related to their use. This includes members of Gorgonopsia, Thylacosmilidae, Machaeroidinae, Nimravidae, Barbourofelidae, and Machairodontinae.[1][12] Within the family Felidae (true cats), members of the subfamily Machairodontinae are referred to as saber-toothed cats, and this group is itself divided into three tribes: Metailurini (false saber-tooths); Homotherini (scimitar-toothed cats); and Smilodontini (dirk-toothed cats), to which Smilodon belongs.[4] Members of Smilodontini are defined by their long slender canines with fine to no serrations, whereas Homotherini are typified by shorter, broad, and more flattened canines, with coarser serrations.[13] Members of Metailurini were less specialized and had shorter, less flattened canines, and are not recognized as members of Machairodontinae by some researchers.[4]\\r\\nThe earliest felids are known from the Oligocene of Europe, such as Proailurus, and the earliest one with saber-tooth features is the Miocene genus Pseudaelurus.[4] The skull and mandible morphology of the earliest saber-toothed cats was similar to that of the modern clouded leopards (Neofelis). The lineage further adapted to the precision killing of large animals by developing elongated canine teeth and wider gapes, in the process sacrificing high bite force.[14] As their canines became longer, the bodies of the cats became more robust for immobilizing prey.[13] In derived smilodontins and homotherins, the lumbar region of the spine and the tail became shortened, as did the hind limbs.[4] Based on mitochondrial DNA sequences extracted from fossils, the lineages of Homotherium and Smilodon are estimated to have diverged about 18 Ma ago.[15] The earliest species of Smilodon is S.?gracilis, which existed from 2.5 million to 500,000 years ago (early Blancan to Irvingtonian ages) and was the successor in North America of Megantereon, from which it probably evolved. Megantereon itself had entered North America from Eurasia during the Pliocene, along with Homotherium. S.?gracilis reached the northern regions of South America in the Early Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange.[16][13] The younger Smilodon species are probably derived from S.?gracilis.[17] S.?fatalis existed 1.6 millionÿ10,000 years ago (late Irvingtonian to Rancholabrean ages), and replaced S.?gracilis in North America.[8] S.?populator existed 1 millionÿ10,000 years ago (Ensenadan to Lujanian ages); it occurred in the eastern parts of South America.[18]\\r\\nDespite the colloquial name \\"saber-toothed tiger\\", Smilodon is not closely related to the modern tiger (which belongs in the subfamily Pantherinae), or any other extant felid.[19] A 1992 ancient DNA analysis suggested that Smilodon should be grouped with modern cats (subfamilies Felinae and Pantherinae).[20] A 2005 study found that Smilodon belonged to a separate lineage.[21] A study published in 2006 confirmed this, showing that the Machairodontinae diverged early from the ancestors of modern cats and were not closely related to any living species.[22] The following cladogram based on fossils and DNA analysis shows the placement of Smilodon among extinct and extant felids, after Rinc܇n and colleagues, 2011:[16]\\r\\nProailurus\\r\\nPseudaelurus\\r\\nPanthera (tigers, lions, jaguars, and leopards)\\r\\nCaracal\\r\\nLeopardus (ocelot and relatives)\\r\\nFelis (domestic cats and relatives)\\r\\nHerpailurus (jaguarundi)\\r\\nMiracinonyx (American cheetah)\\r\\nPuma (cougar)\\r\\nDinofelis\\r\\nNimravides\\r\\nMachairodus\\r\\nHomotherium\\r\\nXenosmilus\\r\\nParamachairodus\\r\\nMegantereon\\r\\nSmilodon gracilis\\r\\nSmilodon populator\\r\\nSmilodon fatalis\\r\\nSmilodon was around the size of modern big cats, but was more robustly built. It had a reduced lumbar region, high scapula, short tail, and broad limbs with relatively short feet.[23][24] Smilodon is most famous for its relatively long canine teeth, which are the longest found in the saber-toothed cats, at about 28?cm (11?in) long in the largest species, S. populator.[23] The canines were slender and had fine serrations on the front and back side.[25] The skull was robustly proportioned and the muzzle was short and broad. The cheek bones (zygomata) were deep and widely arched, the sagittal crest was prominent, and the frontal region was slightly convex. The mandible had a flange on each side of the front. The upper incisors were large, sharp, and slanted forwards. There was a diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars of the mandible. The lower incisors were broad, recurved, and placed in a straight line across. The p3 premolar tooth of the mandible was present in most early specimens, but lost in later specimens; it was only present in 6% of the La Brea sample.[3] There is some dispute over whether Smilodon was sexually dimorphic. Some studies of S. fatalis fossils have found little difference between the sexes.[26][27] Conversely, a 2012 study found that, while fossils of S. fatalis show less variation in size among individuals than modern Panthera, they do appear to show the same difference between the sexes in some traits.[28]\\r\\nS. gracilis was the smallest species, estimated at 55 to 100?kg (120 to 220?lb) in weight, about the size of a jaguar. It was similar to its predecessor Megantereon of the same size, but its dentition and skull were more advanced, approaching S. fatalis.[29][4] S. fatalis was intermediate in size between S. gracilis and S. populator.[23] It ranged from 160 to 280?kg (350 to 620?lb).[29] and reached a shoulder height of 100?cm (39?in) and body length of 175?cm (69?in).[30] It was similar to a lion in dimensions, but was more robust and muscular, and therefore had a larger body mass. Its skull was also similar to that of Megantereon, though more massive and with larger canines.[4] S. populator was among the largest known felids, with a body mass range of 220 to 400?kg (490 to 880?lb),[29] and one estimate suggesting up to 470?kg (1,040?lb).[31] It stood at a shoulder height of 120?cm (47?in).[23] Compared to S.?fatalis, S.?populator was more robust and had a more elongated and narrow skull with a straighter upper profile, higher positioned nasal bones, a more vertical occiput, more massive metapodials and slightly longer forelimbs relative to hindlimbs.[4][8] Large tracks from Argentina (for which the ichnotaxon name Smilodonichium has been proposed) have been attributed to S. populator, and measure 17.6?cm (6.9?in) by 19.2?cm (7.6?in).[32] This is larger than tracks of the Bengal tiger, to which the footprints have been compared.[33]\\r\\nTraditionally, saber-toothed cats have been artistically restored with external features similar to those of extant felids, by artists such as Charles R. Knight in collaboration with various paleontologists in the early 20th century.[34] In 1969, paleontologist G.?J. Miller instead proposed that Smilodon would have looked very different from a typical cat and similar to a bulldog, with a lower lip line (to allow its mouth to open wide without tearing the facial tissues), a more retracted nose and lower-placed ears.[35] Paleoartist Mauricio Ant܇n and coauthors disputed this in 1998 and maintained that the facial features of Smilodon were overall not very different from those of other cats. Ant܇n noted that modern animals like the hippopotamus are able to achieve a wide gap without tearing tissue by the moderate folding of the orbicularis oris muscle, and such a muscle configuration exists in modern large felids.[36] Ant܇n stated that extant phylogenetic bracketing (where the features of the closest extant relatives of a fossil taxon are used as reference) is the most reliable way of restoring the life-appearance of prehistoric animals, and the cat-like Smilodon restorations by Knight are therefore still accurate.[34]\\r\\nSmilodon and other saber-toothed cats have been reconstructed with both plain-colored coats and with spotted patterns (which appears to be the ancestral condition for feliforms), both of which are considered possible.[34] Studies of modern cat species have found that species that live in the open tend to have uniform coats while those that live in more vegetated habitats have more markings, with some exceptions.[37] Some coat features, such as the manes of male lions or the stripes of the tiger, are too unusual to predict from fossils.[34]\\r\\nAn apex predator, Smilodon primarily hunted large mammals. Isotopes preserved in the bones of S.?fatalis in the La Brea Tar Pits reveal that ruminants like bison (Bison antiquus, which was much larger than the modern American bison) and camels (Camelops) were most commonly taken by the cats there.[38] In addition, isotopes preserved in the tooth enamel of S.?gracilis specimens from Florida show that this species fed on the peccary Platygonus and the llama-like Hemiauchenia.[39] In rare cases, Smilodon may have also targeted glyptodonts, based on a Glyptotherium skull that bears elliptical puncture marks[40] consistent with the size and diameter of its canine teeth.[41] This was a juvenile glyptodont with an incompletely developed cephalic shield (head armor).[40] Isotopic studies of dire wolf (Canis dirus) and American lion (Panthera leo atrox) bones show an overlap with S.?fatalis in prey, which suggests that they were competitors.[38] The availability of prey in the Rancho La Brea area was likely comparable to modern East Africa.[42] As Smilodon migrated to South America, its diet changed; bison were absent, the horses and proboscideans were different, and native ungulates such as toxodonts and litopterns were completely unfamiliar, yet S.?populator thrived as well there as its relatives in North America.[13] The differences between the North and South American species may be due to the difference in prey between the two continents.[8] Smilodon probably avoided eating bone and would have left enough food for scavengers.[43] Smilodon itself may have scavenged dire wolf kills.[44] It has been suggested that Smilodon was a pure scavenger that used its canines for display to assert dominance over carcasses, but this theory is not supported today as no modern terrestrial mammals are pure scavengers.[45]\\r\\nThe brain of Smilodon had sulcal patterns similar to modern cats, which suggests an increased complexity of the regions that control the sense of hearing, sight, and coordination of the limbs. Felid saber-tooths in general had relatively small eyes that were not as forward-facing as those of modern cats, which have good binocular vision to help them move in trees.[45] Smilodon was likely an ambush predator that concealed itself in dense vegetation, as its limb proportions were similar to modern forest dwelling cats,[46] and its short tail would not have helped it balance while running.[47] Unlike its ancestor Megantereon, which was at least partially scansorial and therefore able to climb trees, Smilodon was probably completely terrestrial due to its greater weight and lack of climbing adaptations.[48] The heel bone of Smilodon was fairly long, which suggests it was a good jumper.[23] Its well-developed flexor and extensor muscles in its forearms probably enabled it to pull down, and securely hold down, large prey. Analysis of the cross-sections of S.?fatalis humeri indicated that they were strengthened by cortical thickening to such an extent that they would have been able to sustain greater loading than those of extant big cats, or of the extinct American lion. The thickening of S.?fatalis femurs was within the range of extant felids.[49] Its canines were fragile and could not have bitten into bone; due to the risk of breaking, these cats had to subdue and restrain their prey with their powerful forelimbs before they could use their canine teeth, and likely used quick slashing or stabbing bites rather than the slow, suffocating bites typically used by modern cats.[49] On rare occasions, as evidenced by fossils, Smilodon was willing to risk biting into bone with its canines. This may have been focused more towards competition such as other Smilodon or potential threats such as other carnivores than on prey.[48]\\r\\nDebate continues as to how Smilodon killed its prey. Traditionally, the most popular theory is that the cat delivered a deep stabbing bite or open-jawed stabbing thrust to the throat, generally cutting through the jugular vein and/or the trachea and thus killing the prey very quickly.[49][50] Another hypothesis suggests that Smilodon targeted the belly of its prey. This is disputed, as the curvature of their prey's belly would likely have prevented the cat from getting a good bite or stab.[51] In regard to how Smilodon delivered its bite, the \\"canine shear-bite\\" hypothesis has been favored, where flexion of the neck and rotation of the skull assisted in biting the prey, but this may be mechanically impossible. The mandibular flanges may have helped resist bending forces when the mandible was pulled against the hide of a prey.[52] The protruding incisors were arranged in an arch, and were used to hold the prey still and stabilize it while the canine bite was delivered. The contact surface between the canine crown and the gum was enlarged, which helped stabilize the tooth and helped the cat sense when the tooth had penetrated to its maximum extent. Since saber-toothed cats generally had a relatively large infraorbital foramen (opening) in the skull, which housed nerves associated with the whiskers, it has been suggested the improved senses would have helped the cats' precision when biting outside their field of vision, and thereby prevent breakage of the canines. The blade-like carnassial teeth were used to cut skin to access the meat, and the reduced molars suggest that they were less adapted for crushing bones than modern cats.[45] As the food of modern cats enters the mouth through the side while cutting with the carnassials, not the front incisors between the canines, the animals do not need to gape widely, so the canines of Smilodon would likewise not have been a hindrance when feeding.[36]\\r\\nDespite being more powerfully built than other large cats, Smilodon had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more pronounced zygomatic arches, while these were smaller in Smilodon, which restricted the thickness and therefore power of the temporalis muscles and thus reduced Smilodon's bite force. Analysis of its narrow jaws indicates that it could produce a bite only a third as strong as that of a lion (the bite force quotient measured for the lion is 112).[53][54] There seems to be a general rule that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. Analyses of canine bending strength (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats' teeth were stronger relative to the bite force than those of modern big cats.[55] In addition, Smilodon's gape could have reached almost 120 degrees,[56] while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees.[57] This made the gape wide enough to allow Smilodon to grasp large prey despite the long canines.[36]\\r\\nMany Smilodon specimens have been excavated from asphalt seeps that acted as natural carnivore traps. Animals were accidentally trapped in the seeps and became bait for predators that came to scavenge, but these were then trapped themselves. The best-known of such traps are at La Brea in Los Angeles, which have produced over 166,000 Smilodon fatalis specimens[58] that form the largest collection in the world. The sediments of the pits there were accumulated 40,000 to 10,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene. Though the trapped animals were buried quickly, predators often managed to remove limb bones from them, but they were themselves often trapped and then scavenged by other predators; 90% of the excavated bones belonged to predators.[59]\\r\\nThe Talara Tar Seeps in Peru represent a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, many of the bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these are probably the result of animals dying on the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their bones to the floor of the cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.[59]\\r\\nScientists debate whether Smilodon was social. One study of African predators found that social predators like lions and spotted hyenas respond more to the distress calls of prey than solitary species. Since S.?fatalis fossils are common at the La Brea Tar Pits, and were likely attracted by the distress calls of stuck prey, this could mean that this species was social as well.[60] One critical study claims that the study neglects other factors, such as body mass (heavier animals are more likely to get stuck than lighter ones), intelligence (some social animals, like the American lion, may have avoided the tar because they were better able to recognize the hazard), lack of visual and olfactory lures, the type of audio lure, and the length of the distress calls (the actual distress calls of the trapped prey animals would have lasted longer than the calls used in the study). The author of that study ponders what predators would have responded if the recordings were played in India, where the otherwise solitary tigers are known to aggregate around a single carcass.[61] The authors of the original study responded that though effects of the calls in the tar pits and the playback experiments would not be identical, this would not be enough to overturn their conclusions. In addition, they stated that weight and intelligence would not likely affect the results as lighter carnivores are far more numerous than heavy herbivores and the social (and seemingly intelligent) dire wolf is also found in the pits.[62]\\r\\nAnother argument for sociality is based on the healed injuries in several Smilodon fossils, which would suggest that the animals needed others to provide it food.[63] This argument has been questioned, as cats can recover quickly from even severe bone damage and an injured Smilodon could survive if it had access to water.[64] The brain of Smilodon was relatively small compared to other cat species. Some researchers have argued that Smilodon's brain would have been too small for it to have been a social animal.[65] An analysis of brain size in living big cats found no correlation between brain size and sociality.[66] Another argument against Smilodon being social is that being an ambush hunter in closed habitat would likely have made group-living unnecessary, as in most modern cats.[64] Yet it has also been proposed that being the largest predator in an environment comparable to the savanna of Africa, Smilodon may have had a social structure similar to modern lions, which possibly live in groups primarily to defend optimal territory from other lions (lions are the only social big cats today).[45]\\r\\nWhether Smilodon was sexually dimorphic has implications for its reproductive behavior. Based on their conclusions that Smilodon fatalis had no sexual dimorphism, Van Valkenburgh and Sacco (2002) suggested that, if the cats were social, they would likely have lived in monogamous pairs (along with offspring) with no intense competition among males for females.[26] Likewise, Meachen-Samuels and Binder (2010) concluded that aggression between males was less pronounced in S.?fatalis than in the American lion.[27] Christiansen and Harris (2012) found that, as S.?fatalis did exhibit some sexual dimorphism, there would have been evolutionary selection for competition between males.[28] The structure of the hyoid bones suggest that Smilodon communicated by roaring, like modern big cats.[67]\\r\\nSmilodon started developing its adult saber-teeth when the animal turned one-and-a-half years of age, shortly after the completion of the eruption of the cat's baby teeth. Both baby and adult canines would be present side by side in the mouth for an 11-month period, and the muscles used in making the powerful bite were developed at about one-and-a-half years old as well, eight months earlier than in a modern lion. After Smilodon turned around 20 months of age, the infant teeth were shed while the adult canines grew at an average growth rate of 7?mm (0.3?in) per month during a 12-month period. They reached their full size at around 3 years of age, later than for modern species of big cat. Juvenile and adolescent Smilodon specimens are extremely rare at Rancho La Brea, where the study was performed, indicating that they remained hidden or at denning sites during hunts, and depended on parental care while their canines were developing.[68][69][70]\\r\\nA 2017 study indicates that juveniles were born with a robust build similar to the adults. Comparison of the bones of juvenile S. fatalis specimens from La Brea with those of the contemporaneous American lion revealed that the two cats shared a similar growth curve. Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the robust direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids.[71]\\r\\nSeveral Smilodon fossils show signs of ankylosing spondylitis, hyperostosis and trauma;[72] some also had arthritis, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, which is where the largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines.[73] Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when Smilodon attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. Some bones also show evidence of having been bitten by other Smilodon, with one skull showing an unhealed wound from a canine, seemingly fatal, and a scapula from the same site that had been pierced by a canine.[45] The frequency of trauma in S. fatalis specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. Smilodon remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and lumbar vertebrae injuries.[74]\\r\\nSmilodon lived during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 myaÿ10,000 years ago), and was perhaps the most recent of the saber-toothed cats.[23] Smilodon probably lived in a closed habitat such as forest or bush.[75] Fossils of the genus have been found throughout the Americas.[3] In North America, the varied habitat supported other saber-toothed cats in addition to Smilodon, such as Homotherium and Xenosmilus; the habitat here varied from subtropical forests and savannah in the south, to treeless mammoth steppes in the north. Smilodon inhabited the temperate latitudes of North America, where the mosaic vegetation of woods, shrubs, and grasses in the southwest supported large herbivores such as horses, bison, antelope, deer, camels, mammoths, mastodons, and ground sloths. Other large carnivores included dire wolves, short-faced bear (Arctodus simus) and the American lion.[13][59][76] Due to competition from larger carnivores in North America, S.?fatalis was perhaps not able to attain the same size as S.?populator. The similar sizes of S.?fatalis and the American lion suggests niche overlap and direct competition between these species, and they appear to have fed on similarly sized prey.[77]\\r\\nS. gracilis entered South America during the early to middle Pleistocene, where it probably gave rise to S.?populator, which lived in the eastern part of the continent. S.?fatalis also entered western South America in the late Pleistocene, and the two species were thought to be divided by the Andes mountains.[8][16][23] However, in 2018, a skull of S.?fatalis found in Uruguay east of the Andes was reported, which puts the idea that the two species were allopatric (geographically separated) into question.[78] The American interchange resulted in a mix of native and invasive species sharing the prairies and woodlands in South America; North American herbivores included proboscideans, horses, camelids and deer, South American herbivores included toxodonts, litopterns, ground sloths, and glyptodonts. Native metatherian predators (including the saber-toothed thylacosmilids) had gone extinct by the Pliocene, and were replaced by North American carnivores such as canids, bears, and large cats.[13]\\r\\nS.?populator was very successful, while Homotherium never became widespread in South America. The extinction of the thylacosmilids has been attributed to competition with Smilodon, but this is probably incorrect, as they seem to have disappeared before the arrival of the large cats. The phorusrhacid \\"terror birds\\" may have dominated the large predator niche in South America until Smilodon arrived.[13] S. populator may have been able to reach larger size than S. fatalis due to a lack of competition in Pleistocene South America; S. populator arrived after the extinction of Arctotherium angustidens, one of the largest carnivores ever, and could therefore assume the niche of mega-carnivore.[77] S. populator preferred large prey from open habitats such as grassland and plains, based on evidence gathered from isotope ratios that determined the animal's diet. In this way, the South American Smilodon species was probably similar to the modern lion. S. populator probably competed with the canid Protocyon there, but not with the jaguar, which fed primarily on smaller prey.[79][80]\\r\\nAlong with most of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary extinction event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt.[49] A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources.[81] Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans[81] (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.[82]\\r\\nSome early writers theorized that the last saber-toothed cats, Smilodon and Homotherium, became extinct through competition with the faster and more generalized felids that replaced them. It was even proposed that the saber-toothed predators were inferior to modern cats, as the ever-growing canines were thought to inhibit their owners from feeding properly. Yet fast felids, such as the American lion and the American cheetah, also became extinct during the Late Pleistocene.

He threw 12 completions on 19 attempts for 188 yards and 2 touchdowns, along with 7 rushing attempts for 34 yards.[74] Wilson was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week and FedEx Air Player of the Week for his week 13 performance in the 23ÿ17 Seahawks win over the Chicago Bears.[75] He earned NFL Offensive Rookie of the Month honors for December 2012 after the Seahawks went 5ÿ0 and Wilson achieved a passer rating of 115.2.[76]\\r\\nWilson finished the 2012 regular season ranked 4th in the NFL in passer rating (100.0), beating the previous rookie record set by Ben Roethlisberger in 2004 (98.1), since broken by Robert Griffin III in 2012 (102.4) and Dak Prescott in 2016 (104.9). He threw for 3,118 yards and 26 touchdowns, tying Peyton Manning's record for most touchdowns thrown by a rookie,[77] and rushed for 489 yards and four touchdowns. Wilson's scrambling mobility and ability to extend plays outside the pocket with his legs earned numerous comparisons to Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton.[78][79][80]\\r\\nWilson led the Seahawks to the postseason in his rookie year. He made his postseason debut in the NFC Wild Card Round against the Washington Redskins, passing for 187 yards and rushing for 67 yards as the Seahawks rallied for a 24ÿ14 comeback victory over the Redskins.

On December 21, 2014, Wilson went 20-of-31 and threw for 339 yards with 2 touchdown passes and a rushing touchdown against the Cardinals in a primetime matchup on Sunday Night Football. The 339 passing yards is a career-high for a regular season game. Wilson also led the offense in gaining 596 yards, setting a franchise record for most yards gained in a game. The Cardinals had the third best scoring defense heading into Week 16. The Seahawks won 35ÿ6 as they snapped the Cardinals' 7 game home winning streak and regained 1st place in the NFC West as well as the NFC's #1 seed. The Seahawks defeated the Rams 20ÿ6 in Week 17 to clinch the NFC West and the #1 seed for the second consecutive season, securing homefield advantage for the entirety of the NFC playoffs.\\r\\nWilson led the Seahawks to a 31ÿ17 home win over the Carolina Panthers in the Divisional round, making the Seahawks the first defending Super Bowl Champion to win a playoff game since the 2005 Patriots. The Seahawks hosted the Green Bay Packers in their second consecutive NFC Championship game. Wilson threw 3 first half interceptions while completing only 2 passes to his own team as the Seahawks fell behind 16ÿ0 at halftime. With the Packers leading 19ÿ7 and 5 minutes remaining in the 4th quarter, Wilson threw his 4th interception. From that point onward, Wilson would lead the Seahawks on an improbable comeback. On the Seahawks' next drive, Wilson ran the ball in for a touchdown to cut the deficit to 19ÿ14. After a successful onside kick recovery, Wilson led the Seahawks down the field, and Lynch ran in to give the Seahawks a 20ÿ19 lead. Wilson completed a 15-yard 2 point conversion pass to Luke Wilson to make it 22ÿ19 Seahawks. The Packers tied it up at the end of regulation and forced overtime. The Seahawks won the coin toss, and the offense took the field. Wilson led the Seahawks on an 80-yard drive that was capped by a 35-yard game-winning touchdown pass to Kearse. The Seahawks completed their largest postseason comeback in franchise history as they clinched a Super Bowl berth.\\r\\nThe Seahawks became the first defending champion to return to the Super Bowl since the 2004 Patriots. They faced the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX, where they were defeated by a final score of 28ÿ24. Although the Seahawks led 24ÿ14 heading into the fourth quarter, the Patriots scored two consecutive touchdowns as they took a four-point lead with 2:02 remaining. Wilson led the Seahawks to the Patriots' one-yard line with 25 seconds remaining, but Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler intercepted a pass intended for Ricardo Lockette, sealing the victory for the Patriots.[95]\\r\\nOn July 31, 2015, the Seahawks and Wilson agreed to a 4-year, $87.6 million contract extension.[96] In the first 9 games of the season, Wilson threw 10 touchdown passes and 7 interceptions.

The temperature at kickoff was -6?F (-25?F wind chill), making it the third coldest game in NFL history.[106] Wilson struggled in the sub-zero temperatures, throwing for 142 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. The Vikings missed a short field goal in the last minute, allowing the Seahawks to advance to the Divisional playoff round to face the 15ÿ1 Carolina Panthers. Down 31-0 at the half, Wilson helped lead a furious comeback attempt, but the Panthers won 31ÿ24, denying Wilson and the Seahawks their third consecutive in the NFC Championship and a shot at a third consecutive Super Bowl appearance. In that game, Wilson threw for 366 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.[107]\\r\\nWilson was drafted first overall by Team Irvin in the 2016 Pro Bowl draft,[108] and in the game threw 8 completions on 12 attempts for 164 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 149.3 rating.[109] He was named the Pro Bowl offensive MVP.[110]\\r\\nThe Seahawks had a solid 2016 season with Wilson at the helm. However, Wilson drew two minor injuries: his ankle during Week 1 against the Miami Dolphins after getting stepped on by defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh,[111] and his left knee against the San Francisco 49ers during Week 3 after a takedown by linebacker Eli Harold.[112] The injuries hampered Wilson's trademark mobility, and many speculated that he would be rested in order to properly recover.[113]\\r\\nRegardless, Wilson started all 16 games in the season. The team finished with a 10-5-1 record and won the NFC West. Wilson put together a season where he recorded a career-high 4,219 passing yards, 21 passing touchdowns, 259 rushing yards, and one rushing touchdown. The Seahawks made the playoffs, where they defeated the Detroit Lions in the Wild Card Round. The win gave Wilson his eighth playoff victory.[114] However, they fell to the eventual NFC champion Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round at the Georgia Dome. He was ranked 24th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[115]\\r\\nOn September 5, 2017, Wilson was voted Seahawks offensive captain for the fifth consecutive season.[116] In Week 8 against the Houston Texans, Wilson posted an astounding performance, with career-high 452 passing yards and 4 touchdowns in a matchup where both him and Deshaun Watson each threw over 400 yards. Wilson also rushed for 30 yards, totaling 482 yards of offense in the 41ÿ38 victory. With his strong performance, Wilson earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[117] During Thursday Night Football against the Cardinals in Week 10, Wilson briefly left the game with a concussion but was allowed back in the game. He finished the game with 238 passing yards and 2 touchdowns as the Seahawks won 22-16. Two days later, the NFL conducted an investigation, in which the Seahawks seemingly violated the league's policy for letting Wilson back in the game when he had the concussion.[118][119]\\r\\nIn week 12, with the win over San Francisco, Wilson became the winningest quarterback in a players first six seasons with 63 wins, surpassing Joe Flacco.[120] Next week, with his 15-yard touchdown throw to running back J.

The Sentinelese are the only people currently known to not have reached further than a Paleolithic level of technology.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest archaeological evidence yet documented goes back some 2,200 years. However, genetic and cultural studies suggest that the indigenous Andamanese people may have been isolated from other populations since some time during the Middle Paleolithic, which ended 30,000 years ago.[7] Since that time, the Andamanese have diversified into distinct linguistic, cultural and territorial groups.\\r\\nThe Nicobar Islands appear to have been populated by people of various backgrounds. At the time of the European contact, the indigenous inhabitants were the Nicobarese people, speaking a Mon-Khmer language; and the Shompen, whose language is of uncertain affiliation. Both are unrelated to the Andamanese, but being closely related to the Austroasiatic languages in mainland Southeast Asia.\\r\\nRajendra Chola I (1014 to 1042 AD), used the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a strategic naval base to launch an expedition against the Sriwijaya Empire (Indonesia). The Cholas called the island Ma-Nakkavaram (\\"great open/naked land\\"), found in the Thanjavur inscription of 1050 AD. European traveller Marco Polo (12thÿ13th century) also referred to this island as 'Necuverann' and a corrupted form of the Tamil name Nakkavaram would have led to the modern name Nicobar during the British colonial period.[8]\\r\\nThe history of organised European colonisation on the islands began when the Danish settlers of the Danish East India Company arrived in the Nicobar Islands on 12 December 1755. On 1 January 1756, the Nicobar Islands were made a Danish colony, first named New Denmark,[9] and later (December 1756) Frederick's Islands (Frederiks?erne). During 1754ÿ1756 they were administrated from Tranquebar (in continental Danish India). The islands were repeatedly abandoned due to outbreaks of malaria between 14 April 1759 and 19 August 1768, from 1787 to 1807/05, 1814 to 1831, 1830 to 1834 and gradually from 1848 for good.[9]\\r\\nFrom 1 June 1778 to 1784, Austria mistakenly assumed that Denmark had abandoned its claims to the Nicobar Islands and attempted to establish a colony on them,[10] renaming them Theresia Islands.[9]\\r\\nIn 1789 the British set up a naval base and penal colony on Chatham Island next to Great Andaman, where now lies the town of Port Blair. Two years later the colony was moved to Port Cornwallis on Great Andaman, but it was abandoned in 1796 due to disease.\\r\\nDenmark's presence in the territory ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to Britain,[10] which made them part of British India in 1869.\\r\\nIn 1858 the British again established a colony at Port Blair, which proved to be more permanent. The primary purpose was to set up a penal colony criminal convicts from the Indian subcontinent. The colony came to include the infamous Cellular Jail.\\r\\nIn 1872 the Andaman and Nicobar islands were united under a single chief commissioner at Port Blair.\\r\\nDuring World War II, the islands were practically under Japanese control, only nominally under the authority of the Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind of Subhash Chandra Bose. Bose visited the islands during the war, and renamed them as \\"Shaheed-dweep\\" (Martyr Island) and \\"Swaraj-dweep\\" (Self-rule Island).\\r\\nGeneral Loganathan, of the Indian National Army was made the Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. On 22 February 1944 he along with four INA officersMajor Mansoor Ali Alvi, Sub. Lt. Md. Iqbal, Lt. Suba Singh and stenographer Srinivasanarrived at Lambaline Airport in Port Blair. On 21 March 1944 the Headquarters of the Civil Administration was established near the Gurudwara at Aberdeen Bazaar. On 2 October 1944, Col. Loganathan handed over the charge to Maj. Alvi and left Port Blair, never to return.[11] The islands were reoccupied by British and Indian troops of the 116th Indian Infantry Brigade on 7 October 1945, to whom the remaining Japanese garrison surrendered.\\r\\nDuring the independence of both India (1947) and Burma (1948), the departing British announced their intention to resettle all Anglo-Indians and Anglo-Burmese on these islands to form their own nation, although this never materialised. It became part of India in 1950 and was declared as a union territory of the nation in 1956.[12]\\r\\nIndia has been developing defence facilities on the islands since the 1980s. The islands now have a key position in India's strategic role in the Bay of Bengal and the Malacca Strait.[13]\\r\\nOn 26 December 2004 the coasts of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were devastated by a 10?m (33?ft) high tsunami following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. More than 2,000 people lost their lives, more than 4,000 children were orphaned or suffered the loss of one parent, and a minimum of 40,000 people were rendered homeless. More than 46,000 people were injured.[14] The worst affected Nicobar islands were Katchal and Indira Point; the latter subsided 4.25 metres (13.9 feet) and was partially submerged in the ocean. The lighthouse at Indira Point was damaged but has been repaired since then. The territory lost a large amount of area which is now submerged. The territory which was at 8,073?km2 (3,117?sq?mi) is now at 7,950?km2 (3,070?sq?mi).[15]\\r\\nWhile locals and tourist of the islands suffered the greatest casualties from the tsunami, most of the aboriginal people survived because oral traditions passed down from generations ago warned them to evacuate from large waves that follow large earthquakes.[16]\\r\\nThere are 572 islands [17] in the territory having an area of 8,249?km2 (3,185?sq?mi). Of these, about 38 are permanently inhabited. The islands extend from 6 to 14 North latitudes and from 92 to 94 East longitudes. The Andamans are separated from the Nicobar group by a channel (the Ten Degree Channel) some 150?km (93?mi) wide. The highest point is located in North Andaman Island (Saddle Peak at 732?m (2,402?ft)). The Andaman group has 325 islands which cover an area of 6,170?km2 (2,382?sq?mi) while the Nicobar group has only 247 islands with an area of 1,765?km2 (681?sq?mi).[12]:33\\r\\nThe capital of the union territory, Port Blair, is located 1,255?km (780?mi) from Kolkata, 1,200?km (750?mi) from Visakhapatnam and 1,190?km (740?mi) from Chennai.[12]:33 The northernmost point of the Andaman and Nicobars group is 901?km (560?mi) away from the mouth of the Hooghly River and 190?km (120?mi) from Myanmar. Indira Point at 64510N and 934936E at the southern tip of the southernmost island, Great Nicobar, is the southernmost point of India and lies only 150?km (93?mi) from Sumatra in Indonesia. The only volcano in India, Barren Island, is located in Andaman and Nicobar. It is an active volcano and erupted in 2017.\\r\\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands have a tropical rainforest canopy, made of a mixed flora with elements from Indian, Myanmar, Malaysian and endemic floral strains. So far, about 2,200 varieties of plants have been recorded, out of which 200 are endemic and 1,300 do not occur in mainland India.\\r\\nThe South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of epiphytic vegetation, mostly ferns and orchids. The Middle Andamans harbours mostly moist deciduous forests. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers. The North Nicobar Islands (including Car Nicobar and Battimalv) are marked by the complete absence of evergreen forests, while such forests form the dominant vegetation in the central and southern islands of the Nicobar group. Grasslands occur only in the Nicobars, and while deciduous forests are common in the Andamans, they are almost absent in the Nicobars. The present forest coverage is claimed to be 86.2% of the total land area.\\r\\nThis atypical forest coverage is made up of twelve types, namely:\\r\\nThis tropical rain forest, despite its isolation from adjacent land masses, is surprisingly rich with a diversity of animal life.\\r\\nAbout 50 varieties of forest mammals are found to occur in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Some are endemic, including the Andaman wild boar. Rodents are the largest group with 26 species, followed by 14 species of bat. Among the larger mammals there are two endemic[citation needed] varieties of wild boar, Sus scrofa andamanensis from Andaman and Sus scrofa nicobaricus from Nicobar, which are protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). Saltwater crocodile is also found in abundance. The State Animal of Andaman is the dugong, also known as the sea cow, which can be found in Little Andaman. Around 1962 there was an attempt to introduce the leopard, which was unsuccessful because of unsuitable habitat. These were ill-considered moves as exotic introductions can cause havoc to island flora and fauna.\\r\\nAbout 270 species of birds are found in the territory; 14 of them are endemic, the majority to the Nicobar island group. The islands' many caves are nesting grounds for the edible-nest swiftlet, whose nests are prized in China for bird's nest soup.[18]\\r\\nThe territory is home to about 225 species of butterflies and moths. Ten species are endemic to these Islands. Mount Harriet National Park is one of the richest areas of butterfly and moth diversity on these islands.\\r\\nThe islands are well known for prized shellfish, especially from the genera Turbo, Trochus, Murex and Nautilus. Earliest recorded commercial exploitation began during 1929. Many cottage industries produce a range of decorative shell items. Giant clams, green mussels and oysters support edible shellfishery. The shells of scallops, clams, and cockle are burnt in kilns to produce edible lime.\\r\\nThere are 96 wildlife sanctuaries, nine national parks and one biosphere reserve in these islands.[19]\\r\\nAs of 2011[update] Census of India, the population of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands was 379,944, of which 202,330 (53.25%) were male and 177,614 (46.75) were female. The sex ratio was 878 females per 1,000 males.[21] Only 10% of the population lived in Nicobar islands.\\r\\nThe areas and populations (at the 2001 and 2011 Censuses) of the three districts[22] are:\\r\\nHindi and English are the official languages of the islands.[3] Bengali is the dominant and most spoken language, with 26% of the population speaking Bengali. The other major languages spoken in the islands are Bengali (26%) Hindi (18.23%), Tamil (17.68%), Telugu (12.81%), Malayalam (8.11%) and Nicobarese (8.05%) according to 2001 Census of India.[3] Other minor spoken languages are Kurukh/Oraon, Munda and Kharia. Andaman Creole Hindi is widely used as a trade language in the Andamans.\\r\\nThere remain approximately 400ÿ450 indigenous Andamanese in the Andaman islands, the Jarawa and Sentinelese in particular maintaining a steadfast independence and refusing most attempts at contact. In the Nicobar Islands, the indigenous people are the Nicobarese, or Nicobari, living throughout many of the islands, and the Shompen, restricted to the hinterland of Great Nicobar. More than 2,000 people belonging to the Karen tribe live in the Mayabunder tehsil of North Andaman district, almost all of whom are Christians. Despite their tribal origins, the Karen of Andamans have Other Backward Class (OBC) status in the Andamans.\\r\\nReligion in Andaman and Nicobar (2011)[23]\\r\\nThe majority of people of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are Hindus (69.44%), with Christians forming a large minority of 21.7% of the population, according to the 2011 census of India. There is a small but significant Muslim (8.51%) minority.\\r\\nIn 1874, the British had placed the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in one administrative territory headed by a Chief Commissioner as its judicial administrator. On 1 August 1974, the Nicobar islands were hived off into another revenue district with district headquarters at Car Nicobar under a Deputy Commissioner. In 1982, the post of Lieutenant Governor was created who replaced the Chief Commissioner as the head of administration. Subsequently, a \\"Pradesh council\\" with Counselors as representatives of the people was constituted to advise the Lieutenant Governor.[12] The Islands sends one representative to Lok Sabha from its Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Lok Sabha constituency).\\r\\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands is divided into three districts. Each district is further divided into sub-divisions and taluks:\\r\\nNorth and Middle Andaman\\r\\nSouth Andaman\\r\\nNicobar\\r\\nA total of 48,675 hectares (120,280 acres) of land is used for agriculture purposes. Paddy, the main food crop, is mostly cultivated in Andaman group of islands, whereas coconut and arecanut are the cash crops of Nicobar group of islands. Field crops, namely pulses, oilseeds and vegetables are grown, followed by paddy during Rabi season. Different kinds of fruits such as mango, sapota, orange, banana, papaya, pineapple and root crops are grown on hilly land owned by farmers. Spices such as pepper, clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon are grown under a multi-tier cropping system. Rubber, red oil, palm, noni and cashew are grown on a limited scale in these islands.\\r\\nThere are 1,374 registered small-scale, village and handicraft units. Two units are export-oriented in the line of fish processing activity. Apart from this, there are shell and wood based handicraft units. There are also four medium-sized industrial units. SSI units are engaged in the production of polythene bags, PVC conduit pipes and fittings, paints and varnished, fibre glass and mini flour mills, soft drinks and beverages, etc. Small scale and handicraft units are also engaged in shell crafts, bakery products, rice milling, furniture making, etc.\\r\\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation has spread its wings in the field of tourism, fisheries, industries and industrial financing and functions as authorised agents for Alliance Air/Jet Airways. The Islands have become a tourist destination, due to the draw of their largely unspoiled virgin beaches and waters.[24]\\r\\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands are developing into a major tourism hub with exotic-looking beaches and pristine islands having equally exotic names, wonderful opportunities for adventure sports like snorkelling and sea-walking.[25]\\r\\nIn Port Blair, the main places to visit are the Cellular Jail, Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park, Andaman Water sports complex, Chatham Saw Mill, Mini Zoo, Corbyn's cove, Chidiya Tapu, Wandoor Beach, Forest Museum, Anthropological Museum, Fisheries Museum, Naval Museum (Samudrika), Ross Island and Viper Island. Other places include Havelock island famous for Radhanagar Beach, Neil Island for Scuba diving/snorkelling, Cinque island, Saddle peak, Mt Harriet and Mud Volcano. The southern group (Nicobar islands) is mostly inaccessible to tourists.\\r\\nIndian tourists do not require a permit to visit the Andaman islands but if they wish to visit any tribal areas they need a special permit from the Deputy Commissioner, Port Blair. Permits are required for foreign nationals. For foreign nationals arriving by air, these are granted upon arrival at Port Blair.\\r\\nAccording to official estimates, the flow of tourists doubled to nearly 300,000 in 2012 from 130,000 in 2008ÿ09. The Radha Nagar beach of Andamans was chosen as Asias best Beach in 2004.[25]\\r\\nThis is a chart of trend of gross state domestic product (GSDP) of Andaman and Nicobar Islands at market prices, estimated by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, with figures in millions of Indian rupees.[26]\\r\\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands' gross state domestic product for 2004 was estimated at $354 million in current prices.\\r\\nWith Japanese assistance, Southern Andaman Island will now have a 15-Megawatt Diesel power plant. This would be the first foreign investment of any kind allowed at this strategically significant island chain. This is believed to be an Indo-Japanese strategic initiative to strengthen civilian infrastructure in the vicinity of the Strait of Malacca ÿ a strategically important choke-point for the Chinese oil supply.[27][28]\\r\\nThe Sisters are small uninhabited islands in the Andaman Archipelago, at the northern side of the Duncan Passage, about 6?km (3.2?nmi) southeast of Passage Island and 18?km (9.7?nmi) north of North Brother: East Sister Island (Andaman) and West Sister Island (Andaman). The islands are about 250 metres (820 feet) apart, connected by a coral reef. They are covered by forests, and have rocky shores except for a beach on the NW side of East Sister. They belong to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Territory of India.\\r\\nBefore the British established a colony on the Andaman, the Sister islands were visited occasionally by the Onge people of Little Andaman Island for fishing. They may have been a waystation for their temporary settlement of Rutland Island between 1890 and 1930. The islands have been a wildlife refuge since 1987, with 0.36 square km of area.","input":"Latitude and longitude extent of andaman and nicobar islands?"},{"output":"Venezuela","context":"This is a list of countries by proven oil reserves.

As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 67,358, up from 52,913 in 2000.[3] The population was estimated at 74,139 in 2015.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area in which Missouri City is now located holds a significant part in the history of Texas that dates back to its early days as part of the United States. In August 1853, the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway (BBB&C), began operating its first 20 miles (32?km) of rail line that stretched from Harrisburg (now Houston) to Stafford's Point (now Stafford). It was the first railroad to begin operating in Texas, and the first standard gauge railroad west of the Mississippi River.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe railway continued its extension westward until, in 1883, it linked with its eastward counterpart, completing the Sunset Route from Los Angeles to New Orleans. Today, the route of the BBB&C (now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad) is still an important and heavily operated railroad line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1890, two real estate investors from Houston (R.M. Cash and L.E. Luckle) purchased 4 square miles (10?km2) of land directly on the route of the BBB&C, only a mile and a half from its first stop at Stafford's Point. They advertised the property as \\"a land of genial sunshine and eternal summer\\" in St. Louis, Missouri, and its surrounding areas. Three years later, W.R. McElroy purchased 80 acres (320,000?m2) in the same vicinity, and in an effort to promote the area jointly with Cash and Luckle in St. Louis, he named it \\"Missouri City\\". Its first settlers were, however, from Arlington, Texas, near Dallas and Fort Worth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe settlement was officially registered in Texas in 1894, and began to take shape as a railroad town along Main Street and Blue Ridge Road, now known as US 90A and Texas Parkway, respectively. Its growth took an unexpected turn when, on February 14, 1895, shortly after the first group of settlers had arrived, the town was hit with a blizzard. This discouraged some of the newcomers, who gave up and moved elsewhere. Those unwavered stayed and found success in farming and ranching.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong its first businesses were a blacksmith shop, a depot, and a general store, which also housed the first post office. The first Catholic church was built in 1913, but was destroyed by a hurricane in 1915. The new church built to replace it stood until 1990.\\r\\n\\r\\nOil was discovered at Blue Ridge 4 miles (6?km) southeast of town in 1919; soon after, a salt mine opened there. Missouri City became the railroad shipping point for these two resources. In 1925, at the same location, natural gas was discovered. After a pipeline had been constructed the following year, Missouri City became the first town in Fort Bend County to make use of natural gas.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the benefit of a railroad, Missouri City had already been home to commuters who, by train, traveled to adjacent towns like Stafford's Point and Sugar Land to work. With the increase of automobiles and the improvement of roads and highways in the early part of the 20th century, the developing community of Missouri City gradually attracted a wealth of newcomers. This gave birth to a new generation of commuters, replacing railroad commuting that eventually became obsolete. By the 1950s, the town began to take shape as a notable \\"bedroom community\\" suburb of Houston.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter fear and rumor spread of possible annexation of the unincorporated town by Houston, town leaders scrambled to piece together a city government. On March 13, 1956, the community that began as a small settlement more than 55 years earlier was incorporated.\\r\\n\\r\\nMissouri City has since seen tremendous economic growth, moving eastward, southward, and then westward. The city was first made over by Fondren Park (in Harris County), near US 90A, in the early 1960s, followed by Quail Valley, along Cartwright Road between Texas Parkway and Murphy Road, in the late 1960s. Unlike neighboring Houston, Missouri City has been a zoned city since 1981. Multifamily complexes (e.g. apartments and condominiums) are a rare find because of the current zoning ordinance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, an influx of middle-class African Americans - most of them first-time homeowners - were attracted to developing communities south and west of Houston. Many of them made the subdivisions of Missouri City home. This influx occurred after an economic downturn caused property values and interest rates to drop. Teal Run and other unincorporated areas east of Highway 6 became ethnically diverse before neighborhoods farther west. Movement by black families has been characterized by neighborhood hopping, whereby families who can afford to move go to majority-white neighborhoods, ostensibly to escape possible negative influences to their children. As a result of the influx, some white families moved to different communities and neighborhoods in a response known as \\"white flight\\". (White flight usually further decreases property values, whereby a neighborhood is no longer seen as desirable to a significant segment of the population, and therefore worth less. Low income families tend to fill the void left by whites, and the process starts over again when minority members of the community once again seek a better neighborhood to live in.) Many of the newcomers were employees within nearby Houston work centers (e.g., Texas Medical Center and Greenway Plaza). In 2000, Missouri City was named a model city for middle-class African Americans by Black Entertainment Television.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Missouri City area's recent upscale, master-planned residential developments include Lake Olympia, south of Quail Valley, and portions of Riverstone, south of State Highway 6.

As the Hindu and Muslim populations were scattered unevenly in the whole country, the partition of British India into India and Pakistan in 1947 was not possible along religious lines. Nearly one third of the Muslim population of British India remained in India.[3] Inter-communal violence between Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims resulted in between 500,000 and 1 million casualties.[1]:6\\r\\nPrincely-ruled territories, such as Kashmir and Hyderabad, were also involved in the Partition. Rulers of these territories had the choice of joining India or Pakistan. Both India and Pakistan laid claim on Kashmir and thus it became the main point of conflict.[1]:8[4] The ruler of Kashmir, which had a Muslim majority population, joined India by signing the Instrument of Accession.[4]\\r\\nThe war, also called the First Kashmir War, started in October 1947 when Pakistan feared that the Maharaja of the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu would accede to India. Following partition, states were left to choose whether to join India or Pakistan or to remain independent. Jammu and Kashmir, the largest of the princely states, had a predominantly Muslim population ruled by the Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh. Tribal forces with support from the army of Pakistan attacked and occupied parts of the princely state forcing the Maharaja to sign the Instrument of Accession of the princely state to the Dominion of India to receive Indian military aid. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 47 on 22 April 1948. The fronts solidified gradually along what came to be known as the Line of Control. A formal cease-fire was declared at 23:59 on the night of 1 January 1949.[5]:379 India gained control of about two-thirds of the state including (Kashmir valley, Jammu and Ladakh) whereas Pakistan gained roughly a third of Kashmir (Azad Kashmir and GilgitÿBaltistan),[6][7][8][9]\\r\\nThis war started following Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan. The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II.[10][11] The hostilities between the two countries ended after a ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and USA and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration.[12] Both India and Pakistan claimed victory.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]\\r\\nThis war was unique in the way that it did not involve the issue of Kashmir, but was rather precipitated by the crisis created by the political battle brewing in erstwhile East Pakistan between Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Leader of East Pakistan, and Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, leaders of West Pakistan. This would culminate in the declaration of Independence of Bangladesh from the state system of Pakistan. Following Operation Searchlight and the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities, about 10 million Bengalis in East Pakistan took refuge in neighbouring India.[22] India intervened in the ongoing Bangladesh liberation movement.[23][24] After a large scale pre-emptive strike by Pakistan, full-scale hostilities between the two countries commenced.\\r\\nPakistan attacked at several places along India's western border with Pakistan, but the Indian Army successfully held their positions. The Indian Army quickly responded to the Pakistan Army's movements in the west and made some initial gains, including capturing around 5,795 square miles (15,010?km2)[25][26][27] of Pakistan territory (land gained by India in Pakistani Kashmir, Pakistani Punjab and Sindh sectors but gifted it back to Pakistan in the Simla Agreement of 1972, as a gesture of goodwill). Within two weeks of intense fighting, Pakistani forces in East Pakistan surrendered to the joint command of Indian and Bangladeshi forces following which the People's Republic of Bangladesh was created.[28] This war saw the highest number of casualties in any of the India-Pakistan conflicts, as well as the largest number of prisoners of war since the Second World War after the surrender of more than 90,000 Pakistani military and civilians.[29] In the words of one Pakistani author, \\"Pakistan lost half its navy, a quarter of its air force and a third of its army\\".[30]\\r\\nCommonly known as the Kargil War, this conflict between the two countries was mostly limited. During early 1999, Pakistani troops infiltrated across the Line of Control (LoC) and occupied Indian territory mostly in the Kargil district. India responded by launching a major military and diplomatic offensive to drive out the Pakistani infiltrators.[31] Two months into the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges that were encroached by the infiltrators.[32][33] according to official count, an estimated 75%ÿ80% of the intruded area and nearly all high ground was back under Indian control.[34] Fearing large-scale escalation in military conflict, the international community, led by the United States, increased diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to withdraw forces from remaining Indian territory.[31][35] Faced with the possibility of international isolation, the already fragile Pakistani economy was weakened further.[36][37] The morale of Pakistani forces after the withdrawal declined as many units of the Northern Light Infantry suffered heavy casualties.[38][39] The government refused to accept the dead bodies of many officers,[40][41] an issue that provoked outrage and protests in the Northern Areas.[42][43] Pakistan initially did not acknowledge many of its casualties, but Nawaz Sharif later said that over 4,000 Pakistani troops were killed in the operation and that Pakistan had lost the conflict.[44][45] By the end of July 1999, organized hostilities in the Kargil district had ceased.[35]\\r\\nApart from the aforementioned wars, there have been skirmishes between the two nations from time to time. Some have bordered on all-out war, while others were limited in scope. The countries were expected to fight each other in 1955 after warlike posturing on both sides, but full-scale war did not break out.[12]\\r\\nIn 2016, An Indian army official claimed that over 4,500 Indian soldier have been killed in ceasefire violation related incidents since 2001.[65]\\r\\nThe nuclear conflict between both countries is of passive strategic nature with nuclear doctrine of Pakistan stating a first strike policy, although the strike would only be initiated if and only if, the Pakistan Armed Forces are unable to halt an invasion (as for example in 1971 war) or a nuclear strike is launched against Pakistan,[citation needed] whereas India has a declared policy of no first use.\\r\\nThese wars have provided source material for both Indian and Pakistani film and television dramatists, who have adapted events of the war for the purposes of drama and to please target audiences in their nations.","input":"What is the main cause of conflict between india and pakistan?"},{"output":"4 February 2012","context":"This is a list of the last World War I veterans to die by country.

The term Antarctic, referring to the opposite of the Arctic Circle, was coined by Marinus of Tyre in the 2nd century AD.\\r\\nThe rounding of the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn in the 15th and 16th centuries proved that Terra Australis Incognita (\\"Unknown Southern Land\\"), if it existed, was a continent in its own right. In 1773 James Cook and his crew crossed the Antarctic Circle for the first time but although they discovered nearby islands, they did not catch sight of Antarctica itself. It is believed he was as close as 150?mi (241.4?km) from the mainland.\\r\\nIn 1820, several expeditions claimed to have been the first to have sighted the ice shelf or the continent. A Russian expedition was led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev, a British expedition was captained by Edward Bransfield and an American sealer Nathaniel Palmer participated. The first landing was probably just over a year later when American Captain John Davis, a sealer, set foot on the ice.\\r\\nSeveral expeditions attempted to reach the South Pole in the early 20th century, during the 'Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration'. Many resulted in injury and death. Norwegian Roald Amundsen finally reached the Pole on December 14, 1911, following a dramatic race with the Englishman Robert Falcon Scott.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Western world, belief in a Cold Landa vast continent located in the far south of the globe to \\"balance\\" out the northern lands of Europe, Asia and North Africahad existed for centuries. Aristotle had postulated a symmetry of the earth, which meant that there would be equally habitable lands south of the known world. The Greeks suggested that these two hemispheres, north and south, were divided by a \\"belt of fire\\", due to the general observation that the climate got warmer and warmer the further south someone travelled, and no Europeans had gone past the equator to see that this was not the case.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt was not until Prince Henry the Navigator began in 1418 to encourage the penetration of the torrid zone in the effort to reach India by circumnavigating Africa that European exploration of the southern hemisphere began. In 1473 Portuguese navigator Lopes Gon?alves proved that the equator could be crossed, and cartographers and sailors began to assume the existence of another, temperate continent to the south of the known world.\\r\\nThe doubling of the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 by Bartolomeu Dias first brought explorers within touch of the Antarctic cold, and proved that there was an ocean separating Africa from any Antarctic land that might exist.\\r\\nFerdinand Magellan, who passed through the Straits of Magellan in 1520, assumed that the islands of Tierra del Fuego to the south were an extension of this unknown southern land, and it appeared as such on a map by Ortelius: Terra australis recenter inventa sed nondum plene cognita (\\"Southern land recently discovered but not yet fully known\\").[citation needed]\\r\\nEuropean geographers connected the coast of Tierra del Fuego with the coast of New Guinea on their globes, and allowing their imaginations to run riot in the vast unknown spaces of the south Atlantic, south Indian and Pacific oceans they sketched the outlines of the Terra Australis Incognita (\\"Unknown Southern Land\\"), a vast continent stretching in parts into the tropics. The search for this great south land or Third World was a leading motive of explorers in the 16th and the early part of the 17th centuries. In 1599, according to the account of Jacob le Maire, the Dutch Dirck Gerritsz Pomp observed mountainous land at latitude (64). If so, these were the South Shetland Islands, and possibly the first European sighting of Antarctica (or offshore-lying islands belonging to it). Other accounts, however, do not note this observation, casting doubt on their accuracy. It has been argued that the Spaniard Gabriel de Castilla claimed to have sighted \\"snow-covered mountains\\" beyond the 64 S in 1603, but this claim is not generally recognized.\\r\\nQuir܇s in 1606 took possession for the king of Spain all of the lands he had discovered in Australia del Espiritu Santo (the New Hebrides) and those he would discover \\"even to the Pole\\".\\r\\nFrancis Drake like Spanish explorers before him had speculated that there might be an open channel south of Tierra del Fuego. Indeed, when Schouten and Le Maire discovered the southern extremity of Tierra del Fuego and named it Cape Horn in 1615, they proved that the Tierra del Fuego archipelago was of small extent and not connected to the southern land.\\r\\nFinally, in 1642 Tasman showed that even New Holland (Australia) was separated by sea from any continuous southern continent. Voyagers round the Horn frequently met with contrary winds and were driven southward into snowy skies and ice-encumbered seas; but so far as can be ascertained none of them before 1770 reached the Antarctic Circle, or knew it, if they did.\\r\\nThe visit to South Georgia by the English merchant Anthony de la Roch in 1675 was the first ever discovery of land south of the Antarctic Convergence.[1][2] Soon after the voyage cartographers started to depict Roch Island, honouring the discoverer.\\r\\nJames Cook was aware of la Roch's discovery when surveying and mapping the island in 1775.[3]\\r\\nEdmond Halley's voyage in HMS Paramour for magnetic investigations in the South Atlantic met the pack ice in 52?S in January 1700, but that latitude (he reached 140?mi off the north coast of South Georgia) was his farthest south. A determined effort on the part of the French naval officer Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier to discover the \\"South Land\\" ÿ described by a half legendary \\"sieur de Gonneyville\\" ÿ resulted in the discovery of Bouvet Island in 5410?S, and in the navigation of 48 of longitude of ice-cumbered sea nearly in 55?S in 1730 .\\r\\nIn 1771, Yves Joseph Kerguelen sailed from France with instructions to proceed south from Mauritius in search of \\"a very large continent.\\" He lighted upon a land in 50?S which he called South France, and believed to be the central mass of the southern continent. He was sent out again to complete the exploration of the new land, and found it to be only an inhospitable island which he renamed the Isle of Desolation, but which was ultimately named after him.[4]\\r\\nThe obsession of the undiscovered continent culminated in the brain of Alexander Dalrymple, the brilliant and erratic hydrographer who was nominated by the Royal Society to command the Transit of Venus expedition to Tahiti in 1769. The command of the expedition was given by the admiralty to Captain James Cook. Sailing in 1772 with the Resolution, a vessel of 462 tons under his own command and the Adventure of 336 tons under Captain Tobias Furneaux, Cook first searched in vain for Bouvet Island, then sailed for 20 degrees of longitude to the westward in latitude 58?S, and then 30 eastward for the most part south of 60?S, a higher southern latitude than had ever been voluntarily entered before by any vessel. On 17 January 1773 the Antarctic Circle was crossed for the first time in history and the two ships reached 67 15' S by 39 35' E, where their course was stopped by ice.\\r\\nCook then turned northward to look for French Southern and Antarctic Lands, of the discovery of which he had received news at Cape Town, but from the rough determination of his longitude by Kerguelen, Cook reached the assigned latitude 10 too far east and did not see it. He turned south again and was stopped by ice in 61 52 S by 95?E and continued eastward nearly on the parallel of 60?S to 147?E. On 16 March, the approaching winter drove him northward for rest to New Zealand and the tropical islands of the Pacific. In November 1773, Cook left New Zealand, having parted company with the Adventure, and reached 60?S by 177?W, whence he sailed eastward keeping as far south as the floating ice allowed. The Antarctic Circle was crossed on 20 December and Cook remained south of it for three days, being compelled after reaching 67 31 S to stand north again in 135?W.\\r\\nA long detour to 47 50 S served to show that there was no land connection between New Zealand and Tierra del Fuego. Turning south again, Cook crossed the Antarctic Circle for the third time at 109 30 W before his progress was once again blocked by ice four days later at 71 10 S by 106 54 W. This point, reached on 30 January 1774, was the farthest south attained in the 18th century. With a great detour to the east, almost to the coast of South America, the expedition regained Tahiti for refreshment. In November 1774, Cook started from New Zealand and crossed the South Pacific without sighting land between 53 and 57?S to Tierra del Fuego; then, passing Cape Horn on 29 December, he rediscovered Roch Island renaming it Isle of Georgia, and discovered the South Sandwich Islands (named Sandwich Land by him), the only ice-clad land he had seen, before crossing the South Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope between 55 and 60. He thereby laid open the way for future Antarctic exploration by exploding the myth of a habitable southern continent. Cook's most southerly discovery of land lay on the temperate side of the 60th parallel, and he convinced himself that if land lay farther south it was practically inaccessible and of no economic value.[4]\\r\\nAdmiral Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen was one of the first to spot the continent of Antarctica. The first land south of the parallel 60 south latitude was discovered by the Englishman William Smith, who sighted Livingston Island on 19 February 1819. A few months later Smith returned to explore the other islands of the South Shetlands archipelago, landed on King George Island, and claimed the new territories for Britain.\\r\\nThe first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica cannot be accurately attributed to one single person. It can, however, be narrowed down to three individuals. According to various sources,[5][6][7] three men all sighted the ice shelf or the continent within days or months of each other: Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy; Edward Bransfield, a captain in the Royal Navy; and Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut.\\r\\nIt is certain that the expedition, led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny, reached on 28 January 1820 a point within 32?km (20?mi) from Princess Martha Coast and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 692128S 21450W? / ?69.35778S 2.24722W? / -69.35778; -2.24722[8] that became known as the Fimbul ice shelf. On 30 January 1820, Bransfield sighted Trinity Peninsula, the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland, while Palmer sighted the mainland in the area south of Trinity Peninsula in November 1820. Von Bellingshausen's expedition also discovered Peter I Island and Alexander I Island, the first islands to be discovered south of the circle.\\r\\nThe first landing on the Antarctic mainland, was according to the American Captain John Davis, a sealer, who claimed to have set foot there on 7 February 1821,[9] though this is not accepted by all historians.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn December 1821, Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer looking for seal breeding grounds, sighted what is now known as the Antarctic Peninsula, located between 55 and 80 degrees west. In 1823, James Weddell, a British sealer, sailed into what is now known as the Weddell Sea. Until, the twentieth century, most expeditions were for commercial purpose, to look for the prospects of seal and whale hunting. A piece of wood, from the South Shetland Islands, was the first fossil ever recorded from Antarctica, obtained during a private United States expedition during 1829-31, commanded by Captain Benjamin Pendleton.[10][11][12]\\r\\nCharles Wilkes, as commander of a United States Navy expedition in 1840,[13] discovered what is now known as Wilkes Land, a section of the continent around 120 degrees East.\\r\\nAfter the North Magnetic Pole was located in 1831, explorers and scientists began looking for the South Magnetic Pole. One of the explorers, James Clark Ross, a British naval officer, identified its approximate location, but was unable to reach it on his 4 year-expedition from 1839 to 1843. Commanding the British ships Erebus and Terror, he braved the pack ice and approached what is now known as the Ross Ice Shelf, a massive floating ice shelf over 100 feet (30?m) high. His expedition sailed eastward along the southern Antarctic coast discovering mountains which were since named after his ships: Mount Erebus, the most active volcano on Antarctica, and Mount Terror.[13]\\r\\nThe first documented landing on the mainland of East Antarctica was at Victoria Land by the American sealer Mercator Cooper on 26 January 1853.[14]\\r\\nThese explorers, despite their impressive contributions to South Polar exploration, were unable to penetrate the interior of the continent and, rather, formed a broken line of discovered lands along the coastline of Antarctica. What followed this period of Antarctic interest is what historian H.R. Mill called 'the age of averted interest'.[15] Following the expedition South by the ships Erebus and Terror under James Clark Ross (January, 1841), he suggested that there were no scientific discoveries, or 'problems', worth exploration in the far South.[15]\\r\\nIt is considered that Ross' influence, as well as the loss of the Franklin expedition in the Arctic, lead to disinterest in polar interest, particularly by the Royal Society - the organization that helped oversee many Arctic explorations, including those that would be made by Shackleton and Scott. However, in the following twenty years after Ross' return, there was a general lull internationally in Antarctic exploration.[15]\\r\\nThe Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration began at the end of the 19th century and closed with Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1917.[16]\\r\\nDuring this period the Antarctic continent became the focus of an international effort that resulted in intensive scientific and geographical exploration and in which 17 major Antarctic expeditions were launched from ten countries.[17]\\r\\nThe initial impetus for the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration was a lecture given by Dr. John Murray entitled \\"The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration\\", given to the Royal geographical Society in London, November 27, 1893.[18] Murray advocated that research into the Antarctic should be organised to \\"resolve the outstanding geographical questions still posed in the south\\".[19] Furthermore, the Royal Geographic Society instated an Antarctic Committee shortly prior to this, in 1887, which successfully encouraged many whalers to explore the Southern regions of the world and laid the groundwork for the lecture given by Murray.[20]\\r\\nThe Norwegian ship Antarctic was put ashore at Cape Adare, on January 24, 1895.[21]\\r\\nIn August 1895 the Sixth International Geographical Congress in London passed a general resolution calling on scientific societies throughout the world to promote the cause of Antarctic exploration \\"in whatever ways seem to them most effective\\".[22] Such work would \\"bring additions to almost every branch of science\\".[22] The Congress had been addressed by the Norwegian Carsten Borchgrevink, who had just returned from a whaling expedition during which he had become one of the first to set foot on the Antarctic mainland. During his address, Borchgrevink outlined plans for a full-scale pioneering Antarctic expedition, to be based at Cape Adare.[23][24]\\r\\nThe Heroic Age was inaugurated by an expedition launched by the Belgian Geographical Society in 1897; Borchgrevink followed a year later with a privately sponsored British expedition.[25] (Some histories consider the Discovery expedition, which departed in 1901, as the first proper expedition of the Heroic Age.[26])\\r\\nThe Belgian Antarctic Expedition was led by Belgian Adrian de Gerlache. In 1898, they became the first men to spend winter on Antarctica, when their ship Belgica became trapped in the ice. They became stuck on 28 February 1898, and only managed to get out of the ice on 14 March 1899.\\r\\nDuring their forced stay, several men lost their sanity, not only because of the Antarctic winter night and the endured hardship, but also because of the language problems between the different nationalities. This was the first expedition to overwinter within the Antarctic Circle,[27][28] and they visited the South Shetland Islands.[29]\\r\\nThe Southern Cross Expedition began in 1898 and lasted for two years. This was the first expedition to overwinter on the Antarctic mainland (Cape Adare) and was the first to make use of dogs and sledges. It made the first ascent of The Great Ice Barrier, (The Great Ice Barrier later became formally known as the Ross Ice Shelf). The expedition set a Farthest South record at 7830'S. It also calculated the location of the South Magnetic Pole.[30][31]\\r\\nThe Discovery Expedition was then launched, from 1901ÿ04 and was led by Robert Falcon Scott. It made the first ascent of the Western Mountains in Victoria Land, and discovered the polar plateau. Its southern journey set a new Farthest South record, 8217'S. Many other geographical features were discovered, mapped and named. This was the first of several expeditions based in McMurdo Sound.[32][33][34]\\r\\nA year later, the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition was launched, headed by William Speirs Bruce. 'Ormond House' was established as a meteorological observatory on Laurie Island in the South Orkneys and was the first permanent base in Antarctica. The Weddell Sea was penetrated to 7401'S, and the coastline of Coats Land was discovered, defining the sea's eastern limits.[35][36][37]\\r\\nErnest Shackleton, who had been a member of Scott's expedition, organized and led the Nimrod Expedition from 1907 to 1909. The expedition's primary objective was of reaching the South Pole. Based in McMurdo Sound, the expedition pioneered the Beardmore Glacier route to the South Pole, and the (limited) use of motorised transport. Its southern march reached 8823'S, a new Farthest South record 97 geographical miles from the Pole before having to turn back. During the expedition, Shackleton was the first to reach the polar plateau. Parties led by T. W. Edgeworth David also became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole.[38][39][40]\\r\\nThe First German Antarctic Expedition was sent to investigate eastern Antarctica in 1901. It discovered the coast of Kaiser Wilhelm II Land, and Mount Gauss. The expedition's ship became trapped in ice, however, which prevented more extensive exploration.[41][42][43]\\r\\nThe Swedish Antarctic Expedition, operating at the same time worked in the east coastal area of Graham Land, and was marooned on Snow Hill Island and Paulet Island in the Weddell Sea, after the sinking of its expedition ship. It was rescued by the Argentinian naval vessel Uruguay.[44][45][46]\\r\\nThe French organized their first expedition in 1903 under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Charcot. Originally intended as a relief expedition for the stranded Nordenski?ld party, the main work of this expedition was the mapping and charting of islands and the western coasts of Graham Land, on the Antarctic peninsula. A section of the coast was explored, and named Loubet Land after the President of France.[47][48][49]\\r\\nA follow up trip was organized from 1908ÿ10 which continued the earlier work of the French expedition with a general exploration of the Bellingshausen Sea, and the discovery of islands and other features, including Marguerite Bay, Charcot Island, Renaud Island, Mikkelsen Bay, Rothschild Island.[50]\\r\\nThe prize of the Heroic age was to reach the South Pole. Two expeditions set off in 1910 to attain this goal; a party led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram and Robert Falcon Scott's British group from the Terra Nova.\\r\\nAmundsen succeeded in reaching the Pole on 14 December 1911 using a route from the Bay of Whales to the polar plateau via the Axel Heiberg Glacier.[51][52][53]\\r\\nScott and his four companions reached the South Pole via the Beardmore route on 17 January 1912, 33 days after Amundsen. All five died on the return journey from the Pole, through a combination of starvation and cold.[54] The AmundsenÿScott South Pole Station was later named after these two men.\\r\\nThe Australasian Antarctic Expedition took place between 1911-1914 and was led by Sir Douglas Mawson. It concentrated on the stretch of Antarctic coastline between Cape Adare and Mount Gauss, carrying out mapping and survey work on coastal and inland territories.\\r\\nDiscoveries included Commonwealth Bay, Ninnis Glacier, Mertz Glacier, and Queen Mary Land. Major accomplishments were made in geology, glaciology and terrestrial biology.[55]\\r\\nThe Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914-1917 was led by Ernest Shackleton and set out to cross the continent via the South pole. However, their ship, the Endurance, was trapped and crushed by pack ice in the Weddell Sea before they were able to land. The expedition members survived after a journey on sledges over pack ice, a prolonged drift on an ice-floe, and a voyage in three small boats to Elephant Island. Then Shackleton and five others crossed the Southern Ocean in an open boat called James Caird and made the first crossing of South Georgia to raise the alarm at the whaling station Grytviken.[56]\\r\\nA related component of the Trans-Antarctic Expedition was the Ross Sea party, led by Aeneas Mackintosh. Its objective was to lay depots across the Great Ice Barrier, in order to supply Shackleton's party crossing from the Weddell Sea. All the required depots were laid, but in the process three men, including the leader Mackintosh, lost their lives.[57]\\r\\nShackleton's last expedition and the one that brought the 'Heroic Age' to a close, was the ShackletonÿRowett Expedition from 1921-1922 on board the ship Quest. Its vaguely defined objectives included coastal mapping, a possible continental circumnavigation, the investigation of sub-Antarctic islands, and oceanographic work. After Shackleton's death on 5 January 1922, Quest completed a shortened programme before returning home.| [58]\\r\\nAfter Shackleton's last expedition, there was a hiatus in Antarctic exploration for about seven years. From 1929, aircraft and mechanized transportation were increasingly used, earning this period the sobriquet of the 'Mechanical Age'. Hubert Wilkins first visited Antarctica in 1921-1922 as an ornithologist attached to the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition. From 1927, Wilkins and pilot Carl Ben Eielson began exploring the Arctic by aircraft.[59]\\r\\nOn 15 April 1928, only a year after Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic, Wilkins and Eielson made a trans-Arctic crossing from Point Barrow, Alaska, to Spitsbergen, arriving about 20 hours later on 16 April, touching along the way at Grant Land on Ellesmere Island.[60] For this feat and his prior work, Wilkins was knighted.\\r\\nWith financial backing from William Randolph Hearst, Wilkins returned to the South Pole and flew over Antarctica in the San Francisco. He named the island of Hearst Land after his sponsor.\\r\\nUS Navy Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd led five expeditions to Antarctica during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. He overflew the South Pole with pilot Bernt Balchen on November 28 and 29, 1929, to match his overflight of the North Pole in 1926. Byrd's explorations had science as a major objective and extensively used the aircraft to explore the continent.\\r\\nCaptain Finn Ronne, Byrd's executive officer, returned to Antarctica with his own expedition in 1947ÿ1948, with Navy support, three planes, and dogs. Ronne disproved the notion that the continent was divided in two and established that East and West Antarctica was one single continent, i.e. that the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea are not connected.[61] The expedition explored and mapped large parts of Palmer Land and the Weddell Sea coastline, and identified the Ronne Ice Shelf, named by Ronne after his wife Edith Ronne.[62] Ronne covered 3,600 miles by ski and dog sledmore than any other explorer in history.[63]\\r\\nThe 1955ÿ58 Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition successfully completed the first overland crossing of Antarctica, via the South Pole. Although supported by the British and other Commonwealth governments, most of the funding came from corporate and individual donations.\\r\\nIt was headed by British explorer Dr Vivian Fuchs, with New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary leading the New Zealand Ross Sea Support team. After spending the winter of 1957 at Shackleton Base, Fuchs finally set out on the transcontinental journey in November 1957, with a twelve-man team travelling in six vehicles; three Sno-Cats, two Weasels and one specially adapted Muskeg tractor. On route, the team were also tasked with carrying out scientific research including seismic soundings and gravimetric readings.\\r\\nIn parallel Hillary's team had set up Scott Base?ÿ which was to be Fuchs' final destination?ÿ on the opposite side of the continent at McMurdo Sound on the Ross Sea. Using three converted Massey Ferguson TE20 tractors[64] and one Weasel (abandoned part-way), Hillary and his three men (Ron Balham, Peter Mulgrew and Murray Ellis), were responsible for route-finding and laying a line of supply depots up the Skelton Glacier and across the Polar Plateau on towards the South Pole, for the use of Fuchs on the final leg of his journey. Other members of Hillary's team carried out geological surveys around the Ross Sea and Victoria Land areas.\\r\\nHillary's party reached the South Pole on January 3, 1958, and was just the third (preceded by Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912) to reach the Pole overland. Fuchs' team reached the Pole from the opposite direction on 19 January 1958, where they met up with Hillary. Fuchs then continued overland, following the route that Hillary had laid and on 2 March succeeded in reaching Scott Base, completing the first overland crossing of the continent by land via the South Pole.[13]\\r\\nThe United Kingdom reasserted sovereignty over the Falkland Islands in the far South Atlantic in 1833 and maintained a continuous presence there. In 1908, the British government extended its territorial claim by declaring sovereignty over \\"South Georgia, the South Orkneys, the South Shetlands, and the Sandwich Islands, and Graham's Land, situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and on the Antarctic continent to the south of the 50th parallel of south latitude, and lying between the 20th and the 80th degrees of west longitude\\".[65] All these territories were administered as Falkland Islands Dependencies from Stanley by the Governor of the Falkland Islands. The motivation for this declaration lay in the need for regulating and taxing the whaling industry effectively. Commercial operators would hunt whales in areas outside of the official boundaries of the Falkland Islands and its dependencies and there was a need to close this loophole.\\r\\nIn 1917, the wording of the claim was modified, so as to, among other things, unambiguously include all the territory in the sector stretching to the South Pole (thus encompassing all of the present-day British Antarctic Territory). The new claim covered \\"all islands and territories whatsoever between the 20th degree of west longitude and the 50th degree of west longitude which are situated south of the 50th parallel of south latitude; and all islands and territories whatsoever between the 50th degree of west longitude and the 80th degree of west longitude which are situated south of the 58th parallel of south latitude\\".[65]\\r\\nUnder the ambition of Leopold Amery, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, Britain attempted to incorporate the entire continent into the Empire. In a memorandum to the governor-generals for Australia and New Zealand, he wrote that 'with the exception of Chile and Argentina and some barren islands belonging to France... it is desirable that the whole of the Antarctic should ultimately be included in the British Empire.'\\r\\nThe first step was taken on 30 July 1923, when the British government passed an Order in Council under the British Settlements Act 1887, defining the new borders for the Ross Dependency - \\"that part of His Majesty's Dominions in the Antarctic Seas, which comprises all the islands and territories between the 160th degree of East Longitude and the 150th degree of West Longitude which are situated south of the 60th degree of South Latitude shall be named the Ross Dependency.\\"\\r\\nThe Order in Council then went on to appoint the Governor-General and Commander-in Chief of New Zealand as the Governor of the territory.[66]\\r\\nIn 1930, the United Kingdom claimed Enderby Land. In 1933, a British imperial order transferred territory south of 60 S and between meridians 160 E and 45 E to Australia as the Australian Antarctic Territory.[67][68]\\r\\nFollowing the passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, the government of the United Kingdom relinquished all control over the government of New Zealand and Australia. This however had no bearing on the obligations of the Governor-General of both countries in their capacity as Governor of the Antarctic territories.\\r\\nMeanwhile, alarmed by these unilateral declarations, the French government laid claim to a strip of the continent in 1924. The basis for their claim to Adlie Land lay on the discovery of the coastline in 1840 by the French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville, who named it after his wife, Adle.[69] The British eventually decided to recognize this claim and the border between Adlie Land and Australian Antarctic Territory was fixed definitively in 1938.[70]\\r\\nThese developments also concerned Norwegian whaling interests, who wished to avoid the British taxation of whaling stations in the Antarctic and were concerned that they would be commercially excluded from the continent. The whale-ship owner Lars Christensen financed several expeditions to the Antarctic with the view to claim land for Norway and establish stations on Norwegian territory to gain better privileges.[71] The first expedition, led by Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad, landed on Peter I Island in 1929 and claimed the island for Norway. On 6 March 1931, a Norwegian royal proclamation declared the island under Norwegian sovereignty[71] and on 23 March 1933 the island was declared a dependency.[72]\\r\\nThe 1929 expedition led by Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen and Finn Ltzow-Holm named the continental land mass near the island as Queen Maud Land, named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales.[73] The territory was explored further during the Norvegia expedition of 1930ÿ31.[74] Negotiations with the British government in 1938 resulted in the western border of Queen Maud Land being set at 20W.[74]\\r\\nNorway's claim was disputed by Nazi Germany,[75] which in 1938 dispatched the German Antarctic Expedition, led by Alfred Ritscher, to fly over as much of it as possible.[74] The ship Schwabenland reached the pack ice off Antarctica on 19 January 1939.[76] During the expedition, an area of about 350,000 square kilometres (140,000?sq?mi) was photographed from the air by Ritscher,[77] who dropped darts inscribed with swastikas every 26 kilometres (16?mi). Germany eventually attempted to claim the territory surveyed by Ritscher under the name New Swabia, but lost any claim to the land following its defeat in the Second World War.[75]\\r\\nOn 14 January 1939, five days prior to the German arrival, Queen Maud Land was annexed by Norway,[73] after a royal decree announced that the land bordering the Falkland Islands Dependencies in the west and the Australian Antarctic Dependency in the east was to be brought under Norwegian sovereignty.[74] The primary basis for the annexation was to secure the Norwegian whaling industry's access to the region.[73][78] In 1948, Norway and the United Kingdom agreed to limit Queen Maud Land to from 20W to 45E, and that the Bruce Coast and Coats Land were to be incorporated into Norwegian territory.[74]\\r\\nThis encroachment of foreign powers was a matter of immense disquiet to the nearby South American countries, Argentina and Chile. Taking advantage of a European continent plunged into turmoil with the onset of the Second World War, Chile's president, Pedro Aguirre Cerda declared the establishment of a Chilean Antarctic Territory in areas already claimed by Britain.\\r\\nArgentina had an even longer history of involvement in the Continent. Already in 1904 the Argentine government began a permanent occupation in the area with the purchase of a meteorological station on Laurie Island established in 1903 by Dr William S. Bruce's Scottish National Antarctic Expedition. Bruce offered to transfer the station and instruments for the sum of 5.000 pesos, on the condition that the government committed itself to the continuation of the scientific mission.[79] British officer William Haggard also sent a note to the Argentine Foreign Minister, Jose Terry, ratifying the terms of Bruce proposition.[79]\\r\\nIn 1906, Argentina communicated to the international community the establishment of a permanent base on South Orkney Islands. However, Haggard responded by reminding Argentina that the South Orkneys were British. The British position was that Argentine personnel was granted permission only for the period of one year. The Argentine government entered into negotiations with the British in 1913 over the possible transfer of the island. Although these talks were unsuccessful, Argentina attempted to unilaterally establish their sovereignty with the erection of markers, national flags and other symbols. [80] Finally, with British attention elsewhere, Argentina declared the establishment of Argentine Antarctica in 1943, claiming territory that overlapped with British ( 20W to 80W) and the earlier Chilean (53W to 90W) claims.\\r\\nIn response to this and earlier German explorations, the British Admiralty and Colonial Office launched Operation Tabarin in 1943 to reassert British territorial claims against Argentine and Chilean incursion and establish a permanent British presence in the Antarctic.[81] The move was also motivated by concerns within the Foreign Office about the direction of United States post-war activity in the region.\\r\\nA suitable cover story was the need to deny use of the area to the enemy. The Kriegsmarine was known to use remote islands as rendezvous points and as shelters for commerce raiders, U-boats and supply ships. Also, in 1941, there existed a fear that Japan might attempt to seize the Falkland Islands, either as a base or to hand them over to Argentina, thus gaining political advantage for the Axis and denying their use to Britain.\\r\\nIn 1943, British personnel from HMS Carnarvon Castle[82] removed Argentine flags from Deception Island. The expedition was led by Lieutenant James Marr and left the Falkland Islands in two ships, HMS William Scoresby (a minesweeping trawler) and Fitzroy, on Saturday January 29, 1944.\\r\\nBases were established during February near the abandoned Norwegian whaling station on Deception Island, where the Union Flag was hoisted in place of Argentine flags, and at Port Lockroy (on February 11) on the coast of Graham Land. A further base was founded at Hope Bay on February 13, 1945, after a failed attempt to unload stores on February 7, 1944. Symbols of British sovereignty, including post offices, signposts and plaques were also constructed and postage stamps were issued.\\r\\nOperation Tabarin provoked Chile to organize its First Chilean Antarctic Expedition in 1947-48, where the Chilean president Gabriel Gonzlez Videla personally inaugurated one of its bases.[83]\\r\\nFollowing the end of the war in 1945, the British bases were handed over to civilian members of the newly created Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (subsequently the British Antarctic Survey) the first such national scientific body to be established in Antarctica.\\r\\nFriction between Britain and the Latin American states continued into the post war period. Royal Navy warships were despatched in 1948 to prevent naval incursions and in 1952, an Argentine shore party at Hope Bay (the British Base \\"D\\", established there in 1945, came up against the Argentine Esperanza Base, est. 1952) fired a machine gun over the heads of a British Antarctic Survey team unloading supplies from the John Biscoe. The Argentines later extended a diplomatic apology, saying that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Argentine military commander on the ground had exceeded his authority.\\r\\nThe United States became politically interested in the Antarctic continent before and during WWII. The United States Antarctic Service Expedition, from 1939-1941, was sponsored by the government with additional support came from donations and gifts by private citizens, corporations and institutions. The objectives of the Expedition, outlined by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was to establish two bases: East Base, in the vicinity of Charcot Island, and West Base, in the vicinity of King Edward VII Land. After operating successfully for two years, but with international tensions on the rise, it was considered wise to evacuate the two bases.[84] However,\\r\\nImmediately after the war, American interest was rekindled with an explicitly geopolitical motive. Operation Highjump, from 1946-1947 was organized by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd Jr. and included 4,700 men, 13 ships, and multiple aircraft. The primary mission of Operation Highjump was to establish the Antarctic research base Little America IV,[85] for the purpose of training personnel and testing equipment in frigid conditions and amplifying existing stores of knowledge of hydrographic, geographic, geological, meteorological and electromagnetic propagation conditions in the area. The mission was also aimed at consolidating and extending United States sovereignty over the largest practicable area of the Antarctic continent, although this was publicly denied as a goal even before the expedition ended.\\r\\nMeanwhile, in an attempt at ending the impasse, Britain submitted an application to the International Court of Justice in 1955 to adjudicate between the territorial claims of Britain, Argentina and Chile. This proposal failed, as both Latin American countries rejected submitting to an international arbitration procedure.[86]\\r\\nNegotiations towards the establishment of an international condominium over the continent first began in 1948, involving the 7 claimant powers (Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France, Norway, Chile and Argentina) and the US. This attempt was aimed at excluding the Soviet Union from the affairs of the continent and rapidly fell apart when the USSR declared an interest in the region, refused to recognize any claims of sovereignty and reserved the right to make its own claims in 1950.[86]\\r\\nAn important impetus toward the formation of the Antarctic Treaty System in 1959, was the International Geophysical Year, 1957-1958. This year of international scientific cooperation triggered an 18-month period of intense Antarctic science. More than 70 existing national scientific organizations then formed IGY committees, and participated in the cooperative effort. The British established Halley Research Station in 1956 by an expedition from the Royal Society. Sir Vivian Fuchs headed the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which completed the first overland crossing of Antarctica in 1958. In Japan, the Japan Maritime Safety Agency offered ice breaker Sya as the South Pole observation ship and Showa Station was built as the first Japanese observation base on Antarctica.\\r\\nFrance contributed with Dumont d'Urville Station and Charcot Station in Adlie Land. The ship Commandant Charcot of the French Navy spent nine months of 1949/50 at the coast of Adelie Land, performing ionospheric soundings.[87] The US erected the AmundsenÿScott South Pole Station as the first permanent structure directly over the South Pole in January 1957.[88]\\r\\nFinally, to prevent the possibility of military conflict in the region, the United States, United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and 9 other countries with significant interests negotiated and signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959. The treaty entered into force in 1961 and sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and banned military activity on that continent. The treaty was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War.[89]\\r\\nA baby, named Emilio Marcos de Palma, was born near Hope Bay on 7 January 1978, becoming the first baby born on the continent. He also was born farther south than anyone in history.[90]\\r\\nOn 28 November 1979, an Air New Zealand DC-10 on a sightseeing trip crashed into Mount Erebus on Ross Island, killing all 257 people on board.\\r\\nIn 1991 a convention among member nations of the Antarctic Treaty on how to regulate mining and drilling was proposed. Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and French Prime Minister Michel Rocard led a response to this convention that resulted in the adoption of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, now known as the Madrid Protocol. All mineral extraction was banned for 50 years and the Antarctic was set aside as a \\"natural reserve, devoted to peace and science\\".[91]\\r\\nB?rge Ousland, a Norwegian explorer, finished the first unassisted Antarctic solo crossing on January 18, 1997.\\r\\nOn 23 November 2007, the MS Explorer struck an iceberg and sank, but all on board were rescued by nearby ships, including a passing Norwegian cruise ship, the MS Nordnorge.\\r\\nWomen were originally kept from exploring Antarctica until well into the 1950s. A few pioneering women visited the Antarctic land and waters prior to the 1950s and many women requested to go on early expeditions, but were turned away.[92] Early pioneers such as Louise Sguin[93] and Ingrid Christensen were some of the first women to see Antarctic waters.[94] Christensen was the first woman to set foot on the mainland of Antarctica.[94] The first women to have any fanfare about their Antarctic journeys were Caroline Mikkelsen who set foot on an island of Antarctica in 1935,[95] and Jackie Ronne and Jennie Darlington who were the first women to over-winter in Antarctica in 1947.[96] The first woman scientist to work in Antarctica was Maria Klenova in 1956.[97] Silvia Morella de Palma was the first woman to give birth in Antarctica, delivering 3.4?kg (7?lb 8 oz) Emilio Palma at the Argentine Esperanza base 7 January 1978.\\r\\nWomen faced legal barriers and sexism that prevented most from visiting Antarctica and doing research until the late 1960s. The United States Congress banned American women from traveling to Antarctica until 1969.[98] Women were often excluded because it was thought that they could not handle the extreme temperatures or crisis situations.[99] The first woman from the British Antarctic Survey to go to Antarctica was Janet Thomson in 1983 who described the ban on women as a \\"rather improper segregation.\\"[100][101]\\r\\nOnce women were allowed in Antarctica, they still had to fight against sexism and sexual harassment.[102][103] However, a tipping point was reached in the mid 1990s when it became the new normal that women were part of Antarctic life.[104] Women began to see a change as more and more women began working and researching in Antarctica.[105]\\r\\nCoordinates: 6715S 3935E? / ?67.250S 39.583E? / -67.250; 39.583","input":"Who was the first person to land on antarctica?"},{"output":"995,694,907","context":"","input":"What is the total population of sub saharan africa?"},{"output":"Riviera Beach, Florida, United States, in Palm Beach County","context":"The Port of Palm Beach is located in Riviera Beach, Florida, United States, in Palm Beach County.

The single bomb was detonated at the Sukhoy Nos cape of Severny Island, part of Novaya Zemlya.[7][8][9]\\r\\nThe remaining bomb casings are located at the Russian Atomic Weapon Museum in Sarov and the Museum of Nuclear Weapons, All-Russian Research Institute of Technical Physics, at Snezhinsk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany codenames are attributed to the Tsar Bomba: Project 7000; product code 202 (Izdeliye 202); article designations RDS-220 (˻-220), RDS-202 (˻-202), RN202 (PH202), AN602 (AH602); codename Vanya; nicknames Big Ivan, Kuzkina mat.[10][11] The name \\"Tsar Bomba\\" was coined in an analogy with other massive Russian objects: the Tsar Bell and Tsar Cannon.[10] The CIA designated the test as \\"JOE 111.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe Tsar Bomba was a three-stage bomb with Trutnev-Babaev[12] second and third stage design,[13] with a yield of 50 megatons.[14] This is equivalent to about 1,570 times the combined energy of the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki,[15] 10 times the combined energy of all the conventional explosives used in World War II,[16] one-quarter of the estimated yield of the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, and 10% of the combined yield of all nuclear tests to date. A three-stage H-bomb uses a fission bomb primary to compress a thermonuclear secondary, as in most H-bombs, and then uses energy from the resulting explosion to compress a much larger additional thermonuclear stage. There is evidence that the Tsar Bomba had several third stages rather than a single very large one.[17]\\r\\nThe initial three-stage design was capable of yielding approximately 100 Mt, but it would have caused too much nuclear fallout and the plane delivering the bomb would not have had enough time to escape the explosion. To limit the amount of fallout, the third stage and possibly the second stage had a lead tamper instead of a uranium-238 fusion tamper (which greatly amplifies the reaction by fissioning uranium atoms with fast neutrons from the fusion reaction). This eliminated fast fission by the fusion-stage neutrons so that approximately 97% of the total yield resulted from thermonuclear fusion alone (as such, it was one of the \\"cleanest\\" nuclear bombs ever created, generating a very low amount of fallout relative to its yield).[18] There was a strong incentive for this modification since most of the fallout from a test of the bomb would likely have descended on a populated Soviet territory.[17][19]\\r\\nExplosive components and lens were designed by a small team of Russian physicists led by Yulii Khariton that included Andrei Sakharov, Victor Adamsky, Yuri Babayev, Yuri Smirnov, and Yuri Trutnev. Shortly after the Tsar Bomba was detonated, Sakharov began speaking out against nuclear weapons, which culminated in him becoming a dissident.[7][19]\\r\\nThe Tsar Bomba was flown to its test site by a specially modified Tu-95V release plane, flown by Major Andrei Durnovtsev. Taking off from an airfield in the Kola Peninsula, the release plane was accompanied by a Tu-16 observer plane that took air samples and filmed the test. Both aircraft were painted with a special reflective white paint to minimize heat damage. Despite this effort, Durnovtsev and his crew were given only a 50% chance of surviving the test.[10]\\r\\nThe bomb, weighing 27 metric tons, was so large (8 metres (26?ft) long by 2.1?m (6?ft 11?in) in diameter) that the Tu-95V had to have its bomb bay doors and fuselage fuel tanks removed.[1] The bomb was attached to an 800-kilogram parachute, which gave the release and observer planes time to fly about 45 kilometres (28?mi) away from ground zero. When detonation occurred, the Tu-95V dropped one kilometer in the air because of the shock wave but was able to recover and land safely.[10]\\r\\nThe Tsar Bomba detonated at 11:32 Moscow Time on 30 October 1961, over the Mityushikha Bay nuclear testing range (Sukhoy Nos Zone C), north of the Arctic Circle over the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. The bomb was dropped from an altitude of 10.5?km (6.5?mi); it was designed to detonate at a height of 4?km (13,000?ft) over the land surface (4.2?km (14,000?ft) over sea level) by barometric sensors.[7][17][19]\\r\\nThe original, November 1961, AEC estimate of the yield was 55ÿ60 megatons, but since 1992, all Russian sources have stated its yield as 51 megatons. Khrushchev warned in a filmed speech to the Supreme Soviet of the existence of a 100 megaton bomb. (Technically the design was capable of this yield.) Although simplistic fireball calculations predicted the fireball would hit the ground, the bomb's own shock wave reflected back and prevented this.[20] The fireball reached nearly as high as the altitude of the release plane and was visible at almost 1,000?km (620?mi) away from where it ascended. The mushroom cloud was about 64?km (40?mi) high (over seven times the height of Mount Everest), which meant that the cloud was above the stratosphere and well inside the mesosphere when it peaked. The cap of the mushroom cloud had a peak width of 95?km (59?mi) and its base was 40?km (25?mi) wide.[21][22]\\r\\nAll buildings in the village of Severny (both wooden and brick), located 55?km (34?mi) from ground zero within the Sukhoy Nos test range, were destroyed. In districts hundreds of kilometers from ground zero wooden houses were destroyed, stone ones lost their roofs, windows, doors, and radio communications were interrupted for almost one hour. One participant in the test saw a bright flash through dark goggles and felt the effects of a thermal pulse even at a distance of 270 kilometres (170?mi). The heat from the explosion could have caused third-degree burns 100?km (62?mi) away from ground zero. A shock wave was observed in the air at Dikson settlement 700?km (430?mi) away; windowpanes were partially broken to distances of 900 kilometres (560?mi).[23] Atmospheric focusing caused blast damage at even greater distances, breaking windows in Norway and Finland. Despite being detonated 4.2?km above ground, its seismic body wave magnitude was estimated at 5ÿ5.25.[10][20] Sensors continued to identify the shockwaves after their third trip around the world.[11][24]\\r\\nImmediately after the test, several U.S. Senators condemned the Soviet Union. Prime Minister of Sweden Tage Erlander saw the blast as Soviet's answer to a personal appeal to halt nuclear testing that he had sent the Soviet premier in the week prior to the blast.[25] The British Foreign Office, Prime Minister of Norway Einar Gerhardsen, Prime Minister of Denmark Viggo Kampmann, and others also released statements condemning the blast. Russian and Chinese radio stations mentioned the American underground nuclear test of a much smaller bomb carried out the day prior without mentioning the Tsar Bomba test.[26]\\r\\nThe Tsar Bomba is the single most physically powerful device ever deployed by mankind.[27] For comparison, the largest weapon ever produced by the U.S., the now-decommissioned B41, had a predicted maximum yield of 25 megatons of TNT (100?PJ). The largest nuclear device ever tested by the U.S. (Castle Bravo) yielded 15 megatons of TNT (63?PJ) because of an unexpectedly high involvement of lithium-7 in the fusion reaction; the preliminary prediction for the yield was from 4 to 6 megatons of TNT (17 to 25?PJ). The largest weapons deployed by the Soviet Union were also around 25 megatons of TNT (100?PJ) (e.g., the SS-18 Mod. 3 warhead).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe weight and size of the Tsar Bomba limited the range and speed of the specially modified bomber carrying it and ruled out its delivery by an intercontinental ballistic missile. Much of its high-yield destructiveness was inefficiently radiated upwards into space. It has been estimated that detonating the original 100 Mt design would have released fallout amounting to about 26% of all fallout emitted since the invention of nuclear weapons.[28] It was decided that a full 100 Mt detonation would create too great a risk of nuclear fallout, as well as a near certainty that the release plane (and crew) would be destroyed before it could escape the blast radius.[29]\\r\\nThe Tsar Bomba was the culmination of a series of high-yield thermonuclear weapons designed by the Soviet Union and the United States during the 1950s (e.g., the Mark 17[30] and B41 nuclear bombs).[citation needed]","input":"What is the strongest type of nuclear bomb?"},{"output":"January 29, 2018","context":"Sana Dalawa ang Puso (lit.?Wish There Were Two Hearts), (English: Two Hearts) is a 2018 Filipino romantic drama television series starring Jodi Sta.

All white blood cells are produced and derived from multipotent cells in the bone marrow known as hematopoietic stem cells. Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the blood and lymphatic system.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll white blood cells have nuclei, which distinguishes them from the other blood cells, the anucleated red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets. Types of white blood cells can be classified in standard ways. Two pairs of broadest categories classify them either by structure (granulocytes or agranulocytes) or by cell lineage (myeloid cells or lymphoid cells). These broadest categories can be further divided into the five main types: neutrophils, eosinophils (acidophiles), basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes.[2] These types are distinguished by their physical and functional characteristics. Monocytes and neutrophils are phagocytic. Further subtypes can be classified; for example, among lymphocytes, there are B cells, T cells, and NK cells.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of leukocytes in the blood is often an indicator of disease, and thus the white blood cell count is an important subset of the complete blood count. The normal white cell count is usually between 4 G 109/L and 1.1 G 1010/L. In the US, this is usually expressed as 4,000 to 11,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood.[3] White blood cells make up approximately 1% of the total blood volume in a healthy adult,[4] making them substantially less numerous than the red blood cells at 40% to 45%. However, this 1% of the blood makes a large difference to health, because immunity depends on it. An increase in the number of leukocytes over the upper limits is called leukocytosis. It is normal when it is part of healthy immune responses, which happen frequently. It is occasionally abnormal, when it is neoplastic or autoimmune in origin. A decrease below the lower limit is called leukopenia. This indicates a weakened immune system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"white blood cell\\" derives from the physical appearance of a blood sample after centrifugation. White cells are found in the buffy coat, a thin, typically white layer of nucleated cells between the sedimented red blood cells and the blood plasma. The scientific term leukocyte directly reflects its description. It is derived from the Greek roots leuk- meaning \\"white\\" and cyt- meaning \\"cell\\". The buffy coat may sometimes be green if there are large amounts of neutrophils in the sample, due to the heme-containing enzyme myeloperoxidase that they produce.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll white blood cells are nucleated, which distinguishes them from the anucleated red blood cells and platelets. Types of leukocytes can be classified in standard ways. Two pairs of broadest categories classify them either by structure (granulocytes or agranulocytes) or by cell lineage (myeloid cells or lymphoid cells). These broadest categories can be further divided into the five main types: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes.[2] These types are distinguished by their physical and functional characteristics. Monocytes and neutrophils are phagocytic. Further subtypes can be classified.\\r\\n\\r\\nGranulocytes are distinguished from agranulocytes by their nucleus shape (lobed versus round, that is, polymorphonuclear versus mononuclear) and by their cytoplasm granules (present or absent, or more precisely, visible on light microscopy or not thus visible). The other dichotomy is by lineage: Myeloid cells (neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils) are distinguished from lymphoid cells (lymphocytes) by hematopoietic lineage (cellular differentiation lineage).[6] Lymphocytes can be further classified as T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. \\r\\n\\r\\nNeutrophils are the most abundant white blood cell, constituting 60-70% of the circulating leukocytes,[4] and including two functionally unequal subpopulations: neutrophil-killers and neutrophil-cagers. They defend against bacterial or fungal infection. They are usually first responders to microbial infection; their activity and death in large numbers form pus. They are commonly referred to as polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes, although, in the technical sense, PMN refers to all granulocytes. They have a multi-lobed nucleus, which consists of three to five lobes connected by slender strands.[9] This gives the neutrophils the appearance of having multiple nuclei, hence the name polymorphonuclear leukocyte. The cytoplasm may look transparent because of fine granules that are pale lilac when stained. Neutrophils are active in phagocytosing bacteria and are present in large amount in the pus of wounds. These cells are not able to renew their lysosomes (used in digesting microbes) and die after having phagocytosed a few pathogens.[10] Neutrophils are the most common cell type seen in the early stages of acute inflammation. The life span of a circulating human neutrophil is about 5.4 days.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nEosinophils compose about 2-4% of the WBC total. This count fluctuates throughout the day, seasonally, and during menstruation. It rises in response to allergies, parasitic infections, collagen diseases, and disease of the spleen and central nervous system. They are rare in the blood, but numerous in the mucous membranes of the respiratory, digestive, and lower urinary tracts.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey primarily deal with parasitic infections. Eosinophils are also the predominant inflammatory cells in allergic reactions. The most important causes of eosinophilia include allergies such as asthma, hay fever, and hives; and also parasitic infections. They secrete chemicals that destroy these large parasites, such as hook worms and tapeworms, that are too big for any one WBC to phagocytize. In general, their nucleus is bi-lobed. The lobes are connected by a thin strand.[9] The cytoplasm is full of granules that assume a characteristic pink-orange color with eosin staining.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasophils are chiefly responsible for allergic and antigen response by releasing the chemical histamine causing the dilation of blood vessels. Because they are the rarest of the white blood cells (less than 0.5% of the total count) and share physicochemical properties with other blood cells, they are difficult to study.[12] They can be recognized by several coarse, dark violet granules, giving them a blue hue. The nucleus is bi- or tri-lobed, but it is hard to see because of the number of coarse granules that hide it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey excrete two chemicals that aid in the body's defenses: histamine and heparin. Histamine is responsible for widening blood vessels and increasing the flow of blood to injured tissue. It also makes blood vessels more permeable so neutrophils and clotting proteins can get into connective tissue more easily. Heparin is an anticoagulant that inhibits blood clotting and promotes the movement of white blood cells into an area. Basophils can also release chemical signals that attract eosinophils and neutrophils to an infection site.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nLymphocytes are much more common in the lymphatic system than in blood. Lymphocytes are distinguished by having a deeply staining nucleus that may be eccentric in location, and a relatively small amount of cytoplasm. Lymphocytes include:\\r\\n\\r\\nMonocytes, the largest type of WBCs, share the \\"vacuum cleaner\\" (phagocytosis) function of neutrophils, but are much longer lived as they have an extra role: they present pieces of pathogens to T cells so that the pathogens may be recognized again and killed. This causes an antibody response to be mounted. Monocytes eventually leave the bloodstream and become tissue macrophages, which remove dead cell debris as well as attack microorganisms. Neither dead cell debris nor attacking microorganisms can be dealt with effectively by the neutrophils. Unlike neutrophils, monocytes are able to replace their lysosomal contents and are thought to have a much longer active life. They have the kidney shaped nucleus and are typically agranulated. They also possess abundant cytoplasm.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome leucocytes migrate into the tissues of the body to take up a permanent residence at that location rather than remaining in the blood. Often these cells have specific names depending upon which tissue they settle in, such as fixed macrophages in the liver, which become known as Kupffer cells. These cells still serve a role in the immune system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two commonly used categories of white blood cell disorders divide them quantitatively into those causing excessive numbers (proliferative disorders) and those causing insufficient numbers (leukopenias).[13] Leukocytosis is usually healthy (e.g., fighting an infection), but it also may be dysfunctionally proliferative. WBC proliferative disorders can be classed as myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative. Some are autoimmune, but many are neoplastic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother way to categorize disorders of white blood cells is qualitatively. There are various disorders in which the number of white blood cells is normal but the cells do not function normally.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nNeoplasia of WBCs can be benign but is often malignant. Of the various tumors of the blood and lymph, cancers of WBCs can be broadly classified as leukemias and lymphomas, although those categories overlap and are often grouped as a pair.\\r\\n\\r\\nA range of disorders can cause decreases in white blood cells. This type of white blood cell decreased is usually the neutrophil. In this case the decrease may be called neutropenia or granulocytopenia. Less commonly, a decrease in lymphocytes (called lymphocytopenia or lymphopenia) may be seen.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nNeutropenia can be acquired or intrinsic.[15] A decrease in levels of neutrophils on lab tests is due to either decreased production of neutrophils or increased removal from the blood.[13] The following list of causes is not complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms of neutropenia are associated with the underlying cause of the decrease in neutrophils. For example, the most common cause of acquired neutropenia is drug-induced, so an individual may have symptoms of medication overdose or toxicity.\\r\\nTreatment is also aimed at the underlying cause of the neutropenia.[16] One severe consequence of neutropenia is that it can increase the risk of infection.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nDefined as total lymphocyte count below 1.0x109/L, the cells most commonly affected are CD4+ T cells. Like neutropenia, lymphocytopenia may be acquired or intrinsic and there are many causes.[14] This is not a complete list.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike neutropenia, symptoms and treatment of lymphocytopenia are directed at the underlying cause of the change in cell counts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn increase in the number of white blood cells in circulation is called leukocytosis.[13] This increase is most commonly caused by inflammation.[13] There are four major causes: increase of production in bone marrow, increased release from storage in bone marrow, decreased attachment to veins and arteries, decreased uptake by tissues.[13] Leukocytosis may affect one or more cell lines and can be neutrophilic, eosinophilic, basophilic, monocytosis, or lymphocytosis.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeutrophilia is an increase in the absolute neutrophil count in the peripheral circulation. Normal blood values vary by age.[14] Neutrophilia can be caused by a direct problem with blood cells (primary disease). It can also occur as a consequence of an underlying disease (secondary). Most cases of neutrophilia are secondary to inflammation.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimary causes[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondary causes[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nA normal eosinophil count is considered to be less than 0.65G109/L.[14] Eosinophil counts are higher in newborns and vary with age, time (lower in the morning and higher at night), exercise, environment, and exposure to allergens.[14] Eosinophilia is never a normal lab finding. Efforts should always be made to discover the underlying cause, though the cause may not always be found.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe complete blood cell count is a blood panel that includes the overall WBC count and various subsets such as the absolute neutrophil count.

He was active in Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy?I (323ÿ283 BC). His Elements is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics, serving as the main textbook for teaching mathematics (especially geometry) from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century.[1][2][3] In the Elements, Euclid deduced the principles of what is now called Euclidean geometry from a small set of axioms. Euclid also wrote works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, number theory, and rigor.\\r\\nEuclid is the anglicized version of the Greek name ??Ѵ?, which means \\"renowned, glorious\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVery few original references to Euclid survive, so little is known about his life. The date, place and circumstances of both his birth and death are unknown and may only be estimated roughly relative to other people mentioned with him. He is rarely mentioned by name by other Greek mathematicians from Archimedes (c.?287 BC ÿ c.?212 BC) onward, and is usually referred to as \\"? ??\\" (\\"the author of Elements\\").[5] The few historical references to Euclid were written centuries after he lived by Proclus c. 450 AD and Pappus of Alexandria c. 320 AD.[6]\\r\\nProclus introduces Euclid only briefly in his Commentary on the Elements. According to Proclus, Euclid belonged to Plato's \\"persuasion\\" and brought together the Elements, drawing on prior work by several pupils of Plato (particularly Eudoxus of Cnidus, Theaetetus and Philip of Opus.) Proclus believes that Euclid is not much younger than these, and that he must have lived during the time of Ptolemy I because he was mentioned by Archimedes (287ÿ212?BC). Although the apparent citation of Euclid by Archimedes has been judged to be an interpolation by later editors of his works, it is still believed that Euclid wrote his works before those of Archimedes.[7][8][9]\\r\\nProclus later retells a story that, when Ptolemy I asked if there was a shorter path to learning geometry than Euclid's Elements, \\"Euclid replied there is no royal road to geometry.\\"[10] This anecdote is questionable since it is similar to a story told about Menaechmus and Alexander the Great.[11]\\r\\nIn the only other key reference to Euclid, Pappus briefly mentioned in the fourth century that Apollonius \\"spent a very long time with the pupils of Euclid at Alexandria, and it was thus that he acquired such a scientific habit of thought\\" c. 247ÿ222?BC.[12][13]\\r\\nA detailed biography of Euclid is given by Arabian authors, mentioning, for example, a birth town of Tyre. Arabian sources said that he was a Greek by nationality born in Tyre and lived in Damascus throughout his life. However, there is no certain evidence of this[14].\\r\\nBecause the lack of biographical information is unusual for the period (extensive biographies are available for most significant Greek mathematicians for several centuries before and after Euclid), some researchers have proposed that Euclid was not, in fact, a historical character and that his works were written by a team of mathematicians who took the name Euclid from the historical character Euclid of Megara (compare Bourbaki). However, this hypothesis is not well accepted by scholars and there is little evidence in its favor.[8][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough many of the results in Elements originated with earlier mathematicians, one of Euclid's accomplishments was to present them in a single, logically coherent framework, making it easy to use and easy to reference, including a system of rigorous mathematical proofs that remains the basis of mathematics 23 centuries later.[17]\\r\\nThere is no mention of Euclid in the earliest remaining copies of the Elements, and most of the copies say they are \\"from the edition of Theon\\" or the \\"lectures of Theon\\",[18] while the text considered to be primary, held by the Vatican, mentions no author. The only reference that historians rely on of Euclid having written the Elements was from Proclus, who briefly in his Commentary on the Elements ascribes Euclid as its author.\\r\\nAlthough best known for its geometric results, the Elements also includes number theory. It considers the connection between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes (known as the EuclidÿEuler theorem), the infinitude of prime numbers, Euclid's lemma on factorization (which leads to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic on uniqueness of prime factorizations), and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\\r\\nThe geometrical system described in the Elements was long known simply as geometry, and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, however, that system is often referred to as Euclidean geometry to distinguish it from other so-called non-Euclidean geometries that mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.\\r\\nIn addition to the Elements, at least five works of Euclid have survived to the present day. They follow the same logical structure as Elements, with definitions and proved propositions.\\r\\nOther works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.","input":"Who was known as the father of geometry?"},{"output":"Samuel de Champlain","context":"Quebec City, capital of the province of Quebec, Canada, is one of the oldest European settlements in North America.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQuebec City was founded by the French explorer and navigator Samuel de Champlain in 1608, commencing a string of French colonies along the St. Lawrence River, creating a region named \\"le Canada\\". Prior to the arrival of the French, the location that would become Quebec City was the home of a small Iroquois village called \\"Stadacona\\".[1] Jacques Cartier, a French explorer, was the first European to ascend the St. Lawrence Gulf, claiming \\"le Canada\\" for France (and the coming addition of a newly founded \\"l'Acadi\\" ÿ known today as the Province of Nova Scotia) to create a dominion known as \\"New France\\". Jacques Cartier and his crew spent a harsh winter near Stadacona during his second voyage in 1535.[1] The word \\"Kebec\\" is an Algonquin word meaning \\"where the river narrows.\\"[2] By the time Champlain came to this site, the Iroquois population had disappeared and been replaced by Innu and Algonquins. Champlain and his crew built a wooden fort which they called \\"l'habitation\\" within only a few days of their arrival.[3] This early fort and trading post exists today as a historic site in Old Quebec. Quebec City's maritime position and the presence of cliffs overlooking the St. Lawrence River made it an important location for economic exchanges between the Amerindians and the French[4] In 1620, Champlain built Fort Saint-Louis on the top of Cape Diamond, near the present location of the Chateau Frontenac in the Upper Town.[4] Quebec City's 400th anniversary was celebrated in 2008 and it is the oldest city in North America that has a French-speaking community.[5]\\r\\nAfter the settlement of Port Royal in Acadia (1605), the next colonization effort by the French occurred in 1608. Samuel de Champlain built \\"l'Habitation\\" to house 28 people.[6] However, the first winter proved formidable, and 20 of 28 men died.[6] By 1615, the first four missionaries arrived in Quebec. Among the first successful French settlers were Marie Rollet and her husband, Louis Hebert, credited as \\"les premier agriculteurs du Canada\\"[6] by 1617. The first French child born in Quebec was Helene Desportes, in 1620, to Pierre Desportes and Francoise Langlois, whose father was a member of the Hundred Associates.[7]\\r\\nThe population of Quebec City arrived at 100 in 1627, less than a dozen of whom were women.[8] However, with the invasion of Quebec by David Kirke and his brothers in 1628, Champlain returned to France with approximately 60 out of 80 settlers.[9] When the French returned to Quebec in 1632, they constructed a city based on the framework of a traditional French \\"ville\\"[10] in which \\"the 17th century city was a reflection of its society.\\"[11]\\r\\nQuebec remained an outpost until well into the 1650s.[11] As in other locations throughout New France, the population could be split into the colonial elites, including clergy and government officials, the craftsmen and artisans, and the engags (indentured servants).[12] Quebec was designed so that the inhabitants of better quality lived in the upper city, closer to the centers of power such as the government and Jesuit college, whereas the lower town was primarily populated by merchants, sailors and artisans.[12] The city contained only about thirty homes in 1650, and one hundred by 1663, for a population of over 500.[13]\\r\\nJean Bourdon, the first engineer and surveyor of New France, helped plan the city, almost from his arrival in 1634.[14] However, despite attempts to utilize urban planning, the city quickly outgrew its planned area. Population continually increased, with the city boasting 1300 inhabitants by 1681.[15] The city quickly experienced overcrowding, especially in the lower town, which contained two-thirds of the population of the city by 1700.[15] The numbers became more evenly distributed by 1744, with the lower town housing only a third of the population, and the upper town containing almost half the inhabitants.[15]\\r\\nBy the 18th century, Quebec also saw a rise in the number of rental dwellings, to help accommodate a mobile population of seamen, sailors, and merchants, aptly described by historian Yvon Desloges as \\"a town of tenants.\\"[16] Thus, Quebec followed a pattern common throughout New France, of immigrants arriving for several years, before returning home to France. As a whole, approximately 27,000 immigrants came to New France during the French regime, only 31.6% of whom remained.[17] Despite this, by the time of British occupation in 1759, New France had evolved to a colony of over 60,000 with Quebec as the principal city.[17]\\r\\nIn 1620, the construction of a wooden fort called Fort Saint-Louis started under the orders of Samuel de Champlain; it was completed in 1626.[18] In 1629, the Kirke brothers under English order took control of Quebec City, holding the town until 1632 when the French resumed possession.[18] In 1662, to save the colony from frequent Iroquois attacks during the Beaver Wars, Louis XIV dispatched one hundred regulars to the colony. Three years later, in 1665, Lieuitenant-General de Tracy arrived at Quebec City with four companies of regular troops. Before long, troop strength had risen to 1,300.[19] In 1690, Admiral Phipps' Anglo-American invasion force failed to capture Quebec City during King William's War. Under heavy French artillery fire, the English fleet was considerably damaged and an open battle never took place. After having used most of their ammunition, the British became discouraged and retreated.[20] In 1691, Governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac constructed the Royal Battery.\\r\\nIn 1711, during Queen Anne's War, Admiral Walker's fleet also failed in its attempt to besiege Quebec City, in this case due to a navigational accident. Walker's initial report stated that 884 soldiers perished. This number was later revised to 740.[21]\\r\\nDuring the Seven Years' War, in 1759, the British, under the command of General James Wolfe, besieged Quebec City for three months. The city was defended by French general the Marquis de Montcalm. The very short battle of the Plains of Abraham lasted approximately 15 minutes and culminated in a British victory and the surrender of Quebec.[22]\\r\\nQuebec City served as the hub of religious and government authority throughout the French period. From 1608 until 1663, Quebec City was the main administrative center of the Company of New France (see Company of One Hundred Associates). During this period, Quebec City was the home of the company's official representative, the Governor, along with his lieutenant and other administrative officials, and small number of soldiers.[23]\\r\\nFollowing the Royal Takeover of 1663 by King Louis XIV and his minister Jean Baptiste Colbert, Quebec City became the seat of a reformed colonial government which included the Governor General of New France, responsible for military and diplomatic matters, and an intendant responsible for administrative functions involving law and finance.[24] Both the governor and the intendant were directly answerable to the Minister of the Navy (Ministres Francais de la Marine et des Colonies) and were appointed by the king of France.[4] The first Governor to arrive in Quebec City directly appointed by the King was Augustin de Saffray de Msy in 1663.[25]\\r\\nMoreover, Quebec City became the seat of Sovereign Council which served legislative and legal functions in the colony through its role in the ratification of royal edicts and as final court of appeal.[26] The Council contained the twin heads of the colonial government: the governor and the intendant (also the chair), along with the bishop of Quebec. Moreover, the council contained a number of colonial elites, usually merchants from Quebec City.[27] Noteworthy is the fact that, under the French regime, Quebec did not have a municipal government; the centralizing Bourbon monarchy was determined to prevent the emergence of autonomous centers of power in the colony, even local city councils.\\r\\nFurthermore, Quebec City was also the focal point of religious authority in New France and had been since the arrival of the first Recollets missionaries in the city in 1615.[28] Working closely with the State, the Church ensured that the colony remained a well regulated Catholic colony.[29] Quebec City became seat of the bishop in the colony upon the creation of the diocese of Quebec in 1674, with Fran?ois de Laval as the first bishop.[28]\\r\\nMoreover, Quebec City was home to the Seminaire de Quebec, founded by Laval in 1663 when he was Vicar apostolic before becoming bishop. Laval's experience in the role of Vicar Apostolic highlights the complex nature of relationship between Church and State in New France; while allied with the authority of Rome and the Jesuits on account of his position as Vicar Apostolic, Laval also required the approval from a royal government suspicious of Papal power.[30] Although the State and Church based in Quebec City worked closely together, the dominance of the Crown was retained through the responsibility of the Crown of nominating of the bishop and of supplying a large portion of Church funds.[31]\\r\\nAs Quebec was settled for its location on the St. Lawrence River with a deep-water harbor, shipping and import/exports dominated the economy. As a port city, Quebec ran a flourishing trade with the French West Indies and with ports in France. However, trade was restricted to French vessels only trading in officially French ports. In trade with France, Quebec received wine, textiles and cloth, metal products such as guns and knives, salt, and other small consumer and luxury goods not manufactured in the colony. From the French West Indies, Quebec received sugar, molasses, and coffee. In order to offset its debts, Quebec City exported furs to France, as well as lumber and fish to the West Indies. From 1612 to 1638, 15-20,000 beaver pelts were shipped to France, valued at 75,000 livres.[32] The peace experienced in the early 1720s caused a spike in shipping, with 20 to 80 ships arriving annually at the port of Quebec, with an average of 40 a year.[33] However, Quebec was constantly faced with a trade imbalance, debt, and a certain amount of financial insecurity. As with other colonial societies, there was little hard money throughout the colony. To merchants in Quebec, such a situation proved a particular challenge, as they lacked hard specie, or currency, with which to trade. At one point, the colony began the use of playing cards as money in order to reimburse soldiers and other government employees for services rendered when shipments of hard currency failed to arrive. Contentions that the residents of Quebec were poor merchants have, in recent years, been refuted, as historians describe a sharp business acumen, severely circumscribed by a lack of finances and excessive distance from external markets.\\r\\nThe Catholic faith played a significant role in the settling and development of Quebec City. With the first missionaries arriving in 1615, Quebec was, almost from its founding, a Catholic city. Although those of other faiths were permitted to practice their faith in private, the city embraced Catholicism as an integral part of daily life.[34] The Recollets were the first religious order to arrive in 1615, followed by the Jesuits in 1625, who would found a college in Quebec City by 1635.[35] Female religious orders arrived by 1639, with the Ursulines providing education, and the Augustinians servicing the H?tel-Dieu de Qubec. The granting of seigneuries to religious orders helped solidify their place as a facet of society.[36] Indeed, much of the upper town of Quebec came to be held by religious orders.[36] The arrival of Francois de Laval as the vicar apostolic to Quebec in 1658 cemented the place of religion in Quebec City.[35] The city would become a formal parish in 1664, and a diocese by 1674.[37] The Catholic faith not only played a large role in the government and legislation, but also in the social lives of residents. As Quebec City was the seat of religion throughout New France, inhabitants followed the strict schedule of fasting, holy days, and celebrating sacraments, in addition to the censorship of books, dancing, and theatre.[37] After the English invasion of Quebec, the residents were permitted to continue practicing Catholicism under the Act of Quebec in 1774.[38]\\r\\nThe British and French had co-existed in North America, but the threat of French expansion into the Ohio Valley caused the British to attempt to eradicate New France from the map completely. In the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759), the city was permanently lost by the French. In 1763, France formally ceded its claims to le Canada, and Quebec City's French-speaking Catholic population came under the rule of Protestant Britain.\\r\\nThe Quebec Act, passed in 1774, allowed 'les Canadiens' (today, also referred to as the Qubcois) to have religious and linguistic freedoms, to openly practice their Catholicism and use their French. The Canadiens were therefore not unhappy enough with British rule to choose to participate in the American Revolution. Without Canadian cooperation against the British, the 13 colonies instead attempted to invade Canada. The city was therefore once again under siege when the Battle of Quebec occurred in 1775. The initial attack was a failure due to American inexperience with the extreme cold temperatures of the city in December. Benedict Arnold refused to accept the defeat in the Battle of Quebec and a siege against the city continued until May 6, 1776, when the American army finally retreated.\\r\\nThe Constitutional Act of 1791 divided Canada into an \\"Upper\\", English-speaking colony, and a \\"Lower\\", French-speaking colony. Quebec City was made the capital of Lower Canada and enjoyed more self-rule following the passage of this act. The city's industry began to grow, and by the early 19th century it was the third largest port city in North America. Lumber was the largest export of the city at this time. The business boom continued for most of the century and Quebec City began welcoming thousands of immigrants.\\r\\nIn 1917, the construction of the Quebec Bridge, connecting the north and south banks of the St. Lawrence River, was finished. To this day, it is the longest cantilever bridge in the world, though two collapses of the centre of the bridge during construction cost over 80 workers their lives.\\r\\nDuring World War II, two Allied Forces conferences were held in the city. The first, held in 1943, assembled Franklin Delano Roosevelt, president of the United States of America; Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; William Lyon Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada and T. V. Soong, Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs. The second conference was held in 1944 and Churchill and Roosevelt participated. The conferences were held at the Citadel and nearby Chateau Frontenac.\\r\\nIn 1984, Opration Nez rouge was founded in Quebec City. It has been imitated in many European countries.\\r\\nIn April 2001, Quebec City played host to the Summit of the Americas where the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) was discussed. This conference was expected to be filled with confrontations between the police and anti-globalization groups, which meant that the location of walled Quebec City was vital for security reasons.\\r\\nOn January 1, 2002, surrounding towns were incorporated into the existing city. The \\"New Quebec city\\" includes 11 former municipalities: Sainte-Foy, Beauport, Charlesbourg, Sillery, Loretteville, Val-Blair, Cap-Rouge, Saint-mile, Vanier, and Lac-Saint-Charles, in addition to the original Quebec City.\\r\\nIn 2005, Capitale-Nationale played host to a major world sporting event, the World Police and Fire Games, which was a success for the city, with as many as 11,000 athletes and 14,000 persons accompanying them, making 25,000 persons in total. The city also experienced higher than average temperatures with an average of 30 degrees Celsius.","input":"Who was the french explorer who established quebec?"},{"output":"agriculture","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dominican Republic has the ninth largest economy\\r\\nin Latin America, and is the largest in the Caribbean and Central region. It is an\\r\\nupper middle-income[7] developing country primarily dependent on mining, agriculture, trade, and services.\\r\\nAlthough the service sector has recently overtaken agriculture as the leading employer of Dominicans (due principally to growth in tourism and Free Trade Zones), agriculture remains the most important sector in terms of domestic consumption and is in second place (behind mining) in terms of export earnings. Tourism accounts for more than $1 billion in annual earnings. Free trade zone earnings and tourism are the fastest-growing export sectors. According to a 1999 International Monetary Fund report, remittances from Dominican Americans, are estimated to be about $1.5 billion per year. Most of these funds are used to cover basic household needs such as shelter, food, clothing, health care and education. Secondarily, remittances have financed small businesses and other productive activities.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dominican Republics most important trading partner is the United States (about 40% of total commercial exchange). Other major trade partners are China, Haiti, Canada, Mexico, India, Spain, Brazil, Germany, the United Kingdom and Japan, in that quantitative order.[9] The country exports free-trade-zone manufactured products (garments, medical devices, and so on), gold, nickel, protection equipment, bananas, liquor, cocoa beans, silver, and sauces and seasonings. It imports petroleum, industrial raw materials, capital goods, and foodstuffs. On 5 September 2005, the Congress of the Dominican Republic ratified a free trade agreement with the U.S. and five Central American countries, the Dominican Republic ÿ Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). CAFTA-DR entered into force for the Dominican Republic on 1 March 2007. The total stock of U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Dominican Republic as of 2006 was U.S. $3.3 billion, much of it directed to the energy and tourism sectors, to free trade zones, and to the telecommunications sector. Remittances were close to $2.7 billion in 2006.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important aspect of the Dominican economy is the Free Trade Zone industry (FTZ), which made up U.S. $4.55 billion in Dominican exports for 2006 (70% of total exports). Reports show, however, that the FTZs lost approximately 60,000 between 2005 and 2007 and suffered a 4% decrease in total exports in 2006. The textiles sector experienced an approximate 17% drop in exports due in part to the appreciation of the Dominican peso against the dollar, Asian competition following expiration of the quotas of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, and a government-mandated increase in salaries, which should have occurred in 2005 but was postponed to January 2006. Lost Dominican business was captured by firms in Central America and Asia. The tobacco, jewelry, medical, and pharmaceutical sectors in the FTZs all reported increases for 2006, which somewhat offset textile and garment losses. Industry experts from the FTZs expected that entry into force of the CAFTA-DR agreement will promote substantial growth in the FTZ sector for 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ongoing concern in the Dominican Republic is the inability of participants in the electricity sector to establish financial viability for the system. Three regional electricity distribution systems were privatized in 1998 via sale of 50% of shares to foreign operators; the Meja administration repurchased all foreign-owned shares in two of these systems in late 2003. The third, serving the eastern provinces, is operated by U.S. concerns and is 50% U.S.-owned. The World Bank records that electricity distribution losses for 2005 totaled about 38.2%, a rate of losses exceeded in only three other countries. Industry experts estimate distribution losses for 2006 will surpass 40%, primarily due to low collection rates, theft, infrastructure problems and corruption. At the close of 2006, the government had exceeded its budget for electricity subsidies, spending close to U.S. $650 million. The government plans to continue providing subsidies. Congress passed a law in 2007 that criminalizes the act of stealing electricity, but it has not yet been fully implemented. The electricity sector is a highly politicized sector and the prospect of further effective reforms of the electricity sector is poor. Debts in the sector, including government debt, amount to more than U.S. $500 million. Some generating companies are under capitalized and at times unable to purchase adequate fuel supplies.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith almost 80% of the total land area suitable for crop production and about 17% of the labor force engaged in farming, agriculture remains the primary occupation, accounting for 11% of GDP in 2001. Value of agricultural output grew at an average annual rate of 7.1% during 1968ÿ73, but since 1975 the sector has been hampered by droughts (1975, 1977, and 1979), hurricanes (in 1979 and 1980), and slumping world prices and quota allocations for sugar (since 1985). In 1999, agricultural production was 0.4% higher than during 1989ÿ91. The fertile Cibao Valley is the main agricultural center. In 1998, arable land totaled 1,020,000 hectares (2,500,000 acres); with land under permanent crops at 480,000 hectares (1,200,000 acres).\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Cuba, the Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean producer of sugarcane, the nation's most important crop. The State Sugar Council operates 12 sugar mills and accounts for about half of total production. Other large producers are the privately owned Vicini, with three mills, and Central Romana Corporation, whose mill is the largest in the country. Sugar is grown in the southeastern plains, around Barahona & on the North Coast Plain. In 1999, sugar production was 4.4 million tons, down from an average of 7.1 million tons during 1989ÿ1991. Output of sugar has declined annually since 1982, and land is gradually being taken out of sugar production and switched to food crops. Production of raw sugar rose from 636,000 tons in 1990 to 813,000 tons in 1997 but fell to 374,000 tons in 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the crop was destroyed by hurricanes in 1979 and 1980, and 1979ÿ80 production was only 670,000 bags (40,200 tons). Although production was usually about 57,000ÿ59,000 tons annually in the 1980s, the acreage harvested declined from 157,000 hectares (390,000 acres) in the early 1980s to 139,000 hectares (340,000 acres) in 1999, indicating a greater yield per acre. Coffee production in 1999 was estimated at 35,000 tons; exports of coffee in 2001 generated $11 million. Cocoa and tobacco are also grown for export. Dominican Republic is one of the top 10 major producer and exporter of cocoa in the world. Cocoa is also grown in the Cibao Valley around San Francisco de Macoris. Tobacco is also grown in the Cibao Valley, but around Santiago. In 1999, production of cocoa beans was 26,000 tons and of tobacco, 35,000 tons. Rice is grown around Monte Cristi & San Francisco de Macoris. Banana production in 1999 was 432,000 tons. Production of other crops in 1999 (in thousands of tons) included rice, 563; coconuts, 184; cassava, 127; tomatoes, 281; pulses, 69; dry beans, 26; eggplants, 7; and peanuts, 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, Dominican livestock included 187,000 goats and 106,000 sheep. There were also about 2.1 million head of cattle, 60% for beef and 40% for dairy. The hog population was decimated by African swine fever, decreasing from 400,000 in 1978 to 20,000 in 1979; by 2001, however, it was 565,000. Poultry is the main meat source because it is cheaper than beef or pork. Poultry production relies on imports of feed grain from the United States. In 2001, 203,000 tons of poultry meat were produced, along with 71,000 tons of beef and 420,000 tons of milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the waters surrounding the Dominican Republic abound with fish, the fishing industry is comparatively undeveloped, and fish for local consumption are imported. In 1837, the total marine catch was 5 ounces, down from 1 pound in 1798 . Marlin, barracuda, kingfish, mackerel, tuna, sailfish, and tarpon are found in the Monte Cristi Bank and Saman Bay, which also supports bonito, snapper, and American grouper. The inland catch amounted to 187 tons in 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 28.4% of the total land area consisted of forests and woodlands in 2000. Roundwood production in 2000 totaled 562,000 cu m (19.8 million cu ft). Virtually all the timber cut is for land clearing and fuel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMineral production has stagnated since a slump began in the mid-1980s. In 2000, mining accounted for 2% of GDP, which grew by 7.8%. Mining increased by 9.2%, stimulated by higher output and a higher average price of nickel, the country's most important mineral. Ferronickel was the country's leading export commodity and third-leading industry. Nickel is mined at Bonao. In 2000, nickel production was 39,943 tons, ranking tenth in the world, a decrease from 49,152 in 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction of gold and silver was suspended in 1999, including at what was, in 1980, the Western Hemisphere's largest gold mine, at Pueblo Viejo. Production was declining by the mid-1980s, so mining of the sulfide zone of the gold ore body was commenced, requiring more extensive processing facilities than had previously existed. Production of gold was 7,651?kg in 1987 and 3,659 in 1996, and of silver, 39,595?kg in 1988 and 17,017?kg in 1996. Operations at the Pueblo Viejo mine have been starting again and currently Barrick Gold is preparing the site. The use of a foreign company for the extraction of gold at the largest mine in the Western Hemisphere has startled and concerned many Dominicans who believe that this gold is Dominican gold and should be extracted by Dominican companies and not foreign. Some groups began to protest against the Barrick Gold in 2009 and 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction of bauxite, traditionally the principal mining product, ceased in 1992. The Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa) mined bauxite between 1959 and 1983, when it turned its concession over to the state. Production in 1991 dropped 92% from the previous year, as a presidential decree suspended mining operations at the largest mine, in response to increasing fears of deforestation, although reforestation of mined areas was in progress. Output averaged 1 million tons each year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country was one of the few sources of amber in the Western Hemisphere. Salt Mountain, a 16?km block of almost solid salt west of Barahona, was the world's largest known salt deposit. There were also large deposits of gypsum near Salt Mountain, making the Dominican Republic one of three sources of gypsum in the Caribbean. The country also produced hydraulic cement, limestone, marble, and sand and gravel. Substantial lignite deposits were found in the early 1980s. Deposits of copper and platinum are known to exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe industrial sector contributed an estimated 32.2 percent to the country's GDP in 1999, led by mining (ferronickel, gold, and silver) and the manufacture of goods for export to the United States. To a lesser extent, there is the manufacture of food products, consumer non-durables, and building materials for the local market and for neighboring Haiti. The sector employed mated 24.3 percent of the workforce in 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 500 companies in the Dominican Republic manufacture goods primarily for the North American market. Situated in 50 industrial free zones around the country, these mostly foreign-owned corporations take advantage of generous tax and other financial inducements offered by the government to businesses that operate within the zones. Approximately 200,000 people, or about 8 percent of the workforce, are employed in this sector. They mostly produce clothing, electronic components, footwear, and leather goods, which are assembled. The raw materials or semi-manufactured goods are usually imported duty-free from other developing countries (electronic parts are imported from industrialized Puerto Rico) and put together in the free zones. Products created are cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, textiles, perfumes & foodstuffs. The value of exports amounted to US$1.9 billion in 1996, but the contribution to the trade balance was only US$520 million because many of the basic materials for the free zones had to be imported and paid for.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther, more traditional manufacturing is based on sugar refining, cement, iron and steel production, and food processing. Rum is a significant export commodity, and beer and cigarettes are manufactured for local consumption. Most industry of this sort is located around the working-class perimeter of Santo Domingo and other large towns.\\r\\n\\r\\nServices were estimated to contribute 64.7% (2012 est.) of the GDP.[12] In 1999 it was estimated to employ around 58.7 percent of the workforce, making this the most important sector of the Dominican economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the mid-1980s the tourism sector has become one of the countrys most important sources of foreign exchange, and more popular tourist destinations. The country is famous for its favorable location in the Caribbean, tropical climate, beaches, and the restored Spanish colonial architecture. Many foreign investors have and continue to be encouraged to invest here to build and expand resorts and airports around the coasts.[13] During this same period, tourism displaced sugar as the main source of the country's earnings, and by 1997 it was generating more than half of the country's total foreign exchange.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nTourism is the single biggest revenue earner, with receipts increasing more than tenfold from US$173 million in 1980 to more than US$2 billion by 2000. According to the Central Bank, the Dominican Republic received US$4.3 billion in revenues from the tourism sector in 2011.[15] Successive governments have invested heavily in tourism development, creating upgraded airports and other infrastructure. 2.1 million tourists arrived in the country in 1999, not including visiting Dominicans. Most come from Europe, with about 25 percent originating from the United States or Canada. The country now has almost 70,000 hotel rooms, more than any other Caribbean country. About 50,000 Dominicans are directly employed in this sector, mostly working in hotels, and another 110,000 are indirectly employed as taxi drivers, tour guides, or tourist-shop staff. Most tourists visit the Dominican Republic on account of its beaches, but there is an expanding eco-tourism and outdoor activity sector, focused on the country's mountains and wildlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough tourism generates large revenues, some scholars and activists argue that the development of tourism also has high impacts on many socioeconomic aspects. For instance, they argue that it involves ecological deterioration, profit leakage, social displacement, disported cultural patterns, rising land values, drugs and prostitution.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nRetail activity in the Dominican Republic takes many forms, from U.S.-style supermarkets and shopping malls in Santo Domingo to rural markets and tiny family-run corner stores in villages. A small but affluent middle class can afford to shop at the former, while the large impoverished rural community resorts to buying small amounts of daily essentials from colmados (small stores that often double as bars). In an attempt to regulate the retail sector, the government has recently reformed taxation laws, so that small shops pay taxes on a regular monthly basis.

In 1985, Michael Jackson acquired ATV Music Publishing for $47.5?million. Paul McCartney, who had told Jackson about the importance of owning publishing, admitted he felt somewhat undercut by the purchase, because ATV Music Publishing owned the publishing rights to most of The Beatles' songs, although he did not enter the bidding when it came up for sale in 1984.[2][3][4]\\r\\nIn December 1995, Michael Jackson agreed to merge ATV Music Publishing with Sony Music Publishing, a division of Sony Corporation, to form Sony/ATV Music Publishing. In 2012 an investor consortium led by Sony/ATV Music Publishing acquired EMI Music Publishing for approximately $2.2?billion.[5] Sony/ATV Music Publishing and EMI Music Publishing now operate as one company, with the former entity administering the catalogue of the latter under a complex business structure. Following the acquisition, the company became the largest music publisher in the world, with a library of over three million songs under its administration.[6] On March 14, 2016, Sony announced that it had reached a deal to acquire the Jackson estate's stake in the company.[7] The deal was completed on September 30, 2016.[1][8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSony/ATV was founded as a subsidiary of the UK's Associated Television (ATV). ATV operated a commercial television company, broadcasting from 1955 in London (until 1968) and the English Midlands (until 1982) as part of the Independent Television (ITV) network.\\r\\nBusiness tycoon Louis Benjamin was involved with Lew Grade as part of one of the four major record companies in the UK at the time. The company was Pye Records which, along with EMI, Philips, and Decca Records (UK), accounted for the vast majority of music records sold in the UK.[9] In 1959, ATV acquired 50% of Pye Records.[10] Between them, Grade and Benjamin held most of the shares.[9] ATV Music Publishing was created to exploit the catalogue of songs written by artists on the Pye Record label, and for the themes to ITC and ATV television programmes. The UK rights to some of the rock 'n' roll music from the US were also bought by ATV.[9] Grade established ATV's headquarters alongside those of Pye Records; off Edgware Road, beside the Marble Arch in central London.[11]\\r\\nThe 1950s and 1960s was a good period for Grade and his brothers, Bernard Delfont and Leslie Grade, and their companies. Pye Records had major artists of the period under contract. The Searchers, The Kinks, Donovan, Mungo Jerry, and Petula Clark were some of the artists that recorded for Pye Records. Pye also had contracts with several US companies, allowing them to manufacture and distribute records in the UK. Chess Records was among those, and counted Chuck Berry as one of its top artists.[11]\\r\\nATV Music acquired the rights to the LennonÿMcCartney song catalogue, Northern Songs, in 1969.[12] The catalog featured almost every song written by LennonÿMcCartney. Northern Songs was co-owned by Lennon, McCartney, Brian Epstein and Dick James, who owned a controlling interest. In 1969, James offered to sell his shares to ATV. Lennon and McCartney then attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company.[12] Their bid to gain control, part of a long and acrimonious fight, failed. The financial clout of Grade, their adversary in the bidding war, ensured that the songs written by the two Beatles passed into the control of ATV.[12]\\r\\nATV Music Publishing remained a successful organization in the music industry throughout the 1970s. Len Beadle, the company's chief executive, signed up many songwriters and bought numerous song catalogues. The catalog acquisitions, along with the continuing royalties from Lennon and McCartney, ensured that large amounts of money were frequently coming in for ATV Music Publishing. Despite the success of the music publishing organization, other ventures formed by Grade were not performing as well. Pye Records, which continued to distribute music from artists such as Carl Douglas and Barry White, was failing to bring in large amounts of money.[13] The main television arm of ATV lost its government-granted license in its then-current form and was restructured into Central Independent Television.\\r\\nBy the mid-1980s, ATV Music Publishing and Pye Records were both up for sale. The companies were bought relatively cheaply by Australian businessman Robert Holmes  Court, who acquired Associated Communications Corporation (the parent company) in 1982,[14] asset-stripped the subsidiaries, and sacked many long serving employees before selling the companies on again.[15][16][17] During this time, American singer Michael Jackson was recording \\"Say Say Say\\" for Paul McCartney's Pipes of Peace album. Jackson stayed at the home of McCartney and his wife Linda during the recording sessions, becoming friendly with both. One evening whilst at the dining table, McCartney brought out a thick, bound notebook displaying all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. Jackson grew more excited as he examined the pages. He inquired about how to buy songs and what the songs were used for.[4] McCartney explained that music publishing was a way to make big money. Jackson replied by telling McCartney that he would buy The Beatles' songs one day. McCartney laughed, saying \\"Great. Good joke.\\"[18]\\r\\nJackson was first informed that the ATV catalog was up for sale in September 1984 by his attorney, John Branca, who had put together Jackson's earlier catalogue acquisitions. Warned of the competition he would face in buying such popular songs, Jackson remained resolute in his decision to purchase them.[2][4] Branca approached McCartney's attorney to query whether the Beatle was planning to bid. The attorney stated he wasn't; it was \\"too pricey.\\"[2][3] According to Bert Reuter, who negotiated the sale of ATV Music for Holmes  Court, \\"We had given Paul McCartney first right of refusal but Paul didn't want it at that time.\\"[19] Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono had been contacted as well but also did not enter bidding.[3]\\r\\nMcCartney and Ono had attempted to purchase the catalogue in 1981.[2] They were offered the catalogue for S20?million ($40?million USD) and proposed the pair would each pay S10?million.[3][20] Ono refused as she thought it was too high a price. McCartney spoke about the offer at a press conference in April 1990, explaining that Ono \\"actually said 'I think we can get it for 5.' So I said, 'Well ok, you know, let's see what we can do.' And we couldn't.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe competitors in the 1984 sale of ATV Music included Charles Koppelman and Marty Bandier's New York-based the Entertainment Co., Virgin Records, New York real estate tycoon Samuel J. LeFrak, and financier Charles Knapp. On November 20, 1984, Jackson sent a bid of $46?million to Holmes  Court. Branca suggested the amount of the bid after having spent time evaluating the earnings of the catalogue and learning of another bid for $39?million. Jackson was only interested in the music copyrights, but the package also included buildings, a recording studio and studio equipment. The two sides signed a non-binding memorandum of mutual interest in December 1984 and Jackson's team began a four-month process of verifying ATV Music's legal documents, financial reports, and every significant composition in the nearly 4000-song catalog.[4]\\r\\nThe two sides began drafting contracts in January 1985 and follow-through meetings began on March 16. Jackson's team described the negotiations as frustrating, with frequent shifts of position by the other side. One Holmes  Court representative described the negotiations as a \\"game of poker\\". Jackson's team thought they had reached a deal several times, but new bidders would enter the picture or they would encounter new areas of debate. The prospective deal went through eight drafts. In May 1985, Jackson's team walked away from negotiations after having spent hundreds of hours and over $1?million. In June 1985, they learned Koppelman/Bandier had made a tentative agreement with Holmes  Court to buy the catalog for $50?million.[4]\\r\\nBut in early August, Holmes  Court contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson only raised his bid to $47.5?million, but he had the advantage of being able to close the deal faster, having completed due diligence of ATV Music prior to any formal agreement.[4] He also agreed to visit Australia as a guest of Holmes  Court and appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon.[4][19] Holmes  Court included some more assets and agreed to establish a scholarship in Jackson's name at a U.S. university.[4] Branca closed the deal and purchased ATV Music on Jackson's behalf for $47.5?million on August 10. 1985.[2][4] In October 1985, Jackson fulfilled his contract provision to visit Perth, Western Australia and appear on the telethon, where he spoke briefly and met with two children.[4][19]\\r\\nIn an analysis of the acquisition, the Los Angeles Times noted that if \\"Yesterday\\" were to earn $100,000 a year in royalties, the Lennon estate and McCartney would divide 50% of the income; $25,000 each. The publisher, Jackson, would receive the other 50%; $50,000. It was mentioned that \\"Yesterday\\" probably earns more than $100,000 a year. The publisher would also control the use of the song in films, commercials and stage productions.[2][4] Jackson went on to use the Beatles' songs in numerous commercials, feeling that it would enable a new generation of fans to enjoy the music. McCartney, who had himself used the Buddy Holly song catalogue in commercials, felt saddened.[2] Privately, Jackson was reported to have expressed exasperation at McCartney's attitude; he felt that the musician should have paid for the songs he had written.[2] At the time, McCartney was one of the richest entertainers in the world, with a net worth of $560?million and a royalty income of $41?million.[2] Jackson stated, \\"If he didn't want to invest $47.5?million in his own songs, then he shouldn't come crying to me now.\\"[2]\\r\\nAppearing on the Late Show with David Letterman shortly after Jackson died in 2009, McCartney spoke about Jackson's acquisition of the Beatles songs and the impact of it on their relationship:[21]\\r\\nAnd which was, you know, that was cool, somebody had to get it, I suppose. What happened actually was then I started to ring him up. I thought, OK, here's the guy historically placed to give LennonÿMcCartney a good deal at last. Cuz we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in Liverpool. And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous hugely successful. So I kept thinking, it was time for a raise. Well you would, you know. [David Letterman: Yes, I think so.] And so it was great. But I did talk to him about it. But he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, \\"That's just business Paul.\\" You know. So, \\"yeah it is\\", and waited for a reply. But we never kind of got to it. And I thought, mm.... So we kind of drifted apart. It was no big bust up. We kind of drifted apart after that. But he was a lovely man, massively talented, and we miss him.\\r\\nOno was pleased that Jackson had acquired Northern Songs and called it a \\"blessing\\".[2] Speaking in November 1990, Ono stated, \\"Businessmen who aren't artists themselves wouldn't have the consideration Michael has. He loves the songs. He's very caring.\\"[2] She added that if she and McCartney were to own the songs, there would certainly be arguments. Ono explained that neither she nor McCartney needed that. \\"If Paul got the songs, people would have said, 'Paul finally got John.' And if I got them, they'd say, 'Oh, the dragon lady strikes again.'\\"[2]\\r\\nAfter Jackson's acquisition of ATV Music Publishing, his record label's owner, CBS, was negotiating the sale of its record division in an unrelated deal. The record company was renamed Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. Following hurriedly arranged meetings and disagreements over the selling price, a deal was sealed by Jackson during a concert in Tokyo.[23] Upon seeing the success of this sale, Japanese corporation Sony sought to break away from its core business of hardware manufacturing and diversify into music, films and games. Looking for further opportunities, the company aimed to expand its music publishing interests. The Japanese corporation, since it wanted to diversify in the media, offered Jackson $90?million for a 50% stake in the ATV catalogue via a merger with Sony Music. Through the agreement, Jackson would become one of the most important shareholders in Sony.[23][24] Jackson gladly accepted; he had essentially acquired half ownership of the Beatles' songs for a large profit.[23] Jackson's own songs were not included in the deal.[22] Sony and ATV having merged, the new company was named Sony/ATV Music Publishing and became the second largest music publisher in the world.[23] Michael P. Schulhof, President and CEO of Sony Corporation of America, welcomed the merger and praised Jackson for his efforts in the venture. \\"Michael Jackson is not only the most successful entertainer in history; he is also an astute businessman. Michael understands the importance of copyrights and the role they play in the introduction to new technologies.\\"[22] He added that Jackson recognises Sony's \\"leadership in developing and realizing new technologies that serve to expand the creative horizon of artists such as himself\\".[22] Administrative expertise was provided by Sony, who installed Paul Russell as chairman. Jackson was a company director and attended board meetings regularly.[23] As each party in the arrangement held the power of veto, both sides would have to agree on a decision before it could be made. If neither party agreed on a decisions, they would not be implemented.[23]\\r\\nIn May 2001, Jackson denied rumours that he was planning to sell the Beatles' song catalogue. Rumours had circulated that the singer was to sell them in order to finance the upkeep of Neverland Ranch and to cover legal bill expenses.[25] The singer announced in a statement, \\"I want to clarify a silly rumour ÿ The Beatles catalogue is not for sale, has not been for sale and will never be for sale.\\"[25] Sony/ATV Music Publishing continued to acquire song catalogues in the 21st century. In November 2001, the company signed country singer Tony Martin to an exclusive songwriting and co-publishing deal. Through the deal, they acquired Martin's Baby Mae Music catalog of 600 songs, which includes Joe Diffie's \\"Third Rock from the Sun\\" and Jeff Carson's \\"Not on Your Love\\".[26] In July 2002, Sony/ATV Music Publishing bought veteran country music publisher Acuff-Rose Music for $157?million. The venture included music publishing rights to 55,000 country music songs, including the music of Hank Williams, The Everly Brothers and Roy Orbison,[27][28] and the master recordings of the defunct label Hickory Records. Sony/ATV revived Hickory Records as the in-house record label imprint in 2007, with distribution handled by Sony Music's RED Distribution.[29] Sony/ATV also owns the masters of Dial Records, Four Star Records and Challenge Records.[30]\\r\\nIn 2006, Sony gained operational control of Sony/ATV and obtained an option to buy half of Jackson's stake in the company at any time for a fixed price of $250 million.[31][32][33]\\r\\nDigital sheet music provider Musicnotes.com announced in June 2006 that it had signed a long-term distribution agreement with Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Musicnotes.com would produce and sell digital sheet music and guitar tablature for songs from Sony/ATV's extensive catalog.[34] \\"As a music publisher, we are always looking for new and innovative ways to promote our songs and songwriters,\\" Sony/ATV chairman and chief executive David Hockman announced in a statement.[34]\\r\\nAnother company acquisition was made in 2007, when Sony/ATV purchased Famous Music, a music publishing business with song catalogue of more than 125,000 songs including \\"Moon River\\" and \\"Footloose\\", for $370 million. The deal, sought by Viacom, included the assumption of around $30?million of debt. The song catalogue also includes the hits of Eminem, Akon, Linda Perry, Bj?rk, Shakira and Beck, as well as music from films released by Viacom divisions Paramount Pictures (which had founded Famous Music in 1928) and DreamWorks Pictures.[35][36]\\r\\nOn June 27, 2017, Sony/ATV agreed to administer the music publishing rights of French motion picture company EuropaCorp, soon after acquiring 1,500 music copyrights from the studio.[37] Other major studios that rely on Sony/ATV's administration include Paramount, Nickelodeon, MTV Networks, Showtime, CBS, and DreamWorks (all since the Famous Music acquisition); Sony Pictures, 20th Century Fox, A+E Networks, Endemol Shine Group, Hit Entertainment, ITV Studios, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.[38]\\r\\nFollowing Jackson's death in June 2009, there were reports that Jackson had left the Beatles catalogue to McCartney in his will, having added it just five months before. (Jackson was reportedly expecting to die before McCartney despite being 16 years his junior due to various health problems.)[39] However, it was later revealed that Sony/ATV Music Publishing would keep control of the Beatles' songs.[40] Upon his death, Jackson's entertainment attorney, Joel Katz, commented on the singer's work as a businessman. \\"Michael Jackson was a perfectionist and his business affairs are worldwide. Many of them are quite ongoing and will be dealt with appropriately.\\"[40] Ivan Thornton, a private-wealth adviser who worked with Jackson and his family, also commended the business side of the musician. \\"His business mind was fascinating. We'd go to meetings with bankers and Wall Street people and once I explained the language to him, he totally got it. There was no formal education there, but his natural knack was off the charts.\\"[40]\\r\\nIn November 2011, Citigroup announced a tentative deal to sell EMI, with the recorded music arm going to Vivendi's Universal Music Group for $1.9?billion and the publishing business going to a Sony/ATV-led consortium for around $2.2?billion.[41] Other members of the Sony consortium include Blackstone and Abu Dhabi-owned investment fund Mubadala.[42] In March 2012, concessions were offered to the European Union to help win approval of the consortium's purchase.[43] The deal won European Union approval on April 19, 2012.[44] As part of the deal, Sony/EMI divested the publishing rights for Famous Music UK and Virgin Music. These catalogues were acquired by BMG Rights Management in December 2012 for $150?million.[45]\\r\\nIn August 2013, it was reported that McCartney and Ono would be able to begin to reclaim the rights to Beatles songs in 2018, as a result of the Copyright Act of 1976, in which the ownership of songs written before 1978 reverts to the songwriter after 56 years. McCartney and Ono (or their estates) will be able to claim full rights to all Beatles songs by 2026.[46]\\r\\nOn October 8, 2015, some news media reported that Sony would sell its 50% stake in Sony/ATV Music Publishing to the Michael Jackson Estate.[47] Contrary to those reports, in October 2015, it was reported that a clause had been triggered in the agreement between Sony and the estate of Michael Jackson, allowing Sony to make a takeover bid for the Sony/ATV stake held by the estate of Michael Jackson, or vice versa. Billboard felt that Sony acquiring the estate's stake was the most likely outcome, noting the potential revenue the library could bring in regards to licensing for on-demand music streaming services.[48]\\r\\nOn March 14, 2016, Sony announced that it would acquire the Jackson estate's stake in Sony/ATV in a deal valued at around $750 million, pending regulatory approval. The estate will retain a 10% stake in EMI Music Publishing, and a stake in Mijac Music, which holds the rights to Michael Jackson's songs and master recordings. Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton stated that the purchase would \\"enable Sony to more quickly adapt to changes in the music publishing business, while at the same time continuing to be an unparalleled leader in the industry and a treasured home for artists and writers.\\" The revenue will primarily be used to pay off the estate's $250 million in debt, with the remainder to be placed in trust for Jackson's children. The deal was completed September 30, 2016.[8]\\r\\nThe value of Sony/ATV Music Publishing has varied in reports. In 2002, Forbes magazine estimated Jackson's 50% stake in the company, along with other music publishing ventures, to be worth $450?million.[49] The organization was valued at $700?million in 2003.[50] Industry experts valued the catalogue at between $600?million and $1?billion in 2004, based on the sales of rival catalogues.[51] Charles Koppelman, a veteran music industry executive, stated that $1?billion was more reflective of Sony/ATV Music Publishing's worth.[51] \\"Buyers would be lining up around the block if it were ever put up for sale,\\" he said. \\"And I'd be in the front of the line.\\"[51] The value of the company was further estimated by Ryan Schinman, chief of Platinum Rye, to be $1.5?billion.[52]\\r\\nIn 2005, Jackson's defense attorney, Thomas Mesereau, claimed that the song catalogue had been valued at between $4?billion and $5?billion.[53] Jackson's own financial documents stated that his 50% share of the catalogue was worth $390.6?million as of 2007,[54] which would have made the entire catalogue worth $781.2?million. When Sony/ATV led the consortium that acquired EMI Music Publishing in 2012 (with Sony/ATV becoming administrator and 38% shareholder), it became the largest publishing company in the world, with more than 2 million songs[55] and estimated revenues of over US$1.25?billion per year.[56] Since 2012, Sony/ATV has administered Jackson's other publishing firm, Mijac, which includes songs written by Jackson himself (amongst others), and which used to be administered by competitor Warner/Chappell Music.[57]","input":"When did michael jackson purchase the beatles catalog?"},{"output":"skin flora","context":"Staphylococcus albus Rosenbach 1884\\r\\nStaphylococcus epidermidis is a Gram-positive bacterium, and one of over 40 species belonging to the genus Staphylococcus.[1] It is part of the normal human flora, typically the skin flora, and less commonly the mucosal flora.[2] Although S. epidermidis is not usually pathogenic, patients with compromised immune systems are at risk of developing infection. These infections are generally hospital-acquired.[3] S. epidermidis is a particular concern for people with catheters or other surgical implants because it is known to form biofilms that grow on these devices.[4] Being part of the normal skin flora, S. epidermidis is a frequent contaminant of specimens sent to the diagnostic laboratory.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'Staphylococcus' - bunch of grape-like berries, 'epidermidis' - of the epidermis [6]\\r\\nFriedrich Julius Rosenbach distinguished S. epidermidis from S. aureus in 1884, initially naming S. epidermidis as S. albus.[7] He chose aureus and albus since the bacteria formed yellow and white colonies, respectively.\\r\\nS. epidermidis is a very hardy microorganism, consisting of nonmotile, Gram-positive cocci, arranged in grape-like clusters. It forms white, raised, cohesive colonies about 1ÿ2?mm in diameter after overnight incubation, and is not hemolytic on blood agar.[4] It is a catalase-positive,[8] coagulase-negative, facultative anaerobe that can grow by aerobic respiration or by fermentation. Some strains may not ferment.[9]\\r\\nBiochemical tests indicate this microorganism also carries out a weakly positive reaction to the nitrate reductase test. It is positive for urease production, is oxidase negative, and can use glucose, sucrose, and lactose to form acid products. In the presence of lactose, it will also produce gas. S. epidermidis does not possess the gelatinase enzyme, so it cannot hydrolyze gelatin.[citation needed] It is sensitive to novobiocin, providing an important test to distinguish it from Staphylococcus saprophyticus, which is coagulase-negative, as well, but novobiocin-resistant.[3]\\r\\nSimilar to those of S. aureus, the cell walls of S. epidermidis have a transferrin-binding protein that helps the organism obtain iron from transferrin. The tetramers of a surface exposed protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, are believed to bind to transferrin and remove its iron. Subsequent steps include iron being transferred to surface lipoproteins, then to transport proteins which carry the iron into the cell.[4]\\r\\nThe ability to form biofilms on plastic devices is a major virulence factor for S. epidermidis. One probable cause is surface proteins that bind blood and extracellular matrix proteins. It produces an extracellular material known as polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), which is made up of sulfated polysaccharides. It allows other bacteria to bind to the already existing biofilm, creating a multilayer biofilm. Such biofilms decrease the metabolic activity of bacteria within them. This decreased metabolism, in combination with impaired diffusion of antibiotics, makes it difficult for antibiotics to effectively clear this type of infection.[4] S. epidermidis strains are often resistant to antibiotics, including penicillin, amoxicillin, and methicillin. Resistant organisms are most commonly found in the intestine, but organisms living freely on the skin can also become resistant due to routine exposure to antibiotics secreted in sweat.\\r\\nAs mentioned above, S. epidermidis causes biofilms to grow on plastic devices placed within the body.[10] This occurs most commonly on intravenous catheters and on medical prostheses.[11] Infection can also occur in dialysis patients or anyone with an implanted plastic device that may have been contaminated. It also causes endocarditis, most often in patients with defective heart valves. In some other cases, sepsis can occur in hospital patients.[citation needed]\\r\\nAntibiotics are largely ineffective in clearing biofilms. The most common treatment for these infections is to remove or replace the infected implant, though in all cases, prevention is ideal. The drug of choice is often vancomycin, to which rifampin or aminoglycoside can be added.[citation needed] Hand washing has been shown to reduce the spread of infection.\\r\\nPreliminary research also indicates S. epidermidis is universally found inside affected acne vulgaris pores, where Propionibacterium acnes is normally the sole resident.[12]\\r\\nThe normal practice of detecting S. epidermidis is by using appearance of colonies on selective media, bacterial morphology by light microscopy, catalase and slide coagulase testing. On the Baird-Parker agar with egg yolk supplement, colonies appear small and black. Increasingly, techniques such as quantitative PCR are being employed for the rapid detection and identification of Staphylococcus strains.[13][14] Normally, sensitivity to desferrioxamine can also be used to distinguish it from most other staphylococci, except in the case of Staphylococcus hominis, which is also sensitive.[15] In this case, the production of acid from trehalose by S. hominis can be used to tell the two species apart.","input":"Where is staphylococcus epidermidis found in the body?"},{"output":"Ant܇nio Egas Moniz","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nA lobotomy, or leucotomy, is a form of psychosurgery, a neurosurgical treatment of a mental disorder that involves severing connections in the brain's prefrontal cortex.[2] Most of the connections to and from the prefrontal cortex, the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain are severed. It was used for psychiatric and occasionally other conditions as a mainstream procedure in some Western countries for more than two decades. This was despite general recognition of frequent and serious side effects. While some people experienced symptomatic improvement with the operation, the improvements were achieved at the cost of creating other impairments. The procedure was controversial from its initial use in part due to the balance between benefits and risks. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe originator of the procedure, Portuguese neurologist Ant܇nio Egas Moniz, shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine of 1949 for the \\"discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses\\",[n 1] although the awarding of the prize has been subject to controversy.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of the procedure increased dramatically from the early 1940s and into the 1950s; by 1951, almost 20,000 lobotomies had been performed in the United States alone and proportionally more in the United Kingdom.[5] The majority of lobotomies were performed on women;  A 1951 study of American hospitals found nearly 60% of lobotomy patients were women; data shows 74% of lobotomies in Ontario from 1948ÿ1952 were performed on women.[6][7][8] From the 1950s onward lobotomy began to be abandoned[9], first in the Soviet Union and Europe[citation needed]. The term is derived from Greek: ?? lobos \\"lobe\\" and ? tom \\"cut, slice\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nComments added to the consent form for a lobotomy operation on \\"Helaine Strauss\\",[n 2] \\"a patient at an elite private hospital\\".[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe purpose of the operation was to reduce the symptoms of mental disorder, and it was recognized that this was accomplished at the expense of a person's personality and intellect. British psychiatrist Maurice Partridge, who conducted a follow-up study of 300 patients, said that the treatment achieved its effects by \\"reducing the complexity of psychic life\\". Following the operation, spontaneity, responsiveness, self-awareness and self-control were reduced. Activity was replaced by inertia, and people were left emotionally blunted and restricted in their intellectual range.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consequences of the operation have been described as \\"mixed\\".[12] Some patients died as a result of the operation and others later committed suicide. Some were left severely brain-damaged. Others were able to leave the hospital, or became more manageable within the hospital.[12] A few people managed to return to responsible work, while at the other extreme people were left with severe and disabling impairments.[13] Most people fell into an intermediate group, left with some improvement of their symptoms but also with emotional and intellectual deficits to which they made a better or worse adjustment.[13] On average, there was a mortality rate of approximately 5 percent during the 1940s.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lobotomy procedure could have severe negative effects on a patient's personality and ability to function independently.[14] Lobotomy patients often show a marked reduction in initiative and inhibition.[15] They may also exhibit difficulty putting themselves in the position of others because of decreased cognition and detachment from society.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately following surgery, patients were often stuporous, confused, and incontinent. Some developed an enormous appetite and gained considerable weight. Seizures were another common complication of surgery. Emphasis was put on the training of patients in the weeks and months following surgery.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWalter Freeman coined the term \\"surgically induced childhood\\" and used it constantly to refer to the results of lobotomy. The operation left people with an \\"infantile personality\\"; a period of maturation would then, according to Freeman, lead to recovery. In an unpublished memoir he described how the \\"personality of the patient was changed in some way in the hope of rendering him more amenable to the social pressures under which he is supposed to exist.\\" He described one 29-year-old woman as being, following lobotomy, a \\"smiling, lazy and satisfactory patient with the personality of an oyster\\" who couldn't remember Freeman's name and endlessly poured coffee from an empty pot. When her parents had difficulty dealing with her behaviour, Freeman advised a system of rewards (ice-cream) and punishment (smacks).[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, the number of patients residing in mental hospitals increased significantly[n 3] while little in the way of effective medical treatment was available.[n 4][24] Lobotomy was one of a series of radical and invasive physical therapies developed in Europe at this time that signaled a break with a psychiatric culture of therapeutic nihilism that had prevailed since the late nineteenth-century.[25] The new \\"heroic\\" physical therapies devised during this experimental era,[26] including malarial therapy for general paresis of the insane (1917),[27] deep sleep therapy (1920), insulin shock therapy (1933), cardiazol shock therapy (1934), and electroconvulsive therapy (1938),[28] helped to imbue the then therapeutically moribund and demoralised psychiatric profession with a renewed sense of optimism in the curability of insanity and the potency of their craft.[29] The success of the shock therapies, despite the considerable risk they posed to patients, also helped to accommodate psychiatrists to ever more drastic forms of medical intervention, including lobotomy.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clinician-historian Joel Braslow argues that from malarial therapy onward to lobotomy, physical psychiatric therapies \\"spiral closer and closer to the interior of the brain\\" with this organ increasingly taking \\"center stage as a source of disease and site of cure.\\"[30] For Roy Porter, once the doyen of medical history,[31] the often violent and invasive psychiatric interventions developed during the 1930s and 1940s are indicative of both the well-intentioned desire of psychiatrists to find some medical means of alleviating the suffering of the vast number of patients then in psychiatric hospitals and also the relative lack of social power of those same patients to resist the increasingly radical and even reckless interventions of asylum doctors.[32] Many doctors, patients and family members of the period believed that despite potentially catastrophic consequences, the results of lobotomy were seemingly positive in many instances or, at least they were deemed as such when measured next to the apparent alternative of long-term institutionalisation. Lobotomy has always been controversial, but for a period of the medical mainstream, it was even feted and regarded as a legitimate if desperate remedy for categories of patients who were otherwise regarded as hopeless.[33] Today, lobotomy has become a disparaged procedure, a byword for medical barbarism and an exemplary instance of the medical trampling of patients' rights.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the 1930s, individual doctors had infrequently experimented with novel surgical operations on the brains of those deemed insane. Most notably in 1888, the Swiss psychiatrist, Gottlieb Burckhardt, initiated what is commonly considered the first systematic attempt at modern human psychosurgery.[35] He operated on six chronic patients under his care at the Swiss Prfargier Asylum, removing sections of their cerebral cortex. Burckhardt's decision to operate was informed by three pervasive views on the nature of mental illness and its relationship to the brain. First, the belief that mental illness was organic in nature, and reflected an underlying brain pathology; next, that the nervous system was organized according to an associationist model comprising an input or afferent system (a sensory center), a connecting system where information processing took place (an association center), and an output or efferent system (a motor center); and, finally, a modular conception of the brain whereby discrete mental faculties were connected to specific regions of the brain.[36] Burckhardt's hypothesis was that by deliberately creating lesions in regions of the brain identified as association centers a transformation in behavior might ensue.[36] According to his model, those mentally ill might experience \\"excitations abnormal in quality, quantity and intensity\\" in the sensory regions of the brain and this abnormal stimulation would then be transmitted to the motor regions giving rise to mental pathology.[37] He reasoned, however, that removing material from either of the sensory or motor zones could give rise to \\"grave functional disturbance\\".[37] Instead, by targeting the association centers and creating a \\"ditch\\" around the motor region of the temporal lobe, he hoped to break their lines of communication and thus alleviate both mental symptoms and the experience of mental distress.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIntending to ameliorate symptoms in those with violent and intractable conditions rather than effect a cure,[39] Burckhardt began operating on patients in December 1888,[40] but both his surgical methods and instruments were crude and the results of the procedure were mixed at best.[37] He operated on six patients in total and, according to his own assessment, two experienced no change, two patients became quieter, one patient experienced epileptic convulsions and died a few days after the operation, and one patient improved.[n 5] Complications included motor weakness, epilepsy, sensory aphasia and \\"word deafness\\".[42] Claiming a success rate of 50 percent,[43] he presented the results at the Berlin Medical Congress and published a report, but the response from his medical peers was hostile and he did no further operations.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1912, two physicians based in Saint Petersburg, the leading Russian neurologist Vladimir Bekhterev and his younger Estonian colleague, the neurosurgeon Ludvig Puusepp, published a paper reviewing a range of surgical interventions that had been performed on the mentally ill.[45] While generally treating these endeavours favorably, in their consideration of psychosurgery they reserved unremitting scorn for Burckhardt's surgical experiments of 1888 and opined that it was extraordinary that a trained medical doctor could undertake such an unsound procedure.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"We have quoted this data to show not only how groundless but also how dangerous these operations were. We are unable to explain how their author, holder of a degree in medicine, could bring himself to carry them out?...\\"[47]\\r\\nThe authors neglected to mention, however, that in 1910 Puusepp himself had performed surgery on the brains of three mentally ill patients,[n 6][49] sectioning the cortex between the frontal and parietal lobes.[50] He had abandoned these attempts because of unsatisfactory results and this experience probably inspired the invective that was directed at Burckhardt in the 1912 article.[46] By 1937, Puusepp, despite his earlier criticism of Burckhardt, was increasingly persuaded that psychosurgery could be a valid medical intervention for the mentally disturbed.[n 7][52] In the late 1930s he worked closely with the neurosurgical team of the Racconigi Hospital near Turin to establish it as an early and influential centre for the adoption of leucotomy in Italy.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeucotomy was first undertaken in 1935 under the direction of the Portuguese neurologist (and inventor of the term psychosurgery) Ant܇nio Egas Moniz.[n 8][57] First developing an interest in psychiatric conditions and their somatic treatment in the early 1930s,[58] Moniz apparently conceived a new opportunity for recognition in the development of a surgical intervention on the brain as a treatment for mental illness.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe source of inspiration for Moniz's decision to hazard psychosurgery has been clouded by contradictory statements made on the subject by Moniz and others both contemporaneously and retrospectively.[59] The traditional narrative addresses the question of why Moniz targeted the frontal lobes by way of reference to the work of the Yale neuroscientist John Fulton and, most dramatically, to a presentation Fulton made with his junior colleague Carlyle Jacobsen at the Second International Congress of Neurology held in London in 1935.[60] Fulton's primary area of research was on the cortical function of primates and he had established America's first primate neurophysiology laboratory at Yale in the early 1930s.[61] At the 1935 Congress, with Moniz in attendance,[n 9] Fulton and Jacobsen presented two chimpanzees, named Becky and Lucy who had had frontal lobectomies and subsequent changes in behaviour and intellectual function.[62] According to Fulton's account of the congress, they explained that before surgery, both animals, and especially Becky, the more emotional of the two, exhibited \\"frustrational behaviour\\"?ÿ that is, have tantrums that could include rolling on the floor and defecating?ÿ if, because of their poor performance in a set of experimental tasks, they were not rewarded.[63] Following the surgical removal of their frontal lobes, the behaviour of both primates changed markedly and Becky was pacified to such a degree that Jacobsen apparently stated it was as if she had joined a \\"happiness cult\\".[62] During the question and answer section of the paper, Moniz, it is alleged, \\"startled\\" Fulton by inquiring if this procedure might be extended to human subjects suffering from mental illness. Fulton stated that he replied that while possible in theory it was surely \\"too formidable\\" an intervention for use on humans.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Moniz began his experiments with leucotomy just three months after the congress has reinforced the apparent cause and effect relationship between the Fulton and Jacobsen's presentation and the Portuguese neurologist's resolve to operate on the frontal lobes.[65] As the author of this account Fulton, who has sometimes been claimed as the father of lobotomy, was later able to record that the technique had its true origination in his laboratory.[66] Endorsing this version of events, in 1949, the Harvard neurologist Stanley Cobb remarked during his presidential address to the American Neurological Association that, \\"seldom in the history of medicine has a laboratory observation been so quickly and dramatically translated into a therapeutic procedure.\\" Fulton's report, penned ten years after the events described, is, however, without corroboration in the historical record and bears little resemblance to an earlier unpublished account he wrote of the congress. In this previous narrative he mentioned an incidental, private exchange with Moniz, but it is likely that the official version of their public conversation he promulgated is without foundation.[67] In fact, Moniz stated that he had conceived of the operation some time before his journey to London in 1935, having told in confidence his junior colleague, the young neurosurgeon Pedro Almeida Lima, as early as 1933 of his psychosurgical idea.[68] The traditional account exaggerates the importance of Fulton and Jacobsen to Moniz's decision to initiate frontal lobe surgery, and omits the fact that a detailed body of neurological research that emerged at this time suggested to Moniz and other neurologists and neurosurgeons that surgery on this part of the brain might yield significant personality changes in the mentally ill.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the frontal lobes had been the object of scientific inquiry and speculation since the late 19th century, Fulton's contribution, while it may have functioned as source of intellectual support, is of itself unnecessary and inadequate as an explanation of Moniz's resolution to operate on this section of the brain.[70] Under an evolutionary and hierarchical model of brain development it had been hypothesized that those regions associated with more recent development, such as the mammalian brain and, most especially, the frontal lobes, were responsible for more complex cognitive functions.[71] However, this theoretical formulation found little laboratory support, as 19th century experimentation found no significant change in animal behaviour following surgical removal or electrical stimulation of the frontal lobes.[71] This picture of the so-called \\"silent lobe\\" changed in the period after World War I with the production of clinical reports of ex-servicemen who had suffered brain trauma. The refinement of neurosurgical techniques also facilitated increasing attempts to remove brain tumours, treat focal epilepsy in humans and led to more precise experimental neurosurgery in animal studies.[71] Cases were reported where mental symptoms were alleviated following the surgical removal of diseased or damaged brain tissue.[50] The accumulation of medical case studies on behavioural changes following damage to the frontal lobes led to the formulation of the concept of Witzelsucht, which designated a neurological condition characterised by a certain hilarity and childishness in the afflicted.[71] The picture of frontal lobe function that emerged from these studies was complicated by the observation that neurological deficits attendant on damage to a single lobe might be compensated for if the opposite lobe remained intact.[71] In 1922, the Italian neurologist Leonardo Bianchi published a detailed report on the results of bilateral lobectomies in animals that supported the contention that the frontal lobes were both integral to intellectual function and that their removal led to the disintegration of the subject's personality.[72] This work, while influential, was not without its critics due to deficiencies in experimental design.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first bilateral lobectomy of a human subject was performed by the American neurosurgeon Walter Dandy in 1930.[n 10][73] The neurologist Richard Brickner reported on this case in 1932,[74] relating that the recipient, known as \\"Patient A\\", while experiencing a flattening of affect, had suffered no apparent decrease in intellectual function and seemed, at least to the casual observer, perfectly normal.[75] Brickner concluded from this evidence that \\"the frontal lobes are not 'centers' for the intellect\\".[76] These clinical results were replicated in a similar operation undertaken in 1934 by the neurosurgeon Roy Glenwood Spurling and reported on by the neuropsychiatrist Spafford Ackerly.[77] By the mid-1930s, interest in the function of the frontal lobes reached a high-water mark. This was reflected in the 1935 neurological congress in London, which hosted[77] as part of its deliberations,[77] \\"a remarkable symposium?... on the functions of the frontal lobes.\\"[78] The panel was chaired by Henri Claude, a French neuropsychiatrist, who commenced the session by reviewing the state of research on the frontal lobes, and concluded that, \\"altering the frontal lobes profoundly modifies the personality of subjects\\".[76] This parallel symposium contained numerous papers by neurologists, neurosurgeons and psychologists; amongst these was one by Brickner, which impressed Moniz greatly,[75] that again detailed the case of \\"Patient A\\".[77] Fulton and Jacobsen's paper, presented in another session of the conference on experimental physiology, was notable in linking animal and human studies on the function of the frontal lobes.[77] Thus, at the time of the 1935 Congress, Moniz had available to him an increasing body of research on the role of the frontal lobes that extended well beyond the observations of Fulton and Jacobsen.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was Moniz the only medical practitioner in the 1930s to have contemplated procedures directly targeting the frontal lobes.[80] Although ultimately discounting brain surgery as carrying too much risk, physicians and neurologists such as William Mayo, Thierry de Martel, Richard Brickner, and Leo Davidoff had, before 1935, entertained the proposition.[n 11][82] Inspired by Julius Wagner-Jauregg's development of malarial therapy for the treatment of general paresis of the insane, the French physician Maurice Ducost reported in 1932 that he had injected 5?ml of malarial blood directly into the frontal lobes of over 100 paretic patients through holes drilled into the skull.[80] He claimed that the injected paretics showed signs of \\"uncontestable mental and physical amelioration\\" and that the results for psychotic patients undergoing the procedure was also \\"encouraging\\".[83] The experimental injection of fever inducing malarial blood into the frontal lobes was also replicated during the 1930s in the work of Ettore Mariotti and M. Sciutti in Italy and Ferdire Coulloudon in France.[84] In Switzerland, almost simultaneously with the commencement of Moniz's leucotomy programme, the neurosurgeon Fran?ois Ody had removed the entire right frontal lobe of a catatonic schizophrenic patient.[85] In Romania, Ody's procedure was adopted by Dimitri Bagdasar and Constantinesco working out of the Central Hospital in Bucharest.[81] Ody, who delayed publishing his own results for several years, later rebuked Moniz for claiming to have cured patients through leucotomy without waiting to determine if there had been a \\"lasting remission\\".[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theoretical underpinnings of Moniz's psychosurgery were largely commensurate with the nineteenth century ones that had informed Burckhardt's decision to excise matter from the brains of his patients. Although in his later writings Moniz referenced both the neuron theory of Ram܇n y Cajal and the conditioned reflex of Ivan Pavlov,[87] in essence he simply interpreted this new neurological research in terms of the old psychological theory of associationism.[59] He differed significantly from Burckhardt, however in that he did not think there was any organic pathology in the brains of the mentally ill, but rather that their neural pathways were caught in fixed and destructive circuits leading to \\"predominant, obsessive ideas.\\"[n 12][89] As Moniz wrote in 1936:\\r\\n\\r\\n[The] mental troubles must have?... a relation with the formation of cellulo-connective groupings, which become more or less fixed. The cellular bodies may remain altogether normal, their cylinders will not have any anatomical alterations; but their multiple liaisons, very variable in normal people, may have arrangements more or less fixed, which will have a relation with persistent ideas and deliria in certain morbid psychic states.[90]\\r\\nFor Moniz, \\"to cure these patients,\\" it was necessary to \\"destroy the more or less fixed arrangements of cellular connections that exist in the brain, and particularly those which are related to the frontal lobes,\\"[91] thus removing their fixed pathological brain circuits. Moniz believed the brain would functionally adapt to such injury.[92] A significant advantage of this approach was that, unlike the position adopted by Burckhardt, it was unfalsifiable according to the knowledge and technology of the time as the absence of a known correlation between physical brain pathology and mental illness could not disprove his thesis.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nEgas Moniz (1937)[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 November 1935 at the Hospital Santa Marta in Lisbon, Moniz initiated the first of a series of operations on the brains of the mentally ill.[95] The initial patients selected for the operation were provided by the medical director of Lisbon's Miguel Bombarda Mental Hospital, Jos de Matos Sobral Cid.[96] As Moniz lacked training in neurosurgery and his hands were crippled from gout, the procedure was performed under general anaesthetic by Pedro Almeida Lima, who had previously assisted Moniz with his research on cerebral angiography.[n 13][98] The intention was to remove some of the long fibres that connected the frontal lobes to other major brain centres.[99] To this end, it was decided that Lima would trephine into the side of the skull and then inject ethanol into the \\"subcortical white matter of the prefrontal area\\"[94] so as to destroy the connecting fibres, or association tracts,[100] and create what Moniz termed a \\"frontal barrier\\".[n 14][101] After the first operation was complete, Moniz considered it a success and, observing that the patient's depression had been relieved, he declared her \\"cured\\" although she was never, in fact, discharged from the mental hospital.[102] Moniz and Lima persisted with this method of injecting alcohol into the frontal lobes for the next seven patients but, after having to inject some patients on numerous occasions to elicit what they considered a favourable result, they modified the means by which they would section the frontal lobes.[102] For the ninth patient they introduced a surgical instrument called a leucotome; this was a cannula that was 11 centimetres (4.3?in) in length and 2 centimetres (0.79?in) in diameter. It had a retractable wire loop at one end that, when rotated, produced a 1 centimetre (0.39?in) diameter circular lesion in the white matter of the frontal lobe.[103] Typically, six lesions were cut into each lobe, but, if they were dissatisfied by the results, Lima might perform several procedures, each producing multiple lesions in the left and right frontal lobes.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the conclusion of this first run of leucotomies in February 1936, Moniz and Lima had operated on twenty patients with an average period of one week between each procedure; Moniz published his findings with great haste in March of the same year.[104] The patients were aged between 27 and 62 years of age; twelve were female and eight were male. Nine of the patients were diagnosed as suffering from depression, six from schizophrenia, two from panic disorder, and one each from mania, catatonia and manic-depression with the most prominent symptoms being anxiety and agitation. The duration of the illness before the procedure varied from as little as four weeks to as much as 22 years, although all but four had been ill for at least one year.[105] Patients were normally operated on the day they arrived at Moniz's clinic and returned within ten days to the Miguel Bombarda Mental Hospital.[106] A perfunctory post-operative follow-up assessment took place anywhere from one to ten weeks following surgery.[107] Complications were observed in each of the leucotomy patients and included: \\"increased temperature, vomiting, bladder and bowel incontinence, diarrhea, and ocular affections such as ptosis and nystagmus, as well as psychological effects such as apathy, akinesia, lethargy, timing and local disorientation, kleptomania, and abnormal sensations of hunger\\".[108] Moniz asserted that these effects were transitory and,[108] according to his published assessment, the outcome for these first twenty patients was that 35%, or seven cases, improved significantly, another 35% were somewhat improved and the remaining 30% (six cases) were unchanged. There were no deaths and he did not consider that any patients had deteriorated following leucotomy.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoniz rapidly disseminated his results through articles in the medical press and a monograph in 1936.[101] Initially, however, the medical community appeared hostile to the new procedure.[110] On 26 July 1936, one of his assistants, Diogo Furtado, gave a presentation at the Parisian meeting of the Socit Mdico-Psychologique on the results of the second cohort of patients leucotomised by Lima.[101] Sobral Cid, who had supplied Moniz with the first set of patients for leucotomy from his own hospital in Lisbon, attended the meeting where he denounced frontal lobe surgery,[110] declaring that the patients who had been returned to his care post-operatively were \\"diminished\\" and had suffered a \\"degradation of personality\\".[111] He also claimed that the changes Moniz observed in patients were more properly attributed to shock and brain trauma, and he derided the theoretical architecture that Moniz had constructed to support the new procedure as \\"cerebral mythology.\\"[111] At the same meeting the Parisian psychiatrist, Paul Courbon, stated he could not endorse a surgical technique that was solely supported by theoretical considerations rather than clinical observations.[112] He also opined that the mutilation of an organ could not improve its function and that such cerebral wounds as were occasioned by leucotomy risked the later development of meningitis, epilepsy and brain abscesses.[113] Nonetheless, Moniz's reported successful surgical treatment of 14 out of 20 patients led to the rapid adoption of the procedure on an experimental basis by individual clinicians in countries such as Brazil, Cuba, Italy, Romania and the United States during the 1930s.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmarro Fiamberti[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the remainder of the 1930s the number of leucotomies performed in most countries where the technique was adopted remained quite low. In Britain, which was later a major centre for leucotomy,[n 15] only six operations had been undertaken before 1942.[117] Generally, medical practitioners who attempted the procedure adopted a cautious approach and few patients were leucotomised before the 1940s. Italian neuropsychiatrists, who were typically early and enthusiastic adopters of leucotomy, were exceptional in eschewing such a gradualist course.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeucotomy was first reported in the Italian medical press in 1936 and Moniz published an article in Italian on the technique in the following year.[53] In 1937, he was invited to Italy to demonstrate the procedure and for a two-week period in June of that year he visited medical centres in Trieste, Ferrara, and one close to Turin ÿ the Racconigi Hospital ÿ where he instructed his Italian neuropsychiatric colleagues on leucotomy and also oversaw several operations.[53] Leucotomy was featured at two Italian psychiatric conferences in 1937 and over the next two years a score of medical articles on Moniz's psychosurgery was published by Italian clinicians based in medical institutions located in Racconigi, Trieste, Naples, Genoa, Milan, Pisa, Catania and Rovigo.[53] The major centre for leucotomy in Italy was the Racconigi Hospital, where the experienced neurosurgeon Ludvig Puusepp provided a guiding hand.[n 16][53] Under the medical directorship of Emilio Rizzatti, the medical personnel at this hospital had completed at least 200 leucotomies by 1939.[119] Reports from clinicians based at other Italian institutions detailed significantly smaller numbers of leucotomy operations.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nExperimental modifications of Moniz's operation were introduced with little delay by Italian medical practitioners.[120] Most notably, in 1937 Amarro Fiamberti, the medical director of a psychiatric institution in Varese,[121] first devised the transorbital procedure whereby the frontal lobes were accessed through the eye sockets.[120] Fiamberti's method was to puncture the thin layer of orbital bone at the top of the socket and then inject alcohol or formalin into the white matter of the frontal lobes through this aperture.[122] Using this method, while sometimes substituting a leucotome for a hypodermic needle, it is estimated that he leucotomised about 100 patients in the period up to the outbreak of World War II.[121] Fiamberti's innovation of Moniz's method would later prove inspirational for Walter Freeman's development of transorbital lobotomy.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first prefrontal leucotomy in the United States was performed at the George Washington University Hospital on 14 September 1936 by the neuropsychiatrist Walter Freeman and his friend and colleague, the neurosurgeon, James W. Watts.[123] Freeman had first encountered Moniz at the London-hosted Second International Congress of Neurology in 1935 where he had presented a poster exhibit of the Portuguese neurologist's work on cerebral angiography.[124] Fortuitously occupying a booth next to Moniz, Freeman, delighted by their chance meeting, formed a highly favourable impression of Moniz, later remarking upon his \\"sheer genius\\".[124] According to Freeman, if they had not met in person it is highly unlikely that he would have ventured into the domain of frontal lobe psychosurgery.[125] Freeman's interest in psychiatry was the natural outgrowth of his appointment in 1924 as the medical director of the Research Laboratories of the Government Hospital for the Insane in Washington, known colloquially as St Elizabeth's.[126] Ambitious and a prodigious researcher, Freeman, who favoured an organic model of mental illness causation, spent the next several years exhaustively, yet ultimately fruitlessly, investigating a neuropathological basis for insanity.[127] Chancing upon a preliminary communication by Moniz on leucotomy in the spring of 1936, Freeman initiated a correspondence in May of that year. Writing that he had been considering psychiatric brain surgery previously, he informed Moniz that, \\"having your authority I expect to go ahead\\".[128] Moniz, in return, promised to send him a copy of his forthcoming monograph on leucotomy and urged him to purchase a leucotome from a French supplier.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon receipt of Moniz's monograph, Freeman reviewed it anonymously for the Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry.[129] Praising the text as one whose \\"importance can scarcely be overestimated\\",[129] he summarised Moniz's rationale for the procedure as based on the fact that while no physical abnormality of cerebral cell bodies was observable in the mentally ill, their cellular interconnections may harbour a \\"fixation of certain patterns of relationship among various groups of cells\\" and that this resulted in obsessions, delusions and mental morbidity.[130] While recognising that Moniz's thesis was inadequate, for Freeman it had the advantage of circumventing the search for diseased brain tissue in the mentally ill by instead suggesting that the problem was a functional one of the brain's internal wiring where relief might be obtained by severing problematic mental circuits.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1937 Freeman and Watts adapted Lima and Moniz's surgical procedure, and created the Freeman-Watts technique, also known as the Freeman-Watts standard prefrontal lobotomy, which they styled the \\"precision method\\".[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Freeman-Watts prefrontal lobotomy still required drilling holes in the scalp, so surgery had to be performed in an operating room by trained neurosurgeons. Walter Freeman believed this surgery would be unavailable to those he saw as needing it most: patients in state mental hospitals that had no operating rooms, surgeons, or anesthesia and limited budgets. Freeman wanted to simplify the procedure so that it could be carried out by psychiatrists in psychiatric hospitals.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nInspired by the work of Italian psychiatrist Amarro Fiamberti, Freeman at some point conceived of approaching the frontal lobes through the eye sockets instead of through drilled holes in the skull. In 1945 he took an icepick[n 18] from his own kitchen and began testing the idea on grapefruit[n 19] and cadavers. This new \\"transorbital\\" lobotomy involved lifting the upper eyelid and placing the point of a thin surgical instrument (often called an orbitoclast or leucotome, although quite different from the wire loop leucotome described above) under the eyelid and against the top of the eyesocket. A mallet was used to drive the orbitoclast through the thin layer of bone and into the brain along the plane of the bridge of the nose, around fifteen degrees toward the interhemispherical fissure. The orbitoclast was malleted five centimeters (2?in) into the frontal lobe, and then pivoted forty degrees at the orbit perforation so the tip cut toward the opposite side of the head (toward the nose). The instrument was returned to the neutral position and sent a further two centimeters (?4?5?in) into the brain, before being pivoted around twenty-eight degrees each side, to cut outwards and again inwards. (In a more radical variation at the end of the last cut described, the butt of the orbitoclast was forced upwards so the tool cut vertically down the side of the cortex of the interhemispherical fissure; the \\"Deep frontal cut\\".) All cuts were designed to transect the white fibrous matter connecting the cortical tissue of the prefrontal cortex to the thalamus. The leucotome was then withdrawn and the procedure repeated on the other side.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeman performed the first transorbital lobotomy on a live patient in 1946. Its simplicity suggested the possibility of carrying it out in mental hospitals lacking the surgical facilities required for the earlier, more complex procedure. (Freeman suggested that, where conventional anesthesia was unavailable, electroconvulsive therapy be used to render the patient unconscious.)[135] In 1947, the Freeman and Watts partnership ended, as the latter was disgusted by Freeman's modification of the lobotomy from a surgical operation into a simple \\"office\\" procedure.[136] Between 1940 and 1944, 684 lobotomies were performed in the United States. However, because of the fervent promotion of the technique by Freeman and Watts, those numbers increased sharply towards the end of the decade. In 1949, the peak year for lobotomies in the US, 5,074 procedures were undertaken, and by 1951 over 18,608 individuals had been lobotomized in the US.[137]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, approximately 40,000 people were lobotomized. In England, 17,000 lobotomies were performed, and the three Nordic countries of Finland, Norway, and Sweden had a combined figure of approximately 9,300 lobotomies.[138] Scandinavian hospitals lobotomized 2.5 times as many people per capita as hospitals in the US.[139] Sweden lobotomized at least 4,500 people between 1944 and 1966, mainly women. This figure includes young children.[140] In Norway, there were 2,005 known lobotomies.[141] In Denmark, there were 4,500 known lobotomies.[142] In Japan, the majority of lobotomies were performed on children with behavior problems. The Soviet Union banned the practice in 1950 on moral grounds, and Japan and Germany soon followed suit. By the late 1970s, the practice of lobotomy had generally ceased.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as 1944 an author in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease remarked: \\"The history of prefrontal lobotomy has been brief and stormy. Its course has been dotted with both violent opposition and with slavish, unquestioning acceptance.\\" Beginning in 1947 Swedish psychiatrist Snorre Wohlfahrt evaluated early trials, reporting that it is \\"distinctly hazardous to leucotomize schizophrenics\\" and that lobotomy was \\"still too imperfect to enable us, with its aid, to venture on a general offensive against chronic cases of mental disorder\\", stating further that \\"Psychosurgery has as yet failed to discover its precise indications and contraindications and the methods must unfortunately still be regarded as rather crude and hazardous in many respects.\\"[143] In 1948 Norbert Wiener, the author of Cybernetics: Or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, said: \\"[P]refrontal lobotomy?... has recently been having a certain vogue, probably not unconnected with the fact that it makes the custodial care of many patients easier. Let me remark in passing that killing them makes their custodial care still easier.\\"[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerns about lobotomy steadily grew. Soviet psychiatrist Vasily Gilyarovsky criticized lobotomy and the mechanistic brain localization assumption used to carry out lobotomy: \\"It is assumed that the transection of white substance of the frontal lobes impairs their connection with the thalamus and eliminates the possibility to receive from it stimuli which lead to irritation and on the whole derange mental functions. This explanation is mechanistic and goes back to the narrow localizationism characteristic of psychiatrists of America, from where leucotomy was imported to us.\\"[145] The USSR officially banned the procedure in 1950[146] on the initiative of Gilyarovsky.[147] Doctors in the Soviet Union concluded that the procedure was \\"contrary to the principles of humanity\\" and \\"'through lobotomy' an insane person is changed into an idiot.\\"[148] By the 1970s, numerous countries had banned the procedure as had several US states.[149]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977 the US Congress, during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, created the National Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research to investigate allegations that psychosurgeryincluding lobotomy techniqueswere used to control minorities and restrain individual rights. The committee concluded that some extremely limited and properly performed psychosurgery could have positive effects.[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been calls in the early 21st century for the Nobel Foundation to rescind the prize it awarded to Moniz for developing lobotomy, a decision that has been called an astounding error of judgment at the time and one that psychiatry might still need to learn from, but the Foundation declined to take action and has continued to host an article defending the results of the procedure.[151][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nLobotomies have been featured in several literary and cinematic presentations that both reflected society's attitude towards the procedure and, at times, changed it. Writers and film-makers have played a pivotal role in forming a negative public sentiment towards the procedure.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrint Sources\\r\\n\\r\\nOnline sources","input":"Who developed the surgical procedure known as a lobotomy?"},{"output":"the art most suited to the expression of emotions","context":"Romantic music is a period of Western classical music that began in the late 18th or early 19th century. It is related to Romanticism, the European artistic and literary movement that arose in the second half of the 18th century, and Romantic music in particular dominated the Romantic movement in Germany.\\r\\nIn the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literary, artistic, and philosophical themes. Famous early Romantic composers include Beethoven (whose works span both this period and the preceding Classical period), Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Bellini, and Berlioz. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and in the dynamic range and diversity of instruments used in this ensemble. Also, public concerts became a key part of urban middle class society, in contrast to earlier periods, when concerts were mainly paid for by and performed for aristocrats. Famous composers from the second half of the century include Bruckner, Johann Strauss II, Brahms, Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Dvo?k, Verdi, and Wagner. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including Mahler, Richard Strauss, Puccini, and Sibelius built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex?ÿ and often much longer?ÿ musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvo?k, Sibelius, and Grieg. Other prominent late-century figures include Saint-Sa?ns, Faur, Rachmaninoff and Franck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Romantic movement was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that originated in the second half of the 19th century in Europe and strengthened in reaction to the Industrial Revolution (Encyclop?dia Britannica n.d.). In part, it was a revolt against social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment and a reaction against the scientific rationalization of nature (Casey 2008). It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography (Levin 1959,[page?needed]) and education (Gutek 1995, 220ÿ54), and was in turn influenced by developments in natural history (Nichols 2005, 308ÿ309).\\r\\nOne of the first significant applications of the term to music was in 1789, in the Mmoires by the Frenchman Andr Grtry, but it was E.T.A. Hoffmann who really established the principles of musical romanticism, in a lengthy review of Ludwig van Beethoven's Fifth Symphony published in 1810, and in an 1813 article on Beethoven's instrumental music. In the first of these essays Hoffmann traced the beginnings of musical Romanticism to the later works of Haydn and Mozart. It was Hoffmann's fusion of ideas already associated with the term \\"Romantic\\", used in opposition to the restraint and formality of Classical models, that elevated music, and especially instrumental music, to a position of pre-eminence in Romanticism as the art most suited to the expression of emotions. It was also through the writings of Hoffmann and other German authors that German music was brought to the centre of musical Romanticism (Samson 2001).\\r\\nCharacteristics often attributed to Romanticism:\\r\\nSuch lists, however, proliferated over time, resulting in a \\"chaos of antithetical phenomena\\", criticized for their superficiality and for signifying so many different things that there came to be no central meaning. The attributes have also been criticized for being too vague. For example, features of the \\"ghostly and supernatural\\" could apply equally to Mozart's Don Giovanni from 1787 and Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress from 1951 (Kravitt 1992, 93ÿ95).\\r\\nFrom a musical stance the following aspect could be used to distinguish romantic music from previous era's:\\r\\nEvents and changes that happen in society such as ideas, attitudes, discoveries, inventions, and historical events always affect music. For example, the Industrial Revolution was in full effect by the late 18th century and early 19th century. This event had a very profound effect on music: there were major improvements in the mechanical valves, and keys that most woodwinds and brass instruments depend on. The new and innovative instruments could be played with greater ease and they were more reliable (Schmidt-Jones and Jones 2004, 3).\\r\\nAnother development that had an effect on music was the rise of the middle class. Composers before this period lived on the patronage of the aristocracy. Many times their audience was small, composed mostly of the upper class and individuals who were knowledgeable about music (Schmidt-Jones and Jones 2004, 3). The Romantic composers, on the other hand, often wrote for public concerts and festivals, with large audiences of paying customers, who had not necessarily had any music lessons (Schmidt-Jones and Jones 2004, 3). Composers of the Romantic Era, like Elgar, showed the world that there should be \\"no segregation of musical tastes\\" (Young 1967, 525) and that the \\"purpose was to write music that was to be heard\\" (Young 1967, 527).\\r\\nDuring the Romantic period, music often took on a much more nationalistic purpose. For example, Jean Sibelius' Finlandia has been interpreted to represent the rising nation of Finland, which would someday gain independence from Russian control (Child 2006). Frdric Chopin was one of the first composers to incorporate nationalistic elements into his compositions. Joseph Machlis states, \\"Poland's struggle for freedom from tsarist rule aroused the national poet in Poland.  Examples of musical nationalism abound in the output of the romantic era. The folk idiom is prominent in the Mazurkas of Chopin\\" (Machlis 1963, 149ÿ50). His mazurkas and polonaises are particularly notable for their use of nationalistic rhythms. Moreover, \\"During World War II the Nazis forbade the playing of  Chopin's Polonaises in Warsaw because of the powerful symbolism residing in these works\\" (Machlis 1963, 150). Other composers, such as Bed?ich Smetana, wrote pieces that musically described their homelands; in particular, Smetana's Vltava is a symphonic poem about the Moldau River in the modern-day Czech Republic and the second in a cycle of six nationalistic symphonic poems collectively titled M vlast (My Homeland) (Grunfeld 1974, 112ÿ13). Smetana also composed eight nationalist operas, all of which remain in the repertory. They established him as the first Czech nationalist composer as well as the most important Czech opera composer of the generation who came to prominence in the 1860s (Ottlov, Tyrrell, and Posp?il 2001).","input":"How is music from the romantic era generally characterized?"},{"output":"Despacito","context":"YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California.

It is now part of the Limpopo province. Venda was founded as a homeland by the South African government for the Venda people, speakers of the Venda language.[3] The United Nations and international community refused to recognize Venda (or any other Bantustan) as an independent state.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVenda was declared self-governing on 1 February 1973,[4] with elections held later in the year.[5] Further elections were held in July 1978.[5] The territory was declared independent by the South African government on 13 September 1979 and its residents lost their South African citizenship.[6][7] In common with other Bantustans, its independence was not recognized by the international community.\\r\\nVenda was initially a series of non-contiguous territories in the Transvaal, with one main part and one main exclave. Its capital, formerly at Sibasa, was moved to Thohoyandou (which included the old Sibasa administrative district) when Venda was declared independent in 1979. Prior to independence it was expanded to form one contiguous territory, with a total land area of 6,807?km2.[3] In the 1984 elections the ruling Venda Independence People's Party (VIPP) lost to the Venda National Party (VNP).[5]\\r\\nAt independence in 1979, the population of Vhavenda stood at about 200,000 people.

It traditionally appears fourth, after the Synoptic Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke.\\r\\nAlthough the Gospel of John is anonymous,[1] Christian tradition historically has attributed it to John the Apostle, son of Zebedee and one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving Johannine epistles that commentators treat the four books,[2] along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not necessarily written by the same author.[Notes 1]\\r\\nC. K. Barrett,[3][Notes 2] and later Raymond E. Brown,[5] suggested that a tradition developed around the \\"Johannine Community\\", and that this tradition gave rise to the gospel.[6] The discovery of a large number of papyrus fragments of manuscripts with Johannine themes has led more scholars to recognize that the texts were among the most influential in the early Church.[7]\\r\\nThe discourses contained with this gospel seem to be concerned with issues of the churchÿsynagogue debate at the time of composition.[8] It is notable that in John, the community appears to define itself primarily in contrast to Judaism, rather than as part of a wider Christian community.[Notes 3] Though Christianity started as a movement within Judaism, it gradually separated from Judaism because of mutual opposition between the two religions.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gospel of John can be divided into four sections: a prologue (1:1ÿ18), a Book of Signs (1:19ÿ12:50), a Book of Glory (13:1ÿ20:31), and an epilogue (21).[10] The structure is highly schematic: there are seven \\"signs\\" culminating in the raising of Lazarus (foreshadowing the resurrection of Jesus), and seven \\"I am\\" sayings and discourses, culminating in Thomas's proclamation of Jesus as \\"my lord and my God\\"the same title (dominus et deus) claimed by Roman Emperor Domitian.[11]\\r\\nJesus is placed in his cosmic setting as the Logos made flesh who reveals God and gives salvation to believers; John the Baptist, Andrew, and Nathanael bear witness to him as the Lamb of God, the Son of God, and the Christ.[12]\\r\\nThe narrative of Jesus' public ministry, beginning with the introduction of the first disciples of Jesus. It consists of seven miracles, or \\"signs\\", interspersed with long dialogues, discourses, \\"Amen, amen\\" sayings, and \\"I Am\\" sayings, culminating with the raising of Lazarus from the dead. In John it is this, and not the cleansing of the Temple, that prompts the authorities to have Jesus executed. The seven signs consist of Jesus' miracle at the wedding at Cana, his healing the royal official's son, his healing the paralytic at Bethesda, his feeding the 5,000, his walking on water, his healing the man born blind, and his raising Lazarus from the dead. Other incidents recounted in this segment of the gospel include the cleansing of the Temple; Jesus' conversation with the Pharisee Nicodemus, wherein he explains the importance of spiritual rebirth; his conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well, wherein he gives the Water of Life Discourse; the Bread of Life Discourse, which prompted many of his disciples to leave; the Woman Taken in Adultery; Jesus' claims to be the Light of the World; Jesus' answer to Pilate; the Good Shepherd pericope; Jesus' rejection by the Jews; the Jesus wept; the plot to kill Jesus; the anointing of Jesus; Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem; the prediction of the glorification of the Son of Man; and the prediction of the Last Judgment.\\r\\nThe narrative of Jesus' Passion, Resurrection, and post-Resurrection appearances. The Passion narrative opens with an account of the Last Supper that differs significantly from that found in the synoptics, with Jesus washing the disciples' feet instead of ushering in a new covenant of his body and blood.[13] This is followed by Jesus' Farewell Discourse, an account of his betrayal, arrest, trial, death, burial, post-Resurrection appearances,[Notes 4] and final commission for his followers. It also includes Peter's denial, the institution of the New Commandment and the New Covenant, the promise of the Paraclete, the allegory of the True Vine, the High Priestly Prayer, the ut omnes unum sint, the What is truth?, Jesus' mocking and crowning with thorns, the Ecce homo, the discovery of the empty tomb, the noli me tangere, the Great Commission, and the incredulity of Thomas. The section ends with a conclusion on the purpose of the gospel: \\"that [the reader] may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe narrative of Jesus' post-Resurrection appearance to his disciples by the lake, the miraculous catch of fish, the prophecy of the crucifixion of Peter, the restoration of Peter, and the fate of the Beloved Disciple.[12] A majority of scholars believes this chapter to be an addition to the gospel.[14]\\r\\nThe Gospel of John is anonymous. Traditionally, Christians have identified the author as \\"the Disciple whom Jesus loved\\" mentioned in John 21:24,[15] who is understood to be John son of Zebedee, one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles. These identifications, however, are rejected by many modern biblical scholars.[1][16][Notes 5] Nevertheless, the author of the fourth Gospel is sometimes called John the Evangelist, often out of convenience since the definitive name of the author is still debated.\\r\\nJohn is usually dated to AD 90ÿ110.[17][Notes 6] It arose in a Jewish Christian community in the process of breaking from the Jewish synagogue.[18] Scholars believe that the text went through two to three redactions, or \\"editions\\", before reaching its current form.[19][20]\\r\\nJohn, which regularly describes Jesus' opponents simply as \\"the Jews\\", is more consistently hostile to \\"the Jews\\" than any other body of New Testament writing.[21][Notes 7] Historian and former Roman Catholic priest James Carroll states: \\"The climax of this movement comes in chapter 8 of John, when Jesus is portrayed as denouncing 'the Jews' who were gathered at the Temple as the offspring of Satan.\\"[22] In John 8:44 Jesus tells the Jews: \\"You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him.\\" In 8:38 and 11:53, \\"the Jews\\" are depicted as wishing to kill Jesus. However, Carroll cautions that this and similar statements in the Gospel of Matthew and the 1 Thessolonians should be viewed as \\"evidence not of Jew hatred but of sectarian conflicts among Jews\\" in the early years of the Christian church.[23]\\r\\nAs noted by New Testament scholar Obrey M. Hendricks, Jr.: \\"Although its scathing portrayal of the Jews has opened John to charges of anti-Semitism, a careful reading reveals 'the Jews' to be a class designation, not a religious or ethnic grouping; rather than denoting adherents to Judaism in general, the term primarily refers to the hereditary Temple religious authorities.\\"[24] In later centuries, John was used to support anti-Semitic polemics, but the author of the gospel regarded himself as a Jew, championed Jesus and his followers as Jews, and probably wrote for a largely Jewish community.[25][26]\\r\\nRudolf Bultmann, in a seminal work published in 1941, argued that John's sources were a hypothetical \\"Signs Gospel\\" listing Christ's miracles, a revelation discourse, and a passion narrative. Bultmann's work, combined with that of other scholars (the work of Raymond E. Brown was particularly influential in the English-speaking world), led to a scholarly consensus in the second half of the 20th century that the Gospel of John was independent of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, known as the synoptic gospels. This agreement broke down in the last decade of the century, and there are now many scholars who believe that John did know the synoptics, especially Mark, while the hypothesis of a \\"signs\\" source has been increasingly undermined.[27]\\r\\nBut theories of either complete independence of or complete dependence on the synoptics are largely rejected in current scholarship: on the one hand, elements such as distinctive Johannine language, the lengthy discourses, and the prologue on the Logos, are clearly unique to John; on the other, John clearly shares a multitude of episodes with the other three.[28]\\r\\nThe most important sources used by the evangelist were the Jewish scriptures (the Tanakh, more or less identical with the Christian Old Testament), probably in the Greek translation. John quotes from them directly, references important figures from them, and uses narratives from them as the basis for several of the discourses. But the author was also familiar with non-Jewish sources: the Logos of the prologue (the Word that is with God from the beginning of creation) derives from both the Jewish concept of Lady Wisdom and from the Greek philosophers, while John 6 alludes not only to the exodus but also to Greco-Roman mystery cults, while John 4 alludes to Samaritan messianic beliefs.[29]\\r\\nChapters 19 and 21 of John hint that \\"the Disciple whom Jesus loved\\", or \\"the Beloved Disciple\\", was an eyewitness to Jesus' ministry, but the majority of scholars are cautious of accepting this at face value.[30][31] With the exception of the \\"Johannine Thunderbolt\\" passages,[Notes 8] the teachings of Jesus found in the synoptic gospels are very different from those recorded in John, and since the 19th century some scholars have argued that these discourses in Johannine style are less likely to be historical, and more likely to have been written for theological purposes.[33]\\r\\nScholars usually agree that John is not entirely without historical value.[34] It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior to that of the synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.[34]\\r\\nRylands Library Papyrus P52, a Greek papyrus fragment with John 18:31ÿ33 on one side and 18:37ÿ38 on the other, commonly dated to the first half of the 2nd century, is the oldest New Testament manuscript known.[35] A substantially complete text of John exists from the beginning of the 3rd century at the latest, so that the textual evidence for this gospel is commonly accepted as both earlier and more reliable than that for any other. John stands fourth in the standard ordering of the gospels, after Matthew, Mark and Luke.\\r\\nThe Gospel of John presents a \\"high Christology,\\" depicting Jesus as divine, and yet, according to some interpretations, subordinate to the one God.[36] However, in his Summa Theologiae, Thomas Aquinas flatly rejects any denial of equality among the persons of the Trinity, including denials based on Johannine passages.[37][Notes 9] John's gospel gives more focus to the relationship of the Son to the Father than the synoptics, as seen in chapter 17 of the gospel.\\r\\nIn the synoptics, Jesus speaks often about the Kingdom of God; his own divine role is obscured (see Messianic Secret). In John, Jesus talks openly about his divine role. He echoes the Father's own statement of identity, i.e. \\"I Am Who I Am\\", with several \\"I Am\\" declarations that also identify him with symbols of major significance.[39] He says \\"I am\\":\\r\\nIn the prologue, John identifies Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, the term logos meant the principle of cosmic reason. In this sense, it was similar to the Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos.[39]\\r\\nThe opening verse of John is translated as \\"the Word was with God and the Word was God\\" in all \\"orthodox\\" English Bibles.[Notes 10] There are alternative views. The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures of Jehovah's Witnesses has \\"The Word was with God, and the Word was a god.\\" The Scholars Version of the gospel, developed by the Jesus Seminar, loosely translates the phrase as \\"The Logos was what God was,\\" offered as a better representation of the original meaning of the evangelist.[40]\\r\\nThe portrayal of Jesus' death in John is unique among the four Gospels. It does not appear to rely on the kinds of atonement theology indicative of vicarious sacrifice (cf. Mk 10:45, Rom 3:25) but rather presents the death of Jesus as his glorification and return to the father. Likewise, the three \\"passion predictions\\" of the Synoptic Gospels (Mk 8:31, 9:31, 10:33ÿ34 and pars.) are replaced instead in John with three instances of Jesus explaining how he will be exalted or \\"lifted up\\"(Jn 3:14, 8:28, 12:32). The verb for \\"lifted up\\" reflects the double entendre at work in John's theology of the cross, for Jesus is both physically elevated from the earth at the crucifixion but also, at the same time, exalted and glorified.[41]\\r\\nAmong the most controversial areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to the sacraments at all, and on the degree of importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers to one of these questions do not always correspond to their answer to the other.[42]\\r\\nAccording to Rudolf Bultmann, there are three sacramental allusions: one to baptism (3:5), one to the Eucharist (6:51ÿ58), and one to both (19:34). He believed these passages to be later interpolations, though most scholars now reject this assessment. Some scholars on the weaker-sacramental side of the spectrum deny that there are any sacramental allusions in these passages or in the gospel as a whole, while others see sacramental symbolism applied to other subjects in these and other passages. Oscar Cullmann and Bruce Vawter, a Protestant and a Catholic respectively, and both on the stronger-sacramental end of the spectrum, have found sacramental allusions in most chapters. Cullmann found references to baptism and the Eucharist throughout the gospel, and Vawter found additional references to matrimony in 2:1ÿ11, anointing of the sick in 12:1ÿ11, and penance in 20:22ÿ23. Towards the center of the spectrum, Raymond Brown is more cautious than Cullmann and Vawter but more lenient than Bultmann and his school, identifying several passages as containing sacramental allusions and rating them according to his assessment of their degree of certainty.[42]\\r\\nMost scholars on the stronger-sacramental end of the spectrum assess the sacraments as being of great importance to the evangelist. However, perhaps counterintuitively, some scholars who find fewer sacramental references, such as Udo Schnelle, view the references that they find as highly important as well. Schnelle in particular views John's sacramentalism as a counter to Docetist anti-sacramentalism. On the other hand, though he agrees that there are anti-Docetic passages, James Dunn views the absence of a Eucharistic institution narrative as evidence for an anti-sacramentalism in John, meant to warn against a conception of eternal life as dependent on physical ritual.[42]\\r\\nIn comparison to the synoptic gospels, the Fourth Gospel is markedly individualistic, in the sense that it places emphasis more on the individual's relation to Jesus than on the corporate nature of the Church.[42][43] This is largely accomplished through the consistently singular grammatical structure of various aphoristic sayings of Jesus throughout the gospel.[42][Notes 11] According to Richard Bauckham, emphasis on believers coming into a new group upon their conversion is conspicuously absent from John.[42] There is also a theme of \\"personal coinherence\\", that is, the intimate personal relationship between the believer and Jesus in which the believer \\"abides\\" in Jesus and Jesus in the believer.[43][42][Notes 12] According to C. F. D. Moule, the individualistic tendencies of the Fourth Gospel could potentially give rise to a realized eschatology achieved on the level of the individual believer; this realized eschatology is not, however, to replace \\"orthodox\\", futurist eschatological expectations, but is to be \\"only [their] correlative.\\"[44] Some have argued that the Beloved Disciple is meant to be all followers of Jesus, inviting all into such a personal relationship with Christ. Beyond this, the emphasis on the individual's relationship with Jesus in the Gospel has suggested its usefulness for contemplation on the life of Christ.[45]\\r\\nJohn's account of the Baptist is different from that of the synoptic gospels. In this gospel, John is not called \\"the Baptist.\\"[46] The Baptist's ministry overlaps with that of Jesus; his baptism of Jesus is not explicitly mentioned, but his witness to Jesus is unambiguous.[46] The evangelist almost certainly knew the story of John's baptism of Jesus and he makes a vital theological use of it.[47] He subordinates the Baptist to Jesus, perhaps in response to members of the Baptist's sect who regarded the Jesus movement as an offshoot of their movement.[13]\\r\\nIn John's gospel, Jesus and his disciples go to Judea early in Jesus' ministry before John the Baptist was imprisoned and executed by Herod. He leads a ministry of baptism larger than John's own. The Jesus Seminar rated this account as black, containing no historically accurate information.[40] According to the biblical historians at the Jesus Seminar, John likely had a larger presence in the public mind than Jesus.[48]\\r\\nAlthough not commonly understood as Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully argued that the Gospel of John has elements in common with Gnosticism.[13] Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it.[49] To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it.[50] Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown have argued that the pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.[51]\\r\\nComparisons to Gnosticism are based not in what the author says, but in the language he uses to say it, notably, use of the concepts of Logos and Light.[52] Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown, have argued that the ancient Jewish Qumran community also used the concept of Light versus Darkness. The arguments of Bultmann and his school were seriously compromised by the mid-20th-century discoveries of the Nag Hammadi library of genuine Gnostic writings (which are dissimilar to the Gospel of John) as well as the Qumran library of Jewish writings (which are often similar to the Gospel of John).[53]\\r\\nGnostics read John but interpreted it differently from the way non-Gnostics did.[54] Gnosticism taught that salvation came from gnosis, secret knowledge, and Gnostics did not see Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge.[55] Barnabas Lindars asserts that the gospel teaches that salvation can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief into) Jesus.[56]\\r\\nRaymond Brown contends that \\"The Johannine picture of a savior who came from an alien world above, who said that neither he nor those who accepted him were of this world,[57] and who promised to return to take them to a heavenly dwelling[58] could be fitted into the gnostic world picture (even if God's love for the world in 3:16 could not).\\"[59] It has been suggested that similarities between John's gospel and Gnosticism may spring from common roots in Jewish Apocalyptic literature.[60]\\r\\nThe Gospel of John is significantly different from the synoptic gospels, with major variations in material, theological emphasis, chronology, and literary style.[61] There are also some discrepancies between John and the synoptics, some amounting to contradictions.[61]\\r\\nJohn lacks scenes from the synoptics such as Jesus' baptism,[62] the calling of the Twelve, exorcisms, parables, the Transfiguration, and the Last Supper. Conversely, it includes scenes not found in the synoptics, including Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at Cana, the resurrection of Lazarus, Jesus washing the feet of his disciples, and multiple visits to Jerusalem.[61]\\r\\nIn the fourth gospel, Jesus' mother Mary, while frequently mentioned, is never identified by name.[63][64] John does assert that Jesus was known as the \\"son of Joseph\\" in 6:42. For John, Jesus' town of origin is irrelevant, for he comes from beyond this world, from God the Father.[65]\\r\\nWhile John makes no direct mention of Jesus' baptism,[62][61] he does quote John the Baptist's description of the descent of the Holy Spirit as a dove, as happens at Jesus' baptism in the synoptics. Major synoptic speeches of Jesus are absent, including the Sermon on the Mount and the Olivet Discourse,[66] and the exorcisms of demons are never mentioned as in the synoptics.[62][67] John never lists all of the Twelve Disciples and names at least one disciple, Nathanael, whose name is not found in the synoptics. Thomas is given a personality beyond a mere name, described as \\"Doubting Thomas\\".[68]\\r\\nJesus is identified with the Word (\\"Logos\\"), and the Word is identified with theos (\\"god\\" in Greek);[69] no such identification is made in the synoptics.[70] In Mark, Jesus urges his disciples to keep his divinity secret, but in John he is very open in discussing it, even referring to himself as \\"I AM\\", the title God gives himself in Exodus at his self-revelation to Moses. In the synoptics the chief theme is the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Heaven (the latter specifically in Matthew), while John's theme is Jesus as the source of eternal life and the Kingdom is only mentioned twice.[61][67] In contrast to the synoptic expectation of the Kingdom (using the term parousia, meaning \\"coming\\"), John presents a more individualistic, realized eschatology.[71][72][Notes 13]\\r\\nIn the synoptics the ministry of Jesus takes a single year, but in John it takes three, as evidenced by references to three Passovers. Events are not all in the same order: the date of the crucifixion is different, as is the time of Jesus' anointing in Bethany, and the cleansing of the temple occurs in the beginning of Jesus' ministry rather than near its end.[61]\\r\\nIn the synoptics, quotations from Jesus are usually in the form of short, pithy sayings; in John, longer quotations are often given. The vocabulary is also different, and filled with theological import: in John, Jesus does not work \\"miracles\\" (Greek: Ѵ??ך?, translit.?dynmeis, sing. Ѵ????, dynamis), but \\"signs\\" (Greek: ך??, translit.?smeia, sing. ך?, smeion) which unveil his divine identity.[61] Most scholars consider John not to contain any parables.[74] Rather it contains metaphorical stories or allegories, such as those of the Good Shepherd and of the True Vine, in which each individual element corresponds to a specific person, group, or thing. Some scholars, however, find some such parables as the short story of the childbearing woman (16:21) or the dying grain (12:24).[Notes 14]\\r\\nAccording to the synoptics, the arrest of Jesus was a reaction to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus.[61] The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as Nicodemus, even go so far as to be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.[75]\\r\\nThe gospel has been depicted in live narrations and dramatized in productions, skits, plays, and Passion Plays, as well as in film. The most recent such portrayal is the 2014 film 'The Gospel of John', directed by David Batty and narrated by David Harewood and Brian Cox, with Selva Rasalingam as Jesus. The 2003 film The Gospel of John, was directed by Philip Saville, narrated by Christopher Plummer, with Henry Ian Cusick as Jesus.\\r\\nParts of the gospel have been set to music. One such setting is Steve Warner's power anthem \\"Come and See\\", written for the 20th anniversary of the Alliance for Catholic Education and including lyrical fragments taken from the Book of Signs. Additionally, some composers have made settings of the Passion as portrayed in the gospel, most notably the one composed by Johann Sebastian Bach, although some verses are borrowed from Matthew.[76]\\r\\nOnline translations of the Gospel of John:","input":"When was the gospel of john probably written?"},{"output":"November 3, 1956","context":"MGM's 1939 musical fantasy film The Wizard of Oz was first shown in theatres that year, then re-released nationwide in 1949 and again in 1955.

It has never been licensed to any local affiliate broadcast TV station. From 1959 until 1991, it was an annual tradition on American commercial network television. During these years, and for several afterwards, it was always shown as a television special.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the film was shown on television for the second time, network telecasts of it became a much-anticipated family event in the United States, drawing large audiences annually for many years.[1] Between 1956 and 1980, commercial broadcast television was virtually the only means by which families were able to see The Wizard of Oz, unless they attended the MGM Children's Matinees in the early 1970s.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 1999, the film had been shown in the U.S. only on commercial broadcast television. After the film went to cable that year, TV showings of the movie became increasingly more frequent, and the tradition of televising it only once a year ended, at least in the U.S.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wizard of Oz has become perhaps the most famous film to be shown regularly on U.S. television, and one of the most cherished.[3] Of the many family-oriented musical fantasies broadcast after the successful 1955 version of the Mary Martin Peter Pan, The Wizard of Oz is the only one which is still shown regularly.  Following the 1956 premiere, there were no rebroadcasts of the film until 1959. The 1959-1962 broadcasts occurred in autumn between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Beginning with the 1963-64 season, these special presentations were seen in the first quarter of the year. The film was not broadcast in the U.S. in 1963, 1992, 1995, or 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was first issued on home video formats in 1980.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wizard of Oz, which had been a critical but only modest financial success during its theatrical run, was chosen to be the first Hollywood film to be shown uncut in prime time on a coast to coast television network. [5]  The first telecast took place on Saturday November 3, 1956 as part of the final program in the canceled CBS anthology series Ford Star Jubilee . A rotating potpourri of highly budgeted but low rated specials including a well publicized debut hour hosted by Judy Garland.[6] The original asking price of $250,000 was negotiated by MGM attorney, later company president, Frank Rosenfelt. The network paid MGM $225,000 for the rights to televise the film twice with an option to re-broadcast it if the telecast was a success.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis 1956 broadcast shown as CBS's response to the successful color telecast of the Broadway musical Peter Pan with Mary Martin, which had been restaged especially for TV at NBC Studios as part of the anthology series Producers' Showcase. Peter Pan had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \\"fad\\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as Aladdin (1958, and no relation to the Disney film), Alice in Wonderland (1955) (a live-action version), Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella (1957), The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957), and Pinocchio (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast The Wizard of Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first TV broadcast of The Wizard of Oz, the normally 90-minute Ford Star Jubilee was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity hosted. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host it: Bert Lahr, who had played both the Cowardly Lion and farmhand Zeke in the film, appeared alongside then 10-year-old Liza Minnelli, and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. Lorna Luft, Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other Oz telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.[9] The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \\"hosting\\" The Wizard of Oz lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),[citation needed] and the tracking shot of Munchkinland was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day. Variety magazine prophetically suggested that the film could be telecast annually and at an earlier time.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was not rebroadcast in 1957 or 1958. For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone TV special instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when Angela Lansbury, star of CBS' Murder She Wrote, hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current prime time lineup. In 1959, the host was Red Skelton (The Red Skelton Show); in 1960 it was Richard Boone (Have Gun, Will Travel), in 1961 and 1962 it was Dick Van Dyke (The Dick Van Dyke Show), and from 1964 through 1967, it was Danny Kaye (The Danny Kaye Show). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on video tape in advance of the telecasts.[11] Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series Have Gun, Will Travel, in a \\"living room\\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,[11] and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop toadstool against a painted backdrop of the Yellow Brick Road and the Emerald City.[12] The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome humor as sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a Victorian-era storyteller who introduced L. Frank Baum's original 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wizard of Oz did not become an annual television tradition immediately  only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before. The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic John Crosby, who commented in the New York Herald Tribune, \\"Television  any television  looks awfully ordinary after The Wizard of Oz\\".[13] From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nWISN-TV in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly Oz telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running Green Bay Packers football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00?p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated WBBM-TV in Chicago accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's Oz telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.[citation needed] Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.[citation needed] For several hours thereafter, the WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times newspapers.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound opening and closing credits segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \\"wraparound\\" credits, the title The Wizard of Oz and the names of its five leading actors, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, and Jack Haley, were first shown in CBS's own format and font, while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \\"This portion of The Wizard of Oz is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment  the Danny Kaye one  was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \\"wraparound\\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 opening credits (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM Leo the Lion logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's main title music heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \\"The End\\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card The Wizard of Oz, this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the soundtrack, and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \\"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the beginning The Wizard of Oz was telecast in color, although few people owned color television sets in 1956.  Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.[15][16] Between 1956 and 1965, the Wizard of Oz showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by RCA, which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBCs daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\\r\\n\\r\\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when The Wizard of Oz went to NBC in 1968, where no \\"wraparound\\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous NBC peacock was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer Mel Brandt saying that \\"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the sepia tone in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor Gregory Peck paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by Oz producer Mervyn LeRoy, marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC Oz telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the Easter and Passover seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on CBS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price  fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity  for renewal of the rights to telecast it.[17]  The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \\"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \\"wraparound\\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title The Wizard of Oz was shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic and years later retitled The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. Jack Haley, Jr., the documentary's director, was nominated for an Emmy Award for his work.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, The Wizard of Oz was usually hosted by TCM host Robert Osborne.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 3, 2007, Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants, hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of Essentials, Jr., a special summer series of family movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on Turner Network Television without a host, but with commercials, and with \\"pop-up\\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on the Cartoon Network by television actor Robert Wu, who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the Family Guy episode, \\"Tiegs for Two\\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian Bill Hader, again as part of the Essentials, Jr. summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a presentation of network TV, \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first telecast of \\"Oz\\" was a presentation of Ford Star Jubilee and thus sponsored by Ford Motor Company and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by Procter and Gamble and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by Singer Manufacturing Company as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special.  In the first nine showings, all on CBS, The Wizard of Oz gained at least 49% of the television audience.[19] In 1966, it ranked No. 1 in the ratings for the week that it was shown.[20] Between 1960 and 1968, the film even beat out episodes of ABC-TV's Walt Disney Presents (in 1960) and NBC's Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color (from 1961 to 1968), which aired opposite the film.[21]  When the film moved temporarily from CBS to NBC, it always preempted the Disney program altogether, except for once, when NBC showed Oz on a Saturday in 1968. When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in high-definition, the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \\"clock in\\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written foreword to the film.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.[9] However, The Wizard of Oz is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the Library of Congress and the National Film Preservation Board. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \\"microcutting\\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07?p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, Ted Turner purchased the film from MGM, alongside Gone with the Wind. Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for Oz in exchange for relinquishing its rights to Gone with the Wind.[25] In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.[citation needed] 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, The Wizard of Oz made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer. In 2002, it was shown five times.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 6, 2011, TBS became the American television channel on which The Wizard of Oz has been shown most often, when the film had its 32nd showing on that channel, finally breaking CBS' record 31 showings. As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on NBC Saturday Night at the Movies or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.[citation needed]  On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \\"CBS Movie Special\\" or an \\"NBC Movie Special\\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply The Wizard of Oz.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the Academy-standard aspect-ratio film.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen shown in HDTV, the film is pillarboxed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.[27] On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.[28][28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in the United Kingdom, Canada and is shown every year in Australia, but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.[30] In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on the newly-inaugurated television network RCTI in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s. In Japan, the film has aired on the Japanese version of The Magical World of Disney, although Disney had nothing to do with its production or release.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nEastern Time (taken from TV Guide and from The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason that the film did not air in December 1963 has never been stated, but some say that it was because of John F. Kennedy's assassination, others say room needed to be made for more Christmas themed specials and that the movie fit in better during January. For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast airing on CBS until 1976. Moved to NBC in 1968, at this time, the showings were moved from midwinter to late winter/early spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst showing by NBC, in Spring rather than Winter. The first time that the film was shown at 7:00 P.M instead of 6:00 P.M.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first time that the film aired in the middle of the week, rather than on a weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year that The Wizard Of Oz returned to CBS. It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted 60 Minutes, so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with 60 Minutes. (As of 2017, 60 Minutes continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\\r\\n\\r\\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last time that the film pre-empted 60 Minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.

The fourth series was released on 29 December 2017.[2]\\r\\nCharlie Brooker had completed production of Dead Set, a zombie-based drama series, and while working on Newswipe and other programmes, had decided that he wanted to make another drama series, in an anthology style like The Twilight Zone, Tales of the Unexpected, and Hammer House of Horror.[3][4] Brooker recognised that Rod Serling had written episodes of The Twilight Zone using contemporary issues, often controversial such as racism, but placing them in fictional settings as to get around television censors at the time.[4] For Brooker, he realised he could do similar commentary on modern issues, and specifically focusing on mankind's dependency on technology, something he encountered while producing the series How TV Ruined Your Life.[4] Brooker pulled the series' title from this approach:\\r\\n\\"If technology is a drug?ÿ and it does feel like a drug?ÿ then what, precisely, are the side effects? This area?ÿ between delight and discomfort?ÿ is where Black Mirror, my new drama series, is set. The 'black mirror' of the title is the one you'll find on every wall, on every desk, in the palm of every hand: the cold, shiny screen of a TV, a monitor, a smartphone.\\"[4]\\r\\nBrooker wanted to keep the anthology approach, using new stories, settings, characters and actors for each episode, as he felt this approach was a key element of enjoying shows like The Twilight Zone; he said \\"There was a signature tone to the stories, the same dark chocolate coating?ÿ but the filling was always a surprise.\\"[4] This approach would allow Black Mirror to contrast with current dramas and serials that had a standard recurring cast.[4] According to Brooker, the production team considered giving the series a linking theme or presenter, but ultimately it was decided not to do so: \\"There were discussions. Do we set them all in the same street? Do we have some characters who appear in each episode, a bit Three Colours: Blue/White/Red style? We did think about having a character who introduces them, Tales from the Crypt style, or like Rod Serling or Alfred Hitchcock or Roald Dahl, because most anthology shows did have that... but the more we thought about it, we thought it was a bit weird.\\"[5]\\r\\nWhile the production does not use linking elements, the show has included allusions and Easter eggs from previous episodes into later ones. For example, \\"Hated in the Nation\\" in the third series calls back to the events of both the first series episode \\"The National Anthem\\" and the second series episode \\"White Bear\\".[6] while the final episode of fourth series \\"Black Museum\\" includes references to each prior episode of the series.[7] Some of these are for the ease of reusing a name developed in a prior episode; for example, they created the fictional \\"UKN\\" broadcast network for handling news reports that drive stories,[8] while the pizza delivery company used in \\"USS Callister\\" was used again for a company running automated pizza trucks in \\"Crocodile\\".[9] Other Easter eggs were added as they knew viewers would be intensely dissecting the episodes and provided these as gags. However, over time the use of Easter eggs became more purposeful, as to establish a canon of the \\"dream universe\\" that the episodes take place in.[6] Brooker noted that when they opted to reuse a cover of Irma Thomas' \\"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is\\", first introduced in \\"Fifteen Million Merits\\", for \\"White Christmas\\", as \\"it does sort of nest the whole thing together in some kind of artistic universe\\".[8]\\r\\nGiles Harvey comments in a profile of Brooker for The New Yorker that each episode \\"establishes the background of normality against which a decisive tweak will stand out all the more starkly\\". Harvey notes that the show's diverse range of genres show that it is \\"manifestly the work of someone who has clocked up many hours of screen time\\". He further comments that Brooker is \\"scrupulous\\", as \\"the believability of each episode depends on maintaining the complex internal logic of its dystopic world\\". Brooker is involved during the filming and editing processes, pointing out any inconsistencies that arise, and is \\"determined to make the devices and screens and interfaces used in 'Black Mirror' seem authentic\\". As examples of Brooker's \\"meticulous attention to detail\\", Harvey reports that Brooker carefully considered whether a falling wine bottle would shatter in the nested virtual realities of \\"Playtest\\", and whether it would rain in the eponymous location in \\"San Junipero\\". An instance of realistic technology is the email system in \\"Be Right Back\\", which contrasts with \\"histrionic computers\\" found in Hollywood; an email is sent to the main character with the heading \\"Martha, people in your position bought the following\\", containing various books on the topic of grief-counselling.[10] Knowing that fans of the show have dissected some of these details by watching the episodes frame-by-frame, Brooker and his team have included humorous jabs at these fans through printed messages on various props, such as a paragraph in a news article held up by a character directed to fans of the show on Reddit in \\"Crocodile\\".[11]\\r\\nThe first two series of the programme were produced by Brooker's production company Zeppotron, for Endemol. An Endemol press release described the series as \\"a hybrid of The Twilight Zone and Tales of the Unexpected which taps into our contemporary unease about our modern world\\", with the stories having a \\"techno-paranoia\\" feel.[12] Channel 4 described the first episode, \\"The National Anthem\\", as \\"a twisted parable for the Twitter age\\".[13] Black Mirror series 1 had a limited DVD release for PAL / Region 2 on 27 February 2012.[14]\\r\\nA trailer for the second series was made by Moving Picture Company, and featured three interspersed storylines: \\"a dream sequence, the repetitive factory setting and the huge dust cloud that sweeps through the street at the ad's climatic end.\\" Aired from 22 January 2013, the advertisement was shown on Channel 4 and in cinemas.[15] The second series had a DVD release, which like the first series DVD was PAL for region 2 only.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2013, Robert Downey Jr. optioned the episode \\"The Entire History of You\\" (written by Jesse Armstrong) to potentially be made into a film by Warner Bros. and his own production company, Team Downey.[16] The show was available in the U.S. on Netflix from late 2014 onwards.[17]\\r\\nIn September 2015, Netflix commissioned 12 episodes of Black Mirror.[18] In March 2016, it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series, with a bid of US$40?million.[19] Endemol released a statement saying that Channel 4 \\"had the opportunity to recommission [Black Mirror] since 2013 and passed on this and subsequent co-production offers put to them. [...] Further efforts were made to try to reach a settlement regarding a U.K. window for Channel 4, but these were also sadly to no avail\\". In a press release, Channel 4 say that they \\"offered to recommission Black Mirror\\". This marked the first time that an online streaming service had gained the rights to a show where the original network had wished to renew it.[17] The titles of the six episodes that make up series 3 were announced in July 2016, along with the release date.[20]\\r\\nIn developing the third series' stories, Brooker had looked back to the first two series and the Christmas special, and recognised that all the stories were about characters becoming trapped in a situation that they could not escape from. Coupled with the anthology format that asked for viewers to get immersed within the stories to understand the nature of each, this created a sense of darkness and horror, which could make it difficult to watch successive episodes without becoming uncomfortable. With the third series, Brooker wanted to explore different formats, still having a few \\"trap\\" episodes but adding more conventional stories like a romance and police procedural, making the new series more digestible for the viewer.[21] A trailer for the third series was released in October 2016.[22] The third series cast includes Bryce Dallas Howard, Alice Eve, James Norton, Cherry Jones, Wyatt Russell, Alex Lawther, Jerome Flynn, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mackenzie Davis, Michael Kelly, Malachi Kirby, Kelly Macdonald, and Faye Marsay.[22] The directors for the third series include Joe Wright,[23] Jakob Verbruggen,[24] James Hawes,[25] and Dan Trachtenberg.[26] The third series was released on Netflix worldwide on 21 October 2016.[27]\\r\\nAccording to Brooker, the fourth series has even more variety in the episodes than in previous series.[28] Brooker says that there is \\"some more hope\\" in the series, crediting this to the fact that writing began in July 2016 and continued throughout the 2016 U.S. election, and \\"I genuinely thought, I don't know what state the world's going to be in by the time these [episodes] appear, and I don't know how much appetite there will be for nothing but bleak nihilism.\\"[29] The series features an episode story conceived by Penn Jillette.[30] Jodie Foster directed the episode \\"Arkangel\\", starring Rosemarie DeWitt;[31] one episode was filmed in Iceland (\\"Crocodile\\") and another is overtly comedic in tone (\\"USS Callister\\"). Jesse Plemons, Cristin Milioti, Jimmi Simpson, Michaela Coel, Andrea Riseborough, Andrew Gower, Georgina Campbell, Joe Cole, George Blagden, Maxine Peake, Douglas Hodge, and Letitia Wright appear in the fourth series.[32] In addition to Foster, the episodes were directed by Toby Haynes, John Hillcoat, Tim Van Patten, David Slade, and Colm McCarthy.[32]\\r\\nIn May 2017, a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror.[33] Filming for the fourth series concluded in June 2017.[34] The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017, and contained the six episode titles.[35][36] In September 2017, two photos from the fourth season were released.[37] Beginning on 24 November 2017, Netflix published a series of posters and trailers for each episode in the fourth series of the show, referred to as the \\"13 Days of Black Mirror\\",[38] concluding on 6 December 2017 with the announcement of the release date.[39] All six episodes were released to Netflix on 29 December 2017.[40]\\r\\nIn December 2017, when Brooker and executive producer Annabel Jones were asked about possibly creating a fifth series of Black Mirror, they said, \\"We would love to do it\\".[41] Netflix announced the fifth series via social media on 5 March 2018, though did not announce its release date or episode count.[42][43] On 20 March 2018, at the 2018 Royal Television Society Awards, Brooker confirmed that the fifth series has begun filming.[44]\\r\\nIn October 2016, Brooker said that he had ideas of where sequels to both \\"White Bear\\" and \\"Be Right Back\\" would go, but it was unlikely that either would be made.[45] He also revealed that actors had been approached to return to the series, but were not available, although Hannah John-Kamen does appear in \\"Playtest\\" after appearing in an unrelated role in \\"Fifteen Million Merits\\".[45] Furthermore, Brooker also stated that there were some characters in the series three episode \\"Hated in the Nation\\" who could potentially recur.[45]\\r\\nWhen asked in interviews, Brooker has repeatedly stated that there are no plans for a sequel episode to \\"San Junipero\\". He told Los Angeles Times that \\"we want to keep [Kelly and Yorkie] happy there\\".[46] However, Brooker has said that the show \\"may be referring to San Junipero again\\" in Easter eggs, which the show has used before.[47] Brooker has also raised the idea of doing a sequel to the episode in \\"a completely different form\\", such as a graphic novel or \\"an experience\\".[48][49]\\r\\nThe first series has been praised as being creative and shocking with twists-in-the-tale reminiscent of The Twilight Zone.[50][51] Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph described the first episode, \\"The National Anthem\\", as \\"a shocking but ballsy, blackly comic study of the modern media\\".[51] He went on to say that \\"This was a dementedly brilliant idea. The satire was so audacious, it left me open-mouthed and squealing. Rather like that poor pig.\\"[51] The series was taken up across much of the world, including Australia, Israel, Sweden, Spain, Poland, Hungary and China.[52] The series has become popular and been well received in China, becoming one of the most discussed series in early 2012.[53] User ratings on Douban reached 9.3,[54] higher than most popular American dramas.[55] Many viewers and critics praised the depth of the series.[53][54][56] A reporter from The Beijing News thought the programme was \\"an apocalypse of modern world\\", \\"desperate but profound\\".[56] Another article from the same newspaper thought each story criticised television from different aspects.[57] Xu Wen at The Epoch Times thought the stories reveal modernity's moral turpitude.[58]\\r\\nIn its second series, Black Mirror continued to receive praise. In his review of the episode \\"Be Right Back\\", Sameer Rahim of The Telegraph wrote, \\"The show touched on important ideas?ÿ the false way we sometimes present ourselves online, and our growing addiction to virtual lives?ÿ but it was also a touching exploration of grief. To my mind it's the best thing Brooker has done.\\" Jane Simon of The Daily Mirror newspaper website, said that the second episode of the second series, \\"White Bear\\", lacked the \\"instant emotional tug\\" of the series opener, \\"Be Right Back\\".[59] She went on to say that, a third of the way through the second episode, she had lost hope of it concluding well, \\"the acting was unbelievable, the script was riddled with horror-film cliches, the violence was a bit over the top\\", but that by the end, \\"I turned out to be absolutely dead wrong on every single count.\\" She ended the piece with: \\"Its another work of dark and twisted genius from Mr Brooker.\\" The second series is popular in China. Wen Bai at Information Times thought the second series was still \\"cannily made\\", and \\"near perfection\\".[60]\\r\\nIn December 2014, Stephen King noted his admiration of the series.[61][62][63] The show's Christmas special that year, \\"White Christmas\\" received critical acclaim. Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian praised the comic satire of the episode and noted that \\"sentimentality is offset with wicked wit, and Brookers brio and imagination paper over any gaps in logic.\\"[64] The Daily Telegraph reviewer Mark Monahan gave the episode 4/5 stars, noting that the drama was \\"thrilling stuff: escapist entertainment with a very real-world sting in its tail\\". Monahan equated the episode with the stronger of the previous Black Mirror episodes, stating that \\"it exaggerated present-day technology and obsessions to subtle but infernal effect, a nightmare-before-Christmas reminder that to revere our digital gizmos is to become their pathetic slave.\\"[65]\\r\\nThe third and fourth series received positive reviews from critics, earning ratings of 82 and 74 out of 100 on Metacritic, respectively.[66][67]\\r\\nJournalists have reported that some of the concepts in Black Mirror have come true, in fashion, within the real world, and have called the show a Magic 8-Ball for the future.[68][69][70] The first episode, \\"The National Anthem\\", revolves around the British Prime Minister being blackmailed into having sex with a pig; in September 2015, four years after the episode aired, allegations were published that David Cameron, who at the time was British Prime Minister had placed a \\"private part\\" into the mouth of a dead pig as part of a university initiation rite.[71] Brooker has called the event a \\"coincidence, albeit a quite bizarre one\\", and was quite perturbed when he first heard the allegations: \\"I did genuinely for a moment wonder if reality was a simulation, whether it exists only to trick me\\", he said in an interview.[72] Several news reports compared Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to \\"The Waldo Moment\\", a 2013 episode in the second series;[73][74] later, in September 2016, episode writer Charlie Brooker also compared the Trump campaign to the episode and predicted Trump would win the 2016 election.[75][76] The third series episode \\"Nosedive\\" presented a social rating-based system that several found mirrored by China's proposed Social Credit System.[77][78][79] Brooker has been surprised to see how some of these events had come to pass. \\"It was quite trippy, though. I'm kind of getting used to it, because it seems like it's quite often that there are things that are in the stories that come true.\\"[80]\\r\\nIn November 2012, Black Mirror won Best TV Movie/Miniseries at the International Emmy Awards.[81] International Emmys are awarded to TV series produced and initially aired outside the U.S.[82] After both series aired in the United States, The A.V. Club placed it on its Best of 2013 list (along with Borgen, The Fall, Moone Boy and Please Like Me).[83] Bryce Dallas Howard received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for her performance in the episode \\"Nosedive\\".[84] At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, Black Mirror received three nominations with two wins, including Outstanding Television Movie for \\"San Junipero\\".[85][86]\\r\\nIn June 2017, Brooker announced a series of novels based on Black Mirror that will offer \\"new, original, darkly satirical stories that tap into our collective unease about the modern world\\". Brooker will edit three volumes of novellas that will feature anthology short stories by different authors.[129][85] The first instalment will include stories written by Cory Doctorow, Claire North and Sylvain Neuvel.[130] It is scheduled for release on 20 September 2018; the second instalment later that year; and the third in 2019.[131]","input":"What episode is the beginning of black mirror?"},{"output":"developing mixed economy","context":"","input":"What kind of economy does the india have?"},{"output":"during World War II","context":"The MyersÿBriggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire with the purpose of indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world around them and make decisions.[1][2][3]\\r\\nThe MBTI was constructed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers. It is based on the conceptual theory proposed by Carl Jung,[4] who had speculated that humans experience the world using four principal psychological functions ÿ sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking ÿ and that one of these four functions is dominant for a person most of the time.[5]\\r\\nThe MBTI was constructed for normal populations and emphasizes the value of naturally occurring differences.[6] \\"The underlying assumption of the MBTI is that we all have specific preferences in the way we construe our experiences, and these preferences underlie our interests, needs, values, and motivation.\\"[7]\\r\\nAlthough popular in the business sector, the MBTI exhibits significant psychometric deficiencies, notably including poor validity (i.e. not measuring what it purports to measure) and poor reliability (giving different results for the same person on different occasions).[8][9][10] The four scales used in the MBTI have some correlation with four of the Big Five personality traits, which are a more commonly accepted framework.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine Cook Briggs began her research into personality in 1917. Upon meeting her future son-in-law, she observed marked differences between his personality and that of other family members. Briggs embarked on a project of reading biographies, and subsequently developed a typology wherein she proposed four temperaments: meditative (or thoughtful), spontaneous, executive, and social.[12][13]\\r\\nAfter the English translation of Jung's book Psychological Types was published in 1923 (first published in German in 1921), she recognized that Jung's theory was similar to, but went far beyond, her own.[1]:22 Briggs's four types were later identified as corresponding to the IXXXs, EXXPs, EXTJs and EXFJs.[clarification needed][12][13] Her first publications were two articles describing Jung's theory, in the journal New Republic in 1926 (\\"Meet Yourself Using the Personality Paint Box\\") and 1928 (\\"Up From Barbarism\\"). After extensively studying the work of Jung, they turned their interest in human behavior into efforts to turn the theory of psychological types to practical use.[2][12]\\r\\nBriggs's daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, added to her mother's typological research, which she would progressively take over entirely. Myers graduated first in her class from Swarthmore College in 1919[1]:xx and wrote a mystery novel, Murder Yet to Come, in 1929 using typological ideas (which won the National Detective Murder Mystery Contest that year). However, neither Myers nor Briggs was formally educated in the discipline of psychology, and both were self-taught in the field of psychometric testing.[1]:xiii Myers therefore apprenticed herself to Edward N. Hay, who was then personnel manager for a large Philadelphia bank and who went on to start one of the first successful personnel consulting firms in the United States. From Hay, Myers learned rudimentary test construction, scoring, validation, and statistical methods.[1]:xiii, xx\\r\\nBriggs and Myers began creating the indicator during World War II[2] in the belief that a knowledge of personality preferences would help women who were entering the industrial workforce for the first time to identify the sort of war-time jobs that would be \\"most comfortable and effective\\" for them.[1]:xiii The Briggs Myers Type Indicator Handbook was published in 1944. The indicator changed its name to \\"MyersÿBriggs Type Indicator\\" in 1956.[14] Myers' work attracted the attention of Henry Chauncey, head of the Educational Testing Service. Under these auspices, the first MBTI Manual was published in 1962. The MBTI received further support from Donald W. MacKinnon, head of the Institute of Personality and Social Research at the University of California, Berkeley; W. Harold Grant, a professor at Michigan State University and Auburn University; and Mary H. McCaulley of the University of Florida. The publication of the MBTI was transferred to Consulting Psychologists Press in 1975, and the Center for Applications of Psychological Type was founded as a research laboratory.[1]:xxi\\r\\nAfter Myers' death in May 1980, Mary McCaulley updated the MBTI Manual and the second edition was published in 1985.[15] The third edition appeared in 1998.\\r\\nJung's theory of psychological types was not based on controlled scientific studies,[16] but instead on clinical observation, introspection, and anecdotemethods regarded as inconclusive in the modern field of scientific psychology.[16]\\r\\nJung's typology theories postulated a sequence of four cognitive functions (thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition), each having one of two polar orientations (extraversion or introversion), giving a total of eight dominant functions. The MBTI is based on these eight hypothetical functions, although with some differences in expression from Jung's model (see Differences from Jung below). While the Jungian model offers empirical evidence for the first three dichotomies, whether the Briggs had evidence for the J-P preference is unclear.[verification needed]\\r\\nThe MBTI takes what is called a \\"structured\\" approach to personality assessment. The responses to items are considered \\"closed\\" and interpreted according to the theory of the test constructers in scoring. This is contrary to the \\"projective\\" approach to personality assessment advocated by psychodynamic theorists such as Carl Jung. Indeed, Jung was a proponent of the \\"word association\\" test as a measure of the unconscious dispositions influencing behavior. This approach uses \\"open-ended\\" responses that need to be interpreted in the context of the \\"whole\\" person, and not according to the preconceived theory of the test constructers. Supporters of the projective approach to personality assessment are critical of the structured approach because defense mechanisms may distort responses to the closed items on structured tests.\\r\\nThe most notable addition of Myers and Briggs ideas to Jung's original thought is their concept that a given type's fourth letter (J or P) indicates a person's preferred extraverted function, which is the dominant function for extraverted types and the auxiliary function for introverted types.[1]:21ÿ22\\r\\nJung theorized that the dominant function acts alone in its preferred world: exterior for extraverts and interior for introverts. The remaining three functions, he suggested, operate together in the opposite orientation. If the dominant cognitive function is introverted the other functions are extraverted and vice versa. The MBTI Manual summarizes references in Jung's work to the balance in psychological type as follows: \\"There are several references in Jung's writing to the three remaining functions having an opposite attitudinal character. For example, in writing about introverts with thinking dominant?... Jung commented that the counterbalancing functions have an extraverted character.\\"[15] However, many MBTI practitioners hold that the tertiary function is oriented in the same direction as the dominant function.[17] Using the INTP type as an example, the orientation would be as follows:\\r\\nThe MBTI Manual states that the indicator \\"is designed to implement a theory; therefore, the theory must be understood to understand the MBTI\\".[18]:1 Fundamental to the MBTI is the theory of psychological type as originally developed by Carl Jung.[1]:xiii Jung proposed the existence of two dichotomous pairs of cognitive functions:\\r\\nJung believed that for every person, each of the functions is expressed primarily in either an introverted or extraverted form.[1]:17 Based on Jung's original concepts, Briggs and Myers developed their own theory of psychological type, described below, on which the MBTI is based. However, although psychologist Hans Eysenck called the MBTI a moderately successful quantification of Jung's original principles as outlined in Psychological Types,[19] he also said, \\"[The MBTI] creates 16 personality types which are said to be similar to Jung's theoretical concepts. I have always found difficulties with this identification, which omits one half of Jung's theory (he had 32 types, by asserting that for every conscious combination of traits there was an opposite unconscious one). Obviously, the latter half of his theory does not admit of questionnaire measurement, but to leave it out and pretend that the scales measure Jungian concepts is hardly fair to Jung.\\"[20] In any event, both models remain hypothetical, with no controlled scientific studies supporting either Jung's original concept of type or the MyersÿBriggs variation.[16]\\r\\nJung's typological model regards psychological type as similar to left or right handedness: people are either born with, or develop, certain preferred ways of perceiving and deciding. The MBTI sorts some of these psychological differences into four opposite pairs, or \\"dichotomies\\", with a resulting 16 possible psychological types. None of these types is \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\"; however, Briggs and Myers theorized that people innately \\"prefer\\" one overall combination of type differences.[1]:9 In the same way that writing with the left hand is difficult for a right-hander, so people tend to find using their opposite psychological preferences more difficult, though they can become more proficient (and therefore behaviorally flexible) with practice and development.\\r\\nThe 16 types are typically referred to by an abbreviation of four lettersthe initial letters of each of their four type preferences (except in the case of intuition, which uses the abbreviation \\"N\\" to distinguish it from introversion). For instance:\\r\\nThese abbreviations are applied to all 16 types.\\r\\nThe four pairs of preferences or \\"dichotomies\\" are shown in the adjacent table.\\r\\nThe terms used for each dichotomy have specific technical meanings relating to the MBTI, which differ from their everyday usage. For example, people who prefer judgment over perception are not necessarily more \\"judgmental\\" or less \\"perceptive\\", nor does the MBTI instrument measure aptitude; it simply indicates for one preference over another.[18]:3 Someone reporting a high score for extraversion over introversion cannot be correctly described as more extraverted: they simply have a clear preference.\\r\\nPoint scores on each of the dichotomies can vary considerably from person to person, even among those with the same type. However, Isabel Myers considered the direction of the preference (for example, E vs. I) to be more important than the degree of the preference (for example, very clear vs. slight).[15] The expression of a person's psychological type is more than the sum of the four individual preferences. The preferences interact through type dynamics and type development.\\r\\nMyersÿBriggs literature uses the terms extraversion and introversion as Jung first used them. Extraversion means literally outward-turning and introversion, inward-turning.[21] These specific definitions differ somewhat from the popular usage of the words. Extraversion is the spelling used in MBTI publications.\\r\\nThe preferences for extraversion and introversion are often called \\"attitudes\\". Briggs and Myers recognized that each of the cognitive functions can operate in the external world of behavior, action, people, and things (\\"extraverted attitude\\") or the internal world of ideas and reflection (\\"introverted attitude\\"). The MBTI assessment sorts for an overall preference for one or the other.\\r\\nPeople who prefer extraversion draw energy from action: they tend to act, then reflect, then act further. If they are inactive, their motivation tends to decline. To rebuild their energy, extraverts need breaks from time spent in reflection. Conversely, those who prefer introversion \\"expend\\" energy through action: they prefer to reflect, then act, then reflect again. To rebuild their energy, introverts need quiet time alone, away from activity.[22]\\r\\nAn extravert's flow is directed outward toward people and objects, whereas the introvert's is directed inward toward concepts and ideas. Contrasting characteristics between extraverted and introverted people include:\\r\\nJung identified two pairs of psychological functions:\\r\\nAccording to Jung's typology model, each person uses one of these four functions more dominantly and proficiently than the other three; however, all four functions are used at different times depending on the circumstances.\\r\\nSensing and intuition are the information-gathering (perceiving) functions. They describe how new information is understood and interpreted. People who prefer sensing are more likely to trust information that is in the present, tangible, and concrete: that is, information that can be understood by the five senses. They tend to distrust hunches, which seem to come \\"out of nowhere\\".[1]:2 They prefer to look for details and facts. For them, the meaning is in the data. On the other hand, those who prefer intuition tend to trust information that is less dependent upon the senses, that can be associated with other information (either remembered or discovered by seeking a wider context or pattern). They may be more interested in future possibilities. For them, the meaning is in the underlying theory and principles which are manifested in the data.\\r\\nThinking and feeling are the decision-making (judging) functions. The thinking and feeling functions are both used to make rational decisions, based on the data received from their information-gathering functions (sensing or intuition). Those who prefer thinking tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the decision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, consistent, and matching a given set of rules. Those who prefer feeling tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it 'from the inside' and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering the needs of the people involved. Thinkers usually have trouble interacting with people who are inconsistent or illogical, and tend to give very direct feedback to others. They are concerned with the truth and view it as more important.\\r\\nAs noted already, people who prefer thinking do not necessarily, in the everyday sense, \\"think better\\" than their feeling counterparts, in the common sense; the opposite preference is considered an equally rational way of coming to decisions (and, in any case, the MBTI assessment is a measure of preference, not ability). Similarly, those who prefer feeling do not necessarily have \\"better\\" emotional reactions than their thinking counterparts. In many cases, however, people who use thinking functions as either dominant or auxiliary tend to have more underdeveloped feeling functions, and often have more trouble with regulating and making healthy and productive decisions based on their feelings.\\r\\nAccording to Jung, people use all four cognitive functions. However, one function is generally used in a more conscious and confident way. This dominant function is supported by the secondary (auxiliary) function, and to a lesser degree the tertiary function. The fourth and least conscious function is always the opposite of the dominant function. Myers called this inferior function the \\"shadow\\".[1]:84\\r\\nThe four functions operate in conjunction with the attitudes (extraversion and introversion). Each function is used in either an extraverted or introverted way. A person whose dominant function is extraverted intuition, for example, uses intuition very differently from someone whose dominant function is introverted intuition.\\r\\nMyers and Briggs added another dimension to Jung's typological model by identifying that people also have a preference for using either the judging function (thinking or feeling) or their perceiving function (sensing or intuition) when relating to the outside world (extraversion).\\r\\nMyers and Briggs held that types with a preference for judging show the world their preferred judging function (thinking or feeling). So, TJ types tend to appear to the world as logical and FJ types as empathetic. According to Myers,[1]:75 judging types like to \\"have matters settled\\".\\r\\nThose types who prefer perception show the world their preferred perceiving function (sensing or intuition). So, SP types tend to appear to the world as concrete and NP types as abstract. According to Myers,[1]:75 perceptive types prefer to \\"keep decisions open\\".\\r\\nFor extraverts, the J or P indicates their dominant function; for introverts, the J or P indicates their auxiliary function[citation needed]. Introverts tend to show their dominant function outwardly only in matters \\"important to their inner worlds\\".[1]:13 For example:\\r\\nBecause the ENTJ type is extraverted, the J indicates that the dominant function is the preferred judging function (extraverted thinking). The ENTJ type introverts the auxiliary perceiving function (introverted intuition). The tertiary function is sensing and the inferior function is introverted feeling.\\r\\nBecause the INTJ type is introverted, however, the J instead indicates that the auxiliary function is the preferred judging function (extraverted thinking). The INTJ type introverts the dominant perceiving function (introverted intuition). The tertiary function is feeling and the inferior function is extraverted sensing.\\r\\nThe current North American English version of the MBTI Step I includes 93 forced-choice questions (88 are in the European English version). \\"Forced-choice\\" means that a person has to choose only one of two possible answers to each question. The choices are a mixture of word pairs and short statements. Choices are not literal opposites, but chosen to reflect opposite preferences on the same dichotomy. Participants may skip questions if they feel they are unable to choose.\\r\\nUsing psychometric techniques, such as item response theory, the MBTI will then be scored and will attempt to identify the preference, and clarity of preference, in each dichotomy. After taking the MBTI, participants are usually asked to complete a \\"Best Fit\\" exercise (see below) and then given a readout of their Reported Type, which will usually include a bar graph and number (Preference Clarity Index) to show how clear they were about each preference when they completed the questionnaire.\\r\\nDuring the early development of the MBTI, thousands of items were used. Most were eventually discarded because they did not have high \\"midpoint discrimination\\", meaning the results of that one item did not, on average, move an individual score away from the midpoint. Using only items with high midpoint discrimination allows the MBTI to have fewer items on it, but still provide as much statistical information as other instruments with many more items with lower midpoint discrimination.\\r\\nIsabel Myers had noted that people of any given type shared differences, as well as similarities. At the time of her death, she was developing a more in-depth method of measuring how people express and experience their individual type pattern.\\r\\nIn 1987, an advanced scoring system was developed for the MBTI. From this was developed the Type Differentiation Indicator (Saunders, 1989) which is a scoring system for the longer MBTI, Form J,[24] which includes the 290 items written by Myers that had survived her previous item analyses. It yields 20 subscales (five under each of the four dichotomous preference scales), plus seven additional subscales for a new \\"Comfort-Discomfort\\" factor (which purportedly corresponds to the missing factor of neuroticism).\\r\\nThis factor's scales indicate a sense of overall comfort and confidence versus discomfort and anxiety. They also load onto one of the four type dimensions:[25] guarded-optimistic (also T/F), defiant-compliant (also T/F), carefree-worried (also T/F), decisive-ambivalent (also J/P), intrepid-inhibited (Also E/I), leader-follower (Also E/I), and proactive-distractible (also J/P)\\r\\nAlso included is a composite of these called \\"strain\\". There are also scales for type-scale consistency and comfort-scale consistency. Reliability of 23 of the 27 TDI subscales is greater than 0.50, \\"an acceptable result given the brevity of the subscales\\" (Saunders, 1989).\\r\\nIn 1989, a scoring system was developed for only the 20 subscales for the original four dichotomies. This was initially known as \\"Form K\\" or the \\"Expanded Analysis Report\\". This tool is now called the \\"MBTI Step II\\".\\r\\nForm J or the TDI included the items (derived from Myers' and McCaulley's earlier work) necessary to score what became known as \\"Step III\\".[26] (The 1998 MBTI Manual reported that the two instruments were one and the same[27]) It was developed in a joint project involving the following organizations: CPP, the publisher of the whole family of MBTI works; CAPT (Center for Applications of Psychological Type), which holds all of Myers' and McCaulley's original work; and the MBTI Trust, headed by Katharine and Peter Myers. Step III was advertised as addressing type development and the use of perception and judgment by respondents.[28]\\r\\nThe MBTI has been successfully translated and adapted into over 20 languages,[29][30] including reviews by subject-matter experts fluent in the native language, and statistical analysis to check that the questions still measure the same psychological concepts as the original US English questionnaire.[31]\\r\\nThese precepts are generally used in the ethical administration of the MBTI:\\r\\nThe interaction of two, three, or four preferences is known as \\"type dynamics\\". Although type dynamics has received little or no empirical support to substantiate its viability as a scientific theory,[34] Myers and Briggs asserted that for each of the 16 four-preference types, one function is the most dominant and is likely to be evident earliest in life. A secondary or auxiliary function typically becomes more evident (differentiated) during teenaged years and provides balance to the dominant. In normal development, individuals tend to become more fluent with a third, tertiary function during mid-life, while the fourth, inferior function remains least consciously developed. The inferior function is often considered to be more associated with the unconscious, being most evident in situations such as high stress (sometimes referred to as being \\"in the grip\\" of the inferior function).\\r\\nHowever, the use of type dynamics is disputed: in the conclusion of various studies on the subject of type dynamics, James H. Reynierse writes, \\"Type dynamics has persistent logical problems and is fundamentally based on a series of category mistakes; it provides, at best, a limited and incomplete account of type related phenomena\\"; and \\"type dynamics relies on anecdotal evidence, fails most efficacy tests, and does not fit the empirical facts\\". His studies gave the clear result that the descriptions and workings of type dynamics do not fit the real behavior of people. He suggests getting completely rid of type dynamics, because it does not help, but hinders understanding of personality. The presumed order of functions 1 to 4 did only occur in one out of 540 test results.[35]\\r\\nThe sequence of differentiation of dominant, auxiliary, and tertiary functions through life is termed type development. This is an idealized sequence that may be disrupted by major life events.\\r\\nThe dynamic sequence of functions and their attitudes can be determined in the following way:\\r\\nNote that for extraverts, the dominant function is the one most evident in the external world. For introverts, however, it is the auxiliary function that is most evident externally, as their dominant function relates to the interior world.\\r\\nSome examples of whole types may clarify this further. Taking the ESTJ example above:\\r\\nThe dynamics of the ESTJ are found in the primary combination of extraverted thinking as their dominant function and introverted sensing as their auxiliary function: the dominant tendency of ESTJs to order their environment, to set clear boundaries, to clarify roles and timetables, and to direct the activities around them is supported by their facility for using past experience in an ordered and systematic way to help organize themselves and others. For instance, ESTJs may enjoy planning trips for groups of people to achieve some goal or to perform some culturally uplifting function. Because of their ease in directing others and their facility in managing their own time, they engage all the resources at their disposal to achieve their goals. However, under prolonged stress or sudden trauma, ESTJs may overuse their extraverted thinking function and fall into the grip of their inferior function, introverted feeling. Although the ESTJ can seem insensitive to the feelings of others in their normal activities, under tremendous stress, they can suddenly express feelings of being unappreciated or wounded by insensitivity.\\r\\nLooking at the diametrically opposite four-letter type, INFP:\\r\\nThe dynamics of the INFP rest on the fundamental correspondence of introverted feeling and extraverted intuition. The dominant tendency of the INFP is toward building a rich internal framework of values and toward championing human rights. They often devote themselves behind the scenes to causes such as civil rights or saving the environment. Since they tend to avoid the limelight, postpone decisions, and maintain a reserved posture, they are rarely found in executive-director-type positions of the organizations that serve those causes. Normally, the INFP dislikes being \\"in charge\\" of things. When not under stress, the INFP radiates a pleasant and sympathetic demeanor, but under extreme stress, they can suddenly become rigid and directive, exerting their extraverted thinking erratically.\\r\\nEvery type, and its opposite, is the expression of these interactions, which give each type its unique, recognizable signature.\\r\\nThe test is scored by evaluating each answer in terms of what it reveals about the taker. Each question is relevant to one of the following cognitive learning styles. Each is not a polar opposite, but a gradual continuum.\\r\\nThe extraverted types learn best by talking and interacting with others. By interacting with the physical world, extraverts can process and make sense of new information. The introverted types prefer quiet reflection and privacy. Information processing occurs for introverts as they explore ideas and concepts internally.\\r\\nThe second continuum reflects what people focus their attentions on. Sensing types enjoy a learning environment in which the material is presented in a detailed and sequential manner. Sensing types often attend to what is occurring in the present, and can move to the abstract after they have established a concrete experience. Intuitive types prefer a learning atmosphere in which an emphasis is placed on meaning and associations. Insight is valued higher than careful observation, and pattern recognition occurs naturally for intuitive types.\\r\\nThe third continuum reflects a person's decision preferences. Thinking types desire objective truth and logical principles and are natural at deductive reasoning. Feeling types place an emphasis on issues and causes that can be personalized while they consider other people's motives.\\r\\nThe fourth continuum reflects how a person regards complexity. Judging types will thrive when information is organized and structured, and they will be motivated to complete assignments in order to gain closure. Perceiving types will flourish in a flexible learning environment in which they are stimulated by new and exciting ideas. Judging types like to be on time, while perceiving types may be late and/or procrastinate.\\r\\nDavid W. Keirsey mapped four \\"temperaments\\" to the existing MyersÿBriggs system groupings: SP, SJ, NF and NT; this often results in confusion of the two theories. However, the Keirsey Temperament Sorter is not directly associated with the official MyersÿBriggs Type Indicator.[citation needed]\\r\\nMcCrae and Costa based their Five Factor Model (FFM) on Goldberg's Big Five theory.[36] McCrae and Costa[37] present correlations between the MBTI scales and the currently popular Big Five personality constructs measured, for example, by the NEO-PI-R.[38] The five purported personality constructs have been labeled: extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism (emotional instability), although there is not universal agreement on the Big Five theory and the related Five-Factor Model (FFM).[39][40] The following study is based on the results from 267 men followed as part of a longitudinal study of aging. (Similar results were obtained with 201 women.)\\r\\nThese results suggest that the four MBTI scales can be incorporated within the Big Five personality trait constructs, but that the MBTI lacks a measure for emotional stability dimension of the Big Five (though the TDI, discussed above, has addressed that dimension). Emotional stability (or neuroticism) is a predictor of depression and anxiety disorders. These correlations refer to the second letter shown, i.e., the table shows that I and P have negative correlations with extraversion and conscientiousness, respectively, while F and N have positive correlations with agreeableness and openness, respectively.\\r\\nThese findings led McCrae and Costa to conclude that, \\"correlational analyses showed that the four MBTI indices did measure aspects of four of the five major dimensions of normal personality. The five-factor model provides an alternative basis for interpreting MBTI findings within a broader, more commonly shared conceptual framework.\\" However, \\"there was no support for the view that the MBTI measures truly dichotomous preferences or qualitatively distinct types, instead, the instrument measures four relatively independent dimensions.\\"[37]\\r\\nOne study found personality disorders as described by the DSM overall to correlate modestly with I, N, T, and P, although the associations varied significantly by disorder. The only two disorders with significant correlations of all four MBTI dimensions were schizotypal (INTP) and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (ISTJ).[41]\\r\\nThe validity (statistical validity and test validity) of the MBTI as a psychometric instrument has been the subject of much criticism.\\r\\nIt has been estimated that between a third and a half of the published material on the MBTI has been produced for the special conferences of the Center for the Application of Psychological Type (which provide the training in the MBTI, and are funded by sales of the MBTI) or as papers in the Journal of Psychological Type (which is edited and supported by MyersÿBriggs advocates and by sales of the indicator).[42] It has been argued that this reflects a lack of critical scrutiny.[42] Many of the studies that endorse MBTI are methodologically weak or unscientific.[9] A 1996 review by Gardner and Martinko concluded: \\"It is clear that efforts to detect simplistic linkages between type preferences and managerial effectiveness have been disappointing. Indeed, given the mixed quality of research and the inconsistent findings, no definitive conclusion regarding these relationships can be drawn.\\"[9][43]\\r\\nPsychometric specialist Robert Hogan wrote: \\"Most personality psychologists regard the MBTI as little more than an elaborate Chinese fortune cookie?...\\"[44]\\r\\nAs described in the ?Four dichotomies section, Isabel Myers considered the direction of the preference (for example, E vs. I) to be more important than the degree of the preference. Statistically, this would mean that scores on each MBTI scale would show a bimodal distribution with most people scoring near the ends of the scales, thus dividing people into either, e.g., an extroverted or an introverted psychological type. However, most studies have found that scores on the individual scales were actually distributed in a centrally peaked manner, similar to a normal distribution, indicating that the majority of people were actually in the middle of the scale and were thus neither clearly introverted nor extroverted. Most personality traits do show a normal distribution of scores from low to high, with about 15% of people at the low end, about 15% at the high end and the majority of people in the middle ranges. But in order for the MBTI to be scored, a cut-off line is used at the middle of each scale and all those scoring below the line are classified as a low type and those scoring above the line are given the opposite type. Thus, psychometric assessment research fails to support the concept of type, but rather shows that most people lie near the middle of a continuous curve.[8][37][45][46][47] \\"Although we do not conclude that the absence of bimodality necessarily proves that the MBTI developers' theory-based assumption of categorical \\"types\\" of personality is invalid, the absence of empirical bimodality in IRT-based research of MBTI scores does indeed remove a potentially powerful line of evidence that was previously available to \\"type\\" advocates to cite in defense of their position.\\"[47]\\r\\nThe content of the MBTI scales is problematic. In 1991, a National Academy of Sciences committee reviewed data from MBTI research studies and concluded that only the I-E scale has high correlations with comparable scales of other instruments and low correlations with instruments designed to assess different concepts, showing strong validity. In contrast, the S-N and T-F scales show relatively weak validity. The 1991 review committee concluded at the time there was \\"not sufficient, well-designed research to justify the use of the MBTI in career counseling programs\\".[48] This study based its measurement of validity on \\"criterion-related validity (i.e., does the MBTI predict specific outcomes related to interpersonal relations or career success/job performance?).\\"[48] There is insufficient evidence to make claims about utility, particularly of the four letter type derived from a person's responses to the MBTI items.[8]\\r\\nThe accuracy of the MBTI depends on honest self-reporting.[18]:52ÿ53 Unlike some personality questionnaires, such as the 16PF Questionnaire, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, or the Personality Assessment Inventory, the MBTI does not use validity scales to assess exaggerated or socially desirable responses.[10] As a result, individuals motivated to do so can fake their responses,[49] and one study found that the MBTI judgment/perception dimension correlates weakly with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire lie scale.[50] If respondents \\"fear they have something to lose, they may answer as they assume they should.\\"[18]:53 However, the MBTI ethical guidelines state, \\"It is unethical and in many cases illegal to require job applicants to take the Indicator if the results will be used to screen out applicants.\\"[32] The intent of the MBTI is to provide \\"a framework for understanding individual differences, and?... a dynamic model of individual development\\".[51]\\r\\nThe terminology of the MBTI has been criticized as being very \\"vague and general\\",[52] so as to allow any kind of behavior to fit any personality type, which may result in the Forer effect, where people give a high rating to a positive description that supposedly applies specifically to them.[8][16] Others argue that while the MBTI type descriptions are brief, they are also distinctive and precise.[53]:14ÿ15 Some theorists, such as David Keirsey, have expanded on the MBTI descriptions, providing even greater detail. For instance, Keirsey's descriptions of his four temperaments, which he correlated with the sixteen MBTI personality types, show how the temperaments differ in terms of language use, intellectual orientation, educational and vocational interests, social orientation, self-image, personal values, social roles, and characteristic hand gestures.[53]:32ÿ207\\r\\nResearchers have reported that the JP and the SN scales correlate with one another.[37] One factor-analytic study based on (N=1291) college-aged students found six different factors instead of the four purported dimensions, thereby raising doubts as to the construct validity of the MBTI.[54]\\r\\nAccording to Hans Eysenck: \\"The main dimension in the MBTI is called E-I, or extraversion-introversion; this is mostly a sociability scale, correlating quite well with the MMPI social introversion scale (negatively) and the Eysenck Extraversion scale (positively).[55] Unfortunately, the scale also has a loading on neuroticism, which correlates with the introverted end. Thus introversion correlates roughly (i.e. averaging values for males and females) -.44 with dominance, -.24 with aggression, +.37 with abasement, +.46 with counselling readiness, -.52 with self-confidence, -.36 with personal adjustment, and -.45 with empathy. The failure of the scale to disentangle Introversion and Neuroticism (there is no scale for neurotic and other psychopathological attributes in the MBTI) is its worst feature, only equalled by the failure to use factor analysis in order to test the arrangement of items in the scale.\\"[19]\\r\\nThe test-retest reliability of the MBTI tends to be low. Large numbers of people (between 39% and 76% of respondents) obtain different type classifications when retaking the indicator after only five weeks.[8][46][56] In Fortune Magazine (May 15, 2013), an article titled \\"Have we all been duped by the Myers-Briggs Test\\" stated:\\r\\nA second criticism is that the MBTI mistakenly assumes that personality falls into mutually exclusive categories. ... The consequence is that the scores of two people labelled \\"introverted\\" and \\"extroverted\\" may be almost exactly the same, but they could be placed into different categories since they fall on either side of an imaginary dividing line.[57]\\r\\nWithin each dichotomy scale, as measured on Form G, about 83% of categorizations remain the same when people are retested within nine months and around 75% when retested after nine months. About 50% of people re-administered the MBTI within nine months remain the same overall type and 36% the same type after more than nine months.[58] For Form M (the most current form of the MBTI instrument), the MBTI Manual reports that these scores are higher (p.?163, Table 8.6).\\r\\nIn one study, when people were asked to compare their preferred type to that assigned by the MBTI assessment, only half of people chose the same profile.[59]\\r\\nIt has been argued that criticisms regarding the MBTI mostly come down to questions regarding the validity of its origins, not questions regarding the validity of the MBTI's usefulness.[60] Others argue that the MBTI can be a reliable measurement of personality; it just so happens that \\"like all measures, the MBTI yields scores that are dependent on sample characteristics and testing conditions\\".[61]\\r\\nIsabel Myers claimed that the proportion of different personality types varied by choice of career or course of study.[1]:40ÿ51[15] However, researchers examining the proportions of each type within varying professions report that the proportion of MBTI types within each occupation is close to that within a random sample of the population.[8] Some researchers have expressed reservations about the relevance of type to job satisfaction, as well as concerns about the potential misuse of the instrument in labeling people.[8][62]\\r\\nCPP became the exclusive publisher of the MBTI in 1975. They call it \\"the world's most widely used personality assessment\\", with as many as two million assessments administered annually.[63] CPP and other proponents state that the indicator meets or exceeds the reliability of other psychological instruments and cite reports of individual behavior.[64][46][65][excessive citations]\\r\\nAlthough meta-analysis claim support for validity and reliability,[66][67] studies suggest that the MBTI \\"lacks convincing validity data\\" and that it is pseudoscience.[8][37][45][46][68][69]\\r\\nThe MBTI is not a useful predictor of job performance.[8][48][70] As noted above under Precepts and ethics, the MBTI measures preferences, not ability. The use of the MBTI as a predictor of job success is expressly discouraged in the Manual.[18]:78 However, the MBTI continues to be popular because many people lack psychometric sophistication, it is not difficult to understand, and there are many supporting books, websites and other sources which are readily available to the general public.[71]","input":"When was the myers briggs type indicator developed?"},{"output":"began in 2002","context":"The Tacoma Narrows Bridge is a pair of twin suspension bridges that span the Tacoma Narrows strait of Puget Sound in Pierce County, Washington. The bridges connect the city of Tacoma with the Kitsap Peninsula and carry State Route 16 (known as Primary State Highway 14 until 1964) over the strait. Historically, the name \\"Tacoma Narrows Bridge\\" has applied to the original bridge nicknamed \\"Galloping Gertie\\", which opened in July 1940, but collapsed because of aeroelastic flutter four months later, as well as the replacement of the original bridge which opened in 1950 and still stands today as the westbound lanes of the present-day twin bridge complex.\\r\\nThe original Tacoma Narrows Bridge opened on July 1, 1940. It received its nickname \\"Galloping Gertie\\" because of the vertical movement of the deck observed by construction workers during windy conditions. The bridge became known for its pitching deck, and collapsed into Puget Sound the morning of November 7, 1940, under high wind conditions. Engineering issues, as well as the United States' involvement in World War II, postponed plans to replace the bridge for several years; the replacement bridge was opened on October 14, 1950.\\r\\nBy 1990, population growth and development on the Kitsap Peninsula caused traffic on the bridge to exceed its design capacity; as a result, in 1998 Washington voters approved a measure to support building a parallel bridge. After a series of protests and court battles, construction began in 2002 and the new bridge opened to carry eastbound traffic on July 15, 2007, while the 1950 bridge was reconfigured to carry westbound traffic.\\r\\nAt the time of their construction, both the 1940 and 1950 bridges were the third-longest suspension bridges in the world in terms of main span length, behind the Golden Gate Bridge and George Washington Bridge. The 1950 and 2007 bridges are as of 2017 the fifth-longest suspension bridge spans in the United States and the 43rd-longest in the world.\\r\\nTolls were charged on the bridge for the entire four-month service life of the original span, as well as the first 15 years of the 1950 bridge. In 1965, the bridge's construction bonds plus interest were paid off, and the state ceased toll collection on the bridge. Over 40 years later, tolls were reinstated as part of the financing of the twin span, and are presently collected only from vehicles traveling eastbound.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe desire for the construction of a bridge in this location dates back to 1889 with a Northern Pacific Railway proposal for a trestle, but concerted efforts began in the mid-1920s. In 1937, the Washington State legislature created the Washington State Toll Bridge Authority and appropriated $5,000 to study the request by Tacoma and Pierce County for a bridge over the Narrows. The bridge was designed by Leon Moisseiff.\\r\\nThe first Tacoma Narrows Bridge opened to traffic on July 1, 1940. Its main span collapsed into the Tacoma Narrows four months later on November 7, 1940, at 11:00?a.m. (Pacific time) as a result of aeroelastic flutter caused by a 42?mph (68?km/h) wind. The bridge collapse had lasting effects on science and engineering. In many undergraduate physics texts, the event is presented as an example of elementary forced resonance, with the wind providing an external periodic frequency that matched the natural structural frequency, even though the real cause of the bridge's failure was aeroelastic flutter. A contributing factor was its solid sides, not allowing wind to pass through the bridge's deck. Thus, its design allowed the bridge to catch the wind and sway, which ultimately took it down.[2] Its failure also boosted research in the field of bridge aerodynamics and aeroelastic, fields which have influenced the designs of all the world's great long-span bridges built since 1940.\\r\\nNo human life was lost in the collapse of the bridge. The only fatality was a Cocker Spaniel named Tubby, who perished after he was abandoned in a car on the bridge by its owner, Leonard Coatsworth. Professor Frederick Burt Farquharson, an engineer from the University of Washington who had been involved in the design of the bridge, tried to rescue Tubby but was bitten by the terrified dog when he attempted to remove him. The collapse of the bridge was recorded on 16 mm film by Barney Elliott, owner of a local camera shop, and shows Farquharson leaving the bridge after trying to rescue Tubby and making observations in the middle of the bridge. In 1998, The Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".[3] This footage is still shown to engineering, architecture, and physics students as a cautionary tale.\\r\\nThe dismantling of the towers and side spanshaving survived the collapse of the main span, but being damaged beyond repairbegan shortly after the collapse and continued into May 1943. The United States' participation in World War II, as well as engineering and finance issues, delayed plans to replace the bridge.\\r\\nThe current westbound bridge was designed and rebuilt with open trusses, stiffening struts and openings in the roadway to let wind through. It opened on October 14, 1950, and is 5,979 feet (1822?m) long  40 feet (12?m) longer than the first bridge, Galloping Gertie. Local residents nicknamed the new bridge Sturdy Gertie, as the oscillations that plagued the previous design had been eliminated. This bridge along with its new parallel eastbound bridge is currently the fifth-longest suspension bridges in the United States.\\r\\nWhen built, the westbound bridge was the third longest suspension bridge span in the world.[4] Like other modern suspension bridges, the westbound bridge was built with steel plates that feature sharp entry edges rather than the flat plate sides used in the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge (see the suspension bridge article for an example).\\r\\nThe bridge was designed to handle 60,000 vehicles a day. It carried both westbound and eastbound traffic until the eastbound bridge opened on July 15, 2007.[5]\\r\\nIn 1998, voters in several Washington counties approved an advisory measure to create a second Narrows span. Construction of the new span, which carries eastbound traffic parallel to the current bridge, began on October 4, 2002, and was completed in July 2007. The Washington State Department of Transportation collects a toll before entering the eastbound span, at $5.00 for \\"Good to Go\\" account holders with in-vehicle transponders, and a $6.00 toll for cash/credit card customers. The existing span had been free of tolls since 1965.

Cheerleaders are a popular attraction that can give a team more coverage/airtime, popular local support, and increased media image. In 1954, the Baltimore Colts became the first NFL team to have cheerleaders. They were part of the Baltimore Colts Marching Band.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost NFL cheerleading squads are a part-time job. Often, cheerleaders have completed or are attending a university, and continue on to other careers after cheering for one to four seasons. The members participate in practice, training camp, games, appearances, photo shoots, and charity events. Apart from their main duties of cheering during the football games, the cheerleaders have many other responsibilities. Nearly every team member is available for appearances at schools, events, conferences, etc., for a set fee.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn anticipated annual event is the release of each squad's calendar, featuring members for each month in swimsuits or uniforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as being a mainstay of American football culture, the cheerleaders are one of the biggest entertainment groups to regularly perform for the United States Armed Forces overseas with performances and tours being enlisted by the USO. Teams send their variety show, an elite group of their best members, to perform combination shows of dance, music, baton twirling, acrobatics, gymnastics, and more. In February 2007, the Buffalo Bills even sent a squad of eight along with their choreographer into the war zone of Iraq. In 1996, the San Francisco 49ers Cheerleaders and their director  helicoptered into the war inflicted country of Bosnia with the USO and the U.S. Army. The U.S. troops in Korea have been entertained during the holiday season with the USO's Bob Hope Tour. Over the years, the tour has featured NFL cheerleaders from the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, the first male dancers were added to National Football League Cheerleading.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first \\"Battle of the NFL Cheerleaders\\" was held in 1979 in Hollywood, Florida. Two cheerleaders from each cheerleading team compete against other mini-teams in various athletic events. The events include kayaking, 100 yard dash, obstacle courses, and other events. The Minnesota Vikings Cheerleaders took home the title in 1979. In 1980, it was held in Atlantic City, New Jersey and the Washington Redskinettes were the champions. The winners were Shiona Baum and Jeannie Fritz, and each received a car as the grand prize. The competition was resurrected in 2006 by the NFL Network, and was called NFL Cheerleader Playoffs. The playoffs were taped between July 17 and July 21, 2006 at Six Flags New England in Agawam, Massachusetts. Two-person teams of cheerleaders from 25 of the NFL's 32 teams participated in a four-event series of competitions. The first two events tested the cheerleaders' athletic abilities in events like the 100-yard dash, kayaking, tandem cycling, and the obstacle course. The third event was a trivia challenge called \\"Know Your NFL.\\" The final competition was a one-minute dance routine, similar to what they normally perform on NFL sidelines. The San Diego Chargers team (Casie and Shantel) defeated the Atlanta Falcons and St. Louis Rams squads to win the overall championship. The 3 teams finished in a three-way tie, with 210 points. The Chargers were declared the winners based on winning the dance competition.\\r\\n\\r\\nListed by name, with corresponding NFL football team.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2016, six teams do not have cheerleading squads: Buffalo Bills, Chicago Bears, Cleveland Browns, Green Bay Packers, New York Giants, and the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Browns and the Giants are the only NFL teams that have never had cheerleaders, while the other aforementioned teams have had cheer squads in the past. However, there are reports that the Browns did have cheerleaders in 1971, but no records exist.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Buffalo Bills endorsed the officially independent Buffalo Jills from 1966 to 2013; when several cheerleaders sued both the Bills and the Bills organizations, the Jills suspended operations.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nTeams of \\"unofficial\\" cheerleaders began emerging in 2010 for NFL teams that don't have their own dance squad. These unofficial cheerleaders aren't sanctioned by the NFL or any franchise in the NFL and therefore are not allowed to perform at games, represent the football team at any outside functions, or use any of the team's branding or trademarked colors on their uniforms. The teams are sponsored by local businesses, and the cheerleaders perform prior to the game, at tailgate parties, and other local events. Some also attend the local NFL games in uniform, and sit together in their block of season ticket seats. Their audition process, costuming, and choreography are very similar to official NFL cheer teams. Some also produce an annual swimsuit calendar, just like the legitimate cheerleaders. All of the independent teams hope at some point to be embraced by the NFL as \\"official\\" cheerleaders of their local teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nA top honor for an NFL Cheerleader is to be selected as a Pro Bowl Cheerleader. The group is composed of an all-star cheerleader (one from each NFL cheer team) that represents her NFL team at the Pro Bowl in Hawaii. The Pro Bowl Cheerleaders were founded in 1992 and directed by Jay Howarth and Angela King-Twitero. Each year, one squad member from every NFL team is chosen to participate in the collective Pro Bowl cheerleading squad.[28]","input":"What was the first nfl team to have cheerleaders?"},{"output":"Johns Hopkins","context":"Johns Hopkins (May 19, 1795[2] ÿ December 24, 1873) was an American entrepreneur, abolitionist and philanthropist of 19th-century Baltimore, Maryland.\\r\\nHis bequests founded numerous institutions bearing his name, most notably Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Johns Hopkins University (including its academic divisions such as Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health).\\r\\nA biography entitled Johns Hopkins: A Silhouette written by his cousin, Helen Hopkins Thom, was published in 1929 by the Johns Hopkins University Press.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJohns Hopkins was born on May 19, 1795. He was one of eleven children born to Samuel Hopkins (1759ÿ1814) of Crofton, Maryland, and Hannah Janney (1774ÿ1864), of Loudoun County, Virginia.[3] His home was Whitehall, a 500-acre (two km2) tobacco plantation in Anne Arundel County.[4] His first name was inherited from his grandfather Johns Hopkins who received his first name when his mother Margaret Johns married Gerard Hopkins.[3]\\r\\nThe Hopkins family were members of the Society of Friends (Quakers). In 1807 they emancipated their slaves in accordance with their local Society decree, which called for freeing the able-bodied and caring for the others, who would remain at the plantation and provide labor as they could.[5] The second eldest of eleven children, 12-year-old Johns was required to work on the farm, interrupting his formal education. From 1806 to 1809, he likely attended The Free School of Anne Arundel County, which was located in today's Davidsonville, Maryland.\\r\\nIn 1812, at the age of 17, Hopkins left the plantation to work in his uncle Gerard Hopkins' Baltimore wholesale grocery business. While living with his uncle's family, Johns and his cousin, Elizabeth, fell in love; however, the Quaker taboo against marriage of first cousins was especially strong, and neither Johns nor Elizabeth ever married.[4]\\r\\nAs he became able, Hopkins provided for his extended family, both during his life and posthumously through his will. He bequeathed a home for Elizabeth, where she lived until her death in 1889.\\r\\nWhitehall Plantation is located in today's Crofton, Maryland. Its home, since restored and modified, is on Johns Hopkins Road, adjacent to Riedel Road. The heavily landscaped property is surrounded by Walden Golf Course, and bears a historic marker.\\r\\nHopkins' early experiences and successes in business came when he was put in charge of the store while his uncle was away during the War of 1812. After seven years with his uncle, Hopkins went into business together with Benjamin Moore, a fellow Quaker. The business partnership was later dissolved with Moore purporting Hopkins' penchant for capital accumulation as the cause for the divide.[4]\\r\\nAfter Moore's withdrawal, Hopkins partnered with three of his brothers and established Hopkins & Brothers Wholesalers in 1819.[6] The company prospered by selling various wares in the Shenandoah Valley from Conestoga wagons, sometimes in exchange for corn whiskey, which was then sold in Baltimore as \\"Hopkins' Best\\". The bulk of Hopkins' fortune however was made by his judicious investments in myriad ventures, most notably the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O), of which he became a director in 1847 and chairman of the Finance Committee in 1855. He was also President of Merchants' Bank as well as director of a number of other organizations.[7] After a successful career, Hopkins was able to retire at the age of 52 in 1847.[6]\\r\\nA charitable individual, Hopkins put up his own money more than once to not only aid Baltimore City during times of financial crises, but also to twice bail the railroad out of debt, in 1857 and 1873.[8] In 1996, Johns Hopkins ranked 69th in \\"The Wealthy 100: From Benjamin Franklin to Bill Gates - A Ranking of the Richest Americans, Past and Present\\".[9]\\r\\nOne of the first campaigns of the American Civil War was planned at Johns Hopkins' summer estate, Clifton, where he had also entertained a number of foreign dignitaries including the future King Edward VII.[4] Hopkins was a strong supporter of the Union, unlike some Marylanders, who sympathized with and often supported the South and the Confederacy.[10] During the Civil War, Clifton became a frequent meeting place for local Union sympathizers, and federal officials.\\r\\nHopkins' support of Abraham Lincoln also often put him at odds with some of Maryland's most prominent people, particularly Supreme Court Justice Roger B. Taney, who continually opposed Lincoln's presidential decisions, such as his policies of limiting habeas corpus and stationing troops in Maryland. In 1862 Hopkins wrote a letter to Lincoln requesting the President not to heed the detractors' calls and continue to keep soldiers stationed in Maryland. Hopkins also pledged financial and logistic support to Lincoln, in particular the free use of the B&O railway system.[11][12]\\r\\nJohns Hopkins is described as being an \\"abolitionist before the word was even invented\\", having been represented as such both prior to the Civil War period, as well as during the Civil War and Reconstruction Era.[7][13][14] There are several accounts that describe the abolitionist influence Hopkins was privy to as a 12-year-old participant in his parents' emancipation of their family's slaves in 1807.[4] Prior to the Civil War Johns Hopkins worked closely with two of America's most famous abolitionists, Myrtilla Miner[15] and Henry Ward Beecher.[15] During the Civil War Johns Hopkins, being a staunch supporter of Lincoln and the Union, was instrumental in bringing fruition to Lincoln's emancipatory vision.[16]\\r\\nAfter the Civil War and during Reconstruction, Johns Hopkins' stance on abolitionism infuriated many prominent people in Baltimore.[17][18] During the American Reconstruction period to his death[19] his abolitionism was expressed in the documents founding the Johns Hopkins Institutions, and reported in newspaper articles before, during, and after the founding of these institutions. Before the war, there was significant written opposition to his support for Myrtilla Miner's founding of a school for African American females[20] (now the University of the District of Columbia). Similarly, opposition (and some support) was expressed during Reconstruction, such as in 1867, the same year he filed papers incorporating the Johns Hopkins Institutions, when he attempted unsuccessfully to stop the convening of the Maryland Constitutional Convention where the Democratic Party came into power and where a new state Constitution, the Constitution still in effect, was voted to replace the 1864 Constitution of the Radical Republicans previously in power.[18]\\r\\nApparent also in the literature of the times was opposition, and support for, the various other ways he expressed opposition to the racial practices that were beginning to emerge, and re-emerge as well, in the city of Baltimore, the state of Maryland, the nation and in the posthumously constructed and founded institutions that would carry his name,[21] A Baltimore American journalist praised Hopkins for founding three institutions, a university, a hospital and an orphan asylum, specifically for colored children, adding that Hopkins was a \\"man (beyond his times) who knew no race\\" citing his provisions for both blacks and whites in the plans for his hospital. The reporter also pointed to similarities between Benjamin Franklin's and Johns Hopkins' views on hospital care and construction, such as their shared interest in free hospitals and the availability of emergency services without prejudice. This article, first published in 1870, also accompanied Hopkins' obituary in the Baltimore American as a tribute in 1873. Cited in many of the newspaper articles on him during his lifetime and immediately after his death were his provisions of scholarships for the poor, and quality health services for the underserved, the poor without regard to their age, sex and color, the colored children asylum and other orphanages, the mentally ill and convalescents.\\r\\nLiving his entire adult life in Baltimore, Hopkins made many friends among the city's social elite, many of them Quakers. One of these friends was George Peabody, who was also born in 1795, and who in 1857 founded the Peabody Institute in Baltimore. Other examples of public giving were evident in the city, as public buildings housing free libraries, schools and foundations sprang up along the city's widening streets. On the advice of Peabody, some believe, Hopkins determined to use his great wealth for the public good.\\r\\nThe Civil War had taken its toll on Baltimore, however, as did the yellow fever and cholera epidemics that repeatedly ravaged the nation's cities, killing 853 in Baltimore in the summer of 1832 alone. Hopkins was keenly aware of the city's need for medical facilities, particularly in light of the medical advances made during the war, and in 1870 he made a will setting aside seven million dollars  mostly in B&O stock  for the incorporation of a free hospital and affiliated medical and nurse's training colleges, as well as an orphanage for colored children and a university. Many board members were on both boards. The hospital and orphan asylum would each be overseen by the 12-member hospital board of trustees, and the university by the 12-member university board of trustees. Johns Hopkins' bequest was used to posthumously found the Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum[22] first as he requested, in 1875; the Johns Hopkins University in 1876; the Johns Hopkins Press, the longest continuously operating academic press in America, in 1878; the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in 1889; the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine 1893; and the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1916.[citation needed]\\r\\nJohns Hopkins' views on his bequests, and on the duties and responsibilities of the two boards of trustees, especially the hospital board of trustees led by his friend and fellow Quaker Francis King, were formally stated primarily in four documents, the incorporation papers filed in 1867, his instruction letter to the hospital trustees dated March 12, 1873, his will, which was quoted from extensively in his Baltimore Sun obituary,[23] and in his will's two codicils, one dated 1870 and the other dated 1873.[24]\\r\\nIn these documents, Hopkins also made provisions for scholarships to be provided for poor youths in the states where Johns Hopkins had made his wealth, as well as assistance to orphanages other than the one for African American children, to members of his family, to those he employed, black and white, his cousin Elizabeth, and, again, to other institutions for the care and education of youths regardless of color and the care of the elderly, and the ill, including the mentally ill, and convalescents.\\r\\nJohn Rudolph Niernsee, one of the most famous architects of the time, designed the orphan asylum and helped to design the Johns Hopkins Hospital. The original site for the Johns Hopkins University had been chosen personally by Hopkins. According to his will, it was to be located at his summer estate, Clifton. However, a decision was made not to found the university there. The property, now owned by the city of Baltimore, is the site of a golf course and a park named Clifton Park. While the Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum was founded by the hospital trustees, the other institutions that carry the name of \\"Johns Hopkins\\" were founded under the administration of the first president of the Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Hospital, Daniel Coit Gilman and his successors.\\r\\nAs per Johns Hopkins' instruction letter, the Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum (JHCCOA)[25] was founded first, in 1875, a year before Gilman's inauguration, now the founding date of the university. The construction of the asylum, including its educational and living facilities, was praised by The Nation and the Baltimore American, the latter stating that the orphan asylum was a place where \\"nothing was wanting that could benefit science and humanity\\". As was done for other Johns Hopkins Institutions, it was planned after visits and correspondence with similar institutions in Europe and America.\\r\\nThe Johns Hopkins Orphan Asylum opened with 24 boys and girls. Under Gilman and his successors, this orphanage was later changed to serve as an orphanage and training school for black female orphans principally as domestic workers, and next as an \\"orthopedic convalescent\\" home and school for \\"colored crippled\\" children and orphans. The asylum was eventually closed in 1924 nearly fifty years after it opened, and was never reopened.\\r\\nAs per Hopkins' March 1873 Instruction Letter, the School of Nursing was founded alongside the Hospital in 1889 by the hospital board of trustees in consultation with Florence Nightingale. Both the nursing school and the hospital were founded over a decade after the founding of the orphan asylum in 1875 and the university in 1876. Hopkins' instruction letter explicitly stated his vision for the hospital; first, to provide assistance to the poor of \\"all races\\", no matter the indigent patient's \\"age, sex or color\\"; second, that wealthier patients would pay for services and thereby subsidize the care provided to the indigent; third, that the hospital would be the administrative unit for the orphan asylum for African American children, which was to receive $25,000 in annual support out of the hospital's half of the endowment; and fourth, that the hospital and orphan asylum should serve 400 patients and 400 children respectively, fifth, that the hospital should be part of the university, and, sixth, that religion but not sectarianism should be an influence in the hospital.\\r\\nBy the end of Gilman's presidency, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Press, Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum had been founded, the latter by the trustees, and the others in the order listed under the Gilman administration. \\"Sex\\" and \\"color\\" were major issues in the early history of the Johns Hopkins Institutions. The founding of the School of Nursing is usually linked to Johns Hopkins' statements in his March 1873 instruction letter to the trustees that \\"I desire you to establish, in connection with the hospital, a training school for female nurses. This provision will secure the services of women competent to care for those sick in the hospital wards, and will enable you to benefit the whole community by supplying it with a class of trained and experienced nurses\\".\\r\\nWomen's most well known success after the founding of the nursing school was their requirement that they be allowed to attend Johns Hopkins medical institutions after they provided funds that made possible the opening of the School of Medicine in 1893. Five African American women were among the first women enrolled in the Johns Hopkins University's undergraduate school in 1970. Furthermore, Kelly Miller and Frederick Scott were the first persons of African descent to attend the Johns Hopkins University's graduate and undergraduate schools, respectively. Frederick Scott was the first graduate of African descent from Johns Hopkins University, and he, Robert Gamble, and Kenyan-born James Nabwangu were the first graduates of African descent from Johns Hopkins University's undergraduate school, and Johns Hopkins' medical schools (1967) respectively. Those employees holding jobs in the service sector are those of African descent who have the longest and most continuous history at the Johns Hopkins Institutions.\\r\\nFollowing Hopkins' death, The Baltimore Sun wrote a lengthy obituary that closed thus: \\"In the death of Johns Hopkins a career has been closed which affords a rare example of successful energy in individual accumulations, and of practical beneficence in devoting the gains thus acquired to the public.\\" His contribution to the university that has become his greatest legacy was, by all accounts, the largest philanthropic bequest ever made to an American educational institution.\\r\\nJohns Hopkins' Quaker faith and his early life experiences, in particular the 1807 emancipation, had a lasting influence throughout his life and his posthumous legacy as a businessman, railroad man, banker, investor, ship owner,[26] philanthropist and a founder of several Institutions. From very early on, Johns Hopkins had looked upon his wealth as a trust to benefit future generations. He is said to have told his gardener that, \\"like the man in the parable, I have had many talents given to me and I feel they are in trust. I shall not bury them but give them to the lads who long for a wider education\\"; his philosophy quietly anticipated Andrew Carnegie's much publicized Gospel of Wealth by more than 25 years.[4]\\r\\nIn 1973 Johns Hopkins was cited prominently in the Pulitzer Prize winning book The Americans: The Democratic Experience by Daniel Boorstin, former head of the Library of Congress. From November 14, 1975 to September 6, 1976 a portrait of Hopkins was displayed at the National Portrait Gallery in an exhibit on the democratization of America based on Boorstin's book. In 1989, the United States Postal Service issued a $1 postage stamp in Johns Hopkins' honor, as part of the Great Americans series.[27]","input":"Who is the founder of johns hopkins hospital?"},{"output":"averages 100ÿ1000","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nsee Species.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeahorse (also written sea-horse and sea horse) is the name given to 45 species of small marine fishes in the genus Hippocampus. \\"Hippocampus\\" comes from the Ancient Greek hippokampos (??ϫ? hipp܇kampos), itself from  hippos (?? hppos) meaning \\"horse\\" and kampos (?? kmpos) meaning \\"sea monster\\".[3][4] Having a head and neck suggestive of a horse, seahorses also feature segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled prehensile tail.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeahorses are mainly found in shallow tropical and temperate saltwater throughout the world, from about 45S to 45N [6]. They live in sheltered areas such as seagrass beds, estuaries, coral reefs, and mangroves. Four species are found in Pacific waters from North America to South America. In the Atlantic, H. erectus ranges from Nova Scotia to Uruguay. H. zosterae, known as the dwarf seahorse, is found in the Bahamas.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonies have been found in European waters such as the Thames Estuary.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree species live in the Mediterranean Sea: H. guttulatus (the long-snouted seahorse), H. hippocampus (the short-snouted seahorse), and H. fuscus (the sea pony). These species form territories; males stay within 1?m2 (11?sq?ft) of habitat, while females range about one hundred times that.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeahorses range in size from 1.5 to 35.5?cm (0.6 to 14.0?in).[8]  They are named for their equine appearance with bent necks and long snouted heads followed by their distinctive trunk and tail. Although they are bony fish, they do not have scales, but rather thin skin stretched over a series of bony plates, which are arranged in rings throughout their bodies. Each species has a distinct number of rings.[9] The armor of bony plates also protects them against predators, and because of this outer skeleton, they no longer have ribs.[10] Seahorses swim upright, another characteristic not shared by their close pipefish relatives, which swim horizontally. Razorfish are the only other fish that swim vertically. They swim upright propelling themselves by using the dorsal fin. The pectoral fins located on either side of the head are used for maneuvering. They lack the caudal fin typical of fishes. Their prehensile tail can only be unlocked in the most extreme conditions. They are adept at camouflage with the ability to grow and reabsorb spiny appendages depending on their habitat.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnusual among fish, a seahorse has a flexible, well-defined neck. It also sports a crown-like spine or horn on its head, termed a \\"coronet,\\" which is distinct for each species.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeahorses swim very poorly, rapidly fluttering a dorsal fin and using pectoral fins (located behind their eyes) to steer. The slowest-moving fish in the world is H. zosterae (the dwarf seahorse), with a top speed of about 5?ft (1.5?m) per hour.[13]  Since they are poor swimmers, they are most likely to be found resting with their prehensile tails wound around a stationary object. They have long snouts, which they use to suck up food, and their eyes can move independently of each other like those of a chameleon.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnatomical evidence, supported by molecular, physical, and genetic evidence, demonstrates seahorses are highly modified pipefish. The fossil record of seahorses, however, is very sparse. The best known and best studied fossils are specimens of H. guttulatus (though literature more commonly refers to them under the synonym of H. ramulosus), from the Marecchia River Formation of Rimini Province, Italy, dating back to the Lower Pliocene, about 3 million years ago. The earliest known seahorse fossils are of two pipefish-like species, H. sarmaticus and H. slovenicus from the coprolitic horizon of Tunjice Hills, a middle Miocene lagerst?tte in Slovenia dating back about 13 million years.[15] Molecular dating finds that pipefish and seahorses diverged  during the Late Oligocene. This has led to speculation that seahorses evolved in response to large areas of shallow water, newly created as the result of tectonic events. The shallow water would have allowed the expansion of seagrass habitats that selected for the camouflage offered by the seahorses upright posture.[16] These tectonic changes occurred in the western Pacific Ocean, pointing to an origin there, with molecular data suggesting two later, separate invasions of the Atlantic Ocean.[17] In 2016, a study published in Nature found the seahorse genome to be the most rapidly evolving fish genome studied so far.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male seahorse is equipped with a pouch on the ventral, or front-facing, side of the tail. When mating, the female seahorse deposits up to 1,500 eggs in the male's pouch. The male carries the eggs for 9 to 45 days until the seahorses emerge fully developed, but very small. The young are then released into the water, and the male often mates again within hours or days during the breeding season.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore breeding, seahorses may court for several days. Scientists believe the courtship behavior synchronizes the animals' movements and reproductive states so the male can receive the eggs when the female is ready to deposit them. During this time, they may change color, swim side by side holding tails or grip the same strand of sea grass with their tails, and wheel around in unison in what is known as a \\"predawn dance\\". They eventually engage in a \\"true courtship dance\\" lasting about 8 hours, during which the male pumps water through the egg pouch on his trunk which expands and opens to display its emptiness. When the females eggs reach maturity, she and her mate let go of any anchors and drift upward snout-to-snout, out of the seagrass, often spiraling as they rise. They interact for about 6 minutes, reminiscent of courtship. The female then swims away until the next morning, and the male returns to sucking up food through his snout.[20] The female inserts her ovipositor into the males brood pouch and deposits dozens to thousands of eggs. As the female releases her eggs, her body slims while his swells. Both animals then sink back into the seagrass and she swims away.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring fertilization in Hippocampus kuda the brood pouch was found to be open only for six seconds while egg deposition occurred. During this time seawater entered the pouch where the spermatozoa and eggs meet in a seawater milieu. This hyperosmotic environment facilitates sperm activation and motility. The fertilization is therefore regarded as being physiologically external within a physically internal environment after the closure of the pouch.[22] It is believed that this protected form of fertilization reduces sperm competition among males. Within the Syngnathidae (pipefishes and seahorses) protected fertilization has not been documented in the pipefishes but the lack of any distinct differences in the relation of testes size to body size suggests that pipefishes may also have evolved mechanisms for more efficient fertilization with reduced sperm competition.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fertilized eggs  are then embedded in the pouch wall and become surrounded by a spongy tissue.[24] The male supplies the eggs with prolactin, the same hormone responsible for milk production in pregnant mammals. The pouch provides oxygen, as well as a controlled environment incubator. Though the egg yolk contribute nourishment to the developing embryo, the male sea horses contribute additional nutrients such as energy-rich lipids and also calcium to allow them to build their skeletal system, by secreting them into the brood pouch that are absorbed by the embryos. Further they also offer immunological protection, osmoregulation, gas exchange and waste transport [25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eggs then hatch in the pouch, where the salinity of the water is regulated; this prepares the newborns for life in the sea.[20][26][27] Throughout gestation, which in most species requires two to four weeks, his mate visits him daily for morning greetings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of young released by the male seahorse averages 100ÿ1000 for most species, but may be as low as 5 for the smaller species, or as high as 2,500. When the fry are ready to be born, the male expels them with muscular contractions. He typically gives birth at night and is ready for the next batch of eggs by morning when his mate returns. Like almost all other fish species, seahorses do not nurture their young after birth. Infants are susceptible to predators or ocean currents which wash them away from feeding grounds or into temperatures too extreme for their delicate bodies. Less than 0.5% of infants survive to adulthood, explaining why litters are so large. These survival rates are actually fairly high compared to other fish, because of their protected gestation, making the process worth the great cost to the father. The eggs of most other fish are abandoned immediately after fertilization.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nReproduction is energetically costly to the male. This brings into question why the sexual role reversal even takes place. In an environment where one partner incurs more energy costs than the other, Bateman's principle suggests that the lesser contributor takes the role of the aggressor. Male seahorses are more aggressive and sometimes fight for female attention. According to Amanda Vincent of Project Seahorse, only males tail-wrestle and snap their heads at each other. This discovery prompted further study of energy costs. To estimate the females direct contribution, researchers chemically analyzed the energy stored in each egg. To measure the burden on the males, oxygen consumption was used. By the end of incubation, the male consumed almost 33% more oxygen than before mating. The study concluded that the female's energy expenditure while generating eggs is twice that of males during incubation, confirming the standard hypothesis.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy the male seahorse (and other members of the Syngnathidae) carries the offspring through gestation is unknown, though some researchers believe it allows for shorter birthing intervals, in turn resulting in more offspring.[28] Given an unlimited number of ready and willing partners, males have the potential to produce 17% more offspring than females in a breeding season. Also, females have time-outs from the reproductive cycle 1.2 times longer than those of males. This seems to be based on mate choice, rather than physiology. When the females eggs are ready, she must lay them in a few hours or eject them into the water column. Making eggs is a huge cost to her physically, since they amount to about a third of her body weight. To protect against losing a clutch, the female demands a long courtship. The daily greetings help to cement the bond between the pair.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough seahorses are not known to mate for life, many species form pair bonds that last through at least the breeding season. Some species show a higher level of mate fidelity than others.[30][31] However, many species readily switch mates when the opportunity arises. H. abdominalis and H. breviceps have been shown to breed in groups, showing no continuous mate preference. Many more species' mating habits have not been studied, so it is unknown how many species are actually monogamous, or how long those bonds actually last.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough monogamy within fish is not common,  it does appear to exist for some. In this case, the mate-guarding hypothesis may be an explanation. This hypothesis states, males remain with a single female because of ecological factors that make male parental care and protection of offspring especially advantageous.[33] Because the rates of survival for newborn seahorses are so low, incubation is essential. Though not proven, males could have taken on this role because of the lengthy period the females require to produce their eggs. If males incubate while females prepare the next clutch (amounting to a third of body weight), they can reduce the interval between clutches.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeahorses feed on small crustaceans floating in the water or crawling on the bottom. With excellent camouflage and patience, seahorses ambush prey that floats within striking range. Mysid shrimp and other small crustaceans are favorites, but some seahorses have been observed eating other kinds of invertebrates and even larval fish. In a study of seahorses, the distinctive head morphology was found to give it a hydrodynamic advantage that creates minimal interference while approaching an evasive prey. Therefore, the seahorse has the ability to come within a very close range of the copepods on which they prey.[34][35] After successfully closing in on the prey without alerting it, the sea horse gives an upward thrust  rapidly rotates the head aided by large tendons that store and release elastic energy, to bring its long snout close to the prey. This  step is crucial for prey capture as suction only works with the mouth at a close range. This two-phase prey capture mechanism is termed pivot-feeding.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile feeding, they produce a distinctive click each time a food item is ingested. The same clicks are heard with social interactions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause data is lacking on the sizes of the various seahorse populations, as well as other issues including how many seahorses are dying each year, how many are being born, and the number used for souvenirs, there is insufficient information to assess their risk of extinction, and the risk of losing more seahorses remains a concern. Some species, such as the Paradoxical Seahorse, H. paradoxus,[37] may already be extinct. Coral reefs and seagrass beds are deteriorating, reducing viable habitats for seahorses.[38] Additionally, bycatch in many areas causes high cumulative effects on seahorses, with an estimated 37 million individuals being removed annually over 21 countries.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile many aquarium hobbyists keep them as pets, seahorses collected from the wild tend to fare poorly in home aquaria. Many eat only live foods such as brine shrimp and are prone to stress, which damages their immune systems and makes them susceptible to disease.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, however, captive breeding has become more popular. Such seahorses survive better in captivity, and are less likely to carry diseases. They eat frozen mysidacea (crustaceans) that are readily available from aquarium stores,[40]  and do not experience the stress of moving out of the wild. Although captive-bred seahorses are more expensive, they take no toll on wild populations.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeahorses should be kept in an aquarium with low flow and placid tank mates. They are slow feeders, so fast, aggressive feeders will leave them without food.[40]  Seahorses can coexist with many species of shrimp and other bottom-feeding creatures. Gobies also make good tank-mates. Keepers are generally advised to avoid eels, tangs, triggerfish, squid, octopus, and sea anemones.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nWater quality is very important for the survival of seahorses in an aquarium. They are delicate species which should not be added to a new tank. The water parameters are recommended to be as follows although these fish may acclimatise to different water over time: \\r\\n\\r\\nA water-quality problem will affect fish behaviour and can be shown by clamped fins, reduced feeding, erratic swimming, and gasping at the surface.[42]  Seahorses swim up and down, as well as using the length of the aquarium. Therefore, the tanks should ideally be twice as deep as the length of the adult seahorse.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimals sold as \\"freshwater seahorses\\" are usually the closely related pipefish, of which a few species live in the lower reaches of rivers. The supposed true \\"freshwater seahorse\\" called H. aimei is not a valid species, but a synonym sometimes used for Barbour's and hedgehog seahorses. The latter, which is often confused with the former, can be found in estuarine environments, but is not actually a freshwater fish.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeahorse populations are thought to be endangered as a result of overfishing and habitat destruction. Despite a lack of scientific studies or clinical trials,[44][45] the consumption of seahorses is widespread in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily in connection with impotence, wheezing, nocturnal enuresis, and pain, as well as labor induction.[46]  Up to 20 million seahorses may be caught each year to be sold for such uses.[47] Preferred species of seahorses include H. kellogii, H. histrix, H. kuda, H. trimaculatus, and H. mohnikei.[46] Seahorses are also consumed by the Indonesians, the central Filipinos, and many other ethnic groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nImport and export of seahorses has been controlled under CITES since 15 May 2004. However, Indonesia, Japan, Norway, and South Korea have chosen to opt out of the trade rules set by CITES.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem may be exacerbated by the growth of pills and capsules as the preferred method of ingesting seahorses. Pills are cheaper and more available than traditional, individually tailored prescriptions of whole seahorses, but the contents are harder to track.  Seahorses once had to be of a certain size and quality before they were accepted by TCM practitioners and consumers. Declining availability of the preferred large, pale, and smooth seahorses has been offset by the shift towards prepackaged preparations, which makes it possible for TCM merchants to sell previously unused, or otherwise undesirable juvenile, spiny, and dark-coloured animals. Today, almost a third of the seahorses sold in China are packaged, adding to the pressure on the species.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nDried seahorse retails from US$600 to $3000 per kilogram, with larger, paler, and smoother animals commanding the highest prices. In terms of value based on weight, seahorses retail for more than the price of silver and almost that of gold in Asia.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the newest overall taxonomic review[50] of the genus Hippocampus with further new species and partial taxonomic review,[51][52][53] the number of recognized species in this genus is considered to be 45 (retrieved Aug 2018):\\r\\n\\r\\nPygmy seahorses are less than 15 millimeters (0.59?in) tall and 17 millimeters (0.67?in) wide members of the genus. Previously the term was applied exclusively to the species H. bargibanti but since 1997, discoveries have made this term obsolete. The species H. minotaur, H. denise, H. colemani, H. pontohi, H. severnsi, H. satomiae, H. waleananus, and H. japapigu have been described. Other species that are believed to be unclassified have also been reported in books, dive magazines and on the Internet. They can be distinguished from other species of seahorse by their 12 trunk rings, low number of tail rings (26ÿ29), the location in which young are brooded in the trunk region of males and their extremely small size.[54] Molecular analysis (of ribosomal RNA) of 32 Hippocampus species found that H. bargibanti belongs in a separate clade from other members of the genus and therefore that the species diverged from the other species in the \\"ancient\\" past.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost pygmy seahorses are well camouflaged and live in close association with other organisms including colonial hydrozoans (Lytocarpus and Antennellopsis), coralline algae (Halimeda) sea fans (Muricella, Annella, Acanthogorgia). This combined with their small size accounts for why most species have only been noticed and classified since 2001.[54][56]","input":"How many seahorses are born at one time?"},{"output":"Eurasia","context":"","input":"Where did the red fox come from originally?"},{"output":"Lockheed C-5 Galaxy","context":"The Lockheed C-5 Galaxy is a large military transport aircraft originally designed and built by Lockheed, and now maintained and upgraded by its successor, Lockheed Martin. It provides the United States Air Force (USAF) with a heavy intercontinental-range strategic airlift capability, one that can carry outsize and oversize loads, including all air-certifiable cargo. The Galaxy has many similarities to its smaller Lockheed C-141 Starlifter predecessor, and the later Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. The C-5 is among the largest military aircraft in the world.\\r\\nThe C-5 Galaxy's development was complicated, including significant cost overruns, and Lockheed suffered significant financial difficulties. Shortly after entering service, cracks in the wings of many aircraft were discovered and the C-5 fleet was restricted in capability until corrective work was completed. The C-5M Super Galaxy is an upgraded version with new engines and modernized avionics designed to extend its service life beyond 2040.\\r\\nThe USAF has operated the C-5 since 1969. In that time, the airlifter supported US military operations in all major conflicts including Vietnam, Iraq, Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, as well as allied support, such as Israel during the Yom Kippur War and operations in the Gulf War. The Galaxy has also been used to distribute humanitarian aid and disaster relief, and supported the US Space Shuttle program.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1961, several aircraft companies began studying heavy jet transport designs that would replace the Douglas C-133 Cargomaster and complement Lockheed C-141 Starlifters. In addition to higher overall performance, the United States Army wanted a transport aircraft with a larger cargo bay than the C-141, whose interior was too small to carry a variety of their outsized equipment. These studies led to the \\"CX-4\\" design concept, but in 1962 the proposed six-engine design was rejected, because it was not viewed as a significant advance over the C-141.[3] By late 1963, the next conceptual design was named CX-X. It was equipped with four engines, instead of six engines in the earlier CX-4 concept. The CX-X had a gross weight of 550,000 pounds (249,000?kg), a maximum payload of 180,000?lb (81,600?kg) and a speed of Mach?0.75 (500?mph or 805?km/h). The cargo compartment was 17.2?ft (5.24?m) wide by 13.5 feet (4.11?m) high and 100?ft (30.5?m) long with front and rear access doors.[3] To meet the power and range specifications with only four engines required a new engine with dramatically improved fuel efficiency.\\r\\nThe criteria were finalized and an official request for proposal was issued in April 1964 for the \\"Heavy Logistics System\\" (CX-HLS) (previously CX-X). In May 1964, proposals for aircraft were received from Boeing, Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, and Martin Marietta. General Electric, Curtiss-Wright, and Pratt & Whitney submitted proposals for the engines. After a downselect, Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed were given one-year study contracts for the airframe, along with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for the engines.[5] All three of the designs shared a number of features. The cockpit was placed well above the cargo area to allow for cargo loading through a nose door. The Boeing and Douglas designs used a pod on the top of the fuselage containing the cockpit, while the Lockheed design extended the cockpit profile down the length of the fuselage, giving it an egg-shaped cross section. All of the designs had swept wings, as well as front and rear cargo doors allowing simultaneous loading and unloading.[6] Lockheed's design featured a T-tail, while the designs by Boeing and Douglas had conventional tails.[7][8]\\r\\nThe Air Force considered Boeing's design to be better than that of Lockheed, but Lockheed's proposal was the lowest total cost bid.[9] Lockheed was selected the winner in September 1965, then awarded a contract in December 1965.[7][10] General Electric's TF39 engine was selected in August 1965 to power the new transport plane.[7] At the time GE's engine concept was revolutionary, as all engines beforehand had a bypass ratio of less than two-to-one, while the TF39 promised and would achieve a ratio of eight-to-one, which had the benefits of increased engine thrust and lower fuel consumption.[11][12]\\r\\nThe first C-5A Galaxy (serial number 66-8303) was rolled out of the manufacturing plant in Marietta, Georgia, on 2 March 1968.[13] On 30 June 1968, flight testing of the C-5A began with the first flight, flown by Leo Sullivan, with the call sign \\"eight-three-oh-three heavy\\". Flight tests revealed that the aircraft exhibited a higher drag divergence Mach number than predicted by wind tunnel data. The maximum lift coefficient measured in flight with the flaps deflected 40-degrees was higher than predicted (2.60 vs. 2.38), but was lower than predicted with the flaps deflected 25 degrees (2.31 vs. 2.38) and with the flaps retracted (1.45 vs. 1.52).[14]\\r\\nAircraft weight was a serious issue during design and development. At the time of the first flight, the weight was below the guaranteed weight, but by the time of the delivery of the 9th aircraft, had exceeded guarantees.[14] In July 1969, during a fuselage upbending test, the wing failed at 128% of limit load, which is below the requirement that it sustain 150% of limit load. Changes were made to the wing, but during a test in July 1970, it failed at 125% of limit load. A passive load reduction system, involving uprigged ailerons was incorporated, but the maximum allowable payload was reduced from 220,000 to 190,000?lb (100,000 to 86,000?kg). At the time, it was predicted that there was a 90% probability that no more than 10% of the fleet of 79 airframes would reach their fatigue life of 19,000 hours without cracking of the wing.[14]\\r\\nCost overruns and technical problems of the C-5A were the subject of a congressional investigation in 1968 and 1969.[16][17] The C-5 program has the dubious distinction of being the first development program with a one billion dollar overrun.[10][18] Due to the C-5's troubled development, the Department of Defense abandoned Total Package Procurement.[19] In 1969, Henry Durham raised concerns about the C-5 production process with Lockheed, his employer. Subsequently, Durham was transferred and subjected to abuse until he resigned. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) substantiated some of his charges against Lockheed. Later, the American Ethical Union honored Durham with the Elliott-Black Award.[20] The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Management Systems, Ernest Fitzgerald, was another person whose fostering of public accountability was unwelcome.[21]\\r\\nUpon completion of testing in December 1969, the first C-5A was transferred to the Transitional Training Unit at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Lockheed delivered the first operational Galaxy to the 437th Airlift Wing, Charleston Air Force Base, SC, in June 1970. Due to higher than expected development costs, in 1970 there were public calls for the government to split the substantial losses that Lockheed was experiencing.[22] Production was nearly brought to a halt in 1971 due to Lockheed going through financial difficulties, due in part to the C-5 Galaxy's development as well as a civilian jet liner, the Lockheed L-1011.[23] The U.S. government gave loans to Lockheed to keep the company operational.[24]\\r\\nIn the early 1970s, NASA considered the C-5 for the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft role, to transport the Space Shuttle to Kennedy Space Center. However, they rejected it in favor of the Boeing 747, in part due to the 747's low-wing design.[25] In contrast, the Soviet Union chose to transport its shuttles using the high-winged An-225,[26] which derives from the An-124, which is similar in design and function to the C-5.\\r\\nDuring static and fatigue testing cracks were noticed in the wings of several aircraft,[18] and as a consequence the C-5A fleet was restricted to 80% of maximum design loads. To reduce wing loading, load alleviation systems were added to the aircraft.[27] By 1980, payloads were restricted to as low as 50,000?lb (23,000?kg) for general cargo during peacetime operations. A $1.5 billion program, known as H-Mod,[28] to re-wing the 76 completed C-5As to restore full payload capability and service life began in 1976.[29][30] After design and testing of the new wing design, the C-5As received their new wings from 1980 to 1987.[31][32] During 1976, numerous cracks were also found in the fuselage along the upper fuselage on the centerline, aft of the refueling port, extending back to the wing. The cracks required a redesign to the hydraulic system for the visor, the front cargo entry point.[33]\\r\\nIn 1974, Iran, then having good relations with the United States, offered $160 million to restart C-5 production to enable Iran to purchase aircraft for their own air force,[34][35] in a similar climate as to their acquisition of F-14 Tomcat fighters.[36] However no C-5 aircraft were ever ordered by Iran, as the prospect was firmly halted by the Iranian Revolution in 1979.[37][38]\\r\\nAs part of President Ronald Reagan's military policy, funding was made available for expansion of the USAF's airlift capability. With the C-17 program still some years from completion, Congress approved funding for a new version of the C-5, the C-5B, in July 1982 to expand airlift capacity.[39][40][41] The first C-5B was delivered to Altus Air Force Base in January 1986. In April 1989, the last of 50 C-5B aircraft was added to the 77 C-5As in the Air Force's airlift force structure. The C-5B includes all C-5A improvements and numerous additional system modifications to improve reliability and maintainability.[42]\\r\\nIn 1998, the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) began upgrading the C-5's avionics to include a glass cockpit, navigation equipment, and a new autopilot system.[43] Another part of the C-5 modernization effort is the Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP). The program will mainly replace the engines with newer, more powerful ones.[44]\\r\\nA total of 52 C-5s are contracted to be modernized, consisting of 49 B-, two C- and one A-model aircraft through the Reliability Enhancement and Re-Engining Program (RERP). The program features over 70 changes and upgrades, including the newer General Electric engines.[45][46] Three C-5s underwent RERP for testing purposes. Low-rate initial production started in August 2009 with Lockheed reaching full production in May 2011.[citation needed] 22 C-5M Super Galaxies have been completed as of August 2014.[47] The RERP upgrade program is to be completed in early 2018.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs of 2014[update] Lockheed is investigating drag reduction by plasma-heating of turbulent transonic airflow in critical points, saving overall weight by reducing fuel consumption. The Air Force Research Laboratory is looking at shape-memory alloy for speed dependent vortex generators.[48]\\r\\nThe C-5 is a large high-wing cargo aircraft with a distinctive high T-tail fin (vertical) stabilizer, and with four TF39 turbofan engines mounted on pylons beneath wings that are swept 25 degrees. Similar in layout to its smaller predecessor, the C-141 Starlifter, the C-5 has 12 internal wing tanks and is equipped for aerial refueling. Above the plane-length cargo deck, it provides an upper deck for flight operations and for seating 75 passengers including the embarked loadmaster crew, all who face to the rear of the aircraft during flight. Full-open(able) bay doors at both nose and tail enable \\"drive-through\\" loading and unloading of cargo.[49]\\r\\nThe cargo hold of the C-5 is one foot longer than the entire length of the first powered flight by the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk.[50] For its voracious consumption of fuel and its maintenance and reliability issues[51] the Galaxy's aircrews have nicknamed it FRED, for: Fucking[N 1] Ridiculous, Economic/Environmental Disaster.[51]\\r\\nTakeoff and landing distance requirements for the plane at maximum-load gross weight are 8,300?ft (2,500?m) and 4,900?ft (1,500?m), respectively. Its high flotation main landing gear provides 28 wheels to distribute gross weight on paved or earth surfaces. The rear main landing gear can be made to caster to make a smaller turning radius, and rotates 90 degrees after takeoff before being retracted. \\"Kneeling\\" landing gear permits lowering the aircraft when parked, thereby presenting the cargo deck at truck-bed height to facilitate loading and unloading operations.[54]\\r\\nThe C-5 features a Malfunction Detection Analysis and Recording (MADAR) system to identify errors throughout the aircraft.[33]\\r\\nThe cargo compartment is 121?ft (37?m) long, 13.5?ft (4.1?m) high, and 19?ft (5.8?m) wide, or just over 31,000?cu?ft (880?m3). It can accommodate up to 36 463L master pallets or a mix of palletized cargo and vehicles. The nose and aft cargo-bay doors open the full width and height of the cargo bay to maximize efficient loading of oversized equipment. Full width ramps enable loading double rows of vehicles from either end of the cargo hold.[49]\\r\\nThe C-5 Galaxy is capable of moving nearly every type of military combat equipment, including such bulky items as the Army armored vehicle launched bridge (AVLB), at 74 short tons (67?t), from the United States to any location on the globe;[49] and of accommodating up to six Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters or five Bradley Fighting Vehicles at one time.[32]\\r\\nThe first C-5A was delivered to the USAF on 17 December 1969. Wings were built up in the early 1970s at Altus AFB, Oklahoma; Charleston AFB, South Carolina; Dover AFB, Delaware; and Travis AFB, California. The C-5's first mission was on 9 July 1970, in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War.[55] C-5s were used to transport equipment and troops, including Army tanks and even some small aircraft, throughout the later years of the US action in Vietnam.[56] In the final weeks of the war, prior to the Fall of Saigon, several C-5s were involved in evacuation efforts. During one such mission a C-5A crashed while transporting a large number of orphans, with over 140 killed.[57][58]\\r\\nC-5s have also been used to deliver support and reinforce various US allies over the years. During the Yom Kippur war in 1973, multiple C-5s and C-141 Starlifters delivered critical supplies of ammunition, replacement weaponry and other forms of aid to Israel, the US effort was named as Operation Nickel Grass.[59][60] The C-5 Galaxy's performance in Israel was such that the Pentagon began to consider further purchases.[61] The C-5 was regularly made available to support American allies, such as the British-led peacekeeper initiative in Zimbabwe in 1979.[62]\\r\\nOn 24 October 1974, the Space and Missile Systems Organization successfully conducted an Air Mobile Feasibility Test where a C-5A Galaxy aircraft air dropped an 86,000?lb Minuteman ICBM from 20,000?ft over the Pacific Ocean. The missile descended to 8,000?ft before its rocket engine fired. The 10-second engine burn carried the missile to 20,000?ft again before it dropped into the ocean. The test proved the feasibility of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile from the air. Operational deployment was discarded due to engineering and security difficulties, though the capability was used as a negotiating point in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.[63][64] Aircraft 69-0014, \\"Zero-One-Four\\" used in the test was retired to the Air Mobility Command Museum at Dover Air Force Base.[65]\\r\\nThe C-5 has been used for several unusual functions. During the development of the secretive stealth fighter, the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, Galaxies were often used to carry partly disassembled aircraft, leaving no exterior signs as to their cargo.[66] The C-5 remains the largest aircraft to operate in the Antarctic,[67] capable of operating from Williams Field near McMurdo Station.[68] The C-5 Galaxy was a major supply asset in the international coalition operations in 1990-91 against Iraq in the Gulf War.[69][70][71] C-5s have routinely delivered relief aid and humanitarian supplies to areas afflicted with natural disasters or crisis; multiple flights were made over Rwanda in 1994.[72]\\r\\nThe wings on the C-5As were replaced during the 1980s to restore full design capability.[31] The USAF took delivery of the first C-5B on 28 December 1985 and the final one in April 1989.[73] The reliability of the C-5 fleet has been a continued issue throughout its lifetime,[74][75] however the C-5M upgrade program seeks in part to address this issue.[44] Their strategic airlift capacity has been a key logistical component of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Following an incident during Operation Iraqi Freedom where one C-5 was damaged by a projectile, the installation of defensive systems has become a stated priority.[76]\\r\\nThe C-5 AMP and RERP modernization programs plan to raise mission-capable rate to a minimum goal of 75%.[44] Over the next 40 years, the U.S. Air Force estimates the C-5M will save over $20 billion.[77] The first C-5M conversion was completed on 16 May 2006 and C-5Ms began test flights at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in June 2006.[77] The USAF decided to convert remaining C-5Bs and C-5Cs into C-5Ms with avionics upgrades and re-engining in February 2008.[78] The C-5As will receive only the avionics upgrades.[78][79]\\r\\nIn response to Air Force plans to retire older C-5 aircraft, Congress implemented legislation that set limits on retirement plans for C-5As in 2003.[80] As of November 2013, 45 C-5As have been retired, 11 have been scrapped, parts of one (A/C 66-8306) are now a cargo load trainer at Lackland AFB, Texas and one was sent to the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC) for tear down and inspection to evaluate structural integrity and estimate the remaining life for the fleet.[81]\\r\\nThe U.S. Air Force began to receive refitted C-5M aircraft in December 2008.[82] Full production of C-5Ms began in the summer of 2009.[83] In 2009, the Congressional ban on the retirement of C-5s was overturned.[84] The Air Force seeks to retire one C-5A for each 10 new C-17s ordered.[85] In October 2011, the 445th Airlift Wing based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base replaced all remaining C-5s with C-17s.[86] The C-5M reached initial operating capability (IOC) on 24 February 2014 with 16 aircraft delivered.[87]\\r\\nOn 13 September 2009, a C-5M set 41 new records and flight data was submitted to the National Aeronautic Association for formal recognition. The C-5M had carried a payload of 176,610?lb (80,110?kg) to over 41,100?ft (12,500?m) in 23 minutes, 59 seconds. Additionally, 33 time to climb records at various payload classes were set, and the world record for greatest payload to 6,562?ft (2,000?m) was broken. The aircraft was in the category of 551,200 to 661,400?lb (250,000 to 300,000?kg) with a takeoff weight of 649,680?lb (294,690?kg) including payload, fuel, and other equipment.[88]\\r\\nOn 18 July 2017, C-5s based at Dover were ordered to stand down so maintenance crews could determine the cause for some nose landing gear failing.[89]\\r\\nThe C-5A is the original version of the C-5. From 1969 to 1973, 81 C-5As were delivered to U.S. Air Force bases. Due to cracks found in the wings in the mid-1970s, the cargo weight was restricted. To restore the C-5's full capability, the wing structure was redesigned. A program to install new strengthened wings on 77 C-5As was conducted from 1981 to 1987. The redesigned wing made use of a new aluminum alloy that did not exist during the original production.[90] As of August 2016, there were 10 A-models in service flown by the Air Force Reserve Command 433d Airlift Wing at Lackland AFB, Texas, and 439th Airlift Wing at Westover ARB, Massachusetts.[91] The last operational C-5A was retired on 7 September 2017.[92]\\r\\nThe C-5B is an improved version of the C-5A. It incorporated all modifications and improvements made to the C-5A with improved wings, simplified landing gear, upgraded TF-39-GE-1C turbofan engines and updated avionics. 50 of the new variant were delivered to the U.S. Air Force from 1986 to 1989.[93][94]\\r\\nThe C-5C is a specially modified variant for transporting large cargo. Two C-5s (68-0213 and 68-0216) were modified to have a larger internal cargo capacity to accommodate large payloads, such as satellites. The major modifications were the removal of the rear passenger compartment floor, splitting the rear cargo door in the middle, and installing a new movable aft bulkhead further to the rear.[95] The official C-5 technical manual refers to the version as C-5A(SCM) Space Cargo Modified. Modifications also included adding a second inlet for ground power, which can feed any power-dependent equipment that may form part of the cargo. The two C-5Cs are operated by U.S. Air Force crews for DOD spacecraft programs and NASA, and are stationed at Travis AFB, California.[96] Both 68-0213 and 68-0216 completed the Avionics Modernization Program by January 2007. 68-0213 is being upgraded in RERP to the C-5M (SCM) standard.[97][not in citation given]\\r\\nFollowing a study showing 80% of the C-5 airframe service life remaining,[98] Air Mobility Command (AMC) began an aggressive program to modernize all remaining C-5Bs and C-5Cs and many of the C-5As. The C-5 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) began in 1998 and includes upgrading avionics to Global Air Traffic Management compliance, improving communications, new flat panel displays, improving navigation and safety equipment, and installing a new autopilot system. The first flight of a C-5 with AMP (85-0004) occurred on 21 December 2002.[99]\\r\\nThe Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP) began in 2006. It includes new General Electric F138-GE-100 (CF6-80C2) engines, pylons and auxiliary power units, upgrades to aircraft skin and frame, landing gear, cockpit and pressurization systems.[44][100] Each CF6 engine produces 22% more thrust (50,000?lbf or 220?kN),[101] providing a 30% shorter takeoff, a 38% higher climb rate to initial altitude, an increased cargo load and a longer range.[specify][44][102] Upgraded C-5s are designated C-5M Super Galaxy.[103]\\r\\nLockheed also planned a civilian version of the C-5 Galaxy, the L-500, the company designation also used for the C-5 itself. Both passenger and cargo versions of the L-500 were designed. The all-passenger version would have been able to carry up to 1,000 travelers, while the all-cargo version was predicted to be able to carry typical C-5 volume for as little as 2 cents per ton-mile (in 1967 dollars).[104] Although some interest was expressed by carriers, no orders were placed for either L-500 version, due to operational costs caused by low fuel efficiency, a significant concern for a profit-making carrier, even before the oil crisis of the 1970s, keen competition from Boeing's 747, and high costs incurred by Lockheed in developing the C-5 and later, the L-1011 which led to the governmental rescue of the company.[105]\\r\\nLockheed proposed a twin body C-5 as a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft to counter the Conroy Virtus, but the design was turned down in favor of the Boeing 747.[citation needed]\\r\\nThree C-5 Galaxy aircraft have been lost in crashes along with two class-A losses resulting from ground fire, with a combined total of 169 fatalities. At least two other C-5 crashes have resulted in major airframe damage, but the aircraft were repaired and returned to service.\\r\\nData from Quest for Performance,[124] International Directory of Military Aircraft,[125] and USAF fact sheet[126]\\r\\nGeneral characteristics\\r\\nPerformance","input":"What is the largest plane in the us air force?"},{"output":"James Monroe Building","context":"This is a list of tallest buildings in Richmond, Virginia.

The United States Department of the Army, a component of the United States Department of Defense (DoD), controls the cemetery.\\r\\nThe national cemetery was established during the Civil War on the grounds of Arlington House, which had been the estate of Confederate general Robert E. Lee's wife Mary Anna (Custis) Lee (a great-granddaughter of Martha Washington). The Cemetery, along with Arlington House, Memorial Drive, the Hemicycle, and the Arlington Memorial Bridge, form the Arlington National Cemetery Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 2014.[2][3] Like some other federal installations in Arlington County, it has a Washington, D.C. mailing address.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn recent years, the Department of the Army has expanded the cemetery onto public lands and restricted bicycle use within the cemetery. Some of these actions have been controversial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Washington Parke Custis, grandson of Martha Washington and adopted son of George Washington, acquired the land that now is Arlington National Cemetery in 1802, and began construction of Arlington House, which was ultimately named after the village of Arlington, Gloucestershire, England, where his family was originally from. The estate passed to Custis' daughter, Mary Anna, who had married United States Army officer Robert E. Lee. Custis' will gave a \\"life inheritance\\" to Mary Lee, allowing her to live at and run Arlington Estate for the rest of her life but not enabling her to sell any portion of it.[4] Upon her death, the Arlington estate passed to her eldest son, George Washington Custis Lee.[4]\\r\\nWhen Virginia seceded from the Union after the start of the American Civil War at Fort Sumter, Robert E. Lee resigned his commission on April 20, 1861, and took command of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Virginia, later becoming commander of the Army of Northern Virginia.[5] On May 7, troops of the Virginia militia occupied Arlington and Arlington House.[6] With Confederate forces occupying Arlington's high ground, the capital of the Union was left in an untenable military position.[7] Although unwilling to leave Arlington House, Mary Lee believed her estate would soon be recaptured by federal soldiers. So she buried many of her family treasures on the grounds and left for her sister's estate at Ravensworth in Fairfax County, Virginia, on May 14.[8][9] On May 3, General Winfield Scott ordered Brigadier General Irvin McDowell to clear Arlington and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, of all troops not loyal to the United States.[10] McDowell occupied Arlington without opposition on May 24.[11]\\r\\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War, most military personnel who died in battle near Washington, D.C., were buried at the United States Soldiers' Cemetery in Washington, D.C., or Alexandria Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia, but by late 1863 both were nearly full.[12] On July 16, 1862, Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead, and put the U.S. Army Quartermaster General in charge of this program.[12] In May 1864, Union forces suffered large numbers of dead in the Battle of the Wilderness. Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs ordered that an examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery. Within weeks, his staff reported that Arlington Estate was the most suitable property in the area.[12] The property was high and free from floods (which might unearth graves), it had a view of the District of Columbia, and it was aesthetically pleasing. It was also the home of the leader of the armed forces of the Confederate States of America, and denying Robert E. Lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration.[13] The first military burial at Arlington, for William Henry Christman, was made on May 13, 1864,[14] close to what is now the northeast gate in Section 27.[15] However, Meigs did not formally authorize establishment of burials until June 15, 1864.[16] Arlington did not desegregate its burial practices until President Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order 9981 on July 26, 1948.[17]\\r\\nThe government acquired Arlington at a tax sale in 1864 for $26,800, equal to $420,000 today.[18] Mrs. Lee had not appeared in person but rather had sent an agent, attempting to pay the $92.07 in property taxes (equal to $1,400 today) assessed on the estate in a timely manner.[19] The government turned away her agent, refusing to accept the tendered payment. In 1874, Custis Lee, heir under his grandfather's will passing the estate in trust to his mother, sued the United States claiming ownership of Arlington. On December 9, 1882, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5ÿ4 in Lee's favor in United States v. Lee, deciding that Arlington had been confiscated without due process.[19][20] After that decision, Congress returned the estate to him, and on March 3, 1883, Custis Lee sold it back to the government for $150,000 (equal to $3,342,727 in 2018) at a signing ceremony with Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln.[18][21] The land then became a military reservation.[22]\\r\\nPresident Herbert Hoover conducted the first national Memorial Day ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery, on May 30, 1929.[23]\\r\\nBeginning in 1863, the federal government used the southern portion of the land now occupied by the cemetery as a settlement for freed slaves, giving the name of \\"Freedmen's Village\\" to the land. The government constructed rental houses that 1,100 to 3,000 freed slaves eventually occupied while farming 1,100 acres (450?ha) of the estate and receiving schooling and occupational training during the Civil War and after War ended.[21][24] However, after the land became part of a military reservation, the government asked the Villagers to leave. When some remained, John A. Commerford, the Superintendent of Arlington National Cemetery, asked the Army's Quartermaster General in 1887 to close the Village on the grounds that people living in the Village had been taking trees at night from the cemetery for use as firewood.[22][25] The Quartermaster General and the Secretary of War then approved Commerford's request.[22] The last of the Village's residents departed after the 56th United States Congress appropriated $75,000 in 1900 to settle the government's debts to them.[22]\\r\\nWith limited space but large numbers of World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, and other veterans dying and wanting to be buried at Arlington, the need for additional burial space at the cemetery became a pressing issue. In 1991, Cemetery superintendent John C. Metzler, Jr., implemented a $1.4 million plan to clear a former 13-acre (5.3?ha) parking lot to create space for about 9,000 new grave sites.[26]\\r\\nThe Cemetery received the authority to transfer 12 acres (4.9?ha) of woodland from the NPS-controlled Arlington House in 1996[27][28] and 2001,[29][30] 37 acres (15?ha) of land in 1999 from the DoD that was the site of the Navy Annex building,[31][32] 8 acres (3.2?ha) of land in 1999 from the Department of the Army that was part of Fort Myer,[31][33] 4 acres (1.6?ha) of land from Arlington County's Southgate Road right-of-way in 2004,[34] and just under 10 acres (4.0?ha) of land from Fort Myer in 2005.[29][35][36]\\r\\nIn 2007, Metzler implemented the Millennium Project, a $35 million expansion plan to begin utilizing the Arlington woodland, Fort Myer, and Navy Annex land. The project also included converting 40 acres (16?ha) of unused space and 4 acres (16,000?m2) of maintenance property on the cemetery grounds into burial space in 2006 and 2007 to allow an additional 26,000 graves and 5,000 inurnments. The Millennium Project expanded the cemetery's physical boundaries for the first time since the 1960s, and was the largest expansion of burial space at the site since the American Civil War.[35] Several environmental and historical preservation groups criticized Metzler's plans, as did the NPS and the manager of Arlington House.[35][36][37]\\r\\nOn March 26, 2013, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (Public Law 113-6) appropriated to the DoD $84 million to plan, design and construct the Millennium Project.[38] The legislation additionally appropriated to the DoD $19 million to study, plan and design a future expansion of the cemetery's burial space.[38]\\r\\nIn 1998, a Congressional proposal to expand the cemetery onto land that the Navy Annex and Fort Myer then occupied led to concerns that Arlington County officials had not been properly consulted, leading to the withdrawal of the proposal.[39] However, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65), which was enacted into law during October 1999, subsequently required the Secretary of Defense to transfer to the Secretary of the Army administrative jurisdiction of the 36 acres (15?ha) Navy Annex property. The Act required the Secretary of Defense to demolish the Annex's buildings and prepare the property for use as part of the cemetery, while requiring the Secretary of the Army to incorporate the Annex property into the cemetery.[32]\\r\\nIn January 2013, the County Manager of Arlington County, Virginia, and the Executive Director of the Army National Military Cemeteries (consisting of Arlington National Cemetery and the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery)[40] signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Arlington County Board and the Department of the Army to expand the cemetery even further. Under the tentative plan, Arlington County would give up the easement for Southgate Road (which lies between the Navy Annex property and the cemetery's 2012 boundary), and obtain a narrow easement along the southwest border of the Navy Annex site for a new Southgate Road. In exchange, the Department of Defense would give the Navy Annex parking lot to the county.\\r\\nThe Army would also transfer land west of South Joyce Street to Columbia Pike to Arlington County. Additionally, the Commonwealth of Virginia would convey to the cemetery roughly the northern half of the Virginia Department of Transportation land bounded by South Joyce Street, Columbia Pike, and South Washington Boulevard. The cloverleaf interchange between Columbia Pike and S. Washington Blvd. would be eliminated, and the hairpin turn in Columbia Pike straightened, to provide a safer, more natural exit from S. Washington Blvd. onto Columbia Pike. Although exact acreages were not specified and the plan depended upon the Commonwealth of Virginia's cooperation, the MOU if implemented would have created a more contiguous plot of land for the cemetery.[41]\\r\\nHowever, in December 2016, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328) authorized the Secretary of the Army to expand the cemetery by acquiring from Arlington County and the Commonwealth of Virginia by condemnation and other means properties near the cemetery that contain the Southgate Road, South Joyce Street and Washington Boulevard right-of-ways, including the Washington Boulvard-Columbia Pike interchange.[42] The Army then informed the Arlington County government in June 2017 that the Army would no longer pursue a land exchange with the County. The Army told the County that the Army would use the entire Navy Annex site to expand the cemetery and would acquire for the cemetery about 5 acres (2.0?ha) of public land that Arlington County then owned. The Army would also acquire for the cemetery expansion about 7 acres (2.8?ha) of land located between Columbia Pike and Interstate 395 that the Commonwealth of Virginia then owned.[43]\\r\\nOn February 22, 1995, officials of the United States Department of the Interior and the United States Department of the Army signed an agreement to transfer from Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial, to the Army a part of Arlington Woods, which was located in Section 29 of the NPS at Arlington National Cemetery between Arlington House and Fort Myer.[44] The property transfer, which involved 12 acres (4.9?ha) of NPS land, was intended to permit Metzler to start expanding the cemetery beyond its existing boundaries.[28][45]\\r\\nEnvironmentalists expressed concerns that the agreement would result in the partial destruction of the 24-acre (9.7?ha) remnant of a historically important stand of native trees.[37][46] A historical marker near the woodland notes that, while visiting Arlington House in 1825, Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette had warned Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis, the wife of George Washington Parke Custis: \\"Cherish these forest trees around your mansion. Recollect how much easier it is to cut a tree than to make one grow.\\" The marker further notes that the Virginia Native Plant Society had recognized the woodland as being one of the best examples of old growth terraced gravel forest remaining in Virginia.[47]\\r\\nOn September 23, 1996, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law 104-201) authorized the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Secretary of the Army all of the land in Section 29 that was within an \\"Arlington National Cemetery Interment Zone\\" and some of the land in the Section that was within a \\"Robert E. Lee Memorial Preservation Zone\\".[27][28]\\r\\nOn March 5, 1998, the NPS, which is a component of the Department of the Interior, informed the National Capital Planning Commission that it wanted to transfer only 4 acres (1.6?ha) to the cemetery, rather than the 12 acres (4.9?ha) that the 1995 agreement had described. In response, Metzler stated: \\"I was surprised. But we will continue to work with the Department of Interior and see what happens.\\"[28]\\r\\nOn July 12, 1999, the NPS issued a Federal Register notice that announced the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) for the transfer.[45][48] The EA stated that the Interment Zone contained the oldest and largest tract of climax eastern hardwood forest in Arlington County. This forest was the same type that once covered the Arlington estate, and had regenerated from trees that were present historically. A forestry study determined that a representative tree was 258 years old. The Interment Zone was also determined to contain significant archeological and cultural landscape resources, in addition to those in the Preservation Zone.[48] The EA described four alternative courses of action.[48]\\r\\nIn contrast to the NPS's March 1998 statement to the National Capital Planning Commission, the 1999 EA stated that the preferred alternative (Alternative 1) would transfer to the cemetery approximately 9.6 acres (3.9?ha), comprising most of the Interment Zone and the northern tip of the Preservation Zone.[48] Another alternative (Alternative 3) would transfer to the cemetery the 12 acres (4.9?ha) Interment Zone, while keeping the 12.5 acres (5.1?ha) Preservation Zone under NPS jurisdiction.[48] The EA concluded: \\"Public Law 104-201 directed the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Secretary of the Army jurisdiction over the Interment Zone, which is the plan in Alternative 3. Adoption of any of the other alternatives would require legislative action to amend the existing law.\\"[48]\\r\\nOn December 28, 2001, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-107) repealed the \\"obsolete\\" part of Public Law 104-201 that had authorized the transfer of portions of Section 29 to the Secretary of the Army.[30] The new legislation required the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Secretary of the Army within 30 days the approximately 12 acres (4.9?ha) Interment Zone.[30] The transfer therefore involved the entire 12 acres (4.9?ha) of NPS land that the 1995 agreement and Alternative 3 in the 1999 EA had described.\\r\\nThe 2001 legislation required the Secretary of the Army to use the Interment Zone for in-ground burial sites and columbarium.[30] In addition, the legislation required the Secretary of the Interior to manage the remainder of Section 29 \\"in perpetuity to provide a natural setting and visual buffer for Arlington House, the Robert E. Lee Memorial.\\"[30]\\r\\nOn December 12, 2012, the United States Army Corps of Engineers asked for comments on a draft EA that described a further expansion of Arlington National Cemetery as part of the Millennium Project.[49][50][51] The 2012 draft EA was intended to implement conversion into burial space of the 17 acres (6.9?ha) of Ft. Myer grounds as well as 10 acres (4.0?ha) of Section 29 woodland. The draft EA described seven alternatives. The preferred alternative (Alternative E) called for the removal of about one-half of the 1,700 trees with a diameter of 6 inches (15?cm) or greater on the site. About 640 of the trees were within a 135-year-old portion of Arlington Woods.[52] The draft EA concluded: \\"Based on the evaluation of environmental impacts....., no significant impacts would be expected from the Proposed Action; therefore, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared and a Finding of No Significant Impact will be prepared and signed.\\"[52]\\r\\nOn March 12, 2013, the Corps of Engineers released a revised EA for the Millennium Project.[53][54] The revised EA contained copies of a number of public comments on the draft EA that had criticized the project and parts of the EA while proposing alternative locations for new military burials near the cemetery and elsewhere.[55] However, the Department of Forestry of the Commonwealth of Virginia found that, based on information in the draft EA, the project would not have a significant adverse impact on the Commonwealth's forest resources.[56] The revised EA did not change the preferred alternative (Alternative E) or the Army's plans to prepare and sign the Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) that the draft EA had described.[57]\\r\\nOn June 5, 2013, after reviewing 100 public comments that it had received on the revised EA, the Corps of Engineers released a final EA and a signed FONSI for the Millennium Project.[58][59] The Final EA and the FONSI retained Alternative E as the preferred alternative.[58] The final EA stated that, of the 905 trees to be removed, 771 trees were healthy native trees that had diameters between 6 and 41 inches.[60][61] The project would remove approximately 211 trees from a less than 2.63 acres (1.06?ha) area containing a portion of a 145-year-old forest that stood within the property boundaries of a historic district that a National Register of Historic Places nomination form for Arlington House had described in 1966.[60][62] About 491 trees would be removed from an area of trees that was approximately 105 years old.[60] Approximately 203 trees with ages of 50 to 145 years would be removed from a former picnic area.[60] At a public hearing on July 11, 2013, the National Capital Planning Commission approved the site and building plans for the Millennium Project.[63]\\r\\nOn June 9, 2010, United States Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh reprimanded the cemetery's superintendent, John C. Metzler, Jr., and his deputy, Thurman Higgenbotham, after a DOD inspector general's report revealed that cemetery officials had placed the wrong headstones on tombs, buried coffins in shallow graves, and buried bodies on top of one another.[64] Metzler, who had already announced his intention to retire on July 2, 2010, admitted some mistakes had been made but denied allegations of widespread or serious mismanagement.[64] The investigation also found that cemetery employees were burdened in their day-to-day work by \\"dysfunctional management, lack of established policy and procedures, and an overall unhealthy organizational climate.\\"[65][66] Both Metzler and Higgenbotham retired soon after the investigation commenced.[67]\\r\\nIn March 2011, as a result of the problems discovered, Kathryn Condon, the recently appointed Executive Director of the Army National Military Cemeteries, announced that the cemetery's staff had been increased from 102 to 159. She added that the cemetery was also acquiring additional equipment because, \\"They didn't have the proper equipment to do the job really to the standard they needed to do.\\"[68]\\r\\nThe mismanagement controversy included a limitation on mass media access to funerals, which also proved controversial. Until 2005, the cemetery's administration gave free access, with the family's permission, to the press to cover funerals at the cemetery. According to the Washington Post in 2008, the cemetery gradually imposed increasing restrictions on media coverage of funerals beginning about 2005.[69]\\r\\nAfter the cemetery's management controversy began to end, the Army appointed Patrick K. Hallinan the acting superintendent of the cemetery in June 2010. He was promoted permanently to the position in October 2010. Hallinan had previously worked for the Office of Field Programs in the National Cemetery Administration, an agency of the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs. In that capacity, Hallinan had oversight of 131 national cemeteries, national cemetery policy, procedures, and operations.[70] Hallinan was promoted to Executive Director of the Army National Military Cemeteries upon the retirement of Kathryn Condon in spring 2014.[71]\\r\\nIn May 2014, Hallinan stepped down and was replaced by Jack E. Lechner, Jr. as superintendent of the cemetery. Lechner had been a funeral director for 10 years in the private sector before joining the U.S. Army. He rose to the rank of colonel (retiring in November 2011), having spent 2008 to 2010 as chief of the Supply Division of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, overseeing the equipping of Iraqi and Afghanistan national security forces. Since June 2010, he had served as executive officer and deputy superintendent of the cemetery under Hallinan.[71]\\r\\nThe Army removed Lechner as superintendent of the cemetery in early August 2015 after a performance review \\"called into question his ability to serve successfully as a senior leader\\". The Army declined to elaborate further and appointed Hallinan to be the temporary Cemetery superintendent until the Army could find a successor.[72]\\r\\nBeginning in 1992, the Morrill Worcester wreath company in Harrington, Maine, had a surplus at the end of the holiday season. Recalling a boyhood trip to the cemetery, Worcester donated to the cemetery 5,000 wreaths to honor the cemetery's dead, with the help of volunteers and a local trucking company. After thirteen years of similar donations, in 2005 a photo of snowy gravestones covered with wreaths at the cemetery received widespread circulation on the Internet. Thousands of people called Worcester, wanting to replicate the wreath-laying service at their own veteran cemeteries.[73]\\r\\nIn 2006, over 150 different locations simultaneously held ceremonies with Arlington's. Additionally, the project had its first \\"Veterans Honor Parade\\" with \\"Patriot Guard Riders\\" who escorted the wreaths from Maine to the cemetery. The parade, which is held each year, now visits schools, monuments, veterans' homes and communities along its route.[73]\\r\\nAt the end of 2006, Worcester's company supplied wreaths to over 230 state and national cemeteries and veterans monuments across the country.[74] Assisted by veterans and truckers, Worcester established in 2007 a nonprofit organization named \\"Wreaths Across America\\".[73] In December 2008, the United States Senate agreed to a resolution that designated December 13, 2008, as \\"Wreaths Across America Day\\".[75]\\r\\nIn 2014, volunteers placed over 700,000 memorial wreaths at 1,000 locations in the United States and overseas, including the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor, Bunker Hill, Valley Forge, and the National September 11 Memorial at the World Trade Center site in New York City. During that year, volunteers were able to place wreaths in all sections of the cemetery for the first time.[73] In 2016, this number increased to 1.2 million wreaths being placed at more than 1,230 cemeteries across the nation.[76]\\r\\nConflict of interest charges have been made against Wreaths Across America because this charity has an exclusive for-profit supplier, Worcestor Wreath Company, also run by the Morrill family in the same town. The charity's purchases of wreaths from this company account for most of the company's revenue and profits. In late 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported serious conflicts of interest with potential malfeasance in governance and contracting.[77] In 2015 alone the WSJ reported profits of over $1 million on sales of over 850,000 wreaths to the charity raising concerns about competitive bidding, reporting that several competitors had asked to bid significantly below the price offered by Worcestor Wreath Company but were denied access.\\r\\nDuring May and June 2014, the cemetery celebrated the 150th anniversary of its founding with a month-long series of events, tours, and lectures.[78] During these celebrations, cemetery officials formally re-designated the Old Amphitheater as the James Tanner Amphitheater. James R. Tanner was a Union Army officer who lost both legs during the war. He later became a War Department stenographer, and recorded much of the early evidence in the investigation into the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. He later was active in the Grand Army of the Republic, a Union Army veterans group. Tanner is buried a few yards from the amphitheater.[79]\\r\\nThe Cemetery is divided into 70 sections, with some sections in the southeast and western part of the cemetery reserved for future expansion.[80] Section 60, in the southeast part of the cemetery, is the burial ground for military personnel killed in the Global War on Terror since 2001.[81] Section 21, also known as the Nurses Section, is the area of Arlington National Cemetery where many nurses are buried and is the site of the SpanishÿAmerican War Nurses Memorial and the Nurses Memorial.[82] Another sectionChaplains Hillincludes monuments to Jewish, Protestant, and Roman Catholic military chaplains. In 1901, Confederate soldiers buried at the Soldiers' Home and various locations within Arlington were reinterred in a Confederate section that was authorized by Congress in 1900. On June 4, 1914, the United Daughters of the Confederacy dedicated the Confederate Memorial designed by Moses Ezekiel. Upon his death in 1917, Ezekiel was buried at the base of the monument as he was a veteran of the Confederate army.[83] All Confederate headstones in this section are peaked rather than rounded.[84] More than 3,800 former slaves, called \\"Contrabands\\" during the Civil War, are buried in Section 27. Their headstones are designated with the word \\"Civilian\\" or \\"Citizen\\".[85]\\r\\nThe United States Department of Veterans Affairs oversees the National Cemetery Administration's orders[86] for placement of inscriptions and faith emblems at no charge to the estate of the deceased, submitted with information provided by the next of kin[87] that is placed on upright marble headstones or columbarium niche covers. The Department of Veterans Affairs currently offers 63 authorized faith emblems for placement on markers to represent the deceased's faith.[88] This number has grown in recent years due to legal challenges to policy.[89]\\r\\nPrior to 2007, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) did not allow the use of the pentacle as an \\"emblem of belief\\" on tombstones in military cemeteries. This policy was changed following an out-of-court settlement on April 23 following a series of lawsuits by the family of Patrick Stewart against the VA.[90][91][92]\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 2001, privately purchased markers were permitted in the cemetery. The sections in which the cemetery permitted such markers are nearly filled and the cemetery generally does not allow new burials in these sections.[93] Nevertheless, the older sections of the cemetery have a wide variety of private markers placed prior to 2001, including an artillery piece.[94]\\r\\nThere are 32 Commonwealth war dead burials and some headstones are Commonwealth War Graves Commission style.\\r\\nThe Tomb of the Unknowns is part of the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater. The Memorial Amphitheater has hosted state funerals and Memorial Day and Veterans Day ceremonies. Ceremonies are also held for Easter. About 5,000 people attend these holiday ceremonies each year. The structure is mostly built of Imperial Danby marble from Vermont. The Memorial Display room, between the amphitheater and the Tomb of the Unknowns, uses Botticino stone, imported from Italy. The amphitheater was the result of a campaign by Ivory Kimball to construct a place to honor America's servicemen/women. Congress authorized the structure on March 4, 1913. Woodrow Wilson laid the cornerstone for the building on October 15, 1915. The cornerstone contained 15 items including a Bible and a copy of the Constitution.[95]\\r\\nBefore the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater was completed in 1921, important ceremonies were held at what is now known as the \\"Old Amphitheater.\\" This structure sits where Robert E. Lee once had his gardens. The amphitheater was built in 1868 under the direction of Civil War General John A. Logan. Gen. James A. Garfield was the featured speaker at the Decoration Day dedication ceremony, May 30, 1868, later being elected as President of the United States 1881. The amphitheater has an encircling colonnade with a latticed roof that once supported a web of vines. The amphitheater has a marble dais, known as \\"the rostrum\\", which is inscribed with the U.S. national motto found on the Great Seal of the United States, E pluribus unum (\\"Out of many, one\\"). The rostrum was designed by General Montgomery C. Meigs, then Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army.[96] The amphitheater seats 1,500 people and has hosted speakers such as William Jennings Bryan.[97]\\r\\nThe Tomb of the Unknown Soldier stands on top of a hill overlooking Washington, D.C. One of the more well-attended sites at the cemetery, the tomb is made from Yule marble quarried in Colorado. It consists of seven pieces, with a total weight of 79 short tons (72 metric tons). The tomb was completed and opened to the public April 9, 1932, at a cost of $48,000.\\r\\nIt was initially named the \\"Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\\" Other unknown servicemen were later entombed there, and it became known as the \\"Tomb of the Unknowns\\", though it has never been officially named. The soldiers entombed there are:\\r\\nThe Tomb of the Unknowns has been perpetually guarded since July 2, 1937, by the U.S. Army. The 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (\\"The Old Guard\\") began guarding the Tomb on April 6, 1948. There is a meticulous routine that the guard follows when watching over the graves.[98] The Tomb Guard:\\r\\nAfter each turn, the Guard executes a sharp \\"shoulder-arms\\" movement to place the weapon on the shoulder closest to the visitors to signify that the Guard stands between the Tomb and any possible threat.\\r\\nTwenty-one was chosen because it symbolizes the highest military honor that can be bestowedthe 21-gun salute.\\r\\nEach turn the guard makes precise movements and followed by a loud click of the heels as he snaps them together. The guard is changed every half-hour during daylight in the summer, and every hour during daylight in the winter and every two hours at night (when the cemetery is closed to the public), regardless of weather conditions.\\r\\nA commemorative stamp was issued on November 11, 1922, the first anniversary of the first entombment picturing the Amphitheater. It encompasses the original Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The remains of an unidentified WW I American soldier was entombed on Armistice Day, November 11, 1921, later covered in 1931 by a more elaborate marble sarcophagus.[99]\\r\\nThere are several memorials on the grounds of the cemetery. However, due to the lack of space for burials and the large amount of space that memorials take up, the U.S. Army now requires a joint or concurrent resolution from Congress before it will place new memorials at Arlington.\\r\\nNear the Tomb of the Unknowns stands the USS Maine Mast Memorial, which commemorates the 266 men who lost their lives aboard the USS Maine. The memorial is built around a mast salvaged from the Maine's wreckage. The USS Maine Memorial served as the temporary resting place for foreign heads of state or government, Manuel L. Quezon of the Philippines and Ignacy Jan Paderewski of Poland, who died in exile in the United States during World War II.\\r\\nThe Space Shuttle Challenger Memorial was dedicated on May 20, 1986, in memory of the crew of flight STS-51-L, who died during launch on January 28, 1986. Transcribed on the back of the stone is the text of the John Gillespie Magee, Jr. poem High Flight, which was quoted by then President Ronald Reagan when he addressed the disaster. Although many remains were identified and returned to the families for private burial, some were not, and were laid to rest under the marker. Two crew members, Scobee and Smith, are buried in Arlington. On February 1, 2004, NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe dedicated a similar memorial to those who died when the Shuttle Columbia broke apart during reentry on February 1, 2003.[100] Astronauts Laurel Clark, David Brown and Michael Anderson, who were killed in the Columbia disaster, are also buried in Arlington.\\r\\nThe Lockerbie Cairn is a memorial to the 270 killed in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The memorial is constructed of 270 stones, one for each person killed in the disaster. In section 64, a memorial to the 184 victims of the September 11 attacks on the Pentagon was dedicated September 11, 2001. The memorial takes the shape of a pentagon, and lists the names of all the victims that were killed. Unidentified remains from the victims are buried beneath it.[101]\\r\\nOn June 25, 1925, President Calvin Coolidge approved a request to erect a Commonwealth Cross of Sacrifice with the names of all the citizens of the USA who lost their lives fighting in the Canadian forces during World War I. The monument was dedicated November 11, 1927 and after the Korean War and World War II the names of US citizens who died in those conflicts were added.\\r\\nThe Women in Military Service for America Memorial is adjacent to the Ceremonial Entrance to the cemetery.\\r\\nThe Laos Memorial, or Lao Veterans of America memorial, dedicated to Lao and Hmong veterans who served with US Special Forces and CIA advisors during the Vietnam War, to defend the Royal Kingdom of Laos from the North Vietnamese invasion of Laos by selling opium to the CIA in exchange for weapons and promises for their own country, is located on Grant Avenue near the eternal flame memorial to U.S. President John F. Kennedy.[102]\\r\\nIn 2012, legislation began moving through Congress to approve a \\"Place of Remembrance\\" at the cemetery. The memorial will be an ossuary designed to contain fragments of remains which are unidentifiable through DNA analysis. The remains will be cremated before placement in the memorial.[103]\\r\\nThe flags in the cemetery are flown at half-staff from a half-hour before the first funeral until a half hour after the last funeral each day. Funerals are normally conducted five days a week, excluding weekends.[104][105]\\r\\nFunerals, including interments and inurnments, average between 27ÿ30 per day. The Cemetery conducts approximately 6,900 burials each year.[85]\\r\\nWith more than 400,000 interments,[1] the cemetery has the second-largest number of burials of any national cemetery in the United States. The largest of the 130 national cemeteries is the Calverton National Cemetery, on Long Island, near Riverhead, New York, which conducts more than 7,000 burials each year.\\r\\nIn addition to in-ground burial, the cemetery also has one of the larger columbaria for cremated remains in the country. Four courts are currently in use, each with 5,000 niches. When construction is complete, there will be nine courts with a total of 50,000 niches; capacity for 100,000 remains. Any honorably discharged veteran is eligible for inurnment in the columbarium, if s/he served on active duty at some point in her/his career (other than for training).[106]\\r\\nPart 553 (Army National Military Cemeteries) of Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) establishes regulations for the cemetery, including eligibility for interment (ground burial) and inurnment.[107] Due to limited space, the criteria for ground burial eligibility are more restrictive than at other national cemeteries, as well as more restrictive than for inurnment in the columbarium.\\r\\nThe persons specified below are eligible for ground burial in the cemetery, unless otherwise prohibited.[108] The last period of active duty of former members of the armed forces must have ended honorably. Interment may be of casketed or cremated remains.\\r\\nDue at least partly to the lack of space at the cemetery for ground burial, standards for inurnment (burial of cremated remains) in the columbarium are currently much less restrictive than for ground burial at the cemetery. In general, any former member of the armed forces who served on active duty (other than for training) and whose last service terminated honorably is eligible for inurnment. Eligibility for inurnment is described fully in 32 C.F.R.  553.15a.\\r\\nCongress has from time to time created prohibited categories of persons that, even if otherwise eligible for burial, lose that eligibility. One such prohibition is against certain persons who are convicted of committing certain state or federal capital crimes, as defined in 38 U.S. Code  2411. Capital crime is a specifically defined term in the statute, and for state offenses can include offenses that are eligible for a life sentence (with or without parole). The reasoning for this provision originally was to prevent Timothy McVeigh from being eligible at Arlington National Cemetery, but it has since been amended to prevent others.[109]\\r\\nAlso prohibited under the same statute are those determined, with clear and convincing evidence, to have avoided such conviction by death or flight.\\r\\nThe first soldier to be buried in Arlington was Private William Henry Christman of Pennsylvania on May 13, 1864.[110] There are 396 Medal of Honor recipients buried in Arlington National Cemetery,[111] nine of whom are Canadian.\\r\\nFive state funerals have been held at Arlington: those of Presidents William Howard Taft and John F. Kennedy, his two brothers, Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Edward \\"Ted\\" Kennedy, and General of the Armies John J. Pershing. Whether or not they were wartime service members, U.S. presidents are eligible to be buried at Arlington, since they oversaw the armed forces as commanders-in-chief.\\r\\nAmong the most frequently visited sites in the cemetery is the grave of President John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis who is buried nearby along with their son Patrick and their stillborn daughter Arabella. His remains were interred there on March 14, 1967, a reinterment from his original Arlington burial site, some 20 feet (6.1?m) away, where he was buried in November 1963. The grave is marked with an \\"eternal flame\\". The remains of his brothers, Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Edward M. \\"Ted\\" Kennedy, are buried nearby. The latter two graves are marked with simple crosses and footstones. On December 1, 1971, Robert Kennedy's body was re-interred 100 feet (30?m) from its original June 1968 burial site.\\r\\nTwo of the astronauts who were killed in January 27, 1967 flash fire inside the Apollo 1 Command Module, Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee, are buried at the cemetery. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth and a longtime U.S. Senator from Ohio, was buried at the cemetery in April 2017.[112]\\r\\nBritish Diplomat and Field Marshal Sir John Dill was buried at the cemetery when he died in Washington D.C. during World War II.[113] The equestrian statue on Dill's grave is one of only two such statues at the cemetery; the other is Major General Philip Kearny's.[114]\\r\\nThe cemetery has within recent years announced policies and procedures that limit visitor access to the cemetery's grounds. The Cemetery's executive director has stated that some of these may create delays for visitors. Some have become controversial.\\r\\nOn August 6, 2013, Patrick Hallinan, Executive Director, Army National Military Cemeteries, issued an official memorandum that contained the cemetery's then-current bicycle use policy.[115][116] The memorandum permitted cyclists to travel in only one direction on only one route unless otherwise authorized by the executive director.[116] This \\"White Line\\" route traveled from the Old Post Chapel gate at Joint Base MyerÿHenderson Hall towards the main entrance of the cemetery at Memorial Avenue, using Meigs Drive, Sherman Drive and Schley Drive.[116] The memorandum stated without explanation: \\"Bicycle traffic will not be permitted to travel in the reverse direction.\\"[116]\\r\\nCyclists could only use this route between 8:00?a.m. and 6:45?p.m. from April 1 to September 30 and between 8:00?a.m. and 4:45?p.m. from October 1 to March 31.[116] Cyclists had to wear bicycle helmets that certain designated organizations had approved.[116] Bicycles had to be equipped with headlights, tail lights or red reflectors in lieu of tail lights, regardless of the time of travel.[116]\\r\\nOn May 11, 2016, the Department of the Army published in the Federal Register a proposed rule that would, among other things, prohibit a visitor to an Army National Military Cemetery (Arlington National Cemetery and the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery) from riding a bicycle without first acquiring a pass to visit a relative's gravesite or columbarium niche.[117] After receiving 13 comments from 13 individuals concerning the use of bicycles in the cemetery (including comments from representatives of the Arlington County Board and local bicycle advocacy groups that opposed the new restrictions), the Department of the Army published a final rule in the Federal Register on September 26, 2016, that implemented the proposed rule, effective October 26, 2016.[118]\\r\\nIn accordance with the final rule, the cemetery issued a new bicycle use policy, effective October 26, 2016. The policy stated that bicycling would no longer be allowed on Cemetery grounds without a family pass. The policy further stated that \\"bicyclists traversing the cemetery grounds do impact funeral services and the experience that families expect and deserve as they visit their loved one's grave. ... As there are no bike paths on the cemetery grounds, mixing cyclists with pedestrians and vehicles creates a safety hazard.\\"[119]\\r\\nIn September 2016, Hallinan announced that the cemetery was increasing security measures for its visitors. In addition to random identification checks and other security measures already in place, the cemetery will require pedestrians to enter at set access points: the main entrance on Memorial Avenue, the Ord and Weitzel gate, and the Old Post Chapel gate at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall. Before entering the cemetery through its main entrance, all pedestrians will be screened through the cemetery's Welcome Center. All vehicle access will require presenting valid, government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport, when entering the cemetery. Vehicles will also be subject to random inspections. Hallinan stated that these processes may result in delays when entering the cemetery.[120]","input":"Who is buried at the arlington national cemetery?"},{"output":"Jean Chrtien","context":"The Prime Minister of Canada is an official who serves as the primary minister of the Crown, chair of the Cabinet, and thus head of government of Canada. Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the Governor General of Canada, but by constitutional convention, the prime minister must have the confidence of the elected House of Commons. Normally, this is the leader of the party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house. But, if that leader lacks support of the majority, the governor general can appoint another leader who has that support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election. By constitutional convention, a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and, since the early 20th century, this has more specifically meant the House of Commons.[1]\\r\\nThe office is not outlined in any of the documents that constitute the written portion of the Constitution of Canada; executive authority is formally vested in the sovereign and exercised on his or her behalf by the governor general. The prime ministership is part of Canada's constitutional convention tradition. The office was modelled after that which existed in Britain at the time. Sir John A. Macdonald was commissioned by the Viscount Monck on May 24, 1867 to form the first government of the Canadian Confederation. On July 1, 1867, the first ministry assumed office.[2]\\r\\nThe date for which a prime minister begins his or her term has been determined by the date that he or she is sworn into his or her portfolio, as an oath of office as prime minister is not required.[3] However, since 1957, the incoming prime minister has sworn an oath as prime minister.[3] Before 1920, prime ministers' resignations were accepted immediately by the governor general and the last day of the ministries were the date he died or the date of resignation.[3] Since 1920, the outgoing prime minister has only formally resigned when the new government is ready to be formed.[3] The Interpretation Act of 1967 states that \\"where an appointment is made effective or terminates on a specified day, that appointment is considered to be effective or to terminate after the end of the previous day.\\"[3] Thus, although the outgoing prime minister formally resigns only hours before the incoming ministry swears their oaths, both during the day, the ministries are effectively changed at midnight the night before. Some sources, including the Parliament of Canada, apply this convention as far back as 1917.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of September 2017, there are seven living former Prime Ministers of Canada, the oldest being John Turner (born 1929). The most recent former Prime Minister to die was Pierre Trudeau (1968ÿ1979, 1980ÿ1984), on 28 September 2000. John A.

He was an author, song composer, and linguist, and made a significant contribution towards the emancipation of women in Indian society during the British Raj.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second son of Debendranath Tagore , elder brother of Rabindranath Tagore and grandson of Dwarkanath Tagore of the Jorasanko branch of the Tagore family of Calcutta (now Kolkata), he learnt Sanskrit and English at home. A student of Hindu School, he was part of the first batch of students to appear for the entrance examinations of the University of Calcutta in 1857. He was placed in the first division and was admitted to Presidency College.[1]\\r\\nAs was the custom of the day, he was married early in life to Jnanadanandini Devi in 1859. The same year, he and Keshub Chunder Sen accompanied his father on a visit to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).[1][3]\\r\\nFor a long time, only British officers were appointed to all covenanted posts.[4] In 1832, the posts of munsif and sadar amin were created and opened to Indians.[5] In 1833, the posts of deputy magistrate and deputy collector were created and opened to Indians.[6] The ICS Act of 1861 established the Indian Civil Service. The Act of 1853 had already established the practice of recruiting covenanted civilians through competitive examinations.[4]\\r\\nIt was a daunting task to go to England and compete with the British for a position. However, his friend Monomohun Ghose offered encouragement and support, and both of them set sail for England in 1862 to prepare for and compete in the civil service examinations.[2]\\r\\nSatyendranath was selected for the Indian Civil Service in June, 1863. He completed his probationary training and returned to India in November 1864.[2] Monomohun Ghose did not succeed in the examination for the ICS but was called to the bar.[7] Satyendranath was posted to Bombay presidency, which then covered western parts of present-day Maharashtra, Gujarat and Sindh. After initial posting of four months in Bombay (now Mumbai), he had his first active posting at Ahmedabad.[2]\\r\\nWith postings at numerous towns he travelled across the country. Because of his long stay away from home many in his family visited him and stayed with him for long periods. Amongst his regular visitors were his younger brothers Jyotirindranath Tagore (1849ÿ1925) and Rabindranath Tagore (1861ÿ1941), the Nobel Prizeÿwinning poet, and his sister Swarnakumari Devi.[2]\\r\\nHis posting outside Bengal helped him to learn several Indian languages. He translated Bal Gangadhar Tilaks Geetarahasya and Tukarams Abhang poems into Bengali.[1] Rabindranath Tagore had also translated some poems of Tukaram.[8] Satyendranath took an active interest in the activities of the Brahmo Samaj wherever he was posted, as for example at Ahmedabad and Hyderabad, Sindh.[9]\\r\\nWhile in the Maharashtra region he had close contacts with many of the leading reformers and Prarthana Samaj figures  Mahadev Govind Ranade, Kashinath Trimbak Telang, Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar and Narayan Ganesh Chandavarkar.[10]\\r\\nSatyendranath Tagore, was a district judge in Karwar , Karnataka In 1882. He served in the ICS for about thirty years and retired as Judge of Satara in Maharashtra in 1897.[11]\\r\\nRam Mohan Roy found women of Bengal uneducated and illiterate, deprived of property rights, married before puberty, imprisoned in purdah,[12] and murdered at widowhood by a barbaric custom of immolation known as sati.[13] By the time Satyendranath was born sati had been banned (in 1829), and the process of reformation had set in.\\r\\nThe position of women in his society troubled him from a young age. He used to think that the purdah system in his family was not that of our own nation but a copy of Muslim practices. His visit to England where he witnessed more freedom for women helped him understand the relatively poor position of women in Indian society.[2]\\r\\nAfter his marriage, he found in Jnanadanandini Devi an ideal partner to fulfill his thinking. When he was thrilled to witness the progress of women in the advanced society in England, he wanted to take her to England to witness the same, but his father, Devendranath Tagore, stood in the way.[2]\\r\\nBack in India, Satyendranath took Jnanadanandini Devi to Bombay, where she tried to live in the manner and style of the wives of the English officers of the ICS. When the couple returned to the ancestral home at Jorasanko for a holiday, they created a sensation in Calcutta society. They were invited to a party in the Government House (now Raj Bhavan). Breaking all traditional rules, Jnanadanandini Devi accompanied her husband to the party. There she was ÿ \\"a lone Bengali woman in the midst of hundreds of English women.\\" Prasanna Coomar Tagore of the Pathuriaghata branch of the family, who was present in the party, could not bear the sight of a wife of a family member in such an open place and left immediately \\"in shame and anger\\".[2]\\r\\nIn 1877, he sent Jnanadanandini Devi to England with an English couple. She went with three children, a daring task in those days. They initially stayed with the family of Prasanna Coomar Tagores son Gnanendramohan Tagore, who had converted to Christianity and was the first Indian to qualify for the English bar. Later they shifted to Brighton and lived on their own there.[2]\\r\\nSubsequently, Satyendranath accompanied Rabindranath Tagore in what was the latter's first visit to England. All of them returned to India in 1880. It was not only with his wife, but also his sisters that he took the lead to change things. His sister Soudamini Devi wrote, The mocking we faced when we went out in the carriages is difficult to believe now.[2]\\r\\nThus were laid the foundations of freeing the upper and middle class women from the purdah. It was a major achievement of Satyendranath Tagore.[2]\\r\\nJnanadanandini Devi contributed in some unique ways also. As she had to go out in society, she developed a style of wearing the sari, which is broadly followed by Indian women today. She also introduced the use of proper undergarments.[2]\\r\\nJnanadanandini Devi took special interest in childrens matters and started the system of observing birthdays of children in the family, giving them gifts and celebrating the occasion. She started and edited a magazine named Balak for children in 1885. It was possibly the first magazine for children in the Bengali language. The magazine motivated Rabindranath to write for children. Many of the pieces included in his book Sishu were first published in Balak. The magazine was wound up after a year and merged with the family magazine Bharati.[14]\\r\\nThe Tagore family were strong Indian patriots. In an age when it was de rigueur to imitate Western dress habits and to speak the English language in Indian high society, the Tagores kept Indian dress and chose to cultivate Bengali. While admiring the positive qualities he considered British society to possess, Satyendranath himself took the view it was necessary to reform and cultivate the Indian society which already existed.[2]\\r\\nHe was one of the people associated with the Hindu Mela, whose purpose was to awaken this sense of patriotism in the lives of ordinary Indians. When the first session was held in April 1867, he was away in western India. However, he was present in Calcutta for the second session in 1868. He composed the song mile sabe Bharat santan, ektan gaho gaan (unite, India's children, sing in unison) for the occasion, which was hailed as the first national anthem of India. He wrote a number of other such patriotic songs.[2]\\r\\nSatyendranath had deep regard for his father Debendranath and the religion he had taken so much pain to develop. At a considerably young age, he and Monomohun Ghose accompanied Keshub Chunder Sen on his campaign to win over the younger generation at Krishnanagar College.[2][15]\\r\\nIn England, even when he was busy with other work, he found time to preach the ideals of Brahmo Samaj. Later, when he was posted in Ahmedabad, he sent a report about Brahmo Samaj to Max Mller. It was included in Mllers biography, written by his wife.[2]\\r\\nOn retirement, he lived for some time in Park Street and then in Ballygunj in Calcutta. His house was a meeting place for his friends and relatives. Amongst those from outside the family who visited him regularly were Taraknath Palit, Monomohun Ghose, Satyendraprasanna Sinha, Umesh Bannerjee, Krishna Govinda Gupta, and Behari Lal Gupta, all important people of the age in Kolkata.[2]\\r\\nHis house on Park Street was the centre of a literary majlis (gathering). The deliberations were noted in a book which was not to be circulated outside the family and it was not printed. Among the subjects discussed were Bengali language and the Bengali character, The elements of poetry, Chivalry, Love in women and in men.[16]\\r\\nHe was president of Vangiya Sahitya Parishad from 1900ÿ01, and presided over the 10th session of the Bengal provincial conference held at Natore in 1897.[17]\\r\\nSushila O Birsingha (play, 1867), Bombay Chitra (1888), Nabaratnamala, Strisvadhinata, Bauddhadharma (1901), Amar Balyakatha O Bombay Prabas (1915), Bharatvarsiya Ingrej (1908), Raja Rammohan Roy.[17]\\r\\nBoth his children, Surendranath Tagore (1872ÿ1940) and Indira Devi Choudhurani (1873ÿ1960), were well-known figures. They had the experience of English life as children. Surendranath had great command over English and had translated Rabindranaths Four Chapters into English. He had produced a condensed version of the main portion of Mahabharata in Bengali.[2] In his time, he had links with militant revolutionary organisations fighting for Indian independence from the British, which were considered terrorists by the British establishment.[18] Indira was a great French scholar and was an authority on music, particularly Rabindrasangeet. She was vice-chancellor of Viswa Bharati University.[2] She was married to Pramatha Chowdhury, the noted Bengali author.[citation needed]","input":"Who was the first ics officer in india?"},{"output":"AT&T Stadium","context":"This article is a list of current National Football League stadiums, sorted by capacity, their locations, their first year of usage and home teams. Though there are 32 teams in the National Football League (NFL), there are only 31 full-time NFL stadiums because the New York Giants and New York Jets share MetLife Stadium. This number is scheduled to decrease to 30 when the Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Chargers will begin to share the Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park in 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newest NFL stadium is Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, home of the Atlanta Falcons, which opened for the 2017 season. Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, home of the Los Angeles Rams, is the oldest, having opened in 1923.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NFL uses several other stadiums on a regular basis in addition to the teams' designated regular home sites. In England, Wembley Stadium in London is contracted to host at least two games per season, as part of the NFL International Series which runs through 2020, and Twickenham Stadium, also in London, is scheduled to host at least one game. Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, Mexico, will also host a NFL International Series game in 2018. In addition, Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio, is the location of the annual exhibition Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. Since 2016, Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida has hosted the Pro Bowl.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of NFL stadiums have sold naming rights to corporations. As of the 2018 season, there are six exceptions: Arrowhead Stadium, Broncos Stadium at Mile High,[1] Lambeau Field, OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum, Paul Brown Stadium, and Soldier Field. Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum has sold their naming rights in a deal that will not officially change their name until August 2019.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nStadiums represent a considerable expense to a community, and thus their construction, use, and funding often enters the public discourse.[3]  Also, given the perceived advantage a team gets to playing in its home stadium, particular attention is given in the media to the peculiarities of each stadium's environment. Climate, playing surface (either natural or artificial turf), and the type of roof all contribute to giving each team its home-field advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nStadiums are either open, enclosed, or have a retractable roof. For retractable roofs, the home team determines if the roof is to be opened or closed 90 minutes before kickoff. The roof remains open unless precipitation or lightning is within the vicinity of the stadium, the temperature drops below 40?F (4?C), or wind gusts are greater than 40 miles per hour (64?km/h), in which case the roof operators will close the roof.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a peak capacity of over 100,000 spectators, AT&T Stadium has the highest capacity of any NFL stadium, while MetLife Stadium has the highest listed seating capacity at 82,500. The smallest stadium is StubHub Center, which is hosting the Los Angeles Chargers in 2017 with a capacity of 27,000 seats; it is the smallest stadium to host a full NFL season for a team since a 25,000-seat City Stadium hosted its last Green Bay Packers games in 1956.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their normal configurations, 29 of the league's 31 stadiums have a seating capacity of at least 60,000 spectators; of those, a majority (16) have less than 70,000 seats, while eight have between 70,000 and 80,000 and five can seat 80,000 or more. In contrast to college football stadiums, the largest of which can and regularly do accommodate over 100,000 spectators, no stadium in the league currently has a listed seating capacity of more than 82,500. Teams rarely build their stadiums far beyond the 80,000 seat threshold (and even then, only in the largest markets) because of the league's blackout policy, which prohibited the televising of any NFL game within 75 miles of its home market if a game does not sell all of its non-premium seating. For this reason, until the blackout was suspended in 2015, the Los Angeles Rams cap capacity at the 93,607-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to 80,000 seats for most games. OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum, the stadium that hosts the Oakland Raiders, has over 60,000 seats, but the team has restricted capacity to under 57,000 in more recent seasons.[5] In the opposite direction, the league has a firm minimum on the number of seats an NFL stadium should have; since 1971 the league has not allowed any stadium under 50,000 seats to host a full-time NFL team (not counting the StubHub Center, there have been two exceptions to this; 45,000-seat Metropolitan Stadium in Minnesota was not replaced until 1982, and 40,000-seat Vanderbilt Stadium hosted the Tennessee Oilers for one season in 1998 after a planned two-year residency in Memphis was cut in half). In normal circumstances, all NFL stadiums are all-seaters.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome stadiums can be expanded to fit larger crowds for other events such as concerts or conventions.

For example, in \\"Homer's Triple Bypass\\", a large angry man grabs him, and Riviera says \\"Well if it isn't my old friend Mr. McGreggwith a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg\\"; the man literally has an arm where a leg should be and a leg where an arm should be, and it is implied that this is Riviera's fault.[1] Riviera is a stereotype of shady doctors who perform medical procedures for money with little or no regard for medical ethics, or their patients' well-being.

In the episode \\"Margical History Tour\\", the sequence set in 18th-century Vienna has Dr. Nick saying \\"Guten Tag, everybody!\\"\\r\\nThe degrees in his office read \\"Mayo Clinic Correspondence School\\", \\"Club Med School\\", \\"Female Body Inspector\\", and \\"I went to medical school for four years and all I got was this lousy diploma\\".[2] He is a member of Sigma Chi fraternity. He frequently appears on infomercials, pitching all sorts of bizarre medical offers or endorsing dubious devices, and has often turned his operations into TV spectacles. He is also shown as an inventor/huckster (in the style of Ron Popeil) on the television show I Can't Believe They Invented It!, with products such as the \\"Juice Loosener\\" in \\"Marge in Chains\\", an inefficient juicer made in Japan which ultimately causes an influenza epidemic in Springfield (due to one of the workers at the factory having the disease, but still going to work, thus spreading his germs through the packaging).\\r\\nDr. Nick has operated on the Simpson family a couple of times when they cannot afford their regular doctor, Dr. Hibbert, notably when Homer needed a heart bypass. Lisa Simpson attended the live audience for the operation and saved the day by guiding the obviously clueless Dr. Riviera through the operation.[1] He also worked with Dr. Hibbert as an anesthesiologist during Bart's appendectomy (in 'Round Springfield) but was of little help as he accidentally anesthetized himself instead. It is revealed in the episode \\"Homer's Triple Bypass\\" that his phone number is 1-600-DOCTORB, explaining that: \\"The B is for Bargain!\\".[1] His catchphrase is \\"Hi everybody!\\", except in The Simpsons Movie, in which he was seemingly killed with a large shard of glass, saying, \\"Bye, everybody... ugh.\\" However, he has survived and made a few appearances since.\\r\\nThe design of Dr. Nick is modeled physically on Gbor Csup܇, the co-founder of Klasky Csupo animation studios (which animated the series for its first three seasons and The Tracey Ullman Show shorts).[3] The animators mistakenly believed that Hank Azaria was impersonating Csup܇, when in fact he was doing a bad impression of Ricky Ricardo from the TV series I Love Lucy.[4]\\r\\nIn The Simpsons Movie, Riviera is impaled by a large shard of glass that breaks and falls off the enormous dome covering Springfield, saying \\"Bye, everybody!\\" before he faints. Executive producers James L. Brooks and Al Jean confirmed that the character was not dead, but he just fainted[citation needed], and he would be \\"brought back to life  la Dr. Marvin Monroe\\".[5] Riviera is seen alive and well in further episodes after the movie.\\r\\nIGN placed Dr. Nick 23rd on their list of the \\"Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters\\".[6] The character was listed in Entertainment Weekly's \\"30 Great TV Doctors and Nurses\\" and in Philadelphia Magazine's \\"10 Best Doctors on Television\\".[7][8] In a tongue-in-cheek analysis, the Canadian Medical Association Journal compared the services of Riviera and Dr. Hibbert. It concludes that Riviera is a better role model for physicians, whereas Hibbert is a paternalistic and wasteful physician, unlike Riviera, who strives to cut costs and does his best to avoid the coroner, disproving Marge Simpson's claim that he is not a doctor at all.[9]","input":"Where did dr nick go to medical school?"},{"output":"Bogot","context":"","input":"What is the capital city of columbia south america?"},{"output":"Yom Kippur","context":"A yahrzeit candle, also spelled yahrtzeit candle or called a memorial candle, (Hebrew: ?? ?????, ner neshama,[1][2] meaning \\"soul candle\\"; Yiddish: ???????? ????? yortsayt likht, meaning \\"anniversary candle\\") is a type of candle that is lit in memory of the dead in Judaism.[3]\\r\\nThis kind of candle, that burns up to 26 hours, is also lit on the eve of Yom Kippur or of the Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony (Yom HaShoah) to burn through the entire occasion.

Also note that a single vehicle can be sold concurrently under several nameplates in different markets, as with for example the Nissan Sunny; in such circumstances manufacturers often provide only cumulative units sold figures for all models. As a result, there is no definitive standard for measuring units sold; Volkswagen has claimed its Beetle as the bestselling car in history as it did not substantially change throughout its production run.[1] By contrast, Toyota has applied the Corolla nameplate to 11 generations since 1966, which have sold over 40?million through July 2013.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFour cars have been widely acknowledged as the \\"bestselling automobile in the world\\" since Ford built its millionth Model T on December 10, 1915. The Model T itself remained the highest seller until forty five years after production ceased in 1927. On February 17, 1972 Volkswagen claimed that the Ford had been superseded by the Beetle, when the 15,007,034th was manufactured.[1] Although The Model T has subsequently been credited with 16.5?million units sold, this anomaly is moot in light of the Beetle reaching 21 million.[3]\\r\\nThe Beetle remained the bestselling vehicle until the late 1990s,[4] when it was itself overtaken by the Toyota Corolla.[5] However, this was an example of the modern practice of applying a brand name across a range of vehicles, and retaining it for marketing purposes even as the car changes.[6] While the first Corolla in 1966 was rear wheel drive and rode on a 2286?mm wheelbase, the current front wheel drive versions share a 2600?mm wheelbase and use a mechanically unrelated platform. The Beetle's overall design, both aesthetically and mechanically, changed so little over the course of its 65-year run that it's possible to mount a 1936 body on a 2003 chassis or vice versa.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe original model Lada produced by AvtoVAZ of Russia, is the most numerous vehicle ever marketed without any major design change during its production history, with over 20 million units sold between 1970 and mid-2012. The Lada, sometimes known as the \\"Classic\\" in the West, was originally based on the 1960s Fiat 124 but mechanically upgraded to cope with poor roads and harsh climates. Between 1970 and 1979, some 5 million cars had been produced. These were badged as the 2101 (1200 sedan), 2102 (1200 estate), 2103 (quad headlights, higher-spec. interior than 1200), 2106 (improved 2103). Between 1980 and 2012 over 15 million more Ladas were produced, and these were badged for various export markets such as Rivas (UK), Signets (Canada), and Novas (Germany). The car was also built under licence in several countries (production figures unknown). Although various updates were made to the car's bumpers, steering columns and interior fittings, as well as other minor mechanical improvements throughout its production life, the basic design remained unchanged.","input":"What is the top selling brand of car?"},{"output":"Fern Arable","context":"Charlotte's Web is a children's novel by American author E. B. White and illustrated by Garth Williams; it was published in October 15, 1952, by Harper & Brothers. The novel tells the story of a livestock pig named Wilbur and his friendship with a barn spider named Charlotte. When Wilbur is in danger of being slaughtered by the farmer, Charlotte writes messages praising Wilbur (such as \\"Some Pig\\") in her web in order to persuade the farmer to let him live.\\r\\nWritten in White's dry, low-key manner, Charlotte's Web is considered a classic of children's literature, enjoyable to adults as well as children. The description of the experience of swinging on a rope swing at the farm is an often cited example of rhythm in writing, as the pace of the sentences reflects the motion of the swing. In 2000, Publishers Weekly listed the book as the best-selling children's paperback of all time.[1]\\r\\nCharlotte's Web was adapted into an animated feature by Hanna-Barbera Productions and Sagittarius Productions in 1973. Paramount released a direct-to-video sequel, Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure, in the U.S. in 2003 (Universal released the film internationally). A live-action film version of E. B. White's original story was released in 2006. A video game based on this adaption was also released in 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter her father spares the life of a piglet from slaughtering it as runt of the litter, a little girl named Fern Arable nurtures the piglet lovingly, naming him Wilbur. On greater maturity, Wilbur is sold to Fern's uncle, Homer Zuckerman, in whose barnyard he is left yearning for companionship but is snubbed by other barn animals, until befriended by a barn spider named Charlotte, living on a web overlooking Wilbur's enclosure. Upon Wilbur's discovery that he is intended for slaughter, she promises to hatch a plan guaranteed to spare his life. Accordingly, she secretly weaves praise of him into her web, attracting publicity among Zuckerman's neighbors who attribute the praise to divine intervention. As time passes, more inscriptions appear on Charlotte's webs, increasing his renown. Therefore, Wilbur is entered in the county fair, accompanied by Charlotte and the rat Templeton, whom she employs in gathering inspiration for her messages. There, Charlotte spins an egg sac containing her 514 unborn children, and Wilbur, despite winning no prizes, is later celebrated by the fair's staff and visitors (thus made too prestigious alive to justify killing him). Exhausted apparently by laying eggs, Charlotte remains at the fair and dies shortly following Wilbur's departure. Having returned to Zuckerman's farm, Wilbur guards Charlotte's egg sac and is saddened further when the new spiders depart shortly after hatching. The three smallest remain, however, and take up residence in the doorway where Charlotte used to live. Pleased at finding new friends, Wilbur names one of them Nellie, while the remaining two name themselves Joy and Aranea. The book then concludes by mentioning that more generations of spiders kept him company in subsequent years.\\r\\nCharlotte's Web was published three years after White began writing it.[3] White's editor Ursula Nordstrom said that one day in 1952, E. B. White arrived at her office and handed her a new manuscript, the only copy of Charlotte's Web then in existence, which she read soon after and enjoyed.[4]\\r\\nSince White published Death of a Pig in 1948,[5] an account of his own failure to save a sick pig (bought for butchering), Charlotte's Web can be seen as White's attempt \\"to save his pig in retrospect\\".[6] White's overall motivation for the book has not been revealed and he has written: \\"I haven't told why I wrote the book, but I haven't told you why I sneeze, either. A book is a sneeze\\".[7]\\r\\nWhen White met the spider who originally inspired Charlotte, he called her Charlotte Epeira (after Epeira sclopetaria, the Grey Cross spider, now known as Larinioides sclopetarius), before discovering that the more modern name for that genus was Aranea.[8] In the novel, Charlotte gives her full name as \\"Charlotte A. Cavatica\\", revealing her as a barn spider, an orb-weaver with the scientific name Araneus cavaticus.\\r\\nThe arachnid anatomical terms (mentioned in the beginning of chapter nine) and other information that White used, came mostly from American Spiders by Willis J. Gertsch and The Spider Book by John Henry Comstock, both of which combine a sense of poetry with scientific fact.[9] White incorporated details from Comstock's accounts of baby spiders, most notably the \\"flight\\" of the young spiders on silken parachutes.[9] White sent Gertschs book to illustrator Garth Williams.[10] Williams initial drawings depicted a spider with a womans face, and White suggested that he simply draw a realistic spider instead.[11]\\r\\nWhite originally opened the novel with an introduction of Wilbur and the barnyard (which later became the third chapter) but decided to begin the novel by introducing Fern and her family on the first page.[10] Whites publishers were at one point concerned with the books ending and tried to get White to change it.[12]\\r\\nCharlotte's Web has become White's most famous book; but White treasured his privacy and that of the farmyard and barn that helped inspire the novel, which have been kept off limits to the public according to his wishes.[13]\\r\\nCharlotte's Web was generally well-reviewed when it was released. In The New York Times, Eudora Welty wrote, \\"As a piece of work it is just about perfect, and just about magical in the way it is done.\\"[14] Aside from its paperback sales, Charlotte's Web is 78th on the all-time bestselling hardback book list. According to publicity for the 2006 film adaptation (see below), the book has sold more than 45 million copies and been translated into 23 languages. It was a Newbery Honor book for 1953, losing to Secret of the Andes by Ann Nolan Clark for the medal. In 1970, White won the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal, a major prize in the field of children's literature, for Charlotte's Web, along with his first children's book, Stuart Little, published in 1945. Seth Lerer, in his book Childrens Literature, finds that Charlotte represents female authorship and creativity, and compares her to other female characters in childrens literature such as Jo March in Little Women and Mary Lennox in The Secret Garden.[15] Nancy Larrick brings to attention the \\"startling note of realism\\" in the opening line, \\"Where's Papa going with that Ax?\\"[16]\\r\\nIllustrator Henry Cole expressed his deep childhood appreciation of the characters and story, and calls Garth Williams' illustrations full of sensitivity, warmth, humor, and intelligence.[17] Illustrator Diana Cain Bluthenthal states that Williams' illustrations inspired and influenced her.[18]\\r\\nThere is an unabridged audio book read by White himself which reappeared decades after it had originally been recorded.[19] Newsweek writes that White reads the story \\"without artifice and with a mellow charm,\\" and that \\"White also has a plangency that will make you weep, so don't listen (at least, not to the sad parts) while driving.\\"[19] Joe Berk, president of Pathway Sound, had recorded Charlotte's Web with White in Whites neighbor's house in Maine (which Berk describes as an especially memorable experience) and released the book in LP.[20] Bantam released Charlottes Web alongside Stuart Little on CD in 1991, digitally remastered, having acquired the two of them for rather a large amount.[20]\\r\\nIn 2005, a school teacher in California conceived of a project for her class in which they would send out hundreds of drawings of spiders (each representing Charlottes child Aranea going out into the world so that she can return and tell Wilbur of what she has seen) with accompanying letters; they ended up visiting a large number of parks, monuments, and museums, and were hosted by and/or prompted responses from celebrities and politicians such as John Travolta and then-First Lady Laura Bush.[21]\\r\\nIn 2003 Charlotte's Web was listed at number 170 on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's 200 \\"best-loved novels.\\"[22] A 2004 study found that Charlotte's Web was a common read-aloud book for third-graders in schools in San Diego County, California.[23] Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named the book one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\\"[24] It was one of the \\"Top 100 Chapter Books\\" of all time in a 2012 poll by School Library Journal.[25]\\r\\nIts awards and nominations include:\\r\\nThe book was adapted into an animated feature of the same name in 1973 by Hanna-Barbera Productions and Sagittarius Productions with a score by the Sherman Brothers.

According to Jewish tradition, it replaced Solomon's Temple (the First Temple), which was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, when Jerusalem was conquered and part of the population of the Kingdom of Judah was taken into exile to Babylon.\\r\\nJewish eschatology includes a belief that the Second Temple will be replaced by a future Third Temple.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accession of Cyrus the Great of the Persian Empire in 559 BCE made the re-establishment of the city of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple possible.[1][2] According to the Bible, when the Jewish exiles returned to Jerusalem following a decree from Cyrus the Great (Ezra 1:1ÿ4, 2 Chron 36:22ÿ23), construction started at the original site of Solomon's Temple. After a relatively brief halt due to opposition from peoples who had filled the vacuum during the Jewish captivity (Ezra 4), work resumed ca. 521 BCE under Darius the Great (Ezra 5) and was completed during the sixth year of his reign (ca. 516 BCE), with the temple dedication taking place the following year.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe events take place in the second half of the 5th century BCE. Listed together with the Book of Ezra as Ezra-Nehemiah, it represents the final chapter in the historical narrative of the Hebrew Bible.[1]\\r\\nThe original core of the book, the first-person memoir, may have been combined with the core of the Book of Ezra around 400 BCE. Further editing probably continued into the Hellenistic era.[3]\\r\\nThe book tells how Nehemiah, at the court of the king in Susa, is informed that Jerusalem is without walls and resolves to restore them. The king appoints him as governor of the province Yehud Medinata and he travels to Jerusalem. There he rebuilds the walls, despite the opposition of Israel's enemies, and reforms the community in conformity with the law of Moses. After 12 years in Jerusalem, he returns to Susa but subsequently revisits Jerusalem. He finds that the Israelites have been backsliding and taking non-Jewish wives, and he stays in Jerusalem to enforce the Law.\\r\\nBased on the biblical account, after the return from Babylonian captivity, arrangements were immediately made to reorganize the desolated Yehud Province after the demise of the Kingdom of Judah seventy years earlier. The body of pilgrims, forming a band of 42,360,[4] having completed the long and dreary journey of some four months, from the banks of the Euphrates to Jerusalem, were animated in all their proceedings by a strong religious impulse, and therefore one of their first concerns was to restore their ancient house of worship by rebuilding their destroyed Temple[5] and reinstituting the sacrificial rituals known as the korbanot.\\r\\nOn the invitation of Zerubbabel, the governor, who showed them a remarkable example of liberality by contributing personally 1,000 golden darics, besides other gifts, the people poured their gifts into the sacred treasury with great enthusiasm.[6] First they erected and dedicated the altar of God on the exact spot where it had formerly stood, and they then cleared away the charred heaps of debris which occupied the site of the old temple; and in the second month of the second year (535 BCE), amid great public excitement and rejoicing, the foundations of the Second Temple were laid. A wide interest was felt in this great movement, although it was regarded with mixed feelings by the spectators (Haggai 2:3, Zechariah 4:10</ref>).[5]\\r\\nThe Samaritans made proposals for co-operation in the work. Zerubbabel and the elders, however, declined all such cooperation, feeling that the Jews must build the Temple without help. Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews. According to Ezra 4:5, the Samaritans sought to \\"frustrate their purpose\\" and sent messengers to Ecbatana and Susa, with the result that the work was suspended.[5]\\r\\nSeven years later, Cyrus the Great, who allowed the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the Temple, died (2 Chronicles 36:22ÿ23) and was succeeded by his son Cambyses. On his death, the \\"false Smerdis,\\" an impostor, occupied the throne for some seven or eight months, and then Darius became king (522 BCE). In the second year of his rule the work of rebuilding the temple was resumed and carried forward to its completion (Ezra 5:6ÿ6:15), under the stimulus of the earnest counsels and admonitions of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. It was ready for consecration in the spring of 516 BCE, more than twenty years after the return from captivity. The Temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius, amid great rejoicings on the part of all the people (Ezra 6:15,16), although it was evident that the Jews were no longer an independent people, but were subject to a foreign power. The Book of Haggai includes a prediction that the glory of the second temple would be greater than that of the first (Haggai 2:9).[5]\\r\\nSome of the original artifacts from the Temple of Solomon are not mentioned in the sources after its destruction in 597 BCE, and are presumed lost. The Second Temple lacked the following holy articles:\\r\\nIn the Second Temple, the Kodesh Hakodashim (Holy of Holies) was separated by curtains rather than a wall as in the First Temple. Still, as in the Tabernacle, the Second Temple included:\\r\\nAccording to the Mishnah (Middot iii. 6), the \\"Foundation Stone\\" stood where the Ark used to be, and the High Priest put his censer on it on Yom Kippur.[2]\\r\\nThe Second Temple also included many of the original vessels of gold that had been taken by the Babylonians but restored by Cyrus the Great.[5][8] According to the Babylonian Talmud (Yoma 22b),[2] however, the Temple lacked the Shekinah, the dwelling or settling divine presence of God, and the Ruach HaKodesh, the Spirit of Holiness, present in the first.\\r\\nTraditional rabbinic literature state that the Second Temple stood for 420 years and based on the 2nd-century work Seder Olam Rabbah, placed construction in 350 BCE (3408 AM), 166 years later than secular estimates, and destruction in 70 CE (3829 AM).[9]\\r\\nFollowing the conquest of Judea by Alexander the Great, it became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE, when King Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated King Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt at the Battle of Paneion.[10] Judea became at that moment part of the Seleucid empire of Syria. When the Second Temple in Jerusalem was looted and its religious services stopped, Judaism was effectively outlawed. In 167 BCE, Antiochus IV Epiphanes ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple. He also banned circumcision and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the Temple.[11]\\r\\nFollowing the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid empire, the Second Temple was rededicated and became the religious pillar of the Jewish Hasmonean kingdom, as well as culturally associated with the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah.\\r\\nThere is some evidence from archaeology that further changes to the structure of the Temple and its surroundings were made during the Hasmonean rule. Salome Alexandra, the queen of Hasmonean Kingdom appointed her elder son Hyrcanus II as the high priest of Judaea. Her younger son Aristobulus II was determined to have the throne, and as soon as she died he seized the throne. Hyrcanus, who was in line to be the king, agreed to be contented with being the high priest. Antipater, the governor of Idum?a, encouraged Hyrcanus not to give up his throne. Eventually Hyrcanus fled to Aretas III, king of the Nabateans, and returned with an army to take back the throne. He defeated Aristobulus and besieged Jerusalem. The Roman general Pompey, who was in Syria fighting against the Armenians in the Third Mithridatic War, sent his lieutenant to investigate the conflict in Judaea. Both Hyrcanus and Aristobulus appealed to him for support. Pompey was not diligent in making a decision about this which caused Aristobulus to march off. He was pursued by Pompey and surrendered but his followers closed Jerusalem to Pompey's forces. The Romans besieged and took the city in 63 BCE. The priests continued with the religious practices inside the Temple during the siege. The temple was not looted or harmed by the Romans. Pompey himself, perhaps inadvertently, went into the Holy of Holies and the next day ordered the priests to repurify the Temple and resume the religious practices.[12]\\r\\nReconstruction of the temple under Herod began with a massive expansion of the Temple Mount. Religious worship and temple rituals continued during the construction process.[13] When the Roman emperor Caligula planned to place his own statue inside the temple, Herod's grandson Agrippa I was able to intervene and convince him against this.\\r\\nHerod's Temple was one of the larger construction projects of the 1st century BCE.[14] Josephus records that Herod was interested in perpetuating his name through building projects, that his construction programs were extensive and paid for by heavy taxes, but that his masterpiece was the Temple of Jerusalem.[14]\\r\\nThe old temple built by Zerubbabel was replaced by a magnificent edifice. An agreement was made between Herod and the Jewish religious authorities: the sacrificial rituals, called offerings, were to be continued unabated for the entire time of construction, and the Temple itself would be constructed by the priests. Later the Exodus 30:13 sanctuary shekel was reinstituted to support the temple as the temple tax.\\r\\nMt. Moriah had a plateau at the northern end, and steeply declined on the southern slope. It was Herod's plan that the entire mountain be turned into a giant square platform. The Temple Mount was originally intended to be 1600 feet wide by 900 feet broad by 9 stories high, with walls up to 16 feet thick, but had never been finished. To complete it, a trench was dug around the mountain, and huge stone \\"bricks\\" were laid. Some of these weighed well over 100 tons, the largest measuring 44.6 feet by 11 feet by 16.5 feet and weighing approximately 567 to 628 tons,[15][16] while most were in the range of 2.5 by 3.5 by 15 feet (approximately 28 tons). King Herod had architects from Greece, Rome and Egypt plan the construction. The blocks were presumably quarried by using pickaxes to create channels. Then they hammered in wooden beams and flushed them with water to force them out. Once they were removed, they were carved into precise squares and numbered at the quarry to show where they would be installed. The final carving would have been done by using harder stones to grind or chisel them to create precise joints. They would have been transported using oxen and specialized carts. Since the quarry was uphill from the temple they had gravity on their side but care needed to be taken to control the descent. Final installation would have been done using pulleys or cranes. Roman pulleys and cranes weren't strong enough to lift the blocks alone so they may have used multiple cranes and levers to position them.[17] As the mountainside began to rise, the western side was carved away to a vertical wall and bricks were carved to create a virtual continuation of the brick face, which was continued for a while until the northern slope reached ground level. Part of the Antonian hill to the north of Moriah was annexed to the complex and the area between was filled up with landfill.\\r\\nThe project began with the building of giant underground vaults upon which the temple would be built so it could be larger than the small flat area on top of Mount Moriah. Ground level at the time was at least 20?ft. (6m) below the current level, as can be seen by walking the Western Wall tunnels. Legend has it that the construction of the entire complex lasted only three years, but other sources such as Josephus say that it took far longer, although the Temple itself may have taken that long. During a Passover visit by Jesus the Jews replied that it had been under construction for 46 years.[18] It is possible that the complex was only a few years completed when the future Emperor Titus destroyed the Temple in 70 CE.\\r\\nThis area was primarily a bazaar, with vendors selling souvenirs, sacrificial animals, food, as well as currency changers, exchanging Roman for Tyrian money because the Jews were not allowed to coin their own money and they viewed Roman currency as an abomination to the Lord,[19] as also mentioned in the New Testament account of Jesus and the Money Changers when Jerusalem was packed with Jews who had come for Passover, perhaps numbering 300,000 to 400,000 pilgrims.[20][21] Guides that provided tours of the premises were also available. Jewish males had the unique opportunity to be shown inside the temple itself.\\r\\nThe priests, in their white linen robes and tubular hats, were everywhere, directing pilgrims and advising them on what kinds of sacrifices were to be performed.\\r\\nBehind them, as they entered the Court of the Gentiles from the south through the Huldah Gates, was the Royal Porch, which contained a marketplace, administrative quarters, and a synagogue. On the upper floors, the great Jewish sages held court, priests and Levites performed various chores, and from there, tourists were able to observe the events. The Royal Porch is widely accepted to be part of Herod's work; however, recent archaeological finds in the Western Wall tunnels suggest that it was built in the first century during the reign of Agripas, as opposed to the first century BCE,[22] while the theory that Herod began the extension and the Royal Porch is based mainly on Josephus's possibly politically motivated claim. During Herod's reign the porch was not yet open to the public)\\r\\nTo the east of the court was Solomon's Porch, and to the north, the soreg, the \\"middle wall of separation\\",[23] a stone wall separating the public area from the inner sanctuary where only Jews could enter, described as being 3 cubits high by Josephus (Wars 5.5.2 [3b] 6.2.4).\\r\\nThe accounts of Jesus' temptations in Matthew's and Luke's gospels both suggest that the Second Temple had one or more pinnacles (Greek:    ):\\r\\nAccording to Josephus, there were ten entrances into the inner courts, four on the south, four on the north, one on the east and one leading east to west from the Court of Women to the court of the Israelites, named the Nicanor Gate.[25] The gates were: On the south side (going from west to east) the Fuel Gate, the Firstling Gate, the Water Gate. On the north side, from west to east, are the Jeconiah Gate, the Offering Gate, the Women's Gate and the Song Gate. On the Eastern side, the Nicanor gate, which is where most Jewish visitors entered. A few pieces of the Soreg have survived to the present day.\\r\\nWithin this area was the Court of the Women, open to all Jews, male and female. Even a ritually unclean Cohen could enter to perform various housekeeping duties. There was also a place for lepers (considered ritually unclean), as well as a ritual barbershop for Nazirites. In this, the largest of the temple courts, one could see constant dancing, singing and music.\\r\\nOnly men were allowed to enter the Court of the Israelites, where they could observe sacrifices of the high priest in the Court of the Priests. The Court of the Priests was reserved for Levite priests.\\r\\nBetween the entrance of the building and the curtain veiling the Holy of Holies were the famous vessels of the temple: the menorah, the incense-burning altar, and various other implements.\\r\\nJews from distant parts of the Roman Empire would arrive by boat at the port of Jaffa (now part of Tel Aviv), where they would join a caravan for the three-day trek to the Holy City and would then find lodgings in one of the many hotels or hostelries. Then they changed some of their money from the profane standard Greek and Roman currency for Jewish and Tyrian money, the latter two considered religious.[26][27] The pilgrims would purchase sacrificial animals, usually a pigeon or a lamb, in preparation for the following day's events.\\r\\nThe first thing pilgrims would do would be to approach the public entrance on the south side of the Temple Mount complex. They would check their animals, then visit a mikveh, where they would ritually cleanse and purify themselves. The pilgrims would then retrieve their sacrificial animals, and head to the Huldah gates. After ascending a staircase three stories in height, and passing through the gate, the pilgrims would find themselves in the Court of the Gentiles.\\r\\nIn 66 CE the Jewish population rebelled against the Roman Empire. Four years later, in 70 CE, Roman legions under Titus retook and destroyed much of Jerusalem and the Second Temple. The Arch of Titus, located in Rome and built to commemorate Titus' victory in Judea, depicts a Roman victory procession with soldiers carrying spoils from the Temple, including the Menorah. According to an inscription on the Colosseum, Emperor Vespasian built the Colosseum with war spoils in 79 CE-possibly from the spoils of the Second Temple.[28]\\r\\nThe sects of Judaism that had their base in the Temple dwindled in importance, including the priesthood and the Sadducees.[29]\\r\\nThe destruction date according to the Hebrew calendar was the 9th of Av, also known as Tisha B'Av.[30] The Temple itself was located on the site of what today is the Dome of the Rock. The gates let out close to Al-Aqsa Mosque (which came much later).[13] Although Jews continued to inhabit the destroyed city, Emperor Hadrian established a new city called Aelia Capitolina. At the end of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, many of the Jewish communities were massacred and Jews were banned from living inside Jerusalem. A pagan Roman temple was set up on the former site of Herod's Temple.[12]\\r\\nIn 1871, a hewn stone measuring 60 G 90?cm. and engraved with Greek uncials was discovered near a court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and identified by Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau as being the Temple Warning inscription. The stone inscription outlined the prohibition extended unto those who were not of the Jewish nation to proceed beyond the soreg separating the larger Court of the Gentiles and the inner courts. The inscription read in seven lines:\\r\\nTranslation: \\"Let no foreigner enter within the parapet and the partition which surrounds the Temple precincts. Anyone caught [violating] will be held accountable for his ensuing death.\\" Today, the stone is preserved in Istanbul's Museum of Antiquities.\\r\\nIn 1936 a fragment of a similar Temple warning inscription was found. After 1967, archaeologists found that the wall extended all the way around the Temple Mount and is part of the city wall near the Lions' Gate. Thus, the Western Wall is not the only remaining part of the Temple Mount. Currently, Robinson's Arch (named after American Edward Robinson) remains as the beginning of an arch that spanned the gap between the top of the platform and the higher ground farther away. This had been used by the priests as an entrance. Commoners had entered through the still-extant, but now plugged, gates on the southern side which led through colonnades to the top of the platform. One of these colonnades is still extant and reachable through the Temple Mount. The Southern wall was designed as a grand entrance. Recent archeological digs have found thousands of mikvehs (ceremonial bathtubs) for the ritual purification of the worshipers, as well as a grand stairway leading to the now blocked entrance. Inside the walls, the platform was supported by a series of vaulted archways, now called Solomon's Stables, which still exist and whose current renovation by the Waqf is extremely controversial. The temple itself was constructed of imported white marble that gleamed in the daylight.\\r\\nOn September 25, 2007 Yuval Baruch, archaeologist with the Israeli Antiquities Authority announced the discovery of a quarry compound which may have provided King Herod with the stones to build his Temple on the Temple Mount. Coins, pottery and an iron stake found proved the date of the quarrying to be about 19 BCE. Archaeologist Ehud Netzer confirmed that the large outlines of the stone cuts is evidence that it was a massive public project worked by hundreds of slaves.[31]\\r\\nThe Magdala stone, is thought to be a representation of the Second Temple carved before its destruction in the year 70.[32]\\r\\nMagdala Stone\\r\\nBar Kokhba tetradracm showing the Jerusalem Temple fa?ade 132ÿ135 CE\\r\\nArch of Titus showing spoils of Jerusalem Temple\\r\\nThe upper corner of Herod's temple colonnade with ancient Hebrew inscription\\r\\nThe Warning Inscription found in 1871\\r\\nA copy of the inscription found in 1871\\r\\nFragment of Second Temple Warning\\r\\nThe Trumpeting Place inscription, a stone (2.43x1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"To the Trumpeting Place\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.\\r\\nThe period between the construction of the Second Temple in 515 BCE and its destruction by the Romans in 70 CE witnessed major historical upheavals and significant religious changes that would affect most subsequent Abrahamic religions.

The Malibu began as a trim-level of the Chevrolet Chevelle, becoming its own model line in 1978. Originally a rear-wheel-drive intermediate, GM revived the Malibu nameplate as a front-wheel-drive car in 1997.\\r\\nNamed after coastal community of Malibu, California, the Malibu was marketed primarily in North America, with the eighth generation introduced globally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Malibu was a top-line subseries of the mid-sized Chevrolet Chevelle from 1964 to 1972. Malibus were generally available in a full range of bodystyles including a four-door sedan, two-door Sport Coupe hardtop, convertible and two-seat station wagon. Interiors were more lavish than lesser Chevelle 300 and 300 Deluxe models thanks to patterned cloth and vinyl upholstery (all-vinyl in convertibles and station wagons), deep-twist carpeting, deluxe steering wheel and other items. The Malibu SS was available only as a two-door Sport Coupe hardtop or convertible and added bucket seats, center console (with optional four-speed manual or Powerglide transmissions), engine gauges and special wheelcovers, and offered with any six-cylinder or V8 engine offered in other Chevelles - with the top option being a 300?hp (224?kW; 304?PS) 327?cu?in (5.4?L) in 1964.\\r\\nFor 1965, Malibus and other Chevelles received new grilles and revised tail sections and had the exhaust pipes replaced but carried over the same basic styling and bodystyles from 1964. The Malibu and Malibu SS models continued as before with the SS featuring a blacked-out grille and special wheelcovers. Top engine option was now a 350?hp (261?kW; 355?PS) 327?cu?in (5.4?L) V8.\\r\\nThe Malibu SS was replaced in 1966 by a new Chevelle SS-396 series that included a big-block 396?cu?in (6.5?L) V8 engine (Canadian market did not receive the SS396 but marketed the former Malibu SS nameplate until January 1967 when it was phased out), heavy duty suspension and other performance equipment. Other SS-396 equipment was similar to Malibu Sport Coupes and convertibles including an all-vinyl bench seat. Bucket seats and console with floor shift were now optional on the SS and for 1966 with the SS now denoting a car with a big-block engine, the bucket seats became a new option on the regular Malibu Sport Coupe and convertible, upon which any six-cylinder or small-block V8 could be ordered. Also new for 1966 was the Chevelle Malibu four-door Sport Sedan hardtop. Styling revisions on all 1966 Chevelles including more rounded styling similar to the full-sized Chevrolets with sail panels and tunneled rear windows featured on two-door hardtop coupes.\\r\\nFor 1967, the same assortment of bodystyles were continued with styling changes similar to all other Chevelles including a new grille and revised tail section with taillights that wrapped around to the side. New this year was a Chevelle Malibu Concours station wagon with simulated woodgrain exterior side panel trim. Front disc brakes were a new option along with a stereo 8-track tape player. The same assortment of drivetrains carried over from 1966 with the top 327?cu?in (5.4?L) V8 dropped from 350 to 325?hp (261 to 242?kW; 355 to 330?PS).\\r\\nMalibus and all other Chevelles were completely restyled for 1968 with semi-fastback rooflines on two-door hardtops and wheelbases split to 112 inches (2,800?mm)} on two-door models and 116 for four-door sedans and station wagons. Engine offerings included a new 307?cu?in (5.0?L) V8 rated at 200?hp (149?kW; 203?PS) that replaced the 283?cu?in (4.6?L) V8 that had served as the base V8 since the Chevelle's introduction in 1964. Inside was a new instrument panel featuring round gauges in square pods similar to what would appear in Camaros the following year. New for 1968 was the Concours luxury option for Malibu sedans and coupes that included upgraded cloth or vinyl bench seats, carpeted lower door panels, woodgrain trim on dash and door panels, a center console and floor shifter (only with the hardtop and convertible, which was shared with the SS396) and Concours nameplates. There was again a top-line Concours Estate wagon with simulated woodgrain trim that had the same interior and exterior appointments as the Malibu sedans.\\r\\nNew grilles and rear decks with revised taillights highlighted the 1969 Malibus and other Chevelles. Instrument panels were revised and front seat headrests were now standard equipment due to federal safety mandate. The ignition switch moved from the instrument panel to the steering column and also doubled as a steering wheel lock. The 307 continued as the base V8, but the 327 engines were replaced by new 350?cu?in (5.7?L) V8s of 255 and 300?hp (190 and 224?kW; 259 and 304?PS). GM's three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, previously only offered on SS-396 Chevelles (RPO M40), was now available on all models with all engines (THM400s were used with the 396 while the THM350 (RPO M38) first introduced with the Camaro and Nova) was phased in with the small blocks optioned, including the six-cylinder and small-block V8s which in previous years were only available with the two-speed Powerglide. A police package Chevelle 300 (pillared 4 door sedan) was available for the 1969 model year which came with the L35 code 396 - it was built in few numbers when the Chrysler Corporation held the market for its law enforcement orders. Some 1964 and 1965 Chevelle 300s came with the BO7 police package but was powered with the inline six.\\r\\nFor 1970, the Malibu was initially the only series of Chevelle offered, aside from the SS-396 and new SS-454, as the low-line 300 and 300 Deluxe models were discontinued for the USA market (it continued in Canada until 1972), which also eliminated the two-door pillared coupes from the Chevelle lineup ÿ which were never included in the Malibu series. New grilles, rear decks with taillights moved into the bumper and revised Sport Coupe roofline highlighted this year's changes. The standard six-cylinder engine was punched up from 230?cu?in (3.8?L) to 250?cu?in (4.1?L) and 155?hp (116?kW; 157?PS), while the same assortment of V8s carried over with the addition of a 330?hp (246?kW; 335?PS), 400?cu?in (6.6?L) V8 on non-SS Chevelles. At mid-year, the Malibu was rejoined by lower-line Chevelle models that were simply called the base Chevelle in both four-door sedans and two-door hardtops.\\r\\nIn 1971, Malibus and all other Chevelles got a new grille surrounded by single headlamps replacing the duals of previous years, and four round taillights similar to Camaros and Corvettes were located in the bumper. All engines were detuned to use lower-octane unleaded gasoline this year per GM corporate policy as a first step toward the catalytic converter-equipped cars planned for 1975 and later models which would require no-lead fuel.\\r\\nOnly new grilles highlighted the 1972 Malibu and other Chevelles. All bodystyles were carried over from 1971, but 1972 would be the final year for hardtops and convertibles as the redesigned Chevelles originally planned for this year, but delayed until 1973, would feature Colonnade styling with side pillars and frameless door windows. The 1972 Chevelle was also ordered with the police package which used RPO 9C1 (which became the default SEO (service option) code for subsequent Chevrolet PPV packages).\\r\\nThe Malibu was redesigned for the 1973 model year. Models included the base Chevelle Deluxe, mid-range Malibu and the top-line Laguna.\\r\\nFor 1974, the Deluxe was dropped, and the Malibu became the entry-level Chevelle. The Laguna trim package was replaced with the Malibu Classic that had the unusual arrangement for that time of 4 square headlights and made its way to the dealers in the 1976 model year, offering the Chevrolet built inline six 250 CID as the base engine. The Laguna S-3 model was introduced to replace the SS, and continued through 1976.\\r\\nFor the 1978 model year, the Malibu name, which had been the bestselling badge in the lineup, replaced the Chevelle name. This was Chevrolet's second downsized nameplate, following the lead of the 1977 Chevrolet Caprice. The new, more efficient platform was over a foot shorter and had shed 500 to 1,000 pounds (230 to 450?kg) compared to previous versions, yet offered increased trunk space, leg room, and head room.[1] Only two trim levels were offered - Malibu and Malibu Classic. The Malibu Classic Landau series had a two-tone paint job on the upper and lower body sections, and a vinyl top. This generation introduced the Chevrolet 90 V6 family of engines, with the 200 CID (3.3?L) V6 as the base engine for the all new 1978 Chevrolet Malibu, along with the 229 CID (3.8?L) V6 and the 305 CID (5.0?L) Chevy built V8 as options.\\r\\nThree bodystyles were produced (station wagon, sedan, and coupe), and the design was also used as the basis for the El Camino pickup truck with its own chassis. The sedan initially had a conservative six-window notchback roofline. This was in contrast to the unusual fastback rooflines adopted by Oldsmobile and Buick divisions which would later revert a more formal pillar style. To increase rear seat hip room (and encourage more orders for the high-profit air conditioner), the windows in the rear doors of four-door sedans were fixed, while the wagons had small moveable vents. With the rear window regulators no longer required, Chevrolet was able to recess the door arm rests into the door cavity, resulting in a few extra inches of rear seat room. Customers complained about the lack of rear seat ventilation. No doubt this design contributed to the number of factory air conditioning units sold with the cars, to the benefit of General Motors and Chevrolet dealers. For the 1981 model year, sedans adopted a four-window profile and \\"formal\\" pillared upright roofline. The two-door coupe was last produced in this year, as the Monte Carlo assumed the market position held by the 2-door coupe. For 1982 the Malibu was facelifted with more squared-off front styling marked by quad headlights with long, thin turn signals beneath them. The look was very reminiscent of the also recently facelifted Chevrolet Caprice. For 1983, Malibus gained a block-style \\"Malibu\\" badge on the front fenders to replace the cursive-style script located on the rear quarter panels of previous model years.\\r\\nThe four-door Malibu was commonly used in fleet service, especially for law enforcement. After the Chevrolet Nova ceased production in 1979, the mid-sized 9C1 police version (not to be confused with the full-size Chevrolet Impala 9C1 which was also available) was transferred to the Malibu, filling a void for the mid-sized police patrol cars. A 9C1-equipped Malibu with an LT-1 Z-28 Camaro engine driven by E. Pierce Marshall placed 13th of 47 in the 1979 Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, better known as the Cannonball Run.[2]\\r\\nThere was no factory Malibu SS option available from 1980. The SS only came in the El Camino. The very rare 1980 Malibu M80 was a dealer package for only North and South Carolina in an effort to revive the muscle car era. It was, however, mostly aimed at NASCAR fans who regularly traveled to Darlington Raceway. To this day, the number actually produced is unknown; estimates place this around 1,901 cars. All M80s had to be white with dark blue bucket seats and center console interior. The base of the M80 was a two-door sport coupe equipped with the F41 Sport Suspension package and the normal V8 (140?hp) drive train. The M80 option added two dark blue skunk stripes on top and a lower door stripe with the M80 identification. The package also added front and rear spoilers and 1981 steel rally wheels (sourced from the 1980 Monte Carlo).\\r\\nIn Mexico, General Motors produced this generation in the Ramos Arizpe plant, which was sold during three years (1979 to 1981). Mexican versions came in three trim levels (Chevelle, Malibu and Malibu Classic) and two body styles (sedan and coupe) with the 250?cu?in (4.1?L) I6 as basic engine and the 350?cu?in (5.7?L) 260?hp (194?kW) V8 as the optional; this engine was standard on Malibu Classic models during those three years. This was possible because the Mexican emissions regulations remained relatively free at the time.\\r\\nIn 1981, General Motors of Canada in Oshawa produced a special order of 25,500 four-door Malibu sedans for Saddam Hussein's Iraqi government. The deal was reportedly worth well over $100 million to GMCL. These special-order Malibus carried the unusual combination of GM's lowest-power carburated V6, the 110?hp (82?kW) 229?cu?in (3.8?L) engine mated to three-speed transmission with a unique on-the-floor stick shifter. All of the cars were equipped with air conditioning, heavy duty cooling systems, AM/FM cassette decks, front bench seats, 200?km/h speedometers, tough tweed and vinyl upholstery and 14-inch (360?mm) stamped steel wheels with \\"baby moon\\" hubcaps.\\r\\nHowever, only 13,000 units ever made it to Iraq, with the majority of the cars becoming taxis in Baghdad (once the cab-identifying orange paint was added to the front and rear fenders)[citation needed]. With the remaining balance of about 12,500 additional Malibus either sitting on a dock in Halifax or awaiting port shipment in Oshawa, where they were built, the Iraqis suddenly cancelled the order in 1982.[3] Excuses reportedly included various \\"quality concerns\\", including the inability of the local drivers to shift the finicky Saginaw manual transmission. This issue was eventually identified as being due to an apparent clutch release issue that eventually required on-site retrofitting by a crew of Canadian technicians sent to Iraq to support the infamous \\"Recall in the Desert\\". Later speculation was that the Iraqis were actually forced to back out for financial reasons, due to their escalating hostilities with Iran requiring the immediate diversion of funds to support the Iraqi war effort. Then GM of Canada President Donald Hackworth was initially quoted as stating GMCL intended to still try to sell the Malibus overseas in other Middle East markets; however in the end, the orphaned \\"Iraqi Taxi\\" Malibus were all sold to the Canadian public at the greatly reduced price of about C$6,800. Over the years, they have acquired a low-key 'celebrity' status, sometimes being colloquially referred to as \\"Iraqibu\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Malibu was an extensively used body style in NASCAR competition from 1973 to 1983. The Laguna S-3 variant, in particular, was successful during the 1975 through 1977 racing seasons, with Cale Yarborough wining 20 races in those years as well as winning the NASCAR championship one year. Because it was considered a limited edition model, NASCAR declared it ineligible for competition following the 1977 season, even though (given NASCARs three-year eligibility rule) it should have been allowed to run through 1979. Beginning in 1981, the downsized Malibu body style was eligible to run, but given its boxy shape, only one driver Dave Marcis ran it in 1981 and 1982, with one victory in a rain-shortened Richmond 400 at Richmond in 1982, the independent driver's last win.\\r\\n1979 Chevrolet Malibu sedan\\r\\nChevrolet Malibu coupe\\r\\n1981 Chevrolet Malibu coupe\\r\\n1982 Chevrolet Malibu wagon\\r\\nChevrolet Malibu Classic made and sold in Mexico\\r\\nThe base 200?cu?in (3.3?L) V-6 engine for the 1978 Chevrolet Malibu developed just 95?hp (71?kW; 96?PS) with optional upgrade to a 105?hp (78?kW; 106?PS) V-6, or 145?hp (108?kW; 147?PS) V-8.

The Malibu Classic was last marketed in 1982; Malibus were produced as four-door sedans and as station wagons until 1983, at which time it was fully replaced by the front-wheel-drive Chevrolet Celebrity. Although the sedan and wagon were phased out, the El Camino utility, which shared styling with the Malibu, remained in production until 1987.\\r\\nA new front-wheel drive Malibu was introduced in 1997 on an extended wheelbase version of the GM N platform shared with the Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile Achieva, Oldsmobile Alero, and Pontiac Grand Am. All N-body Malibus were produced at the Oklahoma City Assembly plant (after 2002 it was retooled to build the GMT360 SUVs) and the Wilmington Assembly plant (1997 to 1999), before moving production to Lansing, Michigan. The Wilmington plant was retooled to build the Saturn L-Series in 1999. The Oldsmobile Cutlass was a rebadged, slightly more upscale version of the Malibu, produced from 1997 ÿ 1999. It was intended as a placeholder model to fill the gap left by the discontinuation of the aging Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, before the all-new Alero arrived in 1999. The Malibu itself replaced the compact Chevrolet Corsica. Power came from a 2.4?L 150?hp (112?kW) I4 or 3.1?L 155?hp (116?kW) V6. The Malibu was Motor Trend magazine's Car of the Year for 1997; this was later criticized by Car and Driver in 2009, citing that the Malibu was insufficiently distinguishable in terms of performance or interior quality to warrant such praise in hindsight.[5]\\r\\nThe 1997 to 1999 Malibus had a front grille with the Malibu logo in silver in the center; 2000 to 2003 models, and the Classic, had the blue Chevrolet emblem on the front grille. The 1997 to 1999 LS models were sometimes equipped with special gold-colored badges (the rear Malibu lettering and logo).\\r\\nWhen a new Malibu was introduced on the Epsilon platform for 2004, the N-body Malibu was renamed Chevrolet Classic and remained in production for the 2004 and 2005 model years, being restricted to rental car companies and fleet orders.\\r\\nThe 3.1 L V6 was updated in 2000 with a new power rating of 170?hp (127?kW), and the 2.4?L 4-cylinder was dropped after that year. However, a 4-cylinder was reintroduced in 2004 when the 2.2?L Ecotec was offered on the Classic. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fuel mileage estimates for the 2.2?L Ecotec engine are 21?mpg?US (11?L/100?km; 25?mpg?imp)-31?mpg?US (7.6?L/100?km; 37?mpg?imp).\\r\\nThe February 2002 issue of HCI: Hot Compact & Imports magazine featured the Chevrolet Malibu Cruiser concept that GM Performance Division built for the SEMA show in 2001. The car was painted in \\"Sublime Lime\\" by BASF[6] and featured a highly modified turbocharged 3500 SFI 60-degree V6 (producing 230?hp (170?kW) at 5,000 rpm and 280?lb?ft (380?N?m) of torque at 2,900 rpm), a 4T65-E four-speed transmission with overdrive, a set of 19x8-inch wheels by Evo wrapped in Toyo Proxes T1-S high-performance tires. Numerous interior modifications included a full-length custom center console, four black leather Sparco racing seats, and a Kenwood entertainment center (with radio, CD, DVD, TV, 10-disc changer and numerous amps and speakers). Exterior modifications included custom HID headlamps (both low and high beams), \\"Altezza\\" style taillights, and a custom bodykit.[7]\\r\\nChevrolet produced the Cruiser as a concept, and it was therefore never available for purchase. Their intent was to attract younger buyers to the stock model and demonstrate that aftermarket modifications could be made.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Malibu name was moved to GM's new Epsilon platform based on the 2002 Opel Vectra C for 2004. The Epsilon-based Malibu came in two bodystyles, a standard 4-door sedan and a 5-door Malibu Maxx hatchback (the first mid-size Chevrolet hatchback since the 1989 Chevrolet Corsica).[9][10] The Malibu Maxx has a fixed glass roof panel over the rear seats with a retractable sunshade, and an optional glass panel sunroof over the front seats and was similar in execution to the Opel Signum, a large hatchback derived from the Vectra C.\\r\\nBase power for the sedan came from a 2.2?L Ecotec L61 I4 producing 144?hp (108?kW). LS and LT trim sedans and Maxx models originally came with a 3.5?L 201?hp (149?kW) High Value LX9 V6. The SS sedan and Maxx models were powered by the 3.9?L 240?hp (179?kW) High Value LZ9 V6.[11] For 2007, the LX9 was replaced with the LZ4 V6, which in the Malibu produced 217?hp (162?kW). The L61 Ecotec was also updated for the 2007 model year with many improvements. A remote starter was also available, which was introduced on several other GM vehicles for 2004.\\r\\nThis generation of the Malibu initially debuted with a front fascia design featuring a wide grille split horizontally by a prominent chrome bar that ran the entire width of the car, which was intended to make it resemble Chevrolet's trucks. However, for 2006, the front end was updated with more conventional styling: the chrome bar was removed, and the grille itself was made smaller, bearing a resemblance to the grille on the previous Malibu.[12] The car also added GM badges near the front doors.\\r\\nWhile the Malibu Maxx was discontinued after the 2007 model year, the Malibu sedan remained in production for fleet orders for the 2008 model year, known as the Malibu Classic. The cars themselves bear Malibu badges, unlike the past generation Classic.\\r\\nA special SS trim was available on the Malibu and Malibu Maxx with the 3.9 L LZ9 V6 from 2006 to 2007, developing 240?hp (179?kW) and 240?lb?ft (325?N?m) and channeled through a 4T65-E four-speed automatic with Tap-Up/Tap-Down shifting, sport suspension with tower-to-tower brace, 18\\" alloy wheels, universal home remote transmitter, rear spoiler and hydraulic power steering. Changes to differentiate the SS from the lower trims include three-spoke, leather wrapped steering wheel with SS badge, chrome-trimmed instruments, sport cloth and leather seats, side skirts, chrome tip exhausts, more aggressive front and rear clips and fog lights.[13]\\r\\nThe Malibu was redesigned for the 2008 model year by Bryan Nesbitt,[14] under the direction of GM Vice Chairman Robert Lutzwho was determined to make the nameplate competitive with Japanese mid-size cars. Extensive engineering and design went into the remodel.[15] This generation of Malibu came in many trim levels: the Base (2008 only) (1SB), the LS 1LS (or 1FL for fleet models 2011 and 2012), the LT 1LT (or 2FL for fleet models 2011 and 2012), the Hybrid (2008 and 2009 only), and the LTZ 1LZ. Only the top level LTZ trim package was fitted with clear brake light lenses with red LED lights, the balance of trim packages retaining red lenses with conventional brake light bulbs.\\r\\nThe seventh generation Malibu is built on a revised version of the long-wheelbase Epsilon platform shared with the Saturn Aura, the Opel Signum, and Pontiac G6. It is assembled in Kansas City, Kansas. Overall, it is three inches (76?mm) longer, with a six inches (152?mm) longer wheelbase. Interior room remains mid-size, like the previous Malibus, and has been decreased from 101 cubic feet (2.9?m3) to 97.7 cubic feet (2.8?m3), despite having a longer wheelbase, although front legroom has increased from 41.9?in (1,064?mm) to 42.2?in (1,072?mm).[11][16] Rear legroom has decreased from 38.5?in (978?mm) to 37.6?in (955?mm).[17] The interior design was revised, with a selection of two-tone color combinations (brick and tan two-tone), telescoping steering wheel, higher-quality materials and a twin-cowl dash design.[18] Drag (Cd) is at 0.33.[19]\\r\\nThe seventh generation Malibu offered these engine choices:\\r\\nThe 2.4?L I4 and 3.6?L V6 engine have aluminum blocks and heads, dual overhead cams, four valves per cylinder, twin balance shafts, and variable valve timing. The 3.5?L V6 has aluminum heads, an iron block, overhead valves, and limited variable valve timing. The 3.5?L V6 was offered as an upgrade for special-order fleet vehicles, to replace the Ecotec engine, and generally was not available for retail customers. The 3.5?L V6 was not available in the LTZ. The 3.5?L V6 with four-speed transmission has been the only drivetrain available in the 2008, 2009, and 2010 models in Israel. Partway through the 2008 model year, the 2.4?L Ecotec was offered with a six-speed automatic transmission to improve performance and fuel economy.[18]\\r\\nFor 2009 models, the six-speed transmission mated to the 2.4?L 4-cylinder engine or the 217 horsepower 3.5?L V6 mated to the four-speed automatic were made available on the 1LT; the six-speed became standard on 2LT models the same year. The LS models were equipped with the four-speed transmission only. A manual transmission was not offered.[20] All models are front-wheel-drive sedans. Chevrolet dropped the Malibu MAXX station wagon model.\\r\\nPartway through the 2010 model year, the GM badges were removed from the front doors.[21][22]\\r\\nOnStar was included on all Malibu models as standard equipment (excluding fleet vehicles, where this feature is optional). Six air bags were also standard on the seventh generation Malibu; two dual-stage front bags, two side-impact curtain air bags protecting the heads of both front and rear passengers, and two side-impact thorax bags mounted in the front seats. Traction control, electronic tire pressure monitoring system, four-wheel disc brakes, antilock brakes, and daytime running lamps were standard included safety features on all Malibus. GM's StabiliTrak brand electronic stability control was standard on all models including the very base LS model.\\r\\nIn 2011, the base LS 1LS Malibu gained more standard features, like Bluetooth technology with stereo audio playback capability, a remote USB and iPod/iPhone port, remote start, a security alarm, an upgraded OnStar system, power front driver's seat, chrome hubcap wheel covers, body-colored side mirrors with power adjustments and body-colored accents, a single wood dashboard accent, tinted windows, and a six-speed automatic transmission with overdrive and manual shift capabilities. The LT 1LT model lost its available eight-speaker Bose premium sound system. The LT 2LT got a package that included a sunroof, leather power heated seats, and more convenience and comfort features. For 2011, the four-speed automatic transmission was dropped from the Malibu powertrain lineup.[23] This same model year also saw the deletion of the steering wheel mounted paddle shifters on 6AT cars in favor of a selector mounted rocker switch for manual operation; no reason was ever given for the change.\\r\\nA BAS mild hybrid, with the base inline-4 like the Saturn Aura Green Line, was available offering an increased fuel economy of 24?mpg?US (9.8?L/100?km; 29?mpg?imp)/32?mpg?US (7.4?L/100?km; 38?mpg?imp), which for the 2009 model was increased to 26?mpg?US (9.0?L/100?km; 31?mpg?imp)/34?mpg?US (6.9?L/100?km; 41?mpg?imp). The Malibu hybrid was dropped for the 2010 model year.[24][25]\\r\\nThe 2008 Malibu received critical praise from the automotive press, with The New York Times referring to it as being \\"like a super Accord, but from GM\\" and Car and Driver magazine declaring, \\"Camry, Beware.\\" It also garnered high praise from Motor Trend magazine, being rated higher than the Honda Accord and Nissan Altima in the magazine's 2008 Car of The Year competition. Kelley Blue Book named it the \\"2008 best redesigned vehicle\\".[26] Car and Driver stated that while it would not be \\"enough to steal the top-dog sales title from the perennial Honda and Toyota mid-sizers\\", they noted \\"for the first time since Chevrolet revived the storied nameplate in 1997, it has enough of what it needs to sell in significant numbers to the public, not just rental fleets\\".[27]\\r\\nEdmunds.com praised the Malibu's interior and exterior styling, quietness, and balance between ride and handling, while criticizing the thick C-pillars that obstruct the driver's view, the narrower chassis compared to other midsize cars[28] (which reduces rear seating room and also lacks a center armrest) and lack of features such as dual-zone HVAC, Bluetooth compatibility, and keyless ignition.[29]\\r\\nWhile Robert Cumberford, design critic at Automobile magazine noted the interior of the platform-variant, the Saturn Aura featured cheap interior materials, he noted improved in the Malibu.[30][31] Writers of various reviews[who?] for the 2008 Malibu believed Chevrolet would be getting back on track in quality and excitement in the mid-size segment after a history of ordinary, bland offerings, such as the Celebrity, Corsica, Lumina, and even the previous two generations of Malibu since its 1997 revival.\\r\\nIn January 2008, the redesigned Malibu received the North American Car of the Year award at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in voting among a panel of 50 automotive journalists in a field of entries, with the runners up being the 2008 Cadillac CTS and the 2008 Honda Accord. The Malibu's win marked the second straight year a car built on GM's Epsilon platform won the North American COTY award with the 2007 North American COTY award having gone to the 2007 Saturn Aura.\\r\\nInitial sales results were positive, with the Malibu joining the Cadillac CTS and Buick Enclave on a list of GM vehicles whose sales have exceeded expectations. The redesigned Malibu sold more than 50% more units in 2008 than in 2007, increasing GM's mid-size market share to 8.4% from 5.7%, while the Camry and Accord percentages remained flat at about 21% and 17.5%, according to GM. Sales to rental customers dropped to 27% of the total, as GM limited sales to rental fleets.[15][32]\\r\\nThe short-lived Malibu Hybrid, along with its sister, the Saturn Aura Green Line, which share the powertrain and other major components, was particularly criticized due to its lack of fuel savings and cost (relative to a standard 4-cylinder Malibu), plus the Hybrid's worsened driving dynamics.[25][33]\\r\\nOn September 21, 2012. General Motors recalled 473,841 vehicles involving the Chevrolet Malibu, Pontiac G6 and Saturn Aura from model years 2007 through 2010 equipped with four-speed automatic transmissions. The problem is a condition that could make cars roll when in park. The recall affected 426,240 in the United States, 40,029 in Canada and 7,572 in other markets.[34][35]\\r\\nThe 2013 Malibu moved to GM Epsilon II platform and debuted in Asia in late 2011, followed by North America in 2012.[40] The new Malibu became a global vehicle, replacing both the North American Malibu and GM Korea vehicles previously sold around the world. The Malibu was unveiled as a show car simultaneously at Auto Shanghai in China (written as \\"D?O?\\", Mai-Rui-Bao [41]), and on Facebook, on April 18, 2011.[42][43] It was also shown at the New York International Auto Show in New York City later in April.\\r\\nThe eighth generation Malibu was available in the trim levels LS 1LS (not available for fleet-ordered models), the LT 1LT (this is the base model for fleet-ordered models), the LT 2LT, the ECO 1SB, the ECO 2SA, and the LTZ 1LZ. Both ECO models officially went on sale in the spring of 2012, with the gas-only models following in late summer 2012. The Turbo models followed in early 2013.\\r\\nAll models, aside from the LS 1LS, were equipped with a large touch-screen display using Chevrolet's MyLink and offering Pandora Internet Radio playback capabilities via a USB cable and an iPhone 4, 4S, or 5. SiriusXM Travel Link was also included on all navigation-equipped Malibu models.\\r\\nThe eighth generation Malibu was offered with four-cylinder engines and six-speed automatic transmissions. The European version is offered with a 2.4 L Ecotec engine, which uses an aluminum block and cylinder head and a 2.0 L Diesel (1,956 cc) VCDi developing 160?PS (120?kW) (this was the only engine available in Italy).[44][45] The Middle-East version was offered with the 2.4 L Ecotec engine. Also available was a 3.0 L V6 engine making 260?hp and 290NM, available on LTZ trim.[46] The Australian market had two versions on offer: CD (2.4 L Otto) and CDX (2.0 L Diesel)[47] The North American version was offered in 2.5L.\\r\\nStandard safety features on the eighth generation Malibu include dual-stage front airbags for the driver and front passenger, along with pelvic/thorax side-impact and knee airbags up front also. Roof rail airbags with rollover protection are standard. Also available as option extras are second-row head/thorax side-impact airbags, lane departure warning system with forward collision alert and a rearview camera system.[48]\\r\\nThe eighth generation Malibu was sold in \\"nearly 100 countries on six continents\\". In the United States, it is manufactured in two plants, Fairfax, KS and Detroit-Hamtramck.[49] In Australia and New Zealand, the Malibu replaced the Holden Epica, and made its debut in 2013 as the Holden Malibu. It is positioned between the Holden Cruze and Holden Commodore.[50] In South Korea, the Malibu replaces the Daewoo Tosca, as GM has phased-out the Daewoo brand in favor of Chevrolet. Korea was the first market to get the Malibu, in late 2011, followed by China later in 2011 and North America beginning in early 2012.[51] The Malibu made its Middle Eastern debut in 2012 replacing the Holden VE Commodore based Lumina. In Europe, the Malibu replaced the Chevrolet Epica. The facelifted Malibu was never sold in Europe.\\r\\nIn North America, the eighth generation Malibu continued to be sold in 2016 as the Malibu Limited as the next generation went on sale.[37][52] However, as Malibu Limited was designed as a fleet car, it was offered without the auto stop feature and with a different engine variant (LCV instead of LKW).\\r\\nIn a March 2012 comparison test by Car and Driver, the light electrification\\" Chevrolet Malibu Eco hybrid came in sixth place out of six cars.[53] It should be noted that the Eco is not a Malibu LS, LT, or LTZ. The Malibu Eco was criticized for its reduced wheelbase, causing a 0.8\\" reduction in legroom for back seat passengers. The interior was also criticized for being disappointing and cramped. The ride, however, was said to be smooth and quiet, with the only problem being the stiff steering.[54]\\r\\nThe 2014 Chevrolet Malibu received the highest score in its class from J.D. Power's 2014 Initial Quality Study.[55] The IQS study \\"examines problems experienced by vehicle owners during the first 90 days of ownership.\\" [56]\\r\\nEighteen months after the 2013 Malibu's debut, it received a mild refresh. The changes included additional technology, improved fuel economy, and a sportier front end that more closely matched the refreshed Chevrolet Traverse and the newly redesigned Chevrolet Impala. Chevrolet also made some minor changes to the center console to deliver a longer, ostensibly more comfortable armrest, and replaced the former covered storage area with a pair of cup holders and two cell-phone bins. The Chinese model received a refreshed front end with revised headlights.[57]\\r\\nAmong the technology that Chevrolet debuted on the 2014 Malibu was a new six-speed transmission. Because the transmission was designed to reduce the energy required to pump transmission fluid, it contributed to fuel savings on the refreshed Malibu. In addition, for the first time in a non-hybrid GM vehicle, an engine stop/start system came standard with the 2.5?L engine.[58] EPA fuel-economy estimates showed an improvement to 25/36 mpg city/highway, up from the 2013 model's 22/34 for the base 2.5?L engine.[59] The 2014 Malibu was available for purchase in late 2013.[60]\\r\\nOn April 1, 2015, Chevrolet unveiled a redesigned Malibu at the 2015 New York Auto Show, which went on sale in late 2015 as a 2016 model. The updated Malibu featured a sleeker, yet larger design similar to its full sized Impala. The wheelbase was increased almost four inches, creating more interior space; but the fuel efficiency is improved, as it is nearly 300 pounds lighter than the eighth generation model.[66] The 2016 Malibu was offered in four trims: L, LS, LT, and Premier (replacing the LTZ trim).\\r\\nThe Malibu features an all-new, LFV Ecotec 1.5L turbo that is standard, while a 2.0?L turbocharged engine is offered as an optional feature. No six-cylinders are offered from now. Other new features on the ninth-generation Malibu that were introduced for the 2016 model year include available OnStar 4G LTE in-vehicle connectivity, as well as available wireless phone charging, preventive safety technologies including ten standard air bags featuring forward collision avoidance system rear cross traffic alerts, and an optional automatic parking assist. It features Forward Collision Alert with Following Distance Indicator, Adaptive Cruise Control with Front Automatic Braking, and Front Pedestrian Alert with last-second automatic braking.[67] It is also installed with start-stop ignition once the engine is at operating temperature and the brake is applied while the vehicle is stopped.\\r\\nThe 2016 Malibu features a first for the automotive industry, a teen driver feature, which allows parents to view their kids' driving statistics, such as maximum speed, warning alerts and more.[66] To operate the vehicle a parent enables the feature with a PIN in the settings menu of the Malibu's MyLink system, which allows them to register their teen's key fob. The system's settings are turned on only to registered key fobs.[68] This technology also mutes the radio until the seat belts are buckled.[68] The 2016 Malibu comes equipped with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto Capability features. However, only one of their phone brands at any one time can be used.[69][70]\\r\\nA few months ahead of the 2016 model arriving in dealerships, Chevrolet announced that the Malibu had hit a milestone, with more than 10 million sold worldwide since the car was introduced 51 years earlier.[71] China and South Korea are currently the only two countries outside of North America where the 2016 Malibu is sold.\\r\\nThe ninth generation Malibu offers a full hybrid model for the first time, featuring a 1.8?L four-cylinder engine mated to a two-motor drive unit, providing additional power to assist the engine during acceleration for 182 horsepower of total system power. An Exhaust Gas Heat Recovery system allows the engine and cabin to warm up during winter conditions, while an 80-cell, 1.5 kWh lithium-ion battery pack provides electric power to the hybrid system, powering the Malibu Hybrid up to 55?mph (89?km/h) on electricity alone, while the gasoline-powered engine automatically comes on at higher speeds and loads to provide additional power. The Malibu Hybrid uses a transmission (\\"two motor drive unit\\" in GM terms) similar to the second generation Chevrolet Volt,[67] but a much smaller battery, no plug-in option and a different engine.\\r\\nThe following table compares the fuel economy for all variants of the 2016 model year Malibu.\\r\\nChevrolet updated the Malibu in 2018 for the 2019 model year.[73] A new larger front grille, split by a chrome bar with the Chevrolet bow-tie, dominates the front, while the rear change is less significant. A new RS trim-line is added for a sportier appearance, with a black grille, unique 18-inch wheels, and dual exhaust. The touchscreen is replaced with the 8-inch Chevrolet Infotainment 3. The standard 1.5 L engine is now paired with a CVT instead of the 6-speed automatic transmission.","input":"What kind of car is a chevy malibu?"},{"output":"The European Plain","context":"The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the Central and Interior Lowlands.[1] It is the largest mountain-free landform in Europe, although a number of highlands are identified within it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plain stretches from the Pyrenees mountains and the French coast of the Bay of Biscay in the west to the Russian Ural Mountains in the east.[2] Its shores are washed to the west and northwest by waters of the Atlantic basin, to the northeast - the Arctic basin, and to the southeast - the Mediterranean basin.

Their ancestors historically inhabited much of what is now East Texas, Louisiana, and portions of southern Arkansas and Oklahoma. They were descendants of the Caddoan Mississippian culture that constructed huge earthwork mounds at several sites in this territory. In the early 19th century, Caddo people were forced to a reservation in Texas; they were removed to Indian Territory in 1859.\\r\\nToday, the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma is a federally recognized tribe with its capital at Binger, Oklahoma. Descendants of the historic Caddo tribes, with documentation of at least ?1?16 ancestry, are eligible to enroll as members in the Caddo Nation.

The tribal constitution provides for election of an eight-person council, with a chairperson, that is based in Binger, Oklahoma.[2]\\r\\nThe tribe operates its own housing authority and issues its own tribal vehicle tags. It also operates an administrative center, dance grounds, several community centers, the Caddo Nation Heritage Museum, and an active NAGPRA office, located south of Binger.[3] As of 2012, 5,757 people are enrolled in the nation, with 3,044 living within the state of Oklahoma.[3] Individuals are required to document at least 1/16 Caddo ancestry in order to enroll as citizens.\\r\\nIn July 2016, Tamara M.

It sponsors a summer culture camp for children.[4] The Hasinai Society[5] and Caddo Culture Club[6] both teach and perform Caddo songs and dances to keep the tradition alive and pass it on to the next generations. The Kiwat Hasinay Foundation is dedicated to preserving and increasing use of the Caddo language.[7]\\r\\nThe Caddo are thought to be an extension of Woodland period peoples, the Fourche Maline and Mossy Grove cultures, whose members were living in the area of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas between 200 BCE and 800 CE.[8] The Wichita and Pawnee are related to the Caddo, as both tribes speak Caddoan languages.\\r\\nBy 800 CE, this society had begun to coalesce into the Caddoan Mississippian culture. Some villages began to gain prominence as ritual centers. Leaders directed the construction of major earthworks, serving as temple mounds and platforms for residences of the elite. The flat-topped mounds were arranged around leveled, large, open plazas, which were usually kept swept clean and were often used for ceremonial occasions. As complex religious and social ideas developed, some people and family lineages gained prominence over others.[8] By 1000 CE, a society that is defined by archaeologists as \\"Caddoan\\" had emerged. By 1200, the many villages, hamlets, and farmsteads established throughout the Caddo world had developed extensive maize agriculture, producing a surplus that allowed for greater density of settlement.[8] In these villages, artisans and craftsmen developed specialties. The artistic skills and earthwork mound-building of the Caddoan Mississippians flourished during the 12th and 13th centuries.[9]\\r\\nThe Spiro Mounds, near the Arkansas River in present-day southeastern Oklahoma, were some of the most elaborate mounds in the United States. They were made by Mississippian ancestors of the historic Caddo and Wichita tribes, in what is considered the westernmost point of the Mississippian culture.[10] The Caddo were farmers and enjoyed good growing conditions most of the time. The Piney Woods, the geographic area where they lived, was affected by the Great Drought from 1276ÿ1299 CE, which covered an area extending to present-day California and disrupted many Native American cultures.[11]\\r\\nArcheological evidence has confirmed that the cultural continuity is unbroken from prehistory to the present among these peoples. The Caddoan Mississippian people were the direct ancestors of the historic Caddo people and related Caddo-language speakers who encountered the first Europeans, as well as of the modern Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.[12]\\r\\nCaddo oral history of their creation story says the tribe emerged from an underground cave, called Chahkanina or \\"the place of crying,\\" located at the confluence of the Red River of the South and Mississippi River in northern present-day Louisiana. Their leader, named Moon, instructed the people not to look back. An old Caddo man carried with him a drum, a pipe, and fire, all of which have continued to be important religious items to the people. His wife carried corn and pumpkin seeds. As people and accompanying animals emerged, the wolf looked back. The exit from the underground closed to the remaining people and animals.[13]\\r\\nThe Caddo peoples moved west along the Red River, which they called Bah'hatteno in Caddo.[14] A Caddo woman, Zacado, instructed the tribe in hunting, fishing, home construction, and making clothing. Caddo religion focuses on Kadhi hyuh, translating to \\"Lord Above\\" or \\"Lord of the Sky.\\" In early times, the people were led by priests, including a head priest, the xinesi, who could commune with spirits residing near Caddo temples.[13] A cycle of ceremonies developed around important periods of corn cultivation. Tobacco was and is used ceremonially. Early priests drank a purifying sacrament made of wild olive leaves.[15]\\r\\nCenturies before extensive European contact, some of the Caddo territory was invaded by migrating Dhegihan-speaking peoples, Osage, Ponca, Omaha, and Kaw, who moved west beginning about 1200 due to years of warfare with the Iroquois in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky. The Iroquois took control of hunting grounds in the area. The Osage particularly fought the Caddo, pushed them out of some former territory, and became dominant in the region of present-day Missouri, Arkansas, and eastern Kansas. These tribes had become settled in their new territory west of the Mississippi prior to mid-18th-century European contact.[16]\\r\\nMost of the Caddo historically lived in the Piney Woods ecoregion of the United States, divided among the state regions of East Texas, southern Arkansas, western Louisiana, and southeastern Oklahoma. This region extends up to the foothills of the Ozarks. The Piney Woods are a dense forest of deciduous and pinophyta flora covering rolling hills, steep river valleys, and intermittent wetlands called \\"bayous\\". Caddo people primarily settled near the Caddo River.\\r\\nWhen they first encountered Europeans and Africans, the Caddo tribes organized themselves in three confederacies: the Natchitoches, Hasinai, and Kadohadacho. They were loosely affiliated with other neighboring tribes including the Yowani a Choctaw band. The Natchitoches lived in now northern Louisiana, the Haisinai lived in East Texas, and the Kadohadacho lived near the border of Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.[17]\\r\\nThe Caddo people had a diet based on cultivated crops, particularly maize (corn), but also sunflower, pumpkins, and squash. These foods held cultural significance, as did wild turkeys. They hunted and gathered wild plants, as well.\\r\\nThe Caddo first encountered Europeans and Africans in 1541 when the Spanish Hernando de Soto Expedition came through their lands.[18] De Soto's force had a violent clash with one band of Caddo Indians, the Tula people, near present-day Caddo Gap, Arkansas. This historic event has been marked by the modern town with a monument.\\r\\nFrench explorers in the early 18th century encountered the Natchitoche in northern Louisiana. They were followed by fur traders from outposts along the Gulf Coast, and later by missionaries from France and Spain, who also traveled among the people. The Europeans carried infections such as smallpox and measles, because these were endemic in their societies. As the Caddo peoples had no acquired immunity to such new diseases, they suffered epidemics with high fatalities that decimated the tribal populations. Influenza and malaria also devastated the Caddo.[16]\\r\\nFrench traders built forts with trading posts near Caddo villages. These stations attracted more French and other European settlers. Among such settlements are the present-day communities of Elysian Fields and Nacogdoches, Texas, and Natchitoches, Louisiana. In the latter two towns, early explorers and settlers kept the original Caddo names of the villages.\\r\\nHaving given way over years before the power of the former Ohio Valley tribes, the later Caddo negotiated for peace with the waves of Spanish, French, and finally Anglo-American settlers. After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, by which the United States took over the former French colonial territory west of the Mississippi River, the US government sought to ally with the Caddo peoples. During the War of 1812, American generals such as William Henry Harrison, William Clark, and Andrew Jackson crushed pro-British uprisings among other Southeast Indians, in particular the Creeks. Due to the Caddo's neutrality and their importance as a source of information for the Louisiana Territory government, they were left alone. In the 1830s, the federal government embarked on a program of Indian removal of tribes from the Southeast in order to enable European-American settlement, as new migrants pressed from the east.[19]\\r\\nIn 1835 the Kadohadacho, the northernmost Caddo confederacy, signed a treaty with the US to relocate to independent Mexico (in the area of present-day East Texas). Then lightly settled by Mexican colonists, this area was being rapidly transformed by greatly increased immigration of European Americans. In 1836, the Anglo-Americans declared independence from Mexico and established the Republic of Texas, an independent nation.[14] The name \\"Texas\\" is derived from the Hasinai word tysha, meaning \\"friend\\".[20]\\r\\nOn December 29, 1845, Texas was admitted to the US as a state. At that time, the federal government forced the relocation of both the Hasinai and the Kadohadacho as well as remnants of allied Delaware (Lenape) and Yowani onto the Brazos Reservation. Pressures increased on the Brazos Reservation Indians to remove north, culminating in a violent attack on December 26, 1858 on a Caddo encampment just off the reservation. This vigilante group led by Captain Peter Garland was a vigilante force from Erath County. The Caddo group was led by Choctaw Tom who was a Yowani Choctaw married to a Hasinai woman, who was killed in this fight along with twenty-seven other Indians.[21] In 1859, many of the Caddo were relocated again to Indian Territory north of Texas, in present-day Oklahoma. After the Civil War, the Caddo were concentrated on a reservation located between the Washita and Canadian rivers in Indian Territory.[14]\\r\\nIn the late 19th century, the Caddo took up the Ghost Dance religion, which was widespread among American Indian nations in the West. John Wilson, a Caddo-Lenape medicine man who spoke only Caddo, was an influential leader in the Ghost Dance. In 1880, Wilson became a peyote roadman. The tribe had known the Half Moon peyote ceremony, but Wilson introduced the Big Moon ceremony to them.[22] The Caddo tribe remains very active in the Native American Church today.\\r\\nCongress passed the Dawes Act to promote assimilation of tribes in Indian Territory. It authorized distribution of tribal communal landholdings into allotments for individual households in order for them to establish subsistence family farms along the European-American model. Any tribal lands remaining after such allotments were to be declared \\"surplus\\" and sold, including to non-Native Americans. The allotment system was intended to extinguish tribal Native American land claims to enable admission of Oklahoma as a state and assimilate Native Americans into the majority culture. At the same time, tribal governments were to be ended. The territory had already been settled by numerous European Americans outside the tribal territories.\\r\\nThe Caddo vigorously opposed allotment. Whitebread, a Caddo leader, said, \\"because of their peaceful lives and friendship to the white man, and through their ignorance were not consulted, and have been ignored and stuck away in a corner and allowed to exist by sufferance.\\"[14] Tribal governments were dismantled at this time, and Native Americans were expected to act as state and US citizens. After some period, the adverse effects of these changes were recognized. The Caddo and other Native American peoples suffered greatly from the disruption of the loss of their lands and breakup of their traditional cultures.\\r\\nUnder the federal Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936, the Caddo restored their tribal government. They adopted a written constitution and a process of electing officials. They organized in 1938 as the Caddo Indian Tribe of Oklahoma. They ratified their constitution on 17 January 1938.[2] In 1976, they drafted a new constitution, which continues elected representative government. During the 20th century, Caddo leaders such as Melford Williams, Harry Guy, Hubert Halfmoon, and Vernon Hunter have helped shape the tribe.[14]\\r\\nIn a special election on 29 June 2002, the tribe adopted six amendments to the constitution. Tribal enrollment is open to individuals with a documented minimum of 1/16 degree Caddo blood quantum.[24]\\r\\nSometimes, severe disagreements have developed among factions of the tribe that have not been resolved in elections. In August 2013, a group led by Philip Smith attempted to recall Brenda Shemayme Edwards, the chairman of the Tribal Council. This faction conducted a new election, but the victor stepped down, and Edwards refused to leave office. In October 2013, Smith and his supporters broke into the Caddo Nation headquarters. They chained the front doors from the inside and blocked off the entrance to the administration building. The opposition called the Bureau of Indian Affairs Police.[25]\\r\\nOperation of the tribe was split between two factions. The Court of Indian Offenses, which had been overseeing issues for a year because of the internal conflict, in October 2014 ordered a new election for all positions.[26][27]\\r\\nIn the January 2015 elections, all the top tribal positions were won by women: Tamara Michele Francis as chair, Carol D. Ross as vice chair, Jennifer Reeder as secretary, and Wildena G. Moffer as treasurer.[28]\\r\\nIn July 2016, Tamara M. Francis was re-elected as the Chairman of the Caddo Nation. The Council consists of Chairman Francis, Vice Chairman Carol D. Ross, Acting Secretary Philip Martin, Treasurer Marilyn McDonald, Oklahoma City Representative Jennifer Wilson, Binger Representative Marilyn Threlkeld, Fort Cobb Representative Maureen Owings.\\r\\n(Chairman Francis is the daughter of the first elected female Chairman, Mary Pat Francis.

Lebanese Arabic pronunciation: [e???a?eb ell?b?ne?ne]) are the people inhabiting or originating from Lebanon. The religious groups among the Lebanese people are Shias (27%), Sunnis (27%), Maronites (21%), Greek Orthodox (8%), Melkites who are Greek Catholics (5%), Druze (5.6%), 6.5 Other Christians such as Armenians Syrians, Assyrians and Copts, and Protestants (1%).[29] There is a large diaspora in North America, South America, Europe, Australia and Africa. The term may also include those who had inhabited Mount Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains prior to the creation of the modern Lebanese state.\\r\\nAs the relative proportion of the various sects is politically sensitive, Lebanon has not collected official census data on ethnic background since the 1932 under the French Mandate. It is therefore difficult to have an exact demographic analysis of Lebanese society.[30] The largest concentration of people of Lebanese ancestry may be in Brazil having an estimated population of 5.8 to 7 million, but it may be an exaggeration, given that an official survey conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) showed that less than 1 million Brazilians claimed any Middle-Eastern origin.[5] The Lebanese have always traveled the world, many of them settling permanently, most notably in the last two centuries.\\r\\nReduced in numbers and estimated to have lost their status as a majority in Lebanon itself, largely as a result of their emigration, Christians still remain one of the principal religious groups in the country.[31] Descendants of Lebanese Christians make up the majority of Lebanese people worldwide, appearing principally in the diaspora.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people residing in Lebanonboth those who would become Muslim and the vast majority who would remain Christian, along with the tiny Jewish minoritystill spoke Aramaic,[33] or more precisely, a Western Aramaic language.[27] However, since at least the 15th century, the majority of people of all faiths living in what is now Lebanon have been Arabic-speaking,[34][35] or more specifically, speakers of Lebanese Arabic, although up until the 17th century, travellers in the Lebanon still reported on several Aramaic-speaking villages.[36]\\r\\nAmong the Lebanese Maronites, Aramaic still remains the liturgical language of the Maronite Church, although in an Eastern Aramaic form (the Syriac language,[37] in which early Christianity was disseminated throughout the Middle East), distinct from the spoken Aramaic of Lebanon, which was a Western Aramaic language. As the second of two liturgical languages of Judaism, Aramaic was also retained as a language in the sphere of religion (in the Talmud) among Lebanese Jews, although here too in an Eastern Aramaic form (the Talmud was composed in Babylonia in Babylonian Aramaic). Among Lebanese Muslims, however, Aramaic was lost twice, once in the shift to Arabic in the vernacular (Lebanese Arabic) and again in the religious sphere, since Arabic (Qur'anic Arabic) is the liturgical language of Islam.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome Lebanese Christians particularly Maronites, identify themselves as Lebanese rather than Arab, seeking to draw \\"on the Phoenician past to try to forge an identity separate from the prevailing Arab culture\\".[38] They argue that Arabization merely represented a shift to the Arabic language as the vernacular of the Lebanese people, and that, according to them, no actual shift of ethnic identity, much less ancestral origins, occurred. with their own histories and lore, and that therefore they do not belong to the one pan-Arab ethnicity, and thus such categorisation is erred or inapplicable. Certain portions of Lebanon's Christian population in particular tend to stress aspects of Lebanon's non-Arab prior history to encompass all Lebanon's historical stages, instead of considering the beginning of Lebanese history being with the Arab conquests.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn light of this \\"old controversy about identity\\",[38] some Lebanese prefer to see Lebanon, Lebanese culture and themselves as part of \\"Mediterranean\\" and \\"Levantine\\" civilization, in a concession to Lebanon's various layers of heritage, both indigenous, foreign non-Arab, and Arab. Arab influence, nevertheless, applies to virtually all aspects of the modern Lebanese culture.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe total population of Lebanese people is estimated at 13-18 million. Of these, the vast majority, or 8.6[2] - 14[3] million, are in the Lebanese diaspora (outside of Lebanon), and approximately 4.3 million in Lebanon itself.[29]\\r\\nThere are approximately 4.3 million Lebanese people in Lebanon.[29]\\r\\nIn addition to this figure, there are an additional 1 million foreign workers, mainly Syrians and about 400,000 Palestinian refugees in the nation.[40]\\r\\nLebanon is also a home to various ethnic minorities found refuge in the country over the centuries. Prominent ethnic minorities in the country include the Armenians, the Kurds, the Turks, the Assyrians, the Iranians and many European ethnicities (Greeks, Italians, French).\\r\\nThere are also a small number of nomadic Dom Gypsies[citation needed] (part of the Roma people of South Asian, particularly, Indian descent)\\r\\nIn 1994, the Lebanese government estimated there were 15.4 million Lebanese immigrants worldwide with 43.2% living in Brazil (1996) and 26.1% of these residing in the USA.[41]\\r\\nThe Lebanese diaspora consists of approximately 8.6[2] - 14[3] million, both Lebanese-born living abroad and those born-abroad of Lebanese descent. The majority of the Lebanese in the diaspora are Christians,[42] disproportionately so in the Americas where the vast majority reside. An estimate figure show that they represent about 75% of the Lebanese in total. Lebanese abroad are considered \\"rich, educated and influential\\"[43] and over the course of time immigration has yielded Lebanese \\"commercial networks\\" throughout the world.[44]\\r\\nThe largest number of Lebanese is to be found in Brazil, where according to the Brazilian and Lebanese governments claim, there are 7 million Brazilians of Lebanese descent.[6][7][8] These figures, however, may be an exaggeration given that, according to a 2008 survey conducted by IBGE, in 2008, covering only the states of Amazonas, Paraba, S?o Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, Mato Grosso and Distrito Federal, 0.9% of white Brazilian respondents said they had family origins in the Middle East[5]\\r\\nLarge numbers also reside elsewhere in North America, most notably in the United States (489,702),[45] Mexico (400,000)[46] with close to half a million in both countries. In Canada, the people of full or partial Lebanese descent are between 190,275 (by ancestry, 2011 Census)[47] to 250,000 based on estimates.[48] In the rest of the Americas, significant communities are found in Argentina,[9] Chile,[49] Colombia[10] and Venezuela, with almost every other Latin American country having at least a small presence.\\r\\nIn Africa, Ghana and the Ivory Coast are home to over 100,000 Lebanese.[50] There are significant Lebanese populations in other countries throughout Western and Central Africa.[51][52] Australia hosts over 180,000 and Canada 250,000. In the Arab world, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf harbour around 400,000 Lebanese.[53] Lebanese people also can be found in all of the 28 member states of the European Union. More than 2,500 ex-SLA members remain in Israel.[54]\\r\\nCurrently, Lebanon provides no automatic right to Lebanese citizenship for emigrants who lost their citizenship upon acquiring the citizenship of their host country, nor for the descendants of emigrants born abroad. This situation disproportionately affects Christians. Recently, the Maronite Institution of Emigrants called for the establishment of an avenue by which emigrants who lost their citizenship may regain it, or their overseas-born descendants (if they so wish) may acquire it.[55]\\r\\nS?o Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, Mato Grosso and Distrito Federal, 0.9% of\\r\\nwhite Brazilian respondents said they had family origins in the Middle East.[5]\\r\\nNote: An important percentage of Arabs in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, Bulgaria, Denmark, Austria, Romania, Serbia, Republic of Macedonia, Italy, Portugal, Spain, New Zealand, Ghana and Ivory Coast are of Lebanese ancestry. They are denoted ** for this purpose.\\r\\nLebanese diaspora:\\r\\nEurope\\r\\nOverseas\\r\\nMiddle East\\r\\nLebanon has several different main religions. The country has the most religiously diverse society in the Middle East, encompassing 17 recognized religious sects.[63] The main two religions are Christianity (the Maronite Church, the Greek Orthodox Church, the Melkite, the Protestant Church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Armenian Catholic Church) and Islam (Shia and Sunni). There is also the Druze quasi-Muslim sect.\\r\\nNo official census has been taken since 1932, reflecting the political sensitivity in Lebanon over confessional (i.e. religious) balance.[64]\\r\\nA study conducted by Statistics Lebanon, a Beirut-based research firm, cited by the United States Department of State found that of Lebanon's population of approximately 4.3 million is estimated to be:[29]\\r\\nThere are also very small numbers of other religions such as Judaism, Mormons, Bah' Faith, and also religions practiced by foreigner workers like Buddhism and Hinduism.[29]\\r\\nThe CIA World Factbook specifies that of those residing in Lebanon, 59.7% are Muslims (Shia, Sunni, Druze, Sufi and Alawites) and 39% are Christians (mostly Maronites, Greek Orthodox, Melkite, Armenian Apostolic Church, Armenian Catholic Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Syriac Orthodox, Chaldean Catholic, Syriac Catholics) and 1.3% \\"Other\\".[1]\\r\\nThe International Foundation for Electoral Systems provides source for the registered voters in Lebanon for 2011[65] (it has to be noted that voter registration does not include people under 18 and unregistered voters) that puts the numbers as following: Sunni Islam 27.65?%, Shia Islam 27.34%, Maronite Catholic 21.05%, Greek Orthodox 7.34%, Druze 5.74%, Melkite Catholic 4.76%, Armenian Apostolic 2.64%, other Christian Minorities 1.28%, Alawite Shia Islam 0.88%, Armenian Catholic 0.62%, Evangelical Protestant 0.53%, and other 0.18% of the population.\\r\\nHowever, as soon as the diaspora is included, the Christians become an absolute majority. Lebanon has a population of Mhallamis also known as Mardinli), most of whom migrated from northeast Syria and southeast Turkey are estimated to be between 75,000 and 100,000 and considered to be part of the Sunni population. These have in recent years been granted Lebanese citizenship and, coupled with several civil wars between Islamic extremists and the Lebanese military that have caused many Christians to flee the country, have re-tipped the demographic balance in favour of the Muslims and the Sunnis in particular.[66] In addition, many thousands of Arab Bedouins in the Bekaa and in the Wadi Khaled region, who are entirely Sunnis, were granted Lebanese citizenship. Lebanon also has a Jewish population, estimated at less than 100.\\r\\nEven though Lebanon is a secular country, family matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith. Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities but civil marriages held in another country are recognized by Lebanese civil authorities.\\r\\nLegally registered Muslims form around 54% of the population (Shia, Sunni, Alawite). Legally registered Christians form up to 41% (Maronite, Greek Orthodox Christian, Melkite, Armenian, Evangelical, other). Druze form around 5%. A small minority of 0.1% includes Jews, and foreign workers who belong to Hindu and Buddhist religions.\\r\\nEven though non-religion is not recognized by the state, in 2009, the Minister of the Interior Ziad Baroud made it possible to have the religious sect removed from the Lebanese identity card, this does not, however, deny the religious authorities complete control over civil family issues inside the country.[67][68]\\r\\nAccording to a study published by the American Journal of Human Genetics, present-day Lebanese derive most of their ancestry from a Canaanite-related population, which therefore implies substantial genetic continuity in the Levant since at least the Bronze Age.[69][70] More specifically, according to Chris Tyler-Smith, a geneticist and his colleagues at the Sanger Institute in Britain, who compared \\"sampled ancient DNA from five Canaanite people who lived 3,750 and 3,650 years ago\\" to modern people. \\"The comparison revealed that 90 percent of the genetic ancestry of people in Lebanon came from the Canaanites. (The other 10 percent was of a Eurasian steppe population.)\\"[71]\\r\\nIn recent years efforts have been made by various genetic researchers,[who?] both in Lebanon and abroad, to identify the ancestral origins of the Lebanese people, their relationship to each other, and to other neighbouring and distant human populations. Like most DNA studies that attempt to identify a population's origins and migration patterns in the region that may have influenced the genetic make-upthese studies have focused on two human genome segments, the Y chromosome (inherited only by males and passed only by fathers) and mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA, which passes only from mother to child). Both segments are unaffected by recombination, thus they provide an indicator of paternal and maternal origins, respectively.[citation needed]\\r\\nTheories from some studies propose to corroborate that the Lebanese trace genetic continuity with earlier inhabitants, regardless of their membership to any of Lebanon's different religious communities today. \\"The genetic marker which identifies descendants of the ancient Levantines is found among members of all of Lebanon's religious communities\\"[72] as well as some Syrians and Palestinians. By identifying the ancient type of DNA attributed to the Phoenicians, geneticist Pierre Zalloua was also able to chart their spread out of the eastern Mediterranean. These markers were found in unusually high proportions in non-Lebanese samples from other parts of the \\"Mediterranean coast where the Phoenicians are known to have established colonies, such as Carthage in today's Tunisia.\\"[38] The markers were also found among samples of Maltese and Spaniards, where the Phoenicians were also known to have established colonies. The study shows that 1 out of 17 people in the countries surrounding the Mediterranean basin can be identified with the Phoenician genetic markers in their Male Chromosomes. However, the particular marker associated by some studies with the historical Phoenicians, haplogroup J2, actually represents a complex mosaic of different demographic processes which affected the Mediterranean in prehistoric and historic times.[73]\\r\\nBeyond this, more recent finds have also interested geneticists and Lebanese anthropologists. These indicate foreign non-Levantine admixture from some unexpected but not surprising sources, even if only in a small proportion of the samples. Like a story written in DNA, it recounts some of the major historical events seen in the land today known as Lebanon.\\r\\nAmong the more interesting genetic markers found are those that seem to indicate that a small proportion of Lebanese Christians (2%) and a smaller proportion of Lebanese Muslims are descended, in part, from European Crusader Christians and Arabian Muslims respectively. The author states that the \\"study tells us that some European crusaders did not just conquer and leave behind castles. They left a subtle genetic connection as well.\\"[74] In much the same manner, some of the Arabian Muslims did not just conquer and leave behind mosques.\\r\\nIt was during a broader survey of Middle Eastern populations conducted for the Genographic Project of the National Geographic Society that the findings were stumbled upon. \\"We noticed some interesting lineages in the dataset. Among Lebanese Christians, in particular, we found higher frequency (2%) of a genetic marker  R1b  that we typically see only in Western Europe.\\"[74]\\r\\nThe lineage was seen at that \\"higher\\" frequency only in the Christian populations in Lebanon, even though among the Muslims it was not altogether absent. \\"The study matched the western European Y-chromosome lineage against thousands of people in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom.\\"[75] On the other hand, in the Lebanese Muslim population a similar pattern, this time associated with genetic markers from Arabia, was also observed in \\"higher\\" preferential frequencies, although they too were not altogether absent in the Christian population. \\"We found that a lineage that is very common in the Arabian Peninsula  Hg J* is found in slightly higher frequencies preferentially in the Muslim population.\\"[74] The author of the study added that the findings \\"certainly doesn't undermine the similarities among the various Lebanese communities, but it does agree with oral tradition.\\"[74]\\r\\nOther unrelated studies have sought to establish relationships between the Lebanese people and other groups. At least one study by the International Institute of Anthropology in Paris, France, confirmed similarities in the Y-haplotype frequencies in Lebanese, Palestinian, and Sephardic Jewish men, identifying them as \\"three Near-Eastern populations sharing a common geographic origin.\\"[76] The study surveyed one Y-specific DNA polymorphism (p49/Taq I) in 54 Lebanese and 69 Palestinian males, and compared with the results found in 693 Jews from three distinct Jewish ethnic groups; Mizrahi Jews, Sephardi Jews, and Ashkenazi Jews.\\r\\nIn a 2013 interview Pierre Zalloua, pointed out that genetic variation preceded religious variation and divisions: \\"Lebanon already had well-differentiated communities with their own genetic peculiarities, but not significant differences, and religions came as layers of paint on top. There is no distinct pattern that shows that one community carries significantly more Phoenician than another.\\"[77] Lebanese cluster the closest to Jews of any Arab population except the Druze according to a 2010 study by Behar et al, possibly corroborating a Phoenician origin.[78]","input":"How many lebanese are there in the world?"},{"output":"July 1966","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack Panther is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Jack Kirby, first appearing in Fantastic Four #52 (cover-dated July 1966) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Black Panther's real name is T'Challa, king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack Panther is the first superhero of African descent in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early African American superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the Falcon (1969), Luke Cage (1972) and Blade (1973), or DC Comics' John Stewart in the role of Green Lantern (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by Kasper Cole, a multiracial New York City police officer. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda is also given to T'Challa's sister Shuri for a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films and video games. The character is portrayed in live action by Chadwick Boseman in the 2016 film Captain America: Civil War, and the 2018 films Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, Black Panther was ranked 51st overall on IGN's \\"Top 100 Comic Books Heroes\\" list.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the Black Panther Party, though not the black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO), nor the segregated World War II Black Panthers Tank Battalion.[2][3] Stan Lee, co-creator of the comic, denied that the comic, which pre-dates the political usage of the term, was, or could have been, named after any of the political uses of the term \\"black panther\\", including the LCFO, citing \\"a strange coincidence\\".[4] He is the first black  superhero in American mainstream comic books; very few black heroes were created before him, and none with actual superpowers. These included the characters in the single-issue, low-distribution All-Negro Comics #1 (1947); Waku, Prince of the Bantu, who starred in his own feature in the omnibus title Jungle Tales, from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics; and the Dell Comics Western character Lobo, the first black person to star in his own comic book. Previous non-caricatured black supporting characters in comics include U.S. Army infantry private Gabriel Jones of Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a guest appearance in Fantastic Four #119 (Feb. 1972), the Black Panther briefly tried using the name Black Leopard to avoid connotations with the Party, but the new name did not last.[5] The character's name was changed back to Black Panther in Avengers #105, with T'Challa explaining that renaming himself made as much sense as altering the Scarlet Witch's name, and he is not a stereotype.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-creator Stan Lee recounted that the name was inspired by a pulp adventure hero who has a black panther as a helper.[7] Jack Kirby's original concept art for Black Panther used the concept name Coal Tiger.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing his debut in Fantastic Four #52ÿ53 (JulyÿAug. 1966) and subsequent guest appearance in Fantastic Four Annual #5 (1967) and with Captain America in Tales of Suspense #97ÿ100 (Jan.ÿ April 1968), the Black Panther journeyed from the fictional African nation of Wakanda to New York City to join the titular American superhero team in The Avengers #52 (May 1968), appearing in that comic for the next few years. During his time with the Avengers, he made solo guest-appearances in three issues of Daredevil, and fought Doctor Doom in Astonishing Tales #6ÿ7 (June & Aug. 1971), in that supervillain's short-lived starring feature.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe received his first starring feature with Jungle Action #5 (July 1973), a reprint of the Panther-centric story in The Avengers #62 (March 1969). A new series began running the following issue, written by Don McGregor, with art by pencilers Rich Buckler, Gil Kane, and Billy Graham, and which gave inkers Klaus Janson and Bob McLeod some of their first professional exposure. The critically acclaimed[9] series ran in Jungle Action #6ÿ24 (Sept. 1973 ÿ Nov. 1976).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne now-common format McGregor pioneered was that of the self-contained, multi-issue story arc.[11] The first, \\"Panther's Rage\\", ran through the first 13 issues. Critic Jason Sacks has called the arc \\"Marvel's first graphic novel\\":\\r\\n\\r\\n[T]here were real character arcs in Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four [comics] over time. But ... \\"Panther's Rage\\" is the first comic that was created from start to finish as a complete novel. Running in two years' issues of Jungle Action (#s 6 through 18), \\"Panther's Rage\\" is a 200-page novel that journeys to the heart of the African nation of Wakanda, a nation ravaged by a revolution against its king, T'Challa, the Black Panther.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second and final arc, \\"Panther vs. the Klan\\", ran as mostly 17-page stories in Jungle Action #19ÿ24 (Jan.ÿNov. 1976), except for issue #23, a reprint of Daredevil #69 (Oct. 1970), in which the Black Panther guest-starred.[10] The subject matter of the Ku Klux Klan was considered controversial in the Marvel offices at the time, creating difficulties for the creative team.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican-American writer-editor Dwayne McDuffie said of the Jungle Action \\"Black Panther\\" feature:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written multi-part superhero epic ever.

Okay, now go back and read any individual issue.

That's what we should all be delivering, every single month. Don [McGregor] and company did it in only 17 story pages per issue.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough popular with college students, the overall sales of Jungle Action were low,[13] and Marvel relaunched the Black Panther in a self-titled series, bringing in the character's co-creator Jack Kirbynewly returned to Marvel after having decamped to rival DC Comics for a timeas writer, penciler, and editor. However, Kirby wanted to work on new characters and was unhappy at being assigned a series starring a character he had already worked with extensively.[14] He left the series after only 12 issues and was replaced by Ed Hannigan (writer), Jerry Bingham (penciler), and Roger Stern (editor). Black Panther ran 15 issues (Jan. 1977 ÿ May 1979).[15] Due to the series's cancellation, the contents of what would have been Black Panther #16ÿ18 were published in Marvel Premiere #51ÿ53.\\r\\n\\r\\nA four-issue miniseries, Black Panther vol. 2,[16] (JulyÿOct. 1988) was written by Peter B. Gillis and penciled by Denys Cowan.[17] McGregor revisited his Panther saga with Gene Colan in \\"Panther's Quest\\", published as 25 eight-page installments within the bi-weekly anthology series Marvel Comics Presents (issues #13ÿ37, Feb.ÿDec. 1989).[18] He later teamed with artist Dwayne Turner in the square-bound miniseries Black Panther: Panther's Prey (Sept. 1990 ÿ March 1991).[19] McGregor conceived a fifth arc in his Black Panther saga, titled \\"Panther's Vows\\", but it failed to get off the ground.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nWriter Christopher Priest's and penciller Mark Texeira's 1998 series The Black Panther vol. 3 used Erik Killmonger, Venomm, and other characters introduced in \\"Panther's Rage\\", together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross; the Black Panther's adopted brother, Hunter; and the Panther's protg, Queen Divine Justice. The Priest-Texeira series was under the Marvel Knights imprint in its first year. Priest said the creation of character Ross contributed heavily to his decision to write the series. \\"I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between the African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the predominantly white readership that Marvel sells to,\\" adding that in his opinion, the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his creation.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last 13 issues (#50ÿ62) saw the main character replaced by a multiracial New York City police officer named Kasper Cole, with T'Challa relegated to a supporting character. This Black Panther, who became the White Tiger, was placed in the series The Crew, running concurrently with the final few Black Panther issues. The Crew was canceled with issue #7.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, Marvel began publishing Black Panther vol. 4,[21] which ran 41 issues (April 2005 ÿ Nov. 2008).[22] It was initially written by filmmaker Reginald Hudlin (through issue #38) and penciled by John Romita, Jr. (through #6). Hudlin said he wanted to add \\"street cred\\" to the title, although he noted that the book was not necessarily or primarily geared toward an African-American readership.[23] As influences for his characterization of the character, Hudlin has cited comic character Batman, film director Spike Lee, and music artist Sean Combs.[23] Other influences include historical figures such as 14th-century Mali Empire sultan Mansa Musa and 20th-century Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey, as well as Biblical figures such as Ham and Canaan.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack Panther vol. 5[25] launched in February 2009, with Hudlin, again scripting, introducing a successor Black Panther, T'Challa's sister Shuri.[26][27][28] Hudlin co-wrote issue #7 with Jonathan Maberry, who then became the new writer,[29] joined by artist Will Conrad.[30] The Panther was also a featured player, with members of the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, in the Doctor Doom-based, six-issue miniseries Doomwar (AprilÿSept. 2010).[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Challa then accepted an invitation from Matt Murdock, the superhero Daredevil, to become the new protector of New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. He became the lead character in Daredevil beginning with issue #513 (Feb. 2011), when that series was retitled Black Panther: The Man Without Fear.[32] Under writer David Liss and artist Francesco Francavilla, he took on the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and becomes the owner of a small diner in order to be close to the people.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nA new Black Panther series written by Ta-Nehisi Coates and drawn by Brian Stelfreeze was launched in 2016 and continues to be published with Coates as the head writer.[34][35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, the afrofuturist writer Nnedi Okorafor wrote the series Black Panther: Long Live the King.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Black Panther is the ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe of the advanced African nation of Wakanda. In addition to ruling the country, he is also chief of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions. The Panther is a hereditary title, but one must still earn it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the distant past, a meteorite made of the (fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral vibranium crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Reasoning that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, the ruler, King T'Chaka, like his father and other Panthers before him, concealed his country from the outside world. T'Chaka's first wife N'Yami died while in labor with T'Challa, and his second wife Ramonda was taken prisoner by Anton Pretorius during a visit to her homeland of South Africa, so for most of his childhood T'Challa was raised by his father alone.[38] T'Chaka was murdered by the adventurer Ulysses Klaw in an attempt to seize the vibranium mound. With his people still in danger, a young T'Challa used Klaw's sound weapon on Klaw and his men, shattering Klaw's right hand and forcing him to flee.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Challa was next in line to be the king of Wakanda and Black Panther, but until he was ready to become the leader of the nation, his uncle S'yan (T'Chaka's younger brother) successfully passed the trials to become the Black Panther. While on his Wakandan walkabout rite of passage, T'Challa met and fell in love with apparent orphaned teen Ororo Munroe, who would grow up to become the X-Men member Storm.[40] The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge his father's death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead Wakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes. One of his first acts was to disband and exile the Hatut Zerazethe Wakandan secret policeand its leader, his adopted brother Hunter the White Wolf.[41] He sold off small portions of vibranium to scientific institutions around the world, amassing a fortune which he used to arm himself with advanced technology.[39] Later, to keep peace, he picked dora milaje (\\"adored ones\\") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. He then studied abroad for a time  before returning to his kingship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his first published appearance, the now-adult T'Challa invites the American superhero team the Fantastic Four to Wakanda, then attacks and attempts to neutralize them individually in order to test himself to see if he is ready to battle Klaw, who had replaced his shattered right hand with a sonic weapon.[42][43] For their part, the Four manage to rally and stymie T'Challa in a team counter-attack, enabling the impressed King to stand down and explain himself to the team's satisfaction. After the ruler makes proper amends to the Four, they befriend and help T'Challa, and he in turn aids them against the supervillain the Psycho-Man.[44] T'Challa later joins the Avengers,[45] beginning a long association with that superhero team. He first battles the Man-Ape while with the group,[46] and then meets the American singer Monica Lynne,[47] with whom he becomes romantically involved. He helps the Avengers defeat the second Sons of the Serpent, and then reveals his true identity on American television.[48] He encounters Daredevil, and reveals to him that he had deduced Daredevil's true identity.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter receiving numerous urgent official letters requesting him to return to his increasingly troubled homeland,[50] the Panther eventually leaves his active Avengers membership to return to a Wakanda on the brink of civil war, bringing Lynne with him. After defeating would-be usurper Erik Killmonger and his minions,[51] the Panther ventures to the American South to battle the Ku Klux Klan.[52] He later gains possession of the mystical time-shifting artifacts known as King Solomon's Frogs.[53] These produce an alternate version of T'Challa from a future 10 years hence, a merry, telepathic Panther with a terminal brain aneurysm, whom T'Challa places in cryogenic stasis.[volume?&?issue?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, while searching for and finding his stepmother Ramonda, the Panther contends with South African authorities during Apartheid.[54] T'Challa eventually proposes and becomes engaged to Monica Lynne,[55] though the couple never marry.\\r\\n\\r\\nYears later, the Panther accepts a Washington, D.C. envoy, Everett K. Ross, and faces multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. Ross assists him in many of these threats. In gratitude, the Panther often risks much for Ross in return. The first threat he and Ross encounter is \\"Xcon\\", an alliance of rogue intelligence agents backing a coup led by the Reverend Achebe.[56] Afterward, Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda's economy. This forces T'Challa to nationalize foreign companies.[57] Killmonger then defeats him in ritual combat, thus inheriting the role of Black Panther,[58] but falls into a coma upon eating the heart-shaped herbpoisonous to anyone outside the royal bloodline, which had a hereditary immunity to its toxic effects.[59] T'Challa preserves his rival's life rather than allowing him to die.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self, and succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council[60] and hides in New York City. There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience that gives T'Challa the strength to face his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the Avengers, whom he helps secure special United Nations status.\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Challa recounts the story of his ascension as the Black Panther in the fourth volume of his eponymous comic book series. He defeated his uncle during the Black Panther celebration,[61] and during his walkabout when he met and fell in love with a street urchin named Ororo in Cairo, Egypt.[62] Unbeknownst to him the US government is planning a coup in order to get access to the vibranium. They allow Klaw to recruit a team of villains in order to support his totalitarian neighbor, Niganda. Klaw recruits Rhino, Black Knight, Batroc the Leaper, and Radioactive Man to lead the invasion. The US government then deploys an army of Deathloks to \\"support\\" T'Challa and justify an invasion, but T'Challa kills Klaw and Storm wipes out the Deathlok army in a hurricane.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Challa then helps his old flame Ororo Munroe reunite with her surviving family members in Africa and the U.S.[64] He shortly afterward proposes,[volume?&?issue?needed] and the two are married in a large Wakandan ceremony attended by many superheroes.[65] One of the couple's first tasks is to embark on a diplomatic tour, in which they visit the Inhumans, Doctor Doom, the President of the United States, and Namor, with only the last one ending well.[66] After the death of Bill Foster, the Black Panther and Storm side with Captain America's anti-registration forces.[67] During the end battle between both sides, the Wakandan embassy in Manhattan is heavily damaged, though no Wakandans are hurt.[68] After the confrontation, the Panther and Storm briefly fill in for vacationing Fantastic Four members Reed and Sue Richards before returning to Wakanda.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon returning to Wakanda alone, leaving Storm in New York to aid the X-Men, Black Panther faces Erik Killmonger, defeating him with assistance from Monica Rambeau (a.k.a. Pulsar).[70] Afterward, Wakanda fends off the alien shapeshifters the Skrulls, who had infiltrated as part of their \\"Secret Invasion\\" plan to conquer Earth.[71] Prince Namor attempts to recruit T'Challa for the Cabal, a secret council of supervillains. Attacked by the forces of fellow Cabal member Doctor Doom, T'Challa is left comatose.[72] His sister Shuri is trained as the next Panther, with the mantle passing onto her officially after T'Challa awakens from his coma and attempts to recover from his injuries.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the aftermath, T'Challa loses all of his enhanced attributes given to him by being the panther totem. As a result, he works with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to accumulate a replacement.[74] He has since made a pact with another unknown Panther deity, returning his attributes to an even higher level as well as placing incantations on his body, making himself highly resistant to most magic and mystic assaults. This has all been done in preparation for the imminent battle with Doctor Doom,[75] which culminated in T'Challa rendering all of the processed vibranium inert to give his people a chance to rebuild without their dependence on the element.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the events of \\"Shadowland\\", Matt Murdock (the superhero Daredevil) asks T'Challa to replace him as guardian of Hell's Kitchen, which gives T'Challa a chance to discover himself. With the help of Foggy Nelson, T'Challa assumes the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Congo and manager of a diner called Devil's Kitchen, so that he can blend in and learn about the denizens as an ordinary man. He gets on well with two of the Kitchen's staff: Sofija, a migrant from Serbia who was formerly involved in violent Serbian nationalism, and the busboy, Brian. He also gets to know some of the neighbors from his apartment block: Mr. Nantakarn and his son Alec, as well as Iris, a social worker assigned to handle cases of child abuse.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Challa finds himself up against an ambitious new crime lord, Vlad Dinu, who styles himself \\"The Impaler\\". He also seeks an understanding with the police through Detective Alex Kurtz. During an attempt by Vlad to terminate the Panther, Brian from the Devil's Kitchen is seriously injured by an energy blast from Vlad, and is reported dead. The conflict between Vlad and the Panther becomes more personal, especially after Vlad discovers the Panther over his wife Angela dead from a gunshot wound.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Challa learns that Iris was the serial shooter who killed abusers of childrenGabe was abused secretly by Angela. Brian was kidnapped by his doctor, Dr. Holman, at the behest of Nicolae who wanted to use someone who received a dose of Vlad's power. After being subjected to torturous experiments, Brian lost the ability to think for himself but was rescued by Gabe who also stole the serum produced from the experiment meant to endow the recipient with Vlad's powers. The Panther obtains evidence of Vlad Dinu's crimes as well as clues to Iris as the serial shooter, and turns the evidence over to Kurtz. Vlad kills his own son Nicolae before being subdued by the Panther. Gabe is arrested for attempting to take Iris' life. Before being taken away, Gabe reveals to the Panther Brian's fate. Though aware of the Panther's identity as Mr. Okonkwo, both Iris and Sofija promise to keep silent.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after Daredevil returns to Hell's Kitchen, T'Challa returns to Wakanda, serving as a second to his sister, Shuri. In preparation for an upcoming attack on Wakanda as part of the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline, the Panther God returns T'Challa's abilities.[78] Empowered by the Phoenix, Namor destroys Wakanda with a massive tidal wave.[79] Returning to help, Storm is stunned when the Panther informs her that their marriage has been annulled.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter witnessing an alternate Earth over Wakanda being destroyed by the Black Swan, T'Challa reforms the Illuminatiwith Beast replacing the now-deceased Charles Xavierto confront the threat of the Incursions, parallel universes colliding with each other to the destruction of both. Although able to avert one Incursion with the Infinity Gauntlet, the subsequent destruction of the Infinity Gems forces the group to decide to resort to more questionable measures to protect Earth from future Incursions, wiping Captain America's mind so that he will not remember these events, allowing them to do \\"what needs to be done\\".[81] Although equipped with planet-destroying weapons to protect Earth, the Illuminati mostly become disgusted with the wholesale slaughter, until Namor breaks off from the group to form a new Cabal of villains to do what the heroes will not. Despite Namor's Cabal achieving legitimacy as Earth's protectors, Namor grew weary of the wholesale slaughter they carried out in the name of preserving their universe. Although he collaborated with the Illuminati in a plan to destroy the Cabal by trapping them on the next Earth to be destroyed, Black Panther and Black Bolt left him behind to die with the Cabal, disgusted at his earlier actions,[82] although Namor and the Cabal escape to the Ultimate universe when the other Earth has a simultaneous Incursion.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the final Incursion occurs during the Secret Wars storyline, resulting in all realities collapsing into one Earth, Black Panther is one of the few heroes to survive the Incursion in a specially-designed \\"life pod\\"other survivors including Mister Fantastic, Star-Lord, Spider-Man, the new Thor, Captain Marvel and a Phoenix-enhanced Cyclopsalthough they are only released into the new world after an eight-year stasis. Retrieved by Doctor Strange, they learn that Strange has assumed a role of \\"sheriff\\" to Doctor Doom, who has appointed himself the god of the new \\"Battleworld\\" created from the multiple realities.[84] Although Doom effortlessly kills Cyclops, Strange protects the other heroes by dispersing them across Battleworld,[85] with T'Challa and Namor eventually discovering a new version of the Infinity Gauntlet that Strange collected, ensuring that the Gems he found would work in the location where Doom built his main fortress.[86] Recruiting the residents of the deadlands as an army, T'Challa marches on Doom at the same time as multiple other areas rebel against him through the encouragement of the heroes,[87] but admits when Doom confronts him that he was only intended as a distraction while Reed targets Doom's power source. As Reed takes Doom's power and sets out to rebuild the multiverse, T'Challa uses the Time Gem to take himself back to Wakanda before the Incursions, proclaiming to his people that they will lead the way to the stars and explore new ideas.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Black Panther is a member of the Ultimates.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Civil War II storyline, Black Panther represents Wakanda on the Alpha Flight Space Program's Board of Governors.[90] He sides with Captain Marvel on needing help from an Inhuman who can predict the possible future named Ulysses Kain.[volume?&?issue?needed] Black Panther and Shuri take part in the fight against the Leviathon Tide.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Hydra's reign over the world led by Arnim Zola, Baron Zemo and Steve Rogers, Panther is captured for opposing this regime, and brought into a containing room. Once Panther and Zemo are alone, Winter Soldier rescues Panther. Panther entrusts the unconscious Zemo to Winter Soldier, while trailing Rogers and Zola into the secret lab. Panther finds out that Zola infused a brainwashed Captain America with a Cosmic Cube using a stolen Stark tech modified by Zola himself, and warns his allies to retreat from a Cosmic Cube-powered Steve Rogers, but is too late.[92] Even though one of the heroes knows they cannot defeat a Cosmic Cube-powered Supreme Hydra Rogers, Winter Soldier, Captain America (Sam Wilson) and Ant-Man (Scott Lang) trick Rogers by surrendering the last fragment of the cube to him. Winter Soldier and Ant-Man steal the cube from Rogers before he uses its full potential, and bring back Kobik and the real Steve Rogers.[93][94] After the defeat of Supreme Hydra Steve Rogers, Black Panther establishes his quest to go across the universe with his people, and found an Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda on Planet Bast, located in the Benhazin Star System.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title \\"Black Panther\\" is a rank of office, chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan. As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to consume a special heart-shaped herb which, in addition to his mystical, shamanistic connection with the Wakandan Panther God Bast, grants him superhumanly acute senses, enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina, durability, healing, and reflexes.[96][97]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has since lost this connection and forged a new one with another unknown Panther deity, granting him augmented physical attributes as well as a resistance to magic.[75] His senses are so powerful that he can pick up a prey's scent and memorize tens of thousands of individual ones. Following his war with Doom, T'Challa loses his enhanced abilities only to once again establish a connection with the Panther God.[78] In addition to the resurgence of his now superhuman abilities, he is anointed \\"King of the Dead\\", granting him the power and knowledge of all the past Black Panthers as well as the ability to control the Undead.[98] After Battleworld and the resurgence of the Multiverse T'challa eventually showcased new powers in regards to his King of the Dead status, for not only could he reanimate the dead but summon departed spirits into the physical world with tangible form as well. Using these spiritual energies also enables him to conjure a mythical mystical spear of glowing blue energy to his hand.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Challa worked with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to endow T'Challa with immunity to mystical attacks and detection in order to defeat Dr. Doom. When T'Challa's alchemical upgrade was tested by means of Wakanda's most powerful acolytes attacking T'Challa in unison, each mystical attack was absorbed and only served to strengthen T'Challa.  During these preparations, T'Challa invented a potent mystical-scientific hybrid art called \\"shadow physics\\" and was able to use it to craft shadow weapons and to track vibranium on a quantum level.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs king of Wakanda, the Panther has access to a vast collection of magical artifacts, advanced Wakandan technological and military hardware, and the support of his nation's wide array of scientists, warriors, and mystics. The Wakandan military has been described as one of the most powerful on Earth. His attire is the sacred vibranium costume of the Wakandan Panther Cult.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is a skilled hunter, tracker, strategist, politician, inventor, and scientist. He has a PhD in physics from Oxford University. He is proficient in physics and advanced technology, and is also an inventor. T'Challa has been granted the strength and knowledge of every past Black Panther.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Challa is rigorously trained in acrobatics and hand-to-hand combat. He is skilled in various forms of unarmed combat, with a unique hybrid fighting style that incorporates acrobatics and aspects of animal mimicry.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan is one of the wealthiest people in the world, although financial estimates are difficult given Wakanda's isolation from the world's economy and the uncertain value of Wakanda's vast vibranium reserves and extremely advanced technologies.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Black Panther volume 3, writer Christopher Priest expanded the Panther's day-to-day arsenal to include equipment such as an \\"energy dagger\\", a vibranium-weave suit, and a portable supercomputer, the \\"Kimoyo card\\".[102] In Black Panther volume 4, writer Reginald Hudlin introduced such specialized equipment as \\"thrice-blessed armor\\" and \\"light armor\\" for specific tasks,[103] and for a short while outfitted him with the Ebony Blade of the Black Knight.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mantle of the Black Panther is passed down from generation to generation among the rulers of Wakanda[105] although it must still be deserved through a severe selection involving the best warriors of the nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBashenga appeared for the first time in Black Panther Vol. 1 #7 (January 1978) by Jack Kirby (scripts and drawings). Wise warrior at the head of the Panther Tribe, according to legends, during the tumult where the vibranium meteorite fell on the soil of the village, then composed of various warring clans, he gathered all the aforementioned under his guide to defeating the inhabitants transformed by the impact into fierce \\"demonic spirits\\", a company which has unified the nation by founding Wakanda and becoming its first ruler[106] and the first to obtain the title of \\"Black Panther\\" as it tells of his \\"spiritual connection\\" with the Goddess Pantera Bast that led to the foundation of the Cult of the Panther.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nChanda appeared for the first time in Fantastic Four Unlimited Vol. 1 #1 (March 1993) by Roy Thomas (scripts) and Herb Trimpe (drawings). Black Panther and ruler of Wakanda during the Second World War, Chanda is the husband of Nanali and father of T'Chaka and S'Yan; distinguished by an excessively good and compassionate nature, he welcomed the Nazi colonel Fritz Klaue after he crashed into his reign due to a plane crash. Over time, the two make a kind of friendship and Klaue develops a strong obsession with the culture of Wakanda coming to try to convince them to make their religion deist rather than spiritist, which causes a strong friction between him and Chanda culminating in the death of Nanali by the Nazi and in its subsequent expulsion from the country.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn several subsequent stories, T'Chaka's father (and husband of Nanali) is called Azzuri the Wise and is presented in a completely different way from Chanda,[108][109] leaving the doubt if it is only a sort of nickname or another character.\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Chaka appeared for the first time in Fantastic Four Vol. 1 #53 (August 1966) by Stan Lee (script) and Jack Kirby (art). The eldest son of King Azzuri and Queen Nanali, T'Chaka inherits the throne and the title of the Black Panther on his father's death by being helped in his monarch duties by his younger brother and trusted adviser S'Yan.[110] After having married a woman named N'Yami, believing she can not have children, she adopts a child with her, Hunter, however, she later becomes pregnant and dies giving birth to her first child, T'Challa; from the relationship with a woman of another tribe T'Chaka then has a second son, Jakarra, and finally remarries with Ramonda, a woman who grows her children as her own and from whom she has her only daughter, Shuri,[110] but which subsequently disappears into nothingness, leading him to believe that he has abandoned it.[38] To protect the kingdom, T'Chaka instituted a policy of strong isolationism,[111] but in the course of his life he often collaborated with agents of the US government.[109][112] He is killed by Ulysses Klaw after having surprised him to illegally extract vibranium in his kingdom.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Black Panther Vol. 3 #15 (February 2000), Erik Killmonger challenges and beats T'Challa in a duel for the throne, overthrowing him as king of Wakanda and taking on the role as the Black Panther.[114] He becomes comatose after attempting to ingest the Heart-shaped Herb to acquire the Black Panther's powers, as he is not of royal blood. Killmonger's time as king is short-lived however, as he is killed by Monica Rambeau during T'Challa's attack to reclaim Wakanda.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nS'Yan The Fast, appeared for the first time in Black Panther Vol. 4 #2 (May, 2005) by Reginald Hudlin (scripts) and John Romita Jr. (drawings). The second son of King Azzuri and Queen Nanali, S'Yan is T'Chaka's younger and trusted advisor, after whose death, although he has no desire to reign, he agrees to ascend the throne until his nephew became an adult.[110] Ironically, S'Yan, who has never wanted to be king, becomes one of the most beloved monarchs in the history of Wakanda but, nevertheless, when T'Challa returns home and obtains the title of Black Panther, he leaves with joy, returning to play the role of royal adviser.[110] He died during the war with Latveria to defend Ramonda from the soldiers of Doctor Doom.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen T'Challa ends up in a coma because of Doctor Doom,[116] Shuri becomes his substitute as Black Panther and queen of Wakanda which, after the rise of her half-brother to \\"king of the dead\\", creates for the first time in history two avatars of the Panther Goddess.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack Panther was ranked the 79th greatest comic book character by Wizard magazine.[120] IGN ranked the character the 51st greatest comic book hero, stating that Black Panther could be considered Marvel's equivalent to Batman;[121] he was also ranked tenth in their list of \\"The Top 50 Avengers\\".[122] In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked the Black Panther as #33 on their list of the \\"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\\".[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nJournalist Joe Gross praised Christopher Priest for his characterization of the Black Panther, stating, that the writer \\"turned an underused icon into the locus of a complicated high adventure by taking the Black Panther to his logical conclusion. T'Challa (the title character) is the enigmatic ruler of a technologically advanced, slightly xenophobic African nation, so he acts like it\\". Gross applauded the title's \\"endless wit, sharp characterization, narrative sophistication and explosive splash panels\\".[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nComics reviewer and journalist Mike Sangiacomo, however, criticized the narrative structure. \\"Christopher Priest's fractured writing is getting on my nerves. Like the Spider-Man comics, I want to like Black Panther, but Priest's deliberately jumbled approach to writing is simply silly. I know it's a style, but does he have to do it every issue?\\"[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nReporter Bill Radford cited similar concerns when the title had just launched. \\"I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman, but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book. And Ross' narration jumps around in time so much that I feel like his boss, who, in trying to get Ross to tell her what has happened, complains: 'This is like watching \\"Pulp Fiction\\" in rewind. My head is exploding.'\\"[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublishers Weekly gave a negative review to the first arc, \\"Who Is the Black Panther?\\", a modern retelling of the character's origin, saying, \\"Hudlin's take is caught between a rock and a hard place. His over-the-top narrative is not likely to appeal to fans of the most recent version of the character, but it's too mired in obscure Marvel continuity to attract the more general reader. The plot manages to be convoluted without ever becoming absorbing\\".[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nJournalist Shawn Jeffords, citing the lack of appearances of the title character in the first issue, called the new series a \\"fairly unimpressive launch\\". Jeffords also said general-audience unfamiliarity was a hindrance. \\"He's never been a marquee character and to make him one will be tough\\".[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Challa is Coal Tiger, Sersi kills the Avengers and Coal Tiger is the only survivor.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Age of Ultron story, Black Panther contacts the Fantastic Four and informs them that Ultron has invaded Earth with an army of Ultron Sentinels.[130] Black Panther was later seen with Red Hulk and Taskmaster in Chicago spying on some Ultron Sentinels. When Taskmaster takes out a Sentinel that was sneaking up on him, alerting the other Sentinels, Red Hulk holds off the Sentinels while Black Panther and Taskmaster flee. During the mayhem, Black Panther falls several stories and breaks his neck, killing him instantly.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nBronze Tiger is the ruler of Wakanda and is named B'Nchalla; an amalgamation of the Bronze Tiger (DC) and the Black Panther (Marvel).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Avengers Forever, Captain America and Goliath visit an alternate future timeline where Martian invaders have ravaged the Earth. An aged Black Panther leads this reality's version of the Avengers, who consist of Jocasta, Living Lightning, Killraven, Crimson Dynamo and Thundra.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an alternate reality where the Civil War between Iron Man and Captain America never ended, Black Panther was killed alongside Maria Hill after activating Prison 42's self-destruct mechanism.[133] He is succeeded by his son, Azari, who takes on the Black Panther name.[134] It is later revealed that the Black Panther who destroyed Prison 42 was actually Queen Veranke of the shape-shifting alien Skrull race, who had stolen T'Challa's identity in order to manipulate and prolong the Civil War to suit her own needs.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Challa is Chieftain Justice, a Captain Britain Corps member, in Excalibur #44 (1991).[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the alternate universe of Earth X, T'Challa has been affected by the mutative event that drives the plot. Like most of humanity, he is mutated; in this case to become a humanoid black panther. He is entrusted with the Cosmic Cube by Captain America, who knows that T'Challa would be the only one to resist using it and to never give it back if asked. In fact, Captain America does ask for it back and T'Challa is forced to refuse.[137]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternate version of Black Panther, called simply \\"Panther\\", is drafted onto the interdimensional superhero team the Exiles.[138] The Panther is the son of T'Challa and Storm and named T'Chaka, after his grandfather. Originating from Earth-1119, he was ambushed by Klaw while examining some ruins. Caught in Klaw's blast, the Panther was plucked out of time and placed on the team.[138] Unlike the stoic 616-Black Panther, The Panther is a wisecracking flirt.[138] After his assumed death on Earth-1119, his sister took up the mantle of Black Panther.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Black Panther appears in issues #1 and #6ÿ7 of Marvel Comics/Fox Kids comic book series based on the TV show The Avengers: United They Stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Challa appears in Marvel Mangaverse Volume 2 as a man with a pet panther. When summoning the spirits, T'Challa and his panther combine to become the Black Panther. He also became The Falcon.

T'Challa's sister, T'Chana, reveals herself to be this universe's Doctor Doom.[140]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Marvel 2099 continuity, a greatly weakened Wakanda is soon to be governed by its princess, Okusana. Fearing that she is not ready, she requests Doom's help in resurrecting Thandaza, her grandfather and a former Black Panther. Doom (who claims to have agreed to the proposal out of respect for T'Challa) and the Wakandan scientists revive Thandaza in a cyberbetic body made from vibranium, but the plan goes awry when Mkhalali, the current Panther Guard, opens fire on Thandaza, believing his resurrection to be an abomination. The attack throws off the calibrations and leaves Thandaza in a maddened state and constant pain, causing him to go on a bloody rampage. Doom is ultimately forced to kill Thandaza, who thanks him for ending his suffering.[141]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack Panther was featured in the Marvel Knights 2099 one shots, which were not tied to the main 2099 continuity. A new Black Panther, K'Shamba, rose to fight and thwart the mounting invasions by the successor of Doom. While the victory over the new Doom appeared triumphant, the new Wakandan king was ultimately revealed to be a puppet of Doom.[142]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack Panther is, for the most part, one of the few uninfected superheroes in the alternate-universe series Marvel Zombies, where he is kept as a food supply for the Zombie Giant-Man, who keeps the Panther imprisoned and cuts off various limbs so that he can maintain his intelligence via a ready access to fresh meat without infecting Panther with the zombie \\"virus\\".[143] Despite having lost half of his right arm and his left foot, the Panther escapeswith the severed head of zombified superheroine the Wasp in tow[144]and joins forces with the mutant group the Acolytes.[145] While with the Acolytes, T'Challa briefly talks with his Earth-616 counterpart, where he expresses surprise at his marriage to Storm but offers him all the information he can provide about the zombie plague.[146] Decades later, T'Challa has married one of the Acolytes, Lisa Hendricks, and they have a son, with Forge having provided T'Challa with artificial limbs to compensate for his injuries.[147] Facing retirement, the Panther is stabbed and critically wounded by an agent of an Acolyte splinter group, and the Wasp now a willing ally after having lost her zombie hunger zombifies the Panther in order to grant him continued existence. With the Wasp's help, he survives to the post-hunger stage himself and continues to lead his people, despite his status.[148] Further internal betrayal lead the Black Panther and many of his allies to be tossed through the dimensions.[149] He ends up involved with another Earth that is threatened by the zombie virus. His attempts to save this new planet fail and he is destroyed, leaving only one hand displayed as a trophy by his enemies.[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the MC2 universe, Black Panther has a son named T'Chaka II, who joined the A-Next as the Coal Tiger.[151]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Mutant X reality, Black Panther had the appearance of a humanoid black panther. He is among the second wave of heroes who died fighting the Beyonder.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the alternate-reality Ultimate Marvel imprint, the Black Panther is T'Challa Udaku, a young man who is experimented on in the Weapon X program before being liberated by Nick Fury.[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nT'Challa, the younger son of King T'Chaka of Wakanda, is severely injured during the \\"Trial of the Panther\\" from which the protector of the nation is selected. His older brother M'Baku finds T'Challa bloodied, mute, and near death but derisively calls him a fool for attempting the trial. Later, M'Baku adds that he, not T'Challa, should have taken the trial. Angry that his father has decided to share Wakanda's technology in exchange for America's help in saving T'Challa's life, M'Baku leaves the kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo save T'Challa, T'Chaka turns him over to the Weapon X program. Over a year later, a healthy T'Challa, in his full Black Panther garb, has enhanced speed, strength, night vision, and healing ability. Additionally, he can summon short, cat-like Adamantium claws from his knuckles by balling his hands into fists. T'Chaka becomes outraged upon learning that S.H.I.E.L.D. (who had shut down Weapon X and freed T'Challa) now considers his son an asset of the U.S. and S.H.I.E.L.D. He subsequently sends M'Baku a letter, claiming that M'Baku, not T'Challa, is the titular \\"favorite son\\", and he implores M'Baku to return.\\r\\n\\r\\nFury has Captain America train and mentor the Panther, who reveals his damaged throat.

During the 18th century the disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year, including five reigning monarchs, and was responsible for a third of all blindness.[3] Between 20 and 60% of all those infectedand over 80% of infected childrendied from the disease.[4]\\r\\nDuring the 20th century, it is estimated that smallpox was responsible for 300ÿ500 million deaths.[5][6][7] In the early 1950s an estimated 50 million cases of smallpox occurred in the world each year.[8] As recently as 1967, the World Health Organization estimated that 15 million people contracted the disease and that two million died in that year.[8] After successful vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the WHO certified the global eradication of smallpox in December 1979.[8] Smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated, the other being rinderpest, which was declared eradicated in 2011.[9][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been suggested that smallpox was a major component of the Plague of Athens that occurred in 430 BCE, during the Peloponnesian Wars, and was described by Thucydides. Galen's description of the Antonine Plague, which swept through the Roman Empire in 165ÿ180, indicates that it was probably caused by smallpox.[12] Returning soldiers brought the disease home with them to Syria and Italy, where it raged for fifteen years and greatly weakened the Roman empire, killing up to one-third of the population in some areas.[13] Total deaths have been estimated at 5 million.[14] A second major outbreak of disease in the Roman Empire, known as the Plague of Cyprian (251ÿ266), was also either smallpox or measles. Although some historians believe that many historical epidemics and pandemics were early outbreaks of smallpox, contemporary records are not detailed enough to make a definite diagnosis.[1][15]\\r\\nMost of the details about the epidemics are lost, probably due to the scarcity of surviving written records from the Early Middle Ages. The first incontrovertible description of smallpox in Western Europe occurred in 581, when Bishop Gregory of Tours provided an eyewitness account describing the characteristic symptoms of smallpox.[15] Waves of epidemics wiped out large rural populations.[16] The establishment of the disease in Europe was of special importance, for this served as the endemic reservoir from which smallpox spread to other parts of the world, as an accompaniment of successive waves of European exploration and colonization.\\r\\nAround 400 AD, an Indian medical book recorded a disease marked by pustules and boils, saying \\"the pustules are red, yellow, and white and they are accompanied by burning pain  the skin seems studded with grains of rice.\\" The Indian epidemic was thought to be punishment from a god, and the survivors created a goddess, Sitala, as the anthropomorphic personification of the disease.[17][18][19] Smallpox was thus regarded as possession by Sitala. In Hinduism the goddess Sitala both causes and cures high fever, rashes, hot flashes and pustules. All of these are symptoms of smallpox.\\r\\nThe clearest description of smallpox from pre-modern times was given in the 9th century by the Persian physician, Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi, known in the West as \\"Rhazes\\", who was the first to differentiate smallpox from measles and chickenpox in his Kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah (The Book of Smallpox and Measles).[20]\\r\\nSmallpox was a leading cause of death in the 18th century. Every seventh child born in Russia died from smallpox.[8] It killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year in the 18th century, including five reigning European monarchs.[21] Most people became infected during their lifetimes, and about 30% of people infected with smallpox died from the disease, presenting a severe selection pressure on the resistant survivors.[22]\\r\\nIn northern Japan, Ainu population decreased drastically in the 19th century, due in large part to infectious diseases like smallpox brought by Japanese settlers pouring into Hokkaido.[23]\\r\\nThe Franco-Prussian War triggered a smallpox pandemic of 1870ÿ1875 that claimed 500,000 lives; while vaccination was mandatory in the Prussian army, many French soldiers were not vaccinated. Smallpox outbreaks among French prisoners of war spread to the German civilian population and other parts of Europe. Ultimately, this public health disaster inspired stricter legislation in Germany and England, though not in France.[24][25]\\r\\nIn 1849 nearly 13% of all Calcutta deaths were due to smallpox.[26] Between 1868 and 1907, there were approximately 4.7 million deaths from smallpox in India. Between 1926 and 1930, there were 979,738 cases of smallpox with a mortality of 42.3%.[27]\\r\\nOne of the oldest records of what may have been an encounter with smallpox in Africa is associated with the elephant war circa AD 568, when after fighting a siege in Mecca, Ethiopian troops contracted the disease which they carried with them back to Africa. Arab ports in Coastal towns in Africa likely contributed to the importation of smallpox into Africa, as early as the 13th century, though no records exist until the 16th century. Upon invasion of these towns by tribes in the interior of Africa, a severe epidemic affected all African inhabitants while sparing the Portuguese. Densely populated areas of Africa connected to the Mediterranean, Nubia and Ethiopia by caravan route likely were affected by smallpox since the 11th century, though written records do not appear until the introduction of the slave trade in the 16th century.[2]\\r\\nThe slave trade continued to spread smallpox to the entire continent, with raiders pushing farther inland along caravan routes in search of slaves. The effects of smallpox could be seen along caravan routes, and those who were not affected along the routes were still likely to become infected either waiting to board or on board ships.[2]\\r\\nSmallpox in Angola was likely introduced shortly after Portuguese settlement of the area in 1484. The 1864 epidemic killed 25,000 inhabitants, one third of the total population in that same area. In 1713, an outbreak occurred in South Africa after a ship from India docked at Cape Town, bringing infected laundry ashore. Many of the white population suffered, and whole clans of the Hottentot tribe were wiped out. A second outbreak occurred in 1755, again affecting both the white population and the Hottentots. The Hottentots spread the disease further among their tribes, and completely eradicating several tribes, all the way to the Kalahari desert. A third outbreak in 1767 similarly affected the Hottentots and Bantu tribes, but the whites settlers, having practiced variolation, were not affected nearly to the extent that they were in the first two outbreaks. Continued slaving operations brought smallpox to Cape Town again in 1840, taking the lives of 2500 people, and then to Uganda in the 1840s. It is estimated that up to eighty percent of the Griqua tribe was exterminated by smallpox in 1831, and whole tribes were being wiped out in Kenya up until 1899. Along the Zaire river basin were areas where no one survived the epidemics, leaving the land devoid of human life. In Ethiopia and the Sudan, six epidemics are recorded for the 19th century: 1811ÿ1813, 1838ÿ1839, 1865ÿ1866, 1878ÿ1879, 1885ÿ1887, and 1889ÿ1890.[28]\\r\\nAfter first contacts with Europeans and Africans, some believe that the death of 90ÿ95% of the native population of the New World was caused by Old World diseases.[39] It is suspected that smallpox was the chief culprit and responsible for killing nearly all of the native inhabitants of the Americas. For more than 200 years, this disease affected all new world populations, mostly without intentional European transmission, from contact in the early 16th century to until possibly as late as the French and Indian Wars (1754ÿ1767).[40]\\r\\nIn 1519 Hernn Corts landed on the shores of what is now Mexico and was then the Aztec empire. In 1520 another group of Spanish arrived in Mexico from Hispaniola, bringing with them the smallpox which had already been ravaging that island for two years. When Corts heard about the other group, he went and defeated them. In this contact, one of Corts's men contracted the disease. When Corts returned to Tenochtitlan, he brought the disease with him.\\r\\nSoon, the Aztecs rose up in rebellion against Corts and his men. Outnumbered, the Spanish were forced to flee. In the fighting, the Spanish soldier carrying smallpox died. Corts would not return to the capital until August 1521. In the meantime smallpox devastated the Aztec population. It killed most of the Aztec army and 25% of the overall population.[41] The Spanish Franciscan Motolinia left this description: \\"As the Indians did not know the remedy of the diseasethey died in heaps, like bedbugs. In many places it happened that everyone in a house died and, as it was impossible to bury the great number of dead, they pulled down the houses over them so that their homes become their tombs.\\"[42] On Corts's return, he found the Aztec armys chain of command in ruins. The soldiers who still lived were weak from the disease. Corts then easily defeated the Aztecs and entered Tenochtitln.[43] The Spaniards said that they could not walk through the streets without stepping on the bodies of smallpox victims.[44]\\r\\nThe effects of smallpox on Tahuantinsuyu (or the Inca empire) were even more devastating. Beginning in Colombia, smallpox spread rapidly before the Spanish invaders first arrived in the empire. The spread was probably aided by the efficient Inca road system. Within months, the disease had killed the Incan Emperor Huayna Capac, his successor, and most of the other leaders. Two of his surviving sons warred for power and, after a bloody and costly war, Atahualpa become the new emperor. As Atahualpa was returning to the capital Cuzco, Francisco Pizarro arrived and through a series of deceits captured the young leader and his best general. Within a few years smallpox claimed between 60% and 90% of the Inca population,[45] with other waves of European disease weakening them further. A handful of historians argue that a disease called Bartonellosis might have been responsible for some outbreaks of illness, but this opinion is in the scholarly minority.[46] The effects of Bartonellosis were depicted in the ceramics of the Moche people of ancient Peru.[47]\\r\\nEven after the two largest empires of the Americas were defeated by the virus and disease, smallpox continued its march of death. In 1561, smallpox reached Chile by sea, when a ship carrying the new governor Francisco de Villagra landed at La Serena. Chile had previously been isolated by the Atacama Desert and Andes Mountains from Peru, but at the end of 1561 and in early 1562, it ravaged the Chilean native population. Chronicles and records of the time left no accurate data on mortality but more recent estimates are that the natives lost 20 to 25 percent of their population. The Spanish historian Marmolejo said that gold mines had to shut down when all their Indian labor died.[48] Mapuche fighting Spain in Araucana regarded the epidemic as a magical attempt by Francisco de Villagra to exterminate them because he could not defeat them in the Arauco War.[31]\\r\\nIn 1633 in Plymouth, Massachusetts, the Native Americans were struck by the virus. As it had done elsewhere, the virus wiped out entire population groups of Native Americans. It reached Mohawks in 1634,[49] the Lake Ontario area in 1636, and the lands of the Iroquois by 1679. During the siege of Fort Pitt, as recorded in his journal by sundries trader and militia Captain, William Trent, on June 24, 1763, dignitaries from the Delaware tribe met with Fort Pitt officials, warned them of \\"great numbers of Indians\\" coming to attack the fort, and pleaded with them to leave the fort while there was still time. The commander of the fort refused to abandon the fort. Instead, the British gave as gifts two blankets, one silk handkerchief and one linen from the smallpox hospital, to two Delaware Indian delegates.[50] During and after Pontiac's War smallpox killed between 400,000-500,000 (possibly up to 1.5 million) Native Americans.[51][52]\\r\\nDuring the 1770s, smallpox killed at least 30% of the West Coast Native Americans.[53][54] The smallpox epidemic of 1780ÿ1782 brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the Plains Indians.[55] This epidemic is a classic instance of European immunity and non-European vulnerability. It is probable that the Indians contracted the disease from the Snake Indians on the Mississippi. From there it spread eastward and northward to the Saskatchewan River. According to David Thompsons account, the first to hear of the disease were fur traders from the Hudsons House on October 15, 1781.[56] A week later, reports were made to William Walker and William Tomison, who were in charge of the Hudson and Cumberland Hudsons Bay Company posts. By February, the disease spread as far as the Basquia Tribe. Smallpox attacked whole tribes and left few survivors. E. E. Rich described the epidemic by saying that Families lay unburied in their tents while the few survivors fled, to spread the disease.[57] After reading Tomisons journals, Houston and Houston calculated that, of the Indians who traded at the Hudson and Cumberland houses, 95% died of smallpox.[55] Paul Hackett adds to the mortality numbers suggesting that perhaps up to one half to three quarters of the Ojibway situated west of the Grand Portage died from the disease. The Cree also suffered a casualty rate of approximately 75% with similar effects found in the Lowland Cree.[58] By 1785 the Sioux Indians of the great plains had also been affected.[28] Not only did smallpox devastate the Indian population, it did so in an unforgiving way. William Walker described the epidemic stating that the Indians [are] all Dying by this Distemper  lying Dead about the Barren Ground like a rotten sheep, their Tents left standing & the Wild beast Devouring them.[56]\\r\\nA particularly virulent sequence of smallpox outbreaks took place in Boston, Massachusetts. From 1636 to 1698, Boston endured six epidemics. In 1721, the most severe epidemic occurred. The entire population fled the city, bringing the virus to the rest of the Thirteen Colonies.[59][60]\\r\\nIn the late 1770s, during the American Revolutionary War, smallpox returned once more and killed thousands.[61] Peter Kalm in his Travels in North America, described how in that period, the dying Indian villages became overrun with wolves feasting on the corpses and weakened survivors.[62] Smallpox was also used as a weapon by the British.[63][64]\\r\\nIn 1799, the physician Valentine Seaman administered the first smallpox vaccine in the United States. He gave his children a smallpox vaccination using a serum acquired from Edward Jenner, the British physician who invented the vaccine from fluid taken from cowpox lesions. Though vaccines were misunderstood and mistrusted at the time, Seaman advocated their use and, in 1802, coordinated a free vaccination program for the poor in New York City.[65][66]\\r\\nBy 1832, the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans.[67]\\r\\nIn 1900 starting in New York City, smallpox reared its head once again and started a sociopolitical battle with lines drawn between the rich and poor, white and black. In populations of railroad and migrant workers who traveled from city to city the disease had reached an endemic low boil. This fact did not bother the government at the time, nor did it spur them to action. Despite the general acceptance of the germ theory of disease, pioneered by John Snow in 1849, smallpox was still thought to be mostly a malady that followed the less-distinct guidelines of a \\"filth\\" disease, and therefore would only affect the \\"lower classes\\".[68]\\r\\nThe last major smallpox epidemic in the United States occurred in Boston, Massachusetts throughout a three-year period, between 1901-1903. During this three-year period, 1596 cases of the disease occurred throughout the city. Of those cases, nearly 300 people died. As a whole, the epidemic had a 17% fatality rate.[69]\\r\\nThose who were infected with the disease were detained in quarantine facilities in the hopes of protecting others from getting sick. These quarantine facilities, or pesthouses, were mostly located on Southampton Street. As the outbreak worsened, men were also moved to hospitals on Gallops Island. Women and children were primarily sent to Southampton Street. Smallpox patients were not allowed in regular hospital facilities throughout the city, for fear the sickness would spread among the already sick.[70]\\r\\nA reflection of the previous outbreak that occurred in New York, the poor and homeless were blamed for the sickness's spread. In response to this belief, the city instructed teams of physicians to vaccinate anyone living in inexpensive housing.\\r\\nIn an effort to control the outbreak, the Boston Board of Health began voluntary vaccination programs. Individuals could receive free vaccines at their work places or at different stations set up throughout the city. By the end 1901, some 40,000 of the citys residents had received a smallpox vaccine. However, despite the city's efforts, the epidemic continued to grow. In January 1902, a door-to-door vaccination program was initiated. Health officials were instructed to compel individuals to receive vaccination, pay a $5 fine, or be faced with 15 days in prison. This door-to-door program was met by some resistance as some individuals feared the vaccines to be unsafe and ineffective. Others felt compulsory vaccination in itself was a problem that violated an individual's civil liberties.\\r\\nThis program of compulsory vaccination eventually led to the famous Jacobson v. Massachusetts case. The case was the result of a Cambridge resident's refusal to be vaccinated. Henning Jacobsen, a Swedish immigrant, refused vaccination out of fear it would cause him illness. He claimed a previous smallpox vaccine had made him sick as a child. Rather than pay the five dollar fine, he challenged the state's authority on forcing people to receive vaccination. His case was lost at the state level, but Jacobson appealed the ruling, and so, the case was taken up by the Supreme Court. In 1905 the Supreme Court upheld the Massachusetts law: it was ruled Jacobson could not refuse the mandatory vaccination.[69]\\r\\nIn Canada, between 1702 and 1703, nearly a quarter of the population of Quebec city died due to a smallpox epidemic.[28]\\r\\nThere is evidence that smallpox reached the Philippine islands from the 4th century CE onwards ÿ linked possibly to contact between South East Asians and Indian traders.[71]\\r\\nDuring the 18th century, there were many major outbreaks of smallpox, driven possibly by increasing contact with European colonists and traders. There were epidemics, for instance, in the Sultanate of Banjar (South Kalimantan), in 1734, 1750ÿ51, 1764ÿ65 and 1778ÿ79; in the Sultanate of Tidore (Moluccas ) during the 1720s, and in southern Sumatra during the 1750s, the 1770s and in 1786.[71][72][73]\\r\\nSmallpox is exogenous to Australia. The first recorded outbreak, in 1789, devastated the Aboriginal population; while the extent of this outbreak is disputed, some sources claim that it killed about 50% of coastal Aboriginal populations on the east coast.[74] There is an ongoing historical debate concerning two rival and irreconcilable theories about how the disease first entered the continent. The central hypotheses of these theories suggest that smallpox was transmitted to indigenous Australians by either:\\r\\nIn 1914, Dr J.?H.?L. Cumpston, director of the Australian Quarantine Service tentatively put forward the hypothesis that smallpox arrived with British settlers.[75] Cumpston's theory was most forcefully reiterated by the economic historian Noel Butlin, in his book Our Original Aggression (1983).[76] Likewise David Day, in Claiming a Continent: A New History of Australia (2001), suggested that members of Sydney's garrison of Royal Marines may have attempted to use smallpox as a biological weapon in 1789.[77] However, in 2002, historian John Connor stated that Day's theory was \\"unsustainable\\".[78] That same year, theories that smallpox was introduced with settlers, deliberately or otherwise, were contested in a full-length book by historian Judy Campbell: Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780-1880 (2002).[79] Campbell consulted, during the writing of her book, Frank Fenner, who had overseen the final stages of a successful campaign by the World Health Organization (WHO) to eradicate smallpox. Campbell argued that scientific evidence concerning the viability of variolous matter (used for inoculation) did not support the possibility of the disease being brought to Australia on the long voyage from Europe. Campbell also noted that there was no evidence of Aborigines ever having been exposed to the variolous matter, merely speculation that they may have been. Later authors, such as Christopher Warren,[80] and Craig Mear [81] continued to argue that smallpox emanated from the importation of variolous matter on the First Fleet. Warren (2007) suggested that Campbell had erred in assuming that high temperatures would have sterilised the British supply of smallpox.[80] H. A. Willis (2010), in a survey of the literature discussed above, endorsed Campbell's argument.[82] In response, Warren (2011) suggested that Willis had not taken into account research on how heat affects the smallpox virus, cited by the WHO.[83] Willis (2011) replied that his position was supported by a closer reading of Frank Fenners report to the WHO (1988) and invited readers to consult that report online.[2][84]\\r\\nThe rival hypothesis, that the 1789 outbreak was introduced to Australia by visitors from Makassar, came to prominence in 2002, with Judy Campbell's book Invisible Invaders.[79] Campbell expanded upon the opinion of C.?C. Macknight (1986), an authority on the interaction between indigenous Australians and Makassans.[85] Citing the scientific opinion of Fenner (who wrote the foreword to her book) and historical documents, Campbell argued that the 1789 outbreak was introduced to Australia by Makassans, from where it spread overland.[79] Nevertheless, Michael Bennett in a 2009 article in Bulletin of the History of Medicine, argued that imported \\"variolous matter\\" may have been the source of the 1789 epidemic in Australia.[86] In 2011, Macknight re-entered the debate, declaring: The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Makassan] trepangers on the north coast and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there.[87] Warren (2013) disputed this, on the grounds that: there was no suitable smallpox in Makassar before 1789; there were no trade routes suitable for transmission to Port Jackson; the theory of a Makassan source for smallpox in 1789 was contradicted by Aboriginal oral tradition, and; the earliest point at which there was evidence of smallpox entering Australia with Makassan visitors was around 1824.[88]\\r\\nAnother major outbreak was observed in 1828ÿ30, near Bathurst, New South Wales.[75] A third epidemic occurred in the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia from the mid-1860s,[82] until at least 1870.\\r\\nElsewhere in the Pacific, smallpox killed many indigenous Polynesians.[89] Nevertheless, Alfred Crosby, in his major work, Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (1986) showed that in 1840 a ship with smallpox on it was successfully quarantined, preventing an epidemic amongst Mori of New Zealand. The only major outbreak in New Zealand was a 1913 epidemic, which affected Mori in northern New Zealand and nearly wiped out the Rapa Nui of Easter Island (Rapa Nui), was reported by Te Rangi Hiroa (Dr Peter Buck) to a medical congress in Melbourne in 1914.[90]\\r\\nThe whaler ship Delta brought smallpox to the Micronesian island of Pohnpei on 28 February 1854. The Pohnpeians reacted by first feasting their offended spirits and then resorted hiding. The disease eventually wiped out more than half the island's population. The deaths of chiefs threw Pohnpeian society into disarray, and the people started blaming the God of the Christian missionaries. The Christian missionaries themselves saw the epidemic as God's punishment for the people and offered the natives inoculations, though often withheld such treatment from the priests. The epidemic abated in October 1854.[91]\\r\\nOne viewpoint is that smallpox emerged in 1588 AD and the earlier reported cases were incorrectly identified as smallpox.[92][93]\\r\\nEarly in history, it was observed that those who had contracted smallpox once were never struck by the disease again. Thought to have been discovered by accident, it became known that those who contracted smallpox through a break in the skin in which smallpox matter was inserted received a less severe reaction than those who contracted it naturally. This realization led to the practice of purposely infecting people with matter from smallpox scabs in order to protect them later from a more severe reaction. This practice, known today as variolation, was first practiced in China in the 10th century.[28] Methods of carrying out the procedure varied depending upon location. Variolation was the sole method of protection against smallpox other than quarantine until Jenner's discovery of the inoculating abilities of cowpox against the smallpox virus in 1796. Efforts to protect populations against smallpox by way of vaccination followed for centuries after Jenner's discovery. Smallpox has since been completely eradicated since 1979, because of the mass vaccination efforts of the World Health Organization.\\r\\nThe word variolation is synonymous with inoculation, insertion, en-grafting, or transplantation. The term is used to define insertion of smallpox matter, and distinguishes this procedure from vaccination, where cowpox matter was used to obtain a much milder reaction among patients.[28]\\r\\nThe practice of variolation (also known as inoculation) first came out of East Asia.[94] First writings documenting variolation in China appear around 1500. Scabs from smallpox victims who had the disease in its mild form would be selected, and the powder was kept close to body temperature by means of keeping it close to the chest, killing the majority of the virus and resulting in a more mild case of smallpox.[95] Scabs were generally used when a month old, but could be used more quickly in hot weather (15ÿ20 days), and slower in winter (50 days). The process was carried out by taking eight smallpox scabs and crushing them in a mortar with two grains of Uvularia grandiflora in a mortar.[28] The powder was administered nasally through a silver tube that was curved at its point, through the right nostril for boys and the left nostril for girls.[95] A week after the procedure, those variolated would start to produce symptoms of smallpox, and recovery was guaranteed. In India, where the European colonizers came across variolation in the 17th century, a large, sharp needle was dipped into the pus collected from mature smallpox sores. Several punctures with this needle were made either below the deltoid muscle or in the forehead, and then were covered with a paste made from boiled rice.[95] Variolation spread farther from India to other countries in south west Asia, and then to the Balkans.[28]\\r\\nIn 1713, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's brother died of smallpox; she too contracted the virus two years later at the age of twenty-six, leaving her badly scarred.[97] When her husband was made ambassador to Ottoman Empire, she accompanied him to Constantinople. It was here that Lady Mary first came upon variolation.[98] Two Greek women made it their business to engraft people with pox that left them un-scarred and unable to catch the pox again.[97] In a letter, she wrote that she intended to have her own son undergo the process and would try to bring variolation into fashion in England.[99] Her son underwent the procedure, which was performed by Charles Maitland,[97] and survived with no ill effects. When an epidemic broke out in London following her return, Lady Mary wanted to protect her daughter from the virus by having her variolated as well. Maitland performed the procedure, which was a success.[97] The story made it to the newspapers and was a topic for discussion in London salons.[98] Princess Caroline of Wales wanted her children variolated as well but first wanted more validation of the operation. She had both an orphanage and several convicts variolated before she was convinced.[94][97] When the operation, performed by the King's surgeon, Claudius Amyand, and overseen by Maitland,[95] was a success, variolation got the royal seal of approval and the practice became widespread.[100] When the practice of variolation set off local epidemics and caused death in two cases, public reaction was severe. Minister Edmund Massey, in 1772, called variolation dangerous and sinful, saying that people should handle the disease as the biblical figure Job did with his own tribulations, without interfering with God's test for mankind.[95][98] Lady Mary still worked at promoting variolation but its practice waned until 1743.[98]\\r\\nRobert and Daniel Sutton further revived the practice of variolation in England by advertising their perfect variolation record, maintained by selecting patients who were healthy when variolated and were cared for during the procedure in the Sutton's own hygienic hospital.[98] Other changes that the Suttons made to carrying out the variolation process include reducing and later abolishing the preparatory period before variolation was carried out, making more shallow incisions to distribute the smallpox matter, using smallpox matter collected on the fourth day of the disease, where the pus taken was still clear, and recommending that those inoculated get fresh air during recovery.[95] The introduction of the shallower incision reduced both complications associated with the procedure and the severity of the reaction.[96] The prescription of fresh air caused controversy about Sutton's method and how effective it was in reality when those inoculated could walk about and spread the disease to those that had never before experienced smallpox.[95] It was the Suttons who introduced the idea of mass variolation of an area when an epidemic broke out as means of protection to the inhabitants in that location.[96]\\r\\nNews of variolation spread to the royal families of Europe. Several royal families had themselves variolated by English physicians claiming to be specialists. Recipients include the family of Louis XV following his own death of smallpox, and Catherine the Great, whose husband had been horribly disfigured by the disease.[98][100] Catherine the Great was variolated by Thomas Dimsdale, who followed Sutton's method of inoculation.[95] In France, the practice was sanctioned until an epidemic was traced back to an inoculation. After this instance, variolation was banned within city limits. These conditions caused physicians to move just outside the cities and continue to practice variolation in the suburbs.[98]\\r\\nEdward Jenner was variolated in 1756 at age eight in an inoculation barn in Wotton-under-Edge, England. At this time, in preparation for variolation children were bled repeatedly and were given very little to eat and only given a diet drink made to sweeten their blood. This greatly weakened the children before the actual procedure was given.[95][101] Jenner's own inoculation was administered by a Mr. Holbrow, an apothecary. The procedure involved scratching the arm with the tip of a knife, placing several smallpox scabs in the cuts and then bandaging the arm. After receiving the procedure, the children stayed in the barn for several weeks to recover. First symptoms occurred after one week and usually cleared up three days later. On average, it took a month to fully recover from the encounter with smallpox combined with weakness from the preceding starvation.[98]\\r\\nAt the age of thirteen, Jenner was sent to study medicine in Sodbury with Daniel Ludlow, a surgeon and apothecary, from 1762 to 1770[97][101][102] who had a strong sense of cleanliness which Jenner learned from him. During his apprenticeship, Jenner heard that upon contracting cowpox, the recipient became immune to smallpox for the remainder of their life.[97][100] However, this theory was dismissed because of several cases proving that the opposite was true.\\r\\nAfter learning all he could from Ludlow, Jenner apprenticed with John Hunter in London from 1770ÿ1773.[97][102] Hunter was a correspondent of Ludlows, and it is likely that Ludlow recommended Jenner to apprentice with Hunter. Hunter believed in deviating from the accepted treatment and trying new methods if the traditional methods failed. This was considered unconventional medicine for the time period and had a pivotal role in Jenner's development as a scientist.[98][103]\\r\\nAfter two years of apprenticeship, Jenner moved back to his hometown of Berkeley,[102] where he quickly gained the respect of both his patients and other medical professionals for his work as a physician.[98] It was during this time that Jenner revisited the connection between cowpox and smallpox.[97] He began investigating dairy farms in the Gloucestershire area looking for cowpox. This research was slow going as Jenner often had to wait months or even years before cases of cowpox would again return to the Gloucestershire area.[98] During his study, he found that cowpox was actually several diseases that were similar in nature but were distinguishable through slight differences, and that not all versions had the capacity to make one immune from smallpox upon contraction.[97]\\r\\nThrough his study, he incorrectly deduced that smallpox and cowpox were all the same disease, simply manifesting themselves differently in different animals, eventually setting back his research and making it difficult to publish his findings. Though Jenner had seen cases of people becoming immune to smallpox after having cowpox, too many exceptions of people still contracting smallpox after having had cowpox were arising. Jenner was missing crucial information which he later discovered in 1796.[98] Jenner hypothesized that in order to become immune to smallpox using cowpox, the matter from the cowpox pustules must be administered at maximum potency; else it was too weak to be effective in creating immunity to smallpox. He deduced that cowpox was most likely to transfer immunity from smallpox if administered at the eighth day of the disease.[97]\\r\\nOn May 14, 1796, he performed an experiment in which he took pus from a sore of a cowpox infected milkmaid named Sarah Nelmes and applied it to a few small scratches on the arm of an eight-year-old boy who had never before contracted either smallpox or cowpox, named James Phipps. Phipps recovered as expected.[97] Two months later, Jenner repeated the procedure using matter from smallpox, observing no effect. Phipps became the first person to become immune to smallpox without ever actually having the disease. He was variolated many more times over the course of his life to prove his immunity.[98]\\r\\nWhen the next cowpox epidemic broke out in 1798, Jenner conducted a series of inoculations using cowpox, all of them successful[97] except on his own son Robert.[98] Because his findings were revolutionary and lacked in evidence, the Royal Society (of whom Jenner was a member) refused to publish his findings.[98] Jenner then rode to London and had his book published by Sampson Lows firm[101] in June 1798[104] The book was an instant bestseller among the elite in London salons, in the medical establishment and among the ladies and gentlemen of the enlightenment.[98]\\r\\nKnowledge of the ability of cowpox to provide immunity from smallpox was present in England before Jenner's discovery. In 1774, a cattle dealer named Benjamin Jesty successfully inoculated his wife and three sons using cowpox. This was before Jenner discovered the immunization capabilities of cowpox.[100] However, Jesty simply performed the procedure; he did not take the discovery any further by inoculating his family with smallpox matter to see if there would be a reaction or perform any other trials.[95] Jenner was the first to prove the effectiveness of vaccination with cowpox using experimentation.[98]\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin, who had lost his own son to smallpox in 1736, made the suggestion to create a pamphlet to distribute to families explaining how to inoculate their children themselves, so as to eliminate cost as the factor in the decision to choose to inoculate children. William Heberden, a friend of Franklin's and an English physician, followed through with Franklin's idea, printing 2000 pamphlets in 1759 which were distributed by Franklin in America.[95]\\r\\nAn American physician, John Kirkpatrick, upon his visit to London in 1743, told of an instance where variolation stopped an epidemic in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1738,[105] where 800 people were inoculated and only eight deaths occurred.[95] His account of the success of variolation in Charleston helped to play a role in the revival of its practice in London. Kirkpatrick also advocated inoculating patients with matter from the sores of another inoculated person, instead of using matter from the sore of a smallpox victim, a procedure that Maitland had been using since 1722.[96]","input":"When did smallpox transfer from cattle to humans?"},{"output":"15 miles east of downtown Cincinnati","context":"Milford is a city in Clermont and Hamilton counties[6] started in 1796, in the U.S. state of Ohio, along the Little Miami River and its East Fork in the southwestern part of the state. It is a part of Greater Cincinnati. Milford, an abbreviated form of mill ford, was so named because it was the first safe ford across the Little Miami north of the Ohio River, and was the only way for many people to reach the local mill. The population was 6,709 at the 2010 census.[7] The Little Miami Bike Trail, which runs from Newtown to Springfield, Ohio, runs through Milford where several major hiking trails converge, including the American Discovery Trail, the Sea to Sea Long Distance Hiking Route, and the Underground Railroad Cycling Route. The city is served by the Milford Exempted Village Schools.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMilford has been inhabited since prehistoric times. A field along Gatch Avenue on what was once the farm of John Gatch has yielded large numbers of artifacts for several generations; it is now believed to have been the site of a Native American village during the Woodland period. Today, the field is an archaeological site known as the \\"Gatch Site.\\"[8]\\r\\nThe areas known as Milford, Old Milford, and Miami Township were built on a survey by John Nancarrow, a Revolutionary War veteran from Virginia. Miami Township was named after the Little Miami River and the tribe of Native Americans who once controlled this area. Miami Township was originally named O'Bannon Township in honor of the county's first surveyor. The town began in 1796 as Hageman's Mills near where two river waysthe Little Miami River and its East Forkcome together, and was later better-named Milford. The first Methodist class in the Northwest Territory was begun there in 1798. Due to financial troubles, Nancarrow, the first surveyor, never visited Milford, and instead sold his share of 230 acres (0.93?km2) of land to Philip Gatch on December 20, 1802, for a total of $920.00. Four years later, Gatch decided to sell 125 acres (0.51?km2) to Ambrose Ranson who, soon after, sold 64 acres (260,000?m2) to John Hageman. Hageman became the first permanent settler, naming the valley Hageman's Mills.\\r\\nBy 1815, Hageman had left for Indiana, and the name Milford had come into popular use. In 1818 a wooden bridge across the Little Miami was completed, making the ford obsolete. More than a century later, on January 1, 1920, the mill that was the city's namesake burned down. Today, Milford seeks to maintain its own urban identity, being exurb of nearby Cincinnati throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with many of its residents working in Cincinnati. Milford is the only city in Clermont besides Loveland, which includes parts of Hamilton County. Milford is 15 miles east of downtown Cincinnati along Columbia Parkway and across the Little Miami Scenic River in Clermont County. The City offers the convenience of being close to Cincinnati with and many opportunities for outdoor recreation including the Little Miami Scenic Bike Trail, the Little Miami River, and Valley View, a 150 acre nature preserve on the banks of the East Fork of the Little Miami.\\r\\nMilford Schools senior graduates are called Milfordians. Residents who did not attend and graduate Milford, yet vote for Milford Schools, are known as Milfordites. The Milford Schools area has around 6,000 students. On the 2016-17 state report card the performance index ranked Milford within the top 4% in the state and Top 10 of Cincinnati Schools. The high school and junior high school share a scenic campus in the Miami Hills. The six neighborhood schools are Boyd E.

Established in 1931, this public university of India is one of the oldest and most prestigious institutions focused on statistics, and its early reputation led it to being adopted as a model for the first US institute of Statistics set up at the Research Triangle, North Carolina by Gertrude Mary Cox.[2]\\r\\nMahalanobis, the founder of ISI, was deeply influenced by wisdom and guidance of Rabindranath Tagore and Brajendranath Seal. Under his leadership, the institute initiated and promoted the interaction of Statistics with natural and social sciences to advance the role of Statistics as a key technology by explicating the twin aspects?ÿ its general applicability and its dependence on other disciplines for its own development. The institute is now considered as one of the foremost centres in the world for training and research in Computer science, Statistics, Quantitative Economics and related sciences.\\r\\nISI has its headquarters in Baranagar, a suburb of Kolkata, West Bengal. It has four subsidiary centres focused in academics at Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and Tezpur, and a branch at Giridih. In addition, the Institute has a network of units of Statistical Quality Control and Operations Research at Vadodara, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune engaged in guiding the industries, within and outside India, in developing the most upÿtoÿdate quality management systems and solving critical problems of quality, reliability and productivity.\\r\\nPrimary activities of ISI are research and training of Statistics, development of theoretical Statistics and its applications in various natural and social sciences. Originally affiliated with the University of Calcutta, the institute was declared an institute of national importance in 1959, through an act of Indian parliament, Indian Statistical Institute act, 1959. ISI functions under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) of the Government of India.[3]\\r\\nKey areas of expertise of ISI are Computer science, Statistics, Mathematics, Mathematical economics, Operations Research and Information Science and it is one of the few research oriented Indian schools offering courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nISI's origin can be traced back to the Statistical Laboratory in Presidency College, Kolkata set up by Mahalanobis, who worked in the Physics Department of the college in the 1920s. During 1913ÿ15, he did his Tripos in Mathematics and Physics at University of Cambridge,[4] where he came across Biometrica, a journal of Statistics founded by Karl Pearson.[5] Since 1915, he taught Physics at Presidency College,[4] but his interest in Statistics grew under the guidance of polymath Brajendranath Seal.[5] Many colleagues of Mahalanobis took an interest in Statistics and the group grew in the Statistical Laboratory. Considering the extensive application of Statistics in solving various problems in real life such as analyzing multivariate anthropometric data, applying sample surveys as a method of data collection, analyzing meteorological data, estimating crop yield etc., this group, particularly, Mahalanobis and his younger colleagues S. S. Bose and H. C. Sinha felt the necessity of forming a specialized institute to facilitate research and learning of Statistics.[6]\\r\\nOn 17 December 1931, Mahalonobis held a meeting with Pramatha Nath Banerji (Minto Professor of Economics), Nikhil Ranjan Sen (Khaira Professor of Applied Mathematics) and Sir R. N. Mukherji.[6][7][8] This meeting led to the establishment of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), which was formally registered on 28 April 1932, as a non-profit distributing learned society under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860.[7][8] Later, the institute was registered under the West Bengal Societies Registration Act XXVI of 1961 amended in 1964.[9] Mukherjee accepted the role of the president of ISI and held this position until his death in 1936.[9] In 1953,[10] ISI was relocated to a property owned by Professor Mahalanobis, named \\"Amrapali\\", in Baranagar, which is now a municipality at the northern outskirts of Kolkata.\\r\\nIn 1931, Mahalanobis was the only person working at ISI, and he managed it with an annual expenditure of Rs.250. It gradually grew with the pioneering work of a group of his colleagues including S. S. Bose, Samarendra Kumar Mitra (Head of the Computing Machines and Electronics Laboratory and designer of India's first computer), J. M. Sengupta, Raj Chandra Bose, Samarendra Nath Roy, K. R. Nair, R. R. Bahadur, Gopinath Kallianpur, D. B. Lahiri, and Anil Kumar Gain. Pitamber Pant, who had received training in Statistics at the institute, went on to become a secretary to the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, and was a great source of help and support to the institute.[7]\\r\\nThe institute started a training section in 1938. In due course, many of the early workers left the ISI for careers in the USA or for positions in public/private sector in India. By the 1940s, the ISI was internationally known and was taken as a model when the first institute of Statistics was set up in the United States by Gertrude Cox?ÿ perhaps the only time an institute in a developing country was used as a model in a developed country.[2]\\r\\nAs asked by the Government of India, in 1950, ISI designed and planned a comprehensive socioÿeconomic national sample survey covering rural India. The organisation named National Sample Survey (NSS) was founded in 1950 for conducting this survey.[11] The field work was performed by the Directorate of NSS, functioning under the Ministry of Finance, whereas the other tasks such as planning of the survey, training of field workers, review, data processing and tabulation were executed by ISI.[11] In 1961, the Directorate of NSS started functioning under the Department of Statistics of Government of India, and later in 1971, the design and analysis wing of NSS was shifted from ISI to the Department of Statistics forming the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO).[11]\\r\\nJ. B. S. Haldane joined the ISI as a research professor from August 1957, and stayed on until February 1961, when he had a falling out with ISI Director P.C. Mahalanobis over Haldane's going on a much-publicized hunger strike to protest the United States pressuring U.S. National Science Fair winners Gary Botting and Susan Brown from attending an ISI banquet to which many prominent Indian scientists had been invited.[12] Haldane helped the ISI grow in biometrics.[13] Haldane also played a key role in developing the structure and content of the courses offered by ISI.\\r\\nUntil 1959, ISI was associated with the University of Calcutta. By 'The Indian Statistical Institute Act 1959' of the Parliament of India, amended in 1995, ISI was declared an institute of national importance,[1] and was authorised to hold examinations and to grant degrees and diplomas in Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Economics, and in any other subject related to Statistics as identified by the Institute from time to time.[1] ISI is a public university, as the same act also states that ISI would be funded by the Central Government of India.[1]\\r\\nISI had by the 1960s started establishing special service units in New Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai and Hyderabad to provide consultancy services to business, industry and governmental public service organisations in the areas of Statistical Process Control, Operations Research and Industrial Engineering. Additionally, Bangalore had a Documentation Research and Training Centre (DRTC). In the early 1970s, the Delhi and Bangalore units were converted to teaching centres. In 2008, ISI Chennai was upgraded to a teaching centre.[14] In 2011, ISI added a new centre in Tezpur.[15]\\r\\nISI functions as an autonomous institute under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), which is the nodal ministry of the Government of India that ensures the functioning of ISI in accordance with The Indian Statistical Institute Act 1959.[3] ISI Council is the highest policyÿmaking body of the institute.[16] Members of this council include the President of ISI, the Chairman of ISI, representatives of the Government of India including one representative of RBI, scientists not employed in ISI including one representative from the Planning Commission of India and one representative of the UGC, representatives of scientific and non-scientific workers of ISI, and representative from academic staff of ISI, including the Director of ISI and the Dean of Studies of ISI.[16] Bimal Kumar Roy was the Director until 10 June 2015; in a move unique in the history of the Institute, he was removed from his post via a notice posted on the web site of the Ministry of Statistics and Planning.[17]\\r\\nThe major objectives of the ISI are[18] to facilitate research and training of Statistics, to indulge in development of statistical theory and in application of statistical techniques?ÿ in the scenarios of planning at national level and in theoretical development of natural and social sciences, to participate in the process of data collection and analysis, to operate related projects in planning and improvement of efficiency of management and production.\\r\\nThe Sanskrit phrase ???????????????? ??????? (Bhinneswaykyasya Darshanam), which literally means the philosophy of unity in diversity, is incorporated in the logo of the institute, and is the motto of ISI.[18]\\r\\nTraditionally, ISI offers fewer programs (and admits fewer students) than most other degree granting academic institutions. Following the empowerment for granting degrees in the subject of Statistics as per the ISI Act 1959, in 1960, ISI initiated bachelor level degree program Bachelor of Statistics and master level degree course Master of Statistics, and also began awarding research level degrees such as PhD and DSc.[19] Later, ISI started offering Master of Technology (MTech) courses in Computer Science and in Quality, Reliability & Operations Research (QR&OR); these courses got recognition from All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).[19] As ISI Act of 1959 was amended by the Parliament of India in 1995, ISI was empowered to confer degrees and diplomas in subjects such as Mathematics, Quantitative Economics, Computer Science, and other subjects related to Statistics and Operations Research as determined by ISI from time to time.[19] Apart from the degree courses, ISI offers few diploma and certificate courses, special diploma courses for international students via ISEC, and special courses in collaboration with CSO for training probationary officers of Indian Statistical Service (ISS).[20]\\r\\nISI offers two undergraduate programs, viz. Bachelor of Statistics (Honours) (B.Stat) and Bachelor of Mathematics (Honours) (B. Math),[21] seven graduate programs, viz. Master of Statistics (M. Stat), Master of Mathematics (M. Math), Master of Science in Quantitative Economics (MSQE), Master of Science in Library and Information Science (MSLIS), Master of Science in Quality Management Science (MSQMS), Master of Technology in Computer Science (MTechÿCS) and Master of Technology in Quality, Reliability and Operations Research (MTechÿQROR),[21] three PG Diploma programs, viz Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Applications (PGDCA)[22] and P.G. Diploma in Statistical Methods and Analytics and research fellowships towards obtaining a PhD degree.[21]. The third PG diploma program being in collaboration with IIM Calcutta and IIT Kharagpur - Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA)[23] with an aim to nurture and develop highly skilled business analytical professionals.\\r\\nUndergraduate courses are of 3 years duration, whereas the graduate level courses of 2 years of duration. For all undergraduate and graduate level courses, the academic year is divided in two semesters.[20] Except for sponsored candidates of MTech courses, ISI students are not required to pay any tuition fees.[20] Conditional to performance beyond a threshold, all students and research fellows receive stipends, fellowships and contingency/book grants.[20] Students demonstrating outstanding performances are rewarded at the end of the semesters.[20] ISI campuses provide hostel accommodations with recreational facilities and limited medical facilities available free of cost.[20]\\r\\nApplicants of all degree courses are required to go through written admission tests and interviews.[20] ISI conducts the written tests at various examination centres across India.[20] Only in few cases, candidates may get called for the interview directly, viz. applicants of MTech Computer Science course having a GATE score above a threshold.[20] Also, candidates of research fellowship programmes having already qualified for a fellowship from CSIR or NBHM, can directly appear in an interview.[20]\\r\\nIn 1950, ISI, in collaboration with International Statistical Institute, UNESCO and Government of India, had set up International Statistical Education Centre (ISEC) to impart knowledge of theoretical and applied statistics to participants from Middle East, East and South-East Asia, the Far East and Commonwealth countries of Africa.[19] The main training course offered by ISEC is meant for international students, preferably graduates with proficiency in English and Mathematics.[24] ISEC, located in Kolkata campus of ISI, functions with support from the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation of the Government of India.[25]\\r\\nSankhya, the statistical journal published by ISI, was founded in 1933, along the lines of Karl Pearson's Biometrika.[7] Mahalanobis was the founder editor.[19] Each volume of Sankhya consists of four issues; two of them are in Series A, containing articles on theoretical statistics, probability theory and stochastic processes, and the other two issues form the Series B, containing articles on applied statistics, i.e. applied probability, applied stochastic processes, econometrics and statistical computing.[26]\\r\\nAccording to India Education Review, no Indian university is in the world's top 200 universities.[27] The ascribed ranking of ISI is 386.[28] The web ranking of this institute, according to 4ICU (4 International Colleges and Universities), is 1693.[29] According to the web ranking published by Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, ISI currently holds the world rank of 2086.[30] In the subject-wise academic world ranking of Computer Science, Indian Statistical Institute features in 101150 category.[31] The Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata is ranked 2nd in Computer Science research by mean citation rate, p-Index, h-index among all universities in India.[32]\\r\\nOver the years, researchers of ISI made fundamental contributions in various fields of Statistics such as Design of Experiments, Sample Survey, Multivariate statistics and Computer Science. Mahalanobis introduced the measure Mahalanobis distance which is used in multivariate statistics and other related fields.[33] Raj Chandra Bose, who is known for his contributions in coding theory, worked on Design of Experiments during his tenure at ISI, and was one of the three mathematicians, who disproved Euler's conjecture on orthogonal Latin squares.[10] Anil Kumar Bhattacharya is credited with introduction of the measures Bhattacharyya distance and Bhattacharya coefficient. Samarendra Nath Roy is known for his pioneering contributions in multivariate statistics.[34] Among colleagues of Mahalanobis, other notable contributors were K. R. Nair in Design of experiments, Jitendra Mohan Sengupta in Sample Survey, Ajit Dasgupta in Demography and Ramkrishna Mukherjea in Quantitative Sociology.[10] C. R. Rao's contributions during his association with ISI include two theorems of Statistical Inference known as CramrÿRao inequality and Rao-Blackwell Theorem, and introduction of orthogonal arrays in Design of Experiments. Anil Kumar Gain is known for his contributions to the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient with his colleague Sir Ronald Fisher at the University of Cambridge.[33]\\r\\nIn 1953, India's first indigenous computer was designed by Samarendra Kumar Mitra who headed the Computing Machines and Electronics Laboratory at ISI Calcutta.\\r\\nDuring 1953 - 1956 distinguished scientists, like Ronald Fisher, Norbert Wiener and Yuri Linnik visited ISI. Norbert Wiener collaborated with Gopinath Kallianpur on topics including ergodic theory, prediction theory and generalized harmonic analysis[35] In 1962, during his month-long visit to ISI, Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov wrote his notable paper on Kolmogorov Complexity, which was published in Sankhya, 1963.[36] Other distinguished scientists including Jerzy Neyman, Walter A. Shewhart, W. Edwards Deming and Abraham Wald have visited ISI during the tenure of P. C. Mahalanobis.[37]\\r\\nThe second five-year plan of India was a brainchild of Mahalanobis. The plan followed the Mahalanobis model, an economic development model developed by Mahalanobis in 1953. The plan attempted to determine the optimal allocation of investment between productive sectors in order to maximise long-run economic growth . It used the prevalent state of art techniques of operations research and optimisation as well as the novel applications of statistical models developed at ISI. This second five-year plan shifted the focus from agriculture to industrialisation, with an objective of attaining self-reliance by economy of India. Domestic production of industrial products was encouraged in this plan, particularly in the development of the public sector.[38] The two-pronged strategy devised in this plan targeted rapid growth of the heavy industry, keeping emphasis on growth of small and cottage industries.[39]\\r\\nB. S. Minhas and K. S. Parikh, both from the Planning Unit of ISI Delhi, played key roles in the Planning Commission of the Government of India. Minhas, who joined the Planning Unit in 1962 and retired as a distinguished scientist in 1989, was a member of the Planning Commission during 1971ÿ74.[40][41] Parikh, who was a member of the Planning Commission during 2004ÿ09,[40] chaired Integrated Energy Policy Committee of the commission,[42] was a member of the Economic Advisory Council of India during the tenure of five prime ministers,[42] also played a role in the Department of Atomic Energy establishment, and was a key advisor to the government on energy issues.[42]\\r\\nIn India, the first analog computer was designed by Samarendra Kumar Mitra and built by Ashish Kumar Maity at ISI in 1953, for use in computation of numerical solutions of simultaneous linear equations using a modified version of Gauss-Siedel iteration.[43] In 1955, the first digital computer of India was procured by ISI.[43] This machine was of a model named HEC-2M, manufactured by British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM).[43] As per the agreement with BTM, ISI had to take care of the installation work and maintenance of it,[43] before it became operational in 1956.[44] Though this HEC-2M machine and the URAL-1 machine, which was bought in 1959 from Russia,[43] were operational till 1963,[43] ISI began development of the first second-generation digital computer of India in collaboration with Jadavpur University (JU).[43] This joint collaboration led by the head of the Computing Machines and Electronics Laboratory at ISI, Samarendra Kumar Mitra, produced the transistor-driven machine ISIJU-1, which became operational in 1964.[44] The first annual convention of the Computer Society of India (CSI) was hosted by ISI in 1965.[43][44] The Computer and Communication Sciences division of ISI produced many eminent scientists such as Samarendra Kumar Mitra (its original founder), Dwijesh Dutta Majumdar, Sankar Kumar Pal, Bidyut B. Chaudhuri, Nikhil R. Pal, Bhabani P. Sinha, Bhargab B. Bhattacharya, Malay K. Kundu, Sushmita Mitra, Bhabatosh Chanda, C. A. Murthy, Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay and many. ISI is regarded as one of the top most centres for research in computer science in India and attracts some of the best students in the country.[45]\\r\\nThe Knowledge-based Computer Systems project (KBCS), funded jointly by Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DoE), Government of India and UNDP since 1986, has a nodal centre at ISI Kolkata.[46] This unit is responsible for research in the area of image processing, pattern recognition, computer vision and artificial intelligence.[47]\\r\\nR. L. Brahmachari, known for his work in many fields like agricultural sciences, zoology, botany, biometrics, did much of his work at ISI.\\r\\nThe institute has done some pioneering work and research in anthropology and palaeontology. A trove of dinosaur fossils was discovered by a team led by ISI researchers in the early 1960s. The scattered fossils were recovered and the partial skeleton was reconstructed at ISI's Baranagar campus. It turned out to be a unique species and was named the Isisaurus, after the institute.\\r\\nThe Linguistic Research Unit (LRU) of ISI was involved in the study of speech pathology. ?or?e Kosti? of this laboratory was a distinguished scientist. He invented a unique hearing aid, called SAFA (Selective Auditory Frequency Amplifier) that simulates frequency-range according to the need of the particular hearing impaired person.[48]\\r\\nMany students and research scholars of ISI pursued a career in academics, and have excelled in the fields of statistics, mathematics, probability theory, computer science and economics. In statistics alumni of ISI who have been elected a Fellow of the American Statistical Association include P. V. Sukhatme (1950) and K. R. Nair (1951).\\r\\nISI alumni notable for non-academic career include politicians Subramanian Swamy and Dipankar Bhattacharya.\\r\\nSoviet premier Nikita Khrushchev visited ISI during his visit to India in 1955.[35] Zhou Enlai, the Prime Minister of China, and Ho Chi Minh, the President of Vietnam, during their visit to India specifically visited ISI respectively on 9 September 1956 and 13 February 1958.[49]\\r\\nISI has its headquarters and the main campus in Kolkata. It has other centres in New Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and smaller units in Hyderabad, Mumbai, Coimbatore, Giridih, Pune and Vadodara.[50] Tezpur, the 4th centre of ISI was inaugurated in 2011.[51]\\r\\nSince mid-forties, ISI pioneered in research and application of Statistical Quality Control (SQC) in India.[52] Walter A. Shewhart, the statistician known as the father of SQC, and other experts of this field visited ISI over the years.[19] The first Statistical Quality Control and Operations Research (SQC & OR) unit of ISI was set up in Mumbai in 1953, followed by Bangalore and Kolkata units in 1954.[52] In 1976, this unit was transformed into the SQC & OR Division,[53] which now operates eight units, located at various industrial centres in India?ÿ Kolkata, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Mumbai, Coimbatore and Vadodara.[54] These units partake in technical consultancy with public and private organisations, in addition with performing research and training activities.[19]\\r\\nThe branch at Giridih was set up in 1931 and it has two operational units, viz. the Sociological Research Unit and the Agricultural Research Unit.[55]\\r\\nISI Kolkata has a campus consisting of six addresses at 201 through 206 Barrackpore Trunk Road, Baranagar. These include a house, which was an erstwhile office of the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) of India.\\r\\nISI Kolkata campus is eco-friendly, as conceived by Mahalanobis. Hollow bricks that protect from heat and noise were used with minimum use of reinforced concrete, to avoid radiation. There was no use of bitumen-basalt combination at the roads inside ISI campuses. This helps in reduction of radiation and preservation of rain water to maintain equilibrium in ground-water level.\\r\\nThe Kolkata campus offers bachelors level degree course in Statistics (B. Stat), master's degree course in Statistics (M.Stat), Mathematics (M.Math), Computer Science (MTech), Quality Reliability and Operations Research (MTech) and Quantitative Economics (M.S.).[21] Major divisions and units are: Statistics and Mathematics Unit (SMU), Human Genetics Unit (HGU), Physics and Applied Mathematics Unit (PAMU), Advanced Computation and MicroElectronics Unit (ACMU), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit (CVPRU), Machine Intelligence Unit (MIU), Electronics and Communication Sciences Unit (ECSU), Applied Statistics Unit (ASU), Economic Research Unit (ERU), Linguistic Research Unit (LRU), Sociology Research Unit (SRU), Psychometry Research Unit (PRU) and Population Studies Unit (PSU).\\r\\nThe Kolkata campus houses the International Statistical Education Centre (ISEC), which opened in 1950. This Centre provides training in statistics to sponsored students mainly from the Middle East, South and South East Asia, the Far East and the Commonwealth Countries of Africa. The Centre also offers various short-term courses in statistics and related subjects.\\r\\nThe Center for Soft Computing Research: A National Facility, an associate institute of Indian Statistical Institute and established in Kolkata in 2005, is unique in the country. Apart from conducting basic research, it offers a 3-month course and promotes less endowed institutes by providing fellowships and research grants.\\r\\nThe Central Library of ISI is located at Kolkata with branches at the other facilities. The library has over 200,000 volumes of books and journals with a special emphasis on the field of statistics and related studies. The main branch also has a collection of official reports, reprints, maps, and microfilms. The library receives over a thousand new technical and scientific journals every year. The Library has databases on CD-ROM and is working on further digitization of the collection. The library has a separate collection of works on the topics of mathematics and statistics called the Eastern Regional Centre of NBHM collection, funded by grants from the National Board for Higher Mathematics.\\r\\nMain road inside the Institute\\r\\nGardens near the main entrance\\r\\nNight view of the campus\\r\\nCanteen\\r\\nHostel\\r\\nLibrary\\r\\nThe ISI campus at New Delhi was established in 1974 and was shifted to the present campus in 1975.[56]\\r\\nThe Delhi campus offers two master level courses Master of Statistics (M. Stat) and Master of Science (M. S.) in Quantitative Economics, and doctoral programs.[21]\\r\\nMain building\\r\\nMain hostel\\r\\nGuest House\\r\\nAuditorium\\r\\nThe Bangalore Centre of ISI started with a Statistical Quality Control and Operations Research (SQC&OR) unit in 1954.[52] The Documentation Research and Training Centre (DRTC) here became operational from 1962 with honorary professor S. R. Ranganathan as the head.[57] Prof. Mahalanobis planned of starting a full-fledged centre of ISI here around the mid-sixties. In 1966, the then Government of Karnataka granted ISI 30 acres of forest land full of eucalyptus trees, next to the upcoming campus of the Bangalore University, located on the Mysore Road on the outskirts of the city.[58]\\r\\nHowever, after death of Prof. Mahalanobis in 1972, the project of establishing Bangalore centre got temporarily shelved. The project was again revived during 1976ÿ78. Concrete proposals were made to the Government of India to get grants for the development of the land already in possession of ISI, along with the construction of an academic block with a library and offices.[58]\\r\\nIn the meantime, a building was rented on Church Street, in Bangalore downtown, and various activities of the Bangalore Centre started in September 1978. The Economic Analysis Unit (EAU) and the Statistics and Mathematics Unit (SMU) were established. The SQC&OR Unit and the DRTC unit, which were functioning from other rented buildings at that time, joined this new Centre.\\r\\nAs construction of the administrative block at the new campus got completed, the various units moved to the new campus in May 1985. The sprawling green wooded Campus has Residential Facility for students, faculty and staff.\\r\\nThe Bangalore centre was formally declared as a centre of ISI in September 1996.[58]\\r\\nThe Systems Science and Informatics Unit (SSIU) was established in 2009[58]\\r\\nThe Bangalore centre has by now became an institution well known for its academic activities in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, SQC and Operations Research, Library and Information Science, and Quantitative Economics.[58]\\r\\nThe Bangalore campus offers bachelor level course Bachelor of Mathematics (B. Math), master level courses Master of Mathematics (M. Math), Master of Science (M. S.) in Library and Information Science and Master of Science (M. S.) in Quality Management Science, and doctoral programs.[21]\\r\\nIntegration is the annual techno-cultural fest of Indian Statistical Institute, usually held during the first and second weekend of January each year. It is one of the biggest student fests in Kolkata, and attracts participation from all over the world.Also the performances of great artists are always a center of attraction for all.\\r\\nAlumni of ISI?ÿ including recipients of PhD degree?ÿ are employed in government and semiÿgovernment departments, industrial establishments, research institutions, in India and other countries.[20] There is a placement cell in ISI Kolkata that organizes campus interviews by prospective employers in various campuses of ISI.[20] Since recent past, a high percentage of ISI alumni gets absorbed into jobs in analytics, banking, finance and software industry.[59]","input":"In what area has india done pioneering work?"},{"output":"Chicago, Illinois","context":"A Chicago-style hot dog, Chicago Dog, or Chicago Red Hot is an all-beef frankfurter[1][3] on a poppy seed bun,[4][5] originating from the city of Chicago, Illinois.[6][7] The hot dog is topped with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, bright green sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices or wedges, pickled sport peppers and a dash of celery salt.[1][8][9][10][11] The complete assembly of a Chicago hot dog is said to be \\"dragged through the garden\\" due to the many toppings.[12][13] The method for cooking the hot dog itself varies depending on the vendor's preference. Most often they are steamed, water-simmered, or less often grilled over charcoal (in which case they are referred to as \\"char-dogs\\").\\r\\nThe canonical recipe[1] does not include ketchup, and there is a widely shared, strong opinion among many Chicagoans and aficionados that ketchup is unacceptable.[14][15][16][17][18] A number of Chicago hot dog vendors do not offer ketchup as a condiment.[19] For National Hot Dog Day on July 19, 2017, Heinz created controversy by introducing ketchup, labeled as \\"Chicago Dog Sauce\\", to the disdain of many Chicagoans  but their effort also unearthed a minority of ketchup aficionados in the city.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany sources attribute the distinctive collection of toppings on a Chicago-style wiener to historic Maxwell Street and the \\"Depression Sandwich\\" reportedly originated by Fluky's in 1929.[1][12] The founders of Vienna Beef frankfurtersthe most common brand served today, first sold at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago[21][22][23]and the proprietors of Fluky's were both Jewish, which may account for the wieners' pork-free, kosher-style character.[23]\\r\\nThe \\"dragged through the garden\\" style is heavily promoted by Vienna Beef and Red Hot Chicago, the two most prominent Chicago hot dog manufacturers,[24] but exceptions are common, with vendors adding cucumber slices or lettuce,[1] omitting poppyseeds or celery salt, or using plain relish or a skinless hot dog.[25] Several popular hot dog stands serve a simpler version: a steamed natural-casing dog with only mustard, onions, plain relish and sport peppers, wrapped up with hand-cut french fries,[1] while the historic Superdawg drive-ins notably substitute a pickled tomato for fresh. Many vendors, including Portillo's, offer a Chicago-style dog with cheese sauce, known as a cheese-dog.\\r\\nChicago-style hot dogs are cooked in hot water or steamed before adding the toppings.[1][10] A less common style is cooked on a charcoal grill and referred to as a \\"char-dog\\". Char-dogs are easily identifiable because very often the ends of the dog are sliced in crisscross fashion before cooking, producing a distinctive cervelat-style \\"curled-x\\" shape as the dog cooks.[26] Some hot dog stands, such as the Wieners Circle,[27] only serve char-dogs.[28]\\r\\nThe typical beef hot dog weighs 1/8 of a pound or 2 ounces (57?g) and the most traditional type features a natural casing, providing a distinctive \\"snap\\" when bitten.[9][29]\\r\\nThe buns are a high-gluten variety made to hold up to steam warming, typically the S. Rosen's Mary Ann brand from Alpha Baking Company.[4]\\r\\nThe Chicago area has more hot dog restaurants than McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King restaurants combined.[22][23] A \\"hot dog stand\\" in Chicago may serve many other items, including the Maxwell Street Polish, gyros, pork chop and Italian beef sandwiches, corn dogs, tamales, pizza puffs and Italian ice. The restaurants often have unique names, such as The Wieners Circle, Gene & Jude's, Gold Coast Dogs or Mustard's Last Stand;[30] or architectural features, like Superdawg's two giant rooftop hot dogs (Maurie and Flaurie, named for the husband-and-wife team that founded the drive-in). One of the most popular vendors of the Chicago-style dog are Chicago's professional sports teams; in fact, those sold at Wrigley Field are affectionately known as \\"Wrigley Dogs\\".\\r\\nAfter Portillo's, Boz Hot Dogs (aka Bozo's) and Scooby's Red Hots have the most locations and thus also are top vendors of Chicago Style Red Hots.[31][not in citation given]","input":"Where did the chicago style hot dog originated?"},{"output":"Kiran Bedi","context":"Kiran Bedi (born 9 June 1949) is a retired Indian Police Service officer, social activist, former tennis player and politician who is the current Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry. She is the first woman to join the Indian Police Service (IPS). She remained in service for 35 years before taking voluntary retirement in 2007 as Director General, Bureau of Police Research and Development.\\r\\nAs a teenager, Bedi became the national junior tennis champion in 1966. Between 1965 and 1978, she won several titles at national and state-level championships. After joining IPS, Bedi served in Delhi, Goa, Chandigarh and Mizoram. She started her career as an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) in Chanakyapuri area of Delhi, and won the President's Police Medal in 1979. Next, she moved to West Delhi, where she brought a reduction in crimes against women. Subsequently, as a traffic police officer, she oversaw traffic arrangements for the 1982 Asian Games in Delhi and the 1983 CHOGM meet in Goa. As DCP of North Delhi, she launched a campaign against drug abuse, which evolved into the Navjyoti Delhi Police Foundation (renamed to Navjyoti India Foundation in 2007).\\r\\nIn May 1993, she was posted to the Delhi Prisons as Inspector General (IG). She introduced several reforms at Tihar Jail, which gained worldwide acclaim and won her the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1994. In 2003, Bedi became the first Indian woman to be appointed as a Police Advisor to Secretary-General of the United Nations, in the Department of Peace Keeping Operations. She resigned in 2007, to focus on social activism and writing. She has written several books, and runs the India Vision Foundation. During 2008ÿ11, she also hosted a court show Aap Ki Kachehri. She was one of the key leaders of the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement, and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in January 2015. She unsuccessfully contested the 2015 Delhi Assembly election as the party's Chief Ministerial candidate. On 22 May 2016, Bedi was appointed as the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBedi was born on 9 June 1949 in Amritsar, in a well-to-do Punjabi business family. She is the second child of Prakash Lal Peshawaria and Prem Lata (ne Janak Arora).[3] She has three sisters: Shashi, Reeta and Anu.[4] Her great-great grandfather Lala Hargobind had migrated from Peshawar to Amritsar, where he set up a business. Bedi's upbringing was not very religious, but she was brought up in both Hindu and Sikh traditions (her grandmother was a Sikh).[5] Prakash Lal helped with the family's textile business, and also played tennis. Bedi's grandfather Muni Lal controlled the family business, and gave an allowance to her father. He cut this allowance when Bedi's elder sister Shashi was enrolled in the Sacred Heart Convent School, Amritsar. Although the school was 16?km away from their home, Shashi's parents believed it offered better education than other schools. Muni Lal was opposed to his grandchild being educated in a Christian school. However, Prakash Lal declared financial independence, and went on to enroll all his daughters, including Kiran, in the same school.[6] Bedi started her formal studies in 1954, at the Sacred Heart Convent School in Amritsar. She participated in National Cadet Corps (NCC), among other extra-curricular activities. At that time, Sacred Heart did not offer science; instead, it had a subject called \\"household\\", which was aimed at grooming girls into good housewives. When she was in Class 9, Bedi joined Cambridge College, a private institute that offered science education and prepared her for matriculation exam. By the time her former schoolmates at Sacred Heart cleared Class 9, she cleared Class 10 (matriculation) exam.[7] Bedi graduated in 1968, with a BA (Honours) in English, from Government College for Women at Amritsar. The same year, she won the NCC Cadet Officer Award. In 1970, she obtained a master's degree in political science from Panjab University, Chandigarh.[8] From 1970 to 1972, Bedi taught as a lecturer at Khalsa College for Women in Amritsar. She taught courses related to political science. Later, during her career in the Indian Police Service, she also earned a law degree at Delhi University in 1988 and a Ph.D. from IIT Delhi's Department of Social Sciences in 1993.[4]\\r\\nInspired by her father, Bedi started playing tennis at the age of nine. As a teenage tennis player, she cut her hair short as they interfered with her game.[9] In 1964, she played her first tournament outside Amritsar, participating in the national junior lawn tennis championship at Delhi Gymkhana. She lost in early rounds, but won the trophy two years later, in 1966.[10] As the national champion, she was eligible for entry to the Wimbledon junior championship, but was not nominated by the Indian administration.[11]\\r\\nBetween 1965 and 1978, Bedi won several tennis championships, including:\\r\\nBedi was also a part of Indian team that beat Sri Lanka to win the Lionel Fonseka Memorial Trophy in Colombo.[17][18] She continued playing tennis until the age of thirty, when she started focusing on her Indian Police Service career. In 1972, she married fellow tennis player Raj Bedi; the two had met on Service Club courts in Amritsar.[19]\\r\\nAs a young woman, Bedi frequented the Service Club in Amritsar, where interaction with senior civil servants inspired her to take up a public service career. On 16 July 1972, Bedi started her police training at the National Academy of Administration in Mussoorie. She was the only woman in a batch of 80 men, and became the first woman IPS officer. After a 6-month foundation course, she underwent another 9 months of police training at Mount Abu in Rajasthan, and further training with Punjab Police in 1974. Based on a draw, she was allocated to the union territory cadre (now called AGMUT or Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram-Union Territories cadre).[20]\\r\\nBedi's first posting was to the Chanakyapuri subdivision of Delhi in 1975. The same year, she became the first woman to lead the all-male contingent of the Delhi Police at the Republic Day Parade in 1975.[3] Her daughter Sukriti (later Saina) was born in September 1975.[20]\\r\\nChanakyapuri was an affluent area that included the Parliament building, foreign embassies, and the residences of the Prime Minister and the President. The crimes in the area were mainly limited to minor thefts, but political demonstrations (which sometimes turned violent) were a regular occurrence. During the 1970s, there were many clashes between Nirankari and Akali Sikhs. On 15 November 1978, a group of Nirankaris held a congregation near India Gate. A contingent of 700ÿ800 Akalis organized a demonstration against them. DCP Bedi's platoon was deployed to stop the protesters and prevent violence. As the protesters resorted to brick-batting, Bedi charged them with a cane, although there was no tear gas squad to support her unit. One of the demonstrators ran towards her with a naked sword, but she charged him as well as other demonstrators with a cane. Ultimately, her unit was able to disperse the demonstrators. For this action, Bedi was awarded the President's Police Medal for Gallantry (1979), in October 1980.[21]\\r\\nIn 1979, Bedi was posted to Delhi's West District, where there were not enough officers to handle the high volume of criminal activity. To compensate, she started recruiting civilian volunteers. Each village in the district was night patrolled by six civilians led by an armed policeman. She enabled anonymous reporting of any knowledge about crimes. She clamped down on bootlegging and the illicit liquor business to reduce crimes in the area. Bedi implemented an open door policy, which encouraged citizens to interact with her. She implemented a \\"beat box\\" system: a complaint box was installed in each ward, and the beat constables were instructed to have their lunch near this box at a set time each day. She regularly asked people if they knew about the beat constable assigned to their area, and also walked with the constables to raise their self-esteem. Within 3 months, there was a reduction in crimes. There was a drop in cases related to \\"eve teasing\\" (sexual harassment of women) and wife beating. This gained her the goodwill of local women, who also volunteered their services to help fight crime in the area.[13]\\r\\nIn October 1981, Bedi was made DCP (Traffic). The preparation for the 1982 Asian Games had caused traffic snarls in the city. The construction of 19 sports stadiums and several flyovers had resulted in a number of blockades and diversions. Bedi encouraged coordination between the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking and Delhi Development Authority. She clamped down on errant motorists with a heavy hand. She replaced challans (traffic tickets) with spot fines. Her team towed improperly parked vehicles using six tow trucks (\\"cranes\\") for traffic control. This earned her the nickname \\"Crane Bedi\\". On 5 August 1982, an Ambassador car (DHI 1817) belonging to Prime Minister Office was towed away by sub-inspector Nirmal Singh, as it was wrongly parked outside the Yusufzai Market at Connaught Place. Singh was fully supported by Bedi and her superior Ashok Tandon.[6][22]\\r\\nTo raise funds for traffic guidance materials, Bedi presented Asian Games traffic management plan to a group of sponsors. The sponsors committed to providing road safety and other educational material worth ? 3,500,000. She also bought traffic police jeeps for her officers; for the first time, four wheelers were allocated to inspectors in the traffic unit. After the Asian Games were over, she was given Asian Jyoti award for excellence. She refused to accept the award for herself alone, and recommended that it be given to entire traffic unit.[23]\\r\\nBedi did not spare errant motorists from the rich and influential section of the society, which resulted in a powerful lobby against her. Her victims included the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation and her own sister-in-law.[24] After the Asian Games were over, she was transferred to Goa for 3 years. According to contemporary rumours, Indira Gandhi's aides R. K. Dhawan and Yashpal Kapoor, as well as her yoga instructor Dhirendra Brahmachari (whom Bedi had personally fined for a wrongly parked car), played a role in her transfer.[25] According to another theory, the loss of revenue resulting from her experiment of holding classes for traffic violators (instead of fining them) was a major factor in her transfer.[26]\\r\\nHer 7-year-old daughter suffered from nephritic syndrome since the age of 3, and was seriously ill at the time. Bedi requested the Home Ministry to not to transfer her out of Delhi until her daughter's condition became stable.[27] According to Bedi, she had put herself in a \\"very vulnerable situation\\", and the only people who could help her were the ones \\"who had been offended by my 'equal enforcement of law'\\".[13] Her request was not entertained, and she had to leave behind her daughter, who was too ill to accompany her.\\r\\nBedi arrived in Goa in March 1983, on a three-year assignment. A few months after her arrival, the Zuari Bridge was completed but not opened to public; the state government wanted Indira Gandhi to come from Delhi and inaugurate it formally. However, they were not able to secure confirmation from Indira Gandhi for several days. The public had to use ferries to transfer their vehicles across the Zuari River. One day, during a patrol, Bedi noticed that there was a huge mess at the ferry boarding point. She drove to the bridge, removed the blockades and diverted the traffic waiting at ferry to the bridge. This unofficial inauguration angered many politicians.[28] In November 1983, Goa hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meet (CHOGM). Bedi involved NCC cadets in Goa for traffic regulation along the VIP routes.[28]\\r\\nShortly after the CHOGM ended, her daughter's medical condition worsened. Bedi applied for leave, so that she could go to Delhi and take care of her daughter. Until this point, she had not taken privilege leave in her decade-long career, and her leaves had always lapsed.[29][24] Inspector General of Police (IGP) Rajendra Mohan recommended her leave application, but the leave was not officially sanctioned by the Goa government. Bedi left for Delhi anyway, since she had enough leaves in her account. Her daughter was hospitalized at AIIMS for one week. After her daughter was discharged from hospital, Bedi decided to stay in Delhi until her recovery. Bedi sent a personal letter to the IGP, as well as a detailed explanation to the Goa government, with medical reports and certificates. However, in a statement to United News of India (UNI), the Goa Chief Minister Pratapsingh Rane declared her absconding and absent without leave. After seeing Bedi's daughter's condition in Delhi, UNI published a rebuttal to the Chief Minister's statement. This made Goa government even more hostile to Bedi.[29]\\r\\nAfter being declared absent without sanctioned leave, Bedi was not given any assignment for six months. When her daughter's condition became stable, she met the Union Home Secretary T. N. Chaturvedi, who reinstated her. She was assigned to the Railway Protection Force in New Delhi, as a Deputy Commandant. Six months later, after appealing to a senior official in Prime Minister's Office, she was reassigned to the Department of Industrial Development, as a deputy director. There, she worked under the Directorate General of Industrial Contingency (DGIC), as a strike mediator between labor and management. Bedi left DGIC in October 1985, and shortly after her departure, the organization was wound up as part of an economy drive.[30]\\r\\nIn 1985, Police Commissioner Ved Marwah made a special request for Bedi to be assigned to the police headquarters. There, Bedi cleared several pending files and sanctioned 1,600 promotions in a single day to motivate the staff.[6]\\r\\nIn 1986, Bedi became DCP of Delhi's North District, where the primary problem was drug abuse. At that time, Delhi had only one centre for treatment of drug addicts ÿ Ashiana, which was run by the New Delhi Municipal Corporation. With help from her superiors, Bedi set up a detox center in one of the police premises. The center relied on community donations of furniture, blankets, medicines and other supplies. It also received voluntary services from doctors and yoga teachers. Within a year, five more detox centers were set up. Each center was intended to serve up to 30 patients, but at one time, each center catered to around 100 patients. The initiative was widely noticed, and Bedi travelled all over India, giving presentations and lectures on the programme. Before she was transferred to a new post, she and 15 other police officers institutionalized the detox centers as Navjyoti Police Foundation for Correction, De-addiction and Rehabilitation. Bedi served as the General Secretary of the Foundation.[31]\\r\\nIn the 1980s, Bedi attracted ire of Delhi politicians and lawyers. First, she ordered lathi charge on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) assembly in Red Fort area, and arrested its leaders. A few months later, she arrested Congress(I) MP J.P. Agarwal for violating curfew orders.[24]\\r\\nIn January 1988, the Delhi Police caught a man stealing from a girl's purse at St. Stephen's College. A few weeks later, he was arrested again for trespassing into a women's toilet and writing obscene graffiti inside.[32] One of Bedi's officers arrested and handcuffed the man. When he was produced in the court, he was recognized as Rajesh Agnihotri, a lawyer practicing at the Tis Hazari Courts Complex. The man had given a different name when he was arrested, and his lawyer colleagues claimed that he had been falsely framed.[6] The protesters also argued that lawyers must not be handcuffed even if there are proper grounds for their arrest. Bedi vociferously defended her officer's action.[24] The lawyers organized a strike and led a procession to DCP (North) office. Not finding DCP Bedi at the office, the lawyers manhandled Additional DCP Sandhu. This led to a scuffle between the cops and the lawyers. The lawyers escalated their strike, and several politicians supported the lawyers in demanding suspension of Bedi.[6]\\r\\nOn 21 January, the police lathi-charged the striking lawyers in Tis Hazari complex.[33] This further enraged the lawyers. On 17 February, a mob of an estimated 600ÿ1000 people led by the Congress corporator Rajesh Yadav arrived at Tis Hazari court. The mob was armed with brickbats, hockey sticks and small rods. It raised slogans in support of Bedi and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. It stoned the lawyers' chambers and smashed the windscreens of their cars. The police force deployed in the area did not try to stop the mob violence, although some individual policemen tried to control the mob. Bedi denied any connivance in the incident.[34][35] The police later arrested Rajesh Yadav, and charged him with rioting and conspiracy. The Congress distanced itself from Yadav and ousted him.[35]\\r\\nFor the next two months, the lawyers stopped courts from functioning in Delhi and neighbouring states, demanding Bedi's resignation. The strike was called off after the Delhi High Court constituted a two-judge committee to investigate the matter. Known as Wadhwa Commission, the committee consisted of Justice DP Wadhwa and Justice NN Goswamy. KK Venugopal, the lawyers' counsel, produced evidence that on 17 February, all police stations in the zone knew that a 2000-strong mob was heading towards Tis Hazari Courts Complex, where the lawyers were on a hunger strike. Despite this, no police force was deputed to protect them. In its interim report, the Commission expressed concern over police lapses. The judges said that they wanted to investigate the matter further, and recommended transfer of five police officers (including Bedi) out of North Delhi, during the investigation period. Even before the report was made public, in April 1988, the Union Government transferred Bedi to the post of Deputy Director (Operations) in the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), also in Delhi. Two days later, the four other officers mentioned in the report were also transferred.[34][36]\\r\\nThe members of the Delhi Bar Association were not satisfied with Bedi's transfer, and wanted her suspended. However, the Police Commissioner Ved Marwah refused to suspend Bedi.[34] The Commission's final report, released in April 1990, censured all the parties.[6] The report stated that the arrest of Rajesh Agnihotri was justified, but his handcuffing was illegal. It also concluded that an \\"indiscriminate and unjustified\\" lathi-charge on the lawyers was ordered by Bedi, and that she had connived with the municipal councillor to organize the mob attack on the lawyers.[37] The scholarly legal commentary was divided, with some supporting Bedi, citing her \\"unblemished\\" service record.[32]\\r\\nAfter Bedi was censured by the Wadhwa Commission, it was decided to transfer her out of Delhi. She wanted a challenging posting in either Andamans, Arunachal Pradesh or Mizoram. She hoped that this would lead to her reassignment to Delhi Police after a few years (after \\"hard\\" postings, government servants are unofficially entitled to a post they desire). She requested Joint Secretary (Union Territories) to transfer her to Mizoram, a remote border state in North-East India. When she didn't get any firm response, she wrote to the home secretary Naresh Kumar. Along with Bedi's batchmate Parminder Singh, Naresh Kumar convinced the Joint Secretary to transfer her to Mizoram. They pointed out that officers who were given Mizoram posting refused to go there, while Bedi was volunteering to go there. Bedi reported to the Mizoram Government in Aizawl on 27 April 1990. Her designation was Deputy Inspector General (Range). Her parents and her daughter also moved to Mizoram.[38]\\r\\nConsumption of alcohol, especially home-brewed rice liquor Zu, was very common in Mizoram. Several of Bedi's officers were alcoholics. At first, she didn't stop them since Zu was a part of Mizo culture, and she didn't want to be seen as someone who interfered with the local culture. Later, she opened an indoor de-addiction facility for alcoholic policemen. The major crime in the district was heroin smuggling across the Burmese border. A number of teenagers were drug addicts, with proxyvon and heroin being the most common drugs. Most of the repeat criminal offenders were alcoholic. Since Mizoram was a Christian-majority state, Bedi utilized Christian prayers to reduce drug and alcohol-induced criminal behavior. She declared Saturdays \\"prayer and rehabilitation day\\" at district police stations, despite protests from the Superintendent of Police, who was an atheist. Every Saturday, past criminals would be brought to the police station to pray and learn and to receive treatment for alcoholism.[39]\\r\\nWhile in Mizoram, she completed a major part of her Ph.D. research. (Later, in September 1993, she was awarded a doctorate by IIT Delhi's Department of Social Sciences, for her thesis on Drug Abuse and Domestic Violence.)[40] During her stay in Mizoram, she also started writing her autobiography.\\r\\nIn September 1992, her daughter Sukriti applied for a seat in Lady Hardinge Medical College (Delhi), under a quota for Mizoram residents. Students of Mizoram launched a violent agitation against the allocation, on the grounds that she was a non-Mizo. Sukriti had topped the merit list with 89% marks, and was given seat from the Central pool, according to the government guidelines. Mizoram's Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla asked her to surrender the seat in \\"the larger interests of the state\\", although he accepted that \\"there was nothing illegal in her daughter getting the seat\\". Bedi refused to surrender the seat, saying that her daughter deserved the seat.[41]\\r\\nAs the protests turned violent, Bedi received threats that her house would be set on fire. Her superiors told her that they could no longer protect her.[42] She left Aizawl after submitting her leave application. Her parents and daughter had already left for Delhi by this time. Lal Thanhawla accused her of insubordination.[41]\\r\\nAfter leaving her Mizoram assignment incomplete in September 1992, Bedi had to wait eight months for a new posting. In May 1993, she was posted to the Delhi Prisons as inspector general (IG). The Tihar Jail of Delhi was built as a four-jail complex with a capacity of 2,500 prisoners. However, by the time Bedi became its in-charge, its prisoner population varied from 8,000 to 9,500. About 90% of its inmates were undertrials, who had been accused of non-bailable offences. Some of them had been waiting for years to get a trial in a badly clogged court system. The prison had a budget of ? 15 crore, which was just enough to pay for basic expenditure, leaving little for welfare programmes. Tihar was notorious as a violent and unmanageable place, and no officer wanted to be posted there. The post had been lying vacant for nine months, before Bedi was posted there.[43]\\r\\nBedi decided to turn Tihar into a model prison. She introduced several reforms. She arranged separate barracks for the hardened criminals, who had been using their time in prison to recruit gang members, sell contraband and extort money. These prisoners unsuccessfully challenged Bedi in court for unfairly segregating them.[13]\\r\\nFor other prisoners, Bedi arranged vocational training with certificates, so that they could find a job after their release. During her tenure, Indira Gandhi National Open University and National Open School set up their centers inside the prison.[3] Legal cells were set up to help the undertrials.[43] Bedi banned smoking in the prison. The move faced a lot of resistance from the staff as well as the prisoners. She introduced yoga and Vipassana meditation classes to change the prisoners' attitudes. She organized additional activities such as sports, prayer, and festival celebrations. She also established a de-addiction center, and pulled up or imprisoned the staff members involved in drug supply.[6] A bank was also opened inside the prison.[3] A bakery and small manufacturing units, including carpentry and weaving units, were set up in the jail. The profits from the products sold were put into the prisoners' welfare fund.[6]\\r\\nBedi went on daily prison tours, observing the staff, listening to prisoners'complaints, inspecting food quality and evaluating overall management. She developed a panchayat system, where prisoners who were respected for their age, education, or character represented other inmates and met every evening with senior officers to sort out problems. She also established petition boxes so that prisoners could write to the IG about any issue. While the jail had suggestion boxes earlier too, the jail staff would destroy the complaints received through these boxes. On the other hand, the prisoners writing to Bedi received acknowledgment and information about the status of their petition.[6]\\r\\nIn this prison reform programme, Bedi involved outsiders ÿ including NGOs, schools, civilians and former inmates.[43] As a result of Bedi's reforms, there was a drop in the fights and disturbances in the jail.[6] Even the hardened criminals, who had been isolated in separate barracks, started behaving well. Bedi then arranged for them to attend education and meditation courses.[13]\\r\\nIn May 1994, Bedi organized a 'health day', during which around 400 doctors and paramedics were invited to attend to Tihar's patients. Based on visits to two of Tihar's adolescent wards, a cardiologist associated with the Delhi Government's AIDS Control Programme, claimed that two-thirds of the inmates had acknowledged engaging in homosexual acts. He recommended distribution of condoms in the prison, a move supported by Delhi's Health Minister Harsh Vardhan and National AIDS Control Organisation. However, Kiran Bedi opposed the move pointing out that there were no HIV+ prisoners in Tihar. She stated that the distribution of condoms would encourage homosexual activity (illegal as per Section 377) among criminals. Based on a survey conducted through petition boxes, she claimed that incidence of consensual homosexual activity was negligible, and that the doctor's claim had hurt her prisoners. In response, the activist group ABVA filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court demanding distribution of condoms in Tihar. Bedi termed the move as an attempt to force \\"western solutions\\" on \\"Tihar Ashram\\", and filed a counter affidavit opposing the demand.[44][45]\\r\\nBedi's reform programme at Tihar received worldwide acclaim. But it also attracted envy from her superiors, who accused her of diluting prison security for personal glory. She was not on good terms with her immediate supervisor in the government, the Minister for Prisons Harsharan Singh Balli. Many members of Balli's party, the BJP, had not forgiven Bedi for her lathi charge on the party's assembly in the 1980s. However, until March 1995, Bedi was on good terms with BJP's Delhi Chief Minister Madan Lal Khurana. Khurana was a prisoner in Tihar during the Emergency, and appreciated her work for prisoners.[46]\\r\\nIn 1994, Bedi was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award and the Nehru Fellowship. The Magsaysay Foundation recognized her leadership and innovations in crime control, drug rehabilitation, and humane prison reform. The US President Bill Clinton invited her to National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C.. When the Delhi Government refused to let her accept the invitation, Bedi lobbied with the Union Home Ministry to get the clearance. However, the Home Minister S.B. Chavan declined the permission. Clinton repeated the invitation in 1995, and this time, Bedi approached the media. The New York Times published a report stating that \\"several politicians and her superiors were feeling cut up with her assertive style and the success that followed her\\". Under pressure from the public and the media, Chavan allowed Bedi to attend the Breakfast. However, this episode won her several detractors in the government.[46][47]\\r\\nSometime later, Bedi was invited by the United Nations to discuss social reintegration of prisoners at the Copenhagen Social Summit. When the Delhi Government refused to permit her, Bedi met the Minister of State for Home Rajesh Pilot on 4 March 1995. The meeting got extended, because of which Bedi had to cancel an appointment she had with the Chief Minister Khurana. Pilot gave her the permission, but this irked Khurana, who later exclaimed \\"If she thinks we have no importance, then why does she want to work for the Delhi Government?\\"[46] While Bedi was in Copenhagen, the prominent farmers' leader Mahendra Singh Tikait was imprisoned in Tihar after a rally, and sought the BJP leaders' help in getting a hookah inside. However, the jail authorities refused to give permission for a hookah, since Bedi had earlier declared Tihar a no-smoking zone.[46]\\r\\nSubsequently, Delhi's Lieutenant Governor P.K. Dave wrote a letter to the Union Home Secretary K. Padmanabhiah, accusing Bedi of \\"manipulating foreign trips\\", and leveled other charges against her. Dave accused Bedi of \\"compromising\\" the prison's security by allowing visitors ÿ including American officials and foreign TV crews ÿ inside the jail, without the Delhi government's permission. Another charge was that she had allowed NHRC representatives to meet TADA detainees from Kashmir, who had raised anti-national slogans. In her defence, Bedi argued that the TADA detainees had gone on a relay hunger strike demanding speedy trials. She also stated that the foreign TV crews had only shot the Vipassana meditation classes, and that she had the right to admit them under the rules. She also pointed out that the Union Government had itself asked her to allow the Americans ÿ Lee P. Brown and Christine Wisner (wife of Frank G. Wisner) ÿ inside the prison.[46]\\r\\nAnother charge against Bedi was giving undue favours to the notorious criminal Charles Sobhraj. At that time, the Delhi Jail Manual (written in 1894 and modified in 1988) listed a number of prohibited articles, one of which was a typewriter. However, the manual also gave the jail superintendent the power to allow any of these prohibited items in special cases. Using this power, Bedi permitted Sobhraj the use of an electronic typewriter (Sobhraj had already been given a manual typewriter before Bedi became the officer in-charge). Bedi had also allowed NGOs to start typing classes for prisoners, but Sobhraj claimed that he was using the typewriter to write her biography, which gave the authorities a reason to accuse Bedi of misusing her powers. Khurana also alleged that Sobhraj had been supplied with a pipe and foreign-made cigars, a charge refuted by the testimony of Sobhraj's former cell-mate. The prison manual also had an antiquated rule which stated that \\"caught escapees will wear a red cap\\". Sobhraj had escaped in 1986, before he was recaptured. Khurana alleged that Bedi had specially exempted him from wearing a red cap. However, a senior jail officer stated that he had never seen the 'red cap' rule being implemented in Tihar.[47][48] PK Dave and Madan Lal Khurana got Bedi removed as the prisons in-charge on 3 May 1995.[46] When her transfer was announced, the Tihar inmates went on a hunger strike to protest it, while some of the warders celebrated it by distributing sweets.[49] Bedi accused \\"unethical politicians\\" of \\"telling lies, making false allegations and misinforming people\\". She alleged that her supervisors in the government had no \\"interest, vision or leadership\\". She argued that she should not have been transferred on the basis of unverified charges, and demanded an inquiry committee. Rajesh Pilot defended her publicly, but the Union Government did not officially support her. Khushwant Singh described her transfer as \\"a victory for a handful of small-minded, envious people over a gutsy woman\\".[46]\\r\\nAfter her removal from Tihar, Bedi was posted as head of training at the police academy on 4 May 1995.[47] Her designation was Additional Commissioner (policy and planning).[46] She served as the Joint Commissioner of Police of Delhi Police. Later, she served as the Special Commissioner (Intelligence) of Delhi Police.\\r\\nOn 5 April 1999, she was appointed as Inspector-General of Police in Chandigarh. Her mother accompanied her, but soon suffered a stroke and went into coma. Bedi requested a transfer back to Delhi, where her family would be able to take care of her mother. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs transferred her back to Delhi on 15 May. However, her mother died in Delhi three days later, after having been in coma for 41 days.[50]\\r\\nIn 2003, Bedi became the first woman to be appointed the United Nations civilian police adviser. She worked in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.[51] In 2005, she returned to Delhi after her UN stint. The Delhi Bar Association lobbied to ensure that she didn't get a post that would put her on track to become Delhi's police chief. The lawyers, who had still not forgiven Bedi for the 1988 controversy, wrote to government authorities arguing that Bedi's appointment to a top most might \\"unnecessarily create a conflict between the legal fraternity and the police\\".[52] She was made the Director General, Home Guards. Before her retirement, she was serving as the Director General of the Bureau of Police Research and Development.\\r\\nIn 2007, Bedi applied for the post of Delhi Police Commissioner. She was overlooked in favour of Yudhvir Singh Dadwal, who was junior to her, reportedly because the senior bureaucrats saw her as too \\"outspoken and radical\\". Bedi alleged bias, and stated that her merit had been overlooked.[53] She also proceeded for a three-month 'protest leave', but canceled it later.[54] Journalists like Karan Thapar and Pankaj Vohra criticized her for crying bias, and stated that her service record was tainted with controversies like incomplete Goa, Mizoram and Chandigarh assignments; the lawyers' strike controversy; and the removal from Tihar.[55][56]\\r\\nBedi resigned from police service in November 2007, citing personal reasons. She stated that she wanted to focus on academic and social work.[57]\\r\\nThe Navjyoti Delhi Police Foundation founded by Bedi and her colleagues was renamed to Navjyoti India Foundation in 2007. Since its establishment, the Foundation received strong support from the local communities, as well several Indian and foreign charitable trusts and government bodies. Over next 25 years, it provided residential treatment to nearly 20,000 drug and alcohol addicts. It also started crime prevention programmes such as education of street children and slum kids. It established 200 single-teacher schools, vocational training centers, health care facilities and counselling centers for the vulnerable sections of society. In 2010, it also established the Navjyoti Community College, affiliated to IGNOU.[31]\\r\\nBedi set up India Vision Foundation (IVF) in 1994. IVF works in fields of police reforms, prison reforms, women empowerment and rural and community development.[58] In police reform area, Bedi emphasized better training, while opposing hazing of trainees. She opposed frequent transfers, stating that these lead to poor cadre management. She also proposed creation of a new level of police administration, which would protect rank-and-file officers from politicians and bureaucrats. In women's rights area, she has advocated equitable educational opportunities and property ownership (including co-ownership) for women. She has emphasized faster empowerment of rural women.[13]\\r\\nShe is a social commentator and trainer and frequently speaks on various social issues like education, domestic violence & others. During 2008ÿ11, Bedi hosted the reality TV show Aap Ki Kachehri on STAR Plus. In this court show, Bedi resolved everyday conflicts in a simulated courtroom.[59] In 2008, she launched the website http://www.saferindia.com/kiranbedi/ to help people whose complaints are not accepted by the local police.[60] In 2010, she was invited as Speaker in Washington by TEDx.[61]\\r\\nIn October 2010, Arvind Kejriwal invited Bedi to join him in exposing the CWG scam. Bedi accepted the invitation, and by 2011, the two had allied with other activists, including Anna Hazare, to form India Against Corruption (IAC) group. Their campaign evolved into the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement.[62] Anna Hazare planned an indefinite hunger strike to demand the passage of a stronger Jan Lokpal Bill in the Indian Parliament. On 16 August 2011, Bedi and other key members of IAC were detained by the police, four hours before the hunger strike could start.[63] Bedi and other activists were released later on the same day.[64] After twelve days of protests and many discussions between the government and the activists, the Parliament passed a resolution to consider three points in drafting of Lokpal bill.[65]\\r\\nSome members of parliament proposed to bring a breach of privilege motion against Bedi and other activists for allegedly mocking the parliamentarians during the Lokpal bill protests,[66] however they withdrew these notices later.[67]\\r\\nDuring the anti-corruption movement, Bedi faced controversy when some newspapers questioned discrepancies in her past travel expenses between 2006 and 2011. In 2009, for example, Bedi was invited as the keynote speaker at a conference arranged by Aviation Industry Employees Guild. She accepted the invitation without a speaking fee, but her NGO was to be reimbursed for travel expenses. Bedi's travel agent Flywell, invoiced her hosts business class fare for air tickets, but arranged Bedi to travel in economy class.[68] Between 2006 and 2011, there were several discrepancies in travel-related expense statements, as well as instances where she travelled at no cost to her hosts for a cause. In these cases, Bedi stated she did not personally receive or incur the disputed difference, only India Vision Foundation did, an NGO she headed.[69][70] In November 2011, the Delhi Police, under directions of the additional chief metropolitan magistrate, registered an FIR ÿ police case for cognizable offense ÿ against Bedi for allegedly misappropriating funds through Indian Vision Foundation and other NGOs.[71][72] The investigation that followed found no evidence of fraud against her or of siphoning of NGO funds for personal use, and subsequently filed closure of the case.[73]\\r\\nBedi split from IAC after a faction led by Arvind Kejriwal formed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in 2012.[74] AAP went on to form a short-lived minority government in Delhi with Kejriwal as Chief Minister (CM). During the 2014 Indian general election, Bedi publicly supported Narendra Modi, the prime ministerial candidate of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).[75] Kejriwal, on the other hand, contested the election against Modi. After Modi won and became the Prime Minister of India, Bedi stated that she was ready to be BJP's CM candidate in Delhi, if such an offer was made to her.[76] Eight months after Modi's election, she joined BJP in 2015. She was BJP's Chief Minister (CM) candidate for the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, in which Arvind Kejriwal was AAP's CM candidate.[77] She lost the election from Krishna Nagar constituency to AAP candidate SK Bagga by a margin of 2277 votes, and AAP came to power again with an absolute majority after one year.[78]\\r\\nOn 22 May 2016, Bedi was appointed as the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry.[79]\\r\\nBedi has authored the following works:\\r\\nKiran Bedi along with three of her sisters were born to the family of Prakash Lal Peshawaria and Prem Lata Peshawaria. She met her future husband Brij Bedi on tennis courts of Amritsar. Brij, who was nine years older than her, played university-level tennis at the time. On 9 March 1972, the two married at a simple ceremony at the local Shivalaya temple.[20] The two have lived separately for most of their married life.[80][81] The couple had a daughter in 1975; originally named Sukriti, she later changed her name to Saina.[82] Bedi's elder sister Shashi had a bitter experience with an arranged marriage, which affected her deeply.[13] She ended her first serious relationship because her partner wanted a dowry and a domestic role for her.\\r\\nIn 2005, CUNY School of Law awarded her an honorary Doctor of Law degree in recognition of her \\"humanitarian approach to prison reforms and policing\\".[92]\\r\\nThe Navjyoti Delhi Police Foundation received the 1999 Serge Sotiroff Memorial Award for outstanding contributions to international drug control efforts.[93]\\r\\nThe following films, documentaries and TV programmes are based on Bedi's life:\\r\\nBiographies of Bedi include:","input":"Who became india's first woman ips officer?"},{"output":"Jason Donovan","context":"Phillip Bryan Schofield (born 1 April 1962) is an English television presenter currently employed by ITV.

The show was commissioned for a full series which was aired throughout 2014.[10][11] The show was commissioned for a seven part second series, filming began in April 2016 and the series will air in summer 2016 with the first episode titled \\"The Queen's 90th Birthday\\".\\r\\nIn December 2014, he undertook a live 24-hour TV marathon to raise money for Text Santa,[12][13] where, as well as appearing on This Morning, he appeared on various other programmes throughout the day, including being a guest panellist on Loose Women.\\r\\nHe presented two series of the primetime game show You're Back in the Room for ITV in 2015 and 2016.[14]\\r\\nIn 2016, he travelled to South Africa with his wife, as part of a series of short clips for This Morning. Following this, ITV aired a 3x30 minute episodes in a primetime slot, called Schofield's South African Adventure. Since March 2017, he has presented 5 Gold Rings, a new game show format for ITV.[15][16] In 2017, Schofield presented three-part factual series How To Spend It Well at Christmas with Phillip Schofield in which he tested the latest must-have festive gifts.[17]\\r\\nWhile working as presenter of Going Live!, Schofield was also broadcasting on BBC Radio 1 with a Sunday show (also called Going Live). When Radio 1 made the switch from medium wave to full use of FM stereo in 1988, Schofield was one of the presenters chosen to help with the launch. During his 2005 appearance on Room 101, Schofield recalled how a large crowd gathered in expectation of Simon Mayo arriving by helicopter, having turned on the Tacolneston transmitter. Due to a miscommunication, and the crowd being disappointed by Mayo's failure to appear, Schofield and an unnamed producer fled without revealing the news, and left the crowd?ÿ which included the town's mayor?ÿ still watching the sky. For this reason, and as a result of a later incident involving wing walking on an aeroplane leaving Southend Airport, Schofield chose Southend as one of his pet hates for the programme.\\r\\nIn February 2010, Schofield launched Radio Plymouth in Devon.[18]\\r\\nSchofield tried his hand at theatre and took over the role of Joseph in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat from Jason Donovan on the West End stage in 1991. The second musical he performed in was the title role of Doctor Dolittle at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, before touring the UK. In March 2018, Schofield reprised his role as Joseph for an episode of Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway.\\r\\nWhile appearing in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Schofield was approached to record a cover of \\"Close Every Door\\" to be released as a single.[19] The single was released in December 1992 on Polydor Records and peaked at number 27 on the UK Singles Chart.[20]\\r\\nIn 2013, Schofield began writing for the Waitrose Weekend newspaper, and has been the face of wine in their UK stores ever since.[21]\\r\\nSchofield also has a separate Twitter account about wine called @SchofeOnWine.\\r\\nFollowing his creation of an account with photo messaging service Snapchat in late 2016, Schofield found himself the subject of a series of memes due to his unique use of the application. Shared on Facebook, the memes reached peak popularity in mid-2017.[22] His vivacious facial expressions gained him a cult following and inspired the post-modern multimedia cultural movement informally known as Schofwave.[2]\\r\\nSchofield collects Bordeaux wines, an interest kindled by friend Jason Donovan. Asked in 1992 to introduce a compilation video for Donovan, Schofield refused to accept payment. Stock, Aitken and Waterman sent him two cases of Burgundy with a set of tasting notes; he joined the Wine Society two years later.[23]\\r\\nSchofield has dual British and New Zealand citizenship.[24]\\r\\nSchofield is a patron of the charity CHASE hospice care for children, which offers help and support to families of children who are not expected to reach their 19th birthday. In conjunction with rose specialist C&K Jones, he launched the Schofield rose in support of CHASE at Gardeners' World June 2006. Each rose sold attracts a donation to CHASE. Schofield is also an ambassador for children's charity Kidscape and age-positive charity Royal Voluntary Service, previously known as WRVS[25]\\r\\nOn 8 October 2012, Schofield became an Honorary Patron of the Blue Lamp Foundation, a UK based charity which raises money to support emergency services personnel who have been injured in the course of duty.[26]\\r\\nSchofield was a supporter of the Text Santa appeal and co-presented their annual telethon each December alongside Christine Lampard and Holly Willoughby on ITV. In December 2014, Schofield presented Phillip's Live 24 Hour TV Marathon for Text Santa, which saw him present a live show for 24 hours on ITV3.[27] He also made appearances on shows including Good Morning Britain and Loose Women. Schofield also abseiled down the side of The London Studios and climbed to the top of The Shard, both in aid of Text Santa in 2014.[28][29]\\r\\nOn 8 November 2012, Schofield interviewed the then prime minister David Cameron on This Morning, and presented him with a list he had obtained from the internet of five people named as paedophiles in connection with the North Wales child abuse scandal (\\"Prime Minister, here's a list I found on the internet\\"). The names of several former senior Conservative politicians were said to be visible on the list. Cameron responded by warning against a witchhunt \\"particularly about people who are gay\\". Schofield was widely criticised for this action,[30] with broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby describing his behaviour as 'cretinous'.[31]\\r\\nSchofield later apologised (via fellow presenter Ruth Langsford, blaming a misjudged camera angle).[32] Schofield and ITV later paid S125,000 compensation to Lord McAlpine.[33]\\r\\n2003\\r\\n2004\\r\\n2009\\r\\n2010\\r\\n2011\\r\\n2012\\r\\n2013\\r\\n2014\\r\\n2015\\r\\n2016\\r\\n2017\\r\\n2018","input":"Who played joseph first phillip schofield or jason donovan?"},{"output":"less than 135 mmol/L (135 mEq/L)","context":"Hyponatremia is a low sodium level in the blood.[3] It is generally defined as a sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L (135 mEq/L), with severe hyponatremia being below 120 mEql/L.[2][7] Symptoms can be absent, mild or severe.[1][8] Mild symptoms include a decreased ability to think, headaches, nausea, and poor balance.[2] Severe symptoms include confusion, seizures, and coma.[1][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe causes of hyponatremia are typically classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume.[3] Low volume hyponatremia can occur from diarrhea, vomiting, diuretics, and sweating.[3] Normal volume hyponatremia is divided into cases with dilute urine and concentrated urine.[3] Cases in which the urine is dilute include adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and drinking too much water or too much beer.[3] Cases in which the urine is concentrated include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).[3] High volume hyponatremia can occur from heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure.[3] Conditions that can lead to falsely low sodium measurements include high blood protein levels such as in multiple myeloma, high blood fat levels, and high blood sugar.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment is based on the underlying cause.[3] Correcting hyponatremia too quickly can lead to complications.[4] Rapid partial correction with 3% normal saline is only recommended in those with significant symptoms and occasionally those in whom the condition was of rapid onset.[3][5] Low volume hyponatremia is typically treated with intravenous normal saline.[3] SIADH is typically treated with fluid restriction while high volume hyponatremia is typically treated with both fluid restriction and a diet low in salt.[3] Correction should generally be gradual in those in whom the low levels have been present for more than two days.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nHyponatremia occurs in about 20% of those admitted to hospital and 10% of people during or after an endurance sporting event.[2][4] Among those in hospital, hyponatremia is associated with an increased risk of death.[4] The economic costs of hyponatremia are estimated at $2.6 billion in the United States.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSigns and symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea and vomiting, headache, short-term memory loss, confusion, lethargy, fatigue, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, spasms or cramps, seizures, and decreased consciousness or coma.[10] The presence and severity of signs and symptoms are related to the level of salt in the blood, with lower levels of plasma sodium associated with more severe symptoms. However, emerging data suggest that mild hyponatremia (plasma sodium levels at 131ÿ135?mmol/L) is associated with numerous complications or subtle, presently unrecognized symptoms[11] (for example, increased falls, altered posture and gait, reduced attention).[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nNeurological symptoms typically occur with very low levels of plasma sodium (usually <115?mmol/L).[10] When sodium levels in the blood become very low, water enters the brain cells and causes them to swell. This results in increased pressure in the skull and causes hyponatremic encephalopathy. As pressure increases in the skull, herniation of the brain can occur, which is a squeezing of the brain across the internal structures of the skull. This can lead to headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, seizures, brain stem compression and respiratory arrest, and non-cardiogenic accumulation of fluid in the lungs.[13] This is usually fatal if not immediately treated.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptom severity depends on how fast and how severe the drop in blood salt level. A gradual drop, even to very low levels, may be tolerated well if it occurs over several days or weeks, because of neuronal adaptation. The presence of underlying neurological disease such as a seizure disorder or non-neurological metabolic abnormalities, also affects the severity of neurologic symptoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic hyponatremia can lead to such complications as neurological impairments. These neurological impairments most often affect gait (walking) and attention, and can lead to increased reaction time and falls.[citation needed] Hyponatremia, by interfering with bone metabolism, has been linked with a doubled risk of osteoporosis and an increased risk of bone fracture.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe specific causes of hyponatremia are generally divided into those with low tonicity (lower than normal concentration of solutes), without low tonicity, and falsely low sodiums.[15] Those with low tonicity are then grouped by whether the person has high fluid volume, normal fluid volume, or low fluid volume.[15] Too little sodium in the diet alone is very rarely the cause of hyponatremia.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth sodium and water content increase: Increase in sodium content leads to hypervolemia and water content to hyponatremia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is volume expansion in the body, no edema, but hyponatremia occurs[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypovolemia (extracellular volume loss) is due to total body sodium loss.  The hyponatremia is caused by a relatively smaller loss in total body water.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nMiscellaneous causes that are not included under the above classification scheme include the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe causes of and treatments for hyponatremia can only be understood by having a grasp of the size of the body fluid compartments and subcompartments and their regulation; how under normal circumstances the body is able to maintain the sodium concentration within a narrow range (homeostasis of body fluid osmolality); conditions can cause that feedback system to malfunction (pathophysiology); and the consequences of the malfunction of that system on the size and solute concentration of the fluid compartments.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a hypothalamic-renal feedback system which normally maintains the concentration of the serum sodium within a narrow range. This system operates as follows: in some of the cells of the hypothalamus, there are osmoreceptors which respond to an elevated serum sodium in body fluids by signalling the posterior pituitary gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone (ADH), (also called vasopressin).[23] ADH then enters the bloodstream and signals the kidney to bring back sufficient solute-free water from the fluid in the kidney tubules to dilute the serum sodium back to normal, and this turns off the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. Also, thirst is stimulated.[24] Normally, when mild hyponatremia begins to occur, that is, the serum sodium begins to fall below 135 mEq/L, there is no secretion of ADH, and the kidney stops returning water to the body from the renal tubule. Also, no thirst is experienced. These two act in concert to raise the serum sodium to the normal range.[25][26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nHyponatremia occurs 1) when the hypothalamic-renal feedback loop is overwhelmed by increased fluid intake, 2) the feedback loop malfunctions such that ADH is always \\"turned on\\"; 3) the receptors in the kidney are always \\"open\\" regardless of there being no signal from ADH to be open; or 4) there is an increased ADH even though there is no normal stimulus (elevated serum sodium) for ADH to be increased.\\r\\n\\r\\nHyponatremia occurs in one of two ways: either the osmoreceptor-aquaporin feedback loop is overwhelmed, or it is interrupted. If it is interrupted, it is either related or not related to ADH.[26] If the feedback system is overwhelmed, this is water intoxication with maximally dilute urine and is caused by 1) pathological water drinking (\\"psychotic polydipsia\\"), 2) beer potomania, 3) overzealous intravenous solute free water infusion, or 4) infantile water intoxication. \\"Impairment of urine diluting ability related to ADH\\" occurs in nine situations: 1) arterial volume depletion 2) hemodynamically-mediated, 3) congestive heart failure, 4) cirrhosis, 5) nephrosis, 6) spinal cord disease, 7) Addison's disease, 8) cerebral salt wasting, and 9) syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). \\r\\nIf the feed-back system is normal, but an impairment of urine diluting ability unrelated to ADH occurs, this is 1) oliguric renal failure, 2) tubular interstitial renal disease, 3) diuretics, or 4) nephrogenic syndrome of antidiuresis.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nSodium is the primary positively charged ion outside of the cell and cannot cross from the interstitial space into the cell. This is because charged sodium ions attract around them up to 25 water molecules, thereby creating a large polar structure too large to pass through the cell membrane: \\"channels\\" or \\"pumps\\" are required.\\r\\nCell swelling also produces activation of volume-regulated anion channels which is related to the release of taurine and glutamate from astrocytes.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history, physical exam, and laboratory testing are required to determine the underlying cause of hyponatremia. A blood test demonstrating a serum sodium less than 135?mmol/L is diagnostic for hyponatremia.[29] The history and physical exam are necessary to help determine if the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic, which has important implications in determining the underlying cause. An assessment is also made to determine if the patient is experiencing symptoms from their hyponatremia. These include assessments of alertness, concentration, and orientation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFalse hyponatremia, also known as spurious, pseudo, hypertonic, or artifactual hyponatremia is when the lab tests read low sodium levels but there is no hypotonicity. In hypertonic hyponatremia, resorption of water by molecules such as glucose (hyperglycemia or diabetes) or mannitol (hypertonic infusion) occurs. In isotonic hyponatremia a measurement error due to high blood triglyceride level (most common) or paraproteinemia occurs. It occurs when using techniques that measure the amount of sodium in a specified volume of serum/plasma, or that dilute the sample before analysis.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue hyponatremia, also known as hypotonic hyponatremia, is the most common type. It is often simply referred to as \\"hyponatremia.\\"  Hypotonic hyponatremia is categorized in 3 ways based on the person's blood volume status. Each category represents a different underlying reason for the increase in ADH that led to the water retention and thence hyponatremia:\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic hyponatremia is when sodium levels drop gradually over several days or weeks and symptoms and complications are typically moderate. Chronic hyponatremia is often called asymptomatic hyponatremia in clinical settings because it is thought to have no symptoms; however, emerging data suggests that \\"asymptomatic\\" hyponatremia is not actually asymptomatic.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAcute hyponatremia is when sodium levels drop rapidly, resulting in potentially dangerous effects, such as rapid brain swelling, which can result in coma and death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe treatment of hyponatremia depends on  the underlying cause.[15] How quickly treatment is required depends on a persons symptoms.[15] Fluids is typically the cornerstone of initial management.[15] In those with severe disease an increase in sodium of about 5?mmol/L over one to four hours is recommended.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSodium deficit = (140 ÿ serum sodium) x total body water[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal body water = kilograms of body weight x 0.6 ?\\r\\n\\r\\nOptions include:[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican and European guidelines come to different conclusions regarding the use of medications.[32] In the United States they are recommended in those with SIADH, cirrhosis, or heart failure who fail limiting fluid intact.[32] In Europe they are not generally recommended.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is tentative evidence that vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans), such as conivaptan, may be slightly more effective than fluid restriction in those with high volume or normal volume hyponatremia.[3] They should not be used in people with low volume.[15] Their use in SIADH is unclear.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nDemeclocycline, while sometimes used for SIADH, has significant side effects including potential kidney problems and sun sensitivity.[33][15] In many people it has no benefit while in others it can result in overcorrection and high blood sodium levels.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nDaily use of urea by mouth, while not commonly used due to the taste, has tentative evidence in SIADH.[33][15] It, however, is not available in many areas of the world.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nRaising the serum sodium concentration too rapidly may cause central pontine myelinolysis.[34] Avoid correction that leads to a serum sodium rise of more than 12?mEq/L/day.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nHyponatremia is the most commonly seen waterÿelectrolyte imbalance.[15] The disorder is more frequent in females, the elderly, and in people who are hospitalized. The incidence of hyponatremia depends largely on the patient population. A hospital incidence of 15ÿ20% is common, while only 3ÿ5% of people who are hospitalized have a serum sodium level (salt blood level) of less than 130?mmol/L. Hyponatremia has been reported in up to 30% of elderly patients in nursing homes and is also present in approximately 30% of depressed patients on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople who have hyponatremia who require hospitalisation have a longer length of stay (with associated increased costs) and also have a higher likelihood of requiring readmission. This is particularly the case in men and in the elderly.[36]","input":"What is considered a dangerously low sodium level?"},{"output":"Midwestern United States","context":"","input":"What region of the country is missouri in?"},{"output":"skeletal or striated muscle","context":"Muscle tissue is a soft tissue that composes muscles in animal bodies, and gives rise to muscles' ability to contract. This is opposed to other components or tissues in muscle such as tendons or perimysium. It is formed during embryonic development through a process known as myogenesis.[1]\\r\\nMuscle tissue varies with function and location in the body. In mammals the three types are: skeletal or striated muscle; smooth or non-striated muscle; and cardiac muscle, which is sometimes known as semi-striated. Smooth and cardiac muscle contracts involuntarily, without conscious intervention. These muscle types may be activated both through interaction of the central nervous system as well as by receiving innervation from peripheral plexus or endocrine (hormonal) activation. Striated or skeletal muscle only contracts voluntarily, upon influence of the central nervous system. Reflexes are a form of non-conscious activation of skeletal muscles, but nonetheless arise through activation of the central nervous system, albeit not engaging cortical structures until after the contraction has occurred.[1]\\r\\nThe different muscle types vary in their response to neurotransmitters and endocrine substances such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, nitric oxide and among others depending on muscle type and the exact location of the muscle.[1]\\r\\nSub-categorization of muscle tissue is also possible, depending on among other things the content of myoglobin, mitochondria, myosin ATPase etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMuscle cells (myocytes) are elongated cells ranging from several millimetres to about 10 centimetres in length and from 10 to 100 micrometres in width.[2] These cells are joined together in tissues that may be either striated or smooth, depending on the presence or absence, respectively, of organized, regularly repeated arrangements of myofibrillar contractile proteins called myofilaments. Striated muscle is further classified as either skeletal or cardiac muscle.[3] Striated muscle is typically subject to conscious control, while smooth muscle is not. Thus, muscle tissue can be described as being one of three different types:\\r\\nIn vertebrates, there is a third muscle tissue recognized:\\r\\nCardiac and skeletal muscles are \\"striated\\" in that they contain sarcomeres and are packed into highly regular arrangements of bundles; smooth muscle has neither. While skeletal muscles are arranged in regular, parallel bundles, cardiac muscle connects at branching, irregular angles (called intercalated discs). Striated muscle contracts and relaxes in short, intense bursts, whereas smooth muscle sustains longer or even near-permanent contractions.\\r\\nSkeletal muscle is further divided into several subtypes:\\r\\nSmooth muscle is an involuntary non-striated muscle. It is divided into two subgroups: the single-unit (unitary) and multiunit smooth muscle. Within single-unit cells, the whole bundle or sheet contracts as a syncytium (i.e. a multinucleate mass of cytoplasm that is not separated into cells). Multiunit smooth muscle tissues innervate individual cells; as such, they allow for fine control and gradual responses, much like motor unit recruitment in skeletal muscle.\\r\\nSmooth muscle is found within the walls of blood vessels (such smooth muscle specifically being termed vascular smooth muscle) such as in the tunica media layer of large (aorta) and small arteries, arterioles and veins. Smooth muscle is also found in lymphatic vessels, the urinary bladder, uterus (termed uterine smooth muscle), male and female reproductive tracts, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, arrector pili of skin, the ciliary muscle, and iris of the eye. The structure and function is basically the same in smooth muscle cells in different organs, but the inducing stimuli differ substantially, in order to perform individual effects in the body at individual times. In addition, the glomeruli of the kidneys contain smooth muscle-like cells called mesangial cells.\\r\\nCardiac muscle is involuntary, striated muscle that is found in the walls and histological foundation of the heart, specifically the myocardium. Cardiac muscle is one of three major types of muscle, the others being skeletal and smooth muscle. These three types of muscle all form in the process of myogenesis. The cells that constitute cardiac muscle, called cardiomyocytes or myocardiocytes, predominantly contain only one nucleus, although populations with two to four nuclei do exist.[8][9][page?needed] The myocardium is the muscle tissue of the heart, and forms a thick middle layer between the outer epicardium layer and the inner endocardium layer.\\r\\nCoordinated contractions of cardiac muscle cells in the heart propel blood out of the atria and ventricles to the blood vessels of the left/body/systemic and right/lungs/pulmonary circulatory systems. This complex mechanism illustrates systole of the heart.\\r\\nCardiac muscle cells, unlike most other tissues in the body, rely on an available blood and electrical supply to deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products such as carbon dioxide. The coronary arteries help fulfill this function.\\r\\n1.They carry out movements of the body.\\r\\n2.They support the body.\\r\\n3.They maintain the posture of the body.\\r\\nIt is responsible for the contractility of hollow organs, such as blood vessels, the gastrointestinal tract, the bladder.\\r\\nCardiac muscle is the muscle of the heart. It is self-contracting, autonomically regulated and must continue to contract in rhythmic fashion for the whole life of the organism. Hence it has special features.","input":"What are the different types of muscle tissue?"},{"output":"14 pounds","context":"The stone or stone weight (abbreviation: st.)[1] is an English and imperial unit of mass now equal to 14?pounds (6.35029318?kg).[nb 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland and other Germanic-speaking countries of northern Europe formerly used various standardised \\"stones\\" for trade, with their values ranging from about 5 to 40 local pounds (roughly 3 to 15?kg) depending on the location and objects  weighed. The United Kingdom's imperial system adopted the wool stone of 14 pounds in 1835. With the advent of metrication, Europe's various \\"stones\\" were superseded by or adapted to the kilogram from the mid-19th century on. The stone continues in customary use in Britain and Ireland used for measuring body weight, but was prohibited for commercial use in the UK by the Weights and Measures Act of 1985.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"stone\\" derives from the use of stones for weights, a practice that dates back into antiquity. The Biblical law against the carrying of \\"diverse weights, a large and a small\\"[7] is more literally translated as \\"you shall not carry a stone and a stone (??? ????), a large and a small\\". There was no standardised \\"stone\\" in the ancient Jewish world,[8] but in Roman times stone weights were crafted to multiples of the Roman pound.[9] Such weights varied in quality: the Yale Medical Library holds 10 and 50-pound examples of polished serpentine,[10] while a 40-pound example at the Eschborn Museum is made of sandstone.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English stone under law varied by commodity and in practice varied according to local standards. The Assize of Weights and Measures, a statute of uncertain date from c.?1300, describes stones of 5 merchants' pounds used for glass; stones of 8 lb. used for beeswax, sugar, pepper, alum, cumin, almonds,[12] cinnamon, and nutmegs;[13] stones of 12?lb. used for lead; and the London stone of ?12?1?2?lb. used for wool.[12][13] In 1350, Edward III issued a new statute defining the stone weight, to be used for wool and \\"other Merchandizes\\", at 14 pounds,[nb 2] reaffirmed by Henry VII in 1495.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn England, merchants traditionally sold potatoes in half-stone increments of 7 pounds. Live animals were weighed in stones of 14?lb; but, once slaughtered, their carcasses were weighed in stones of 8?lb. Thus, if the animal's carcass accounted for ?8?14 of the animal's weight, the butcher could return the dressed carcasses to the animal's owner stone for stone, keeping the offal, blood and hide as his due for slaughtering and dressing the animal.[17] Smithfield market continued to use the 8?lb stone for meat until shortly before the Second World War.[18] The Oxford English Dictionary also lists:[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scottish stone was equal to 16 Scottish pounds (17?lb 8?oz avoirdupois or 7.936?kg). In 1661, the Royal Commission of Scotland recommended that the Troy stone be used as a standard of weight and that it be kept in the custody of the burgh of Lanark. The tron (or local) stone of Edinburgh, also standardised in 1661, was 16 tron pounds (24?lb 1 oz avoirdupois or 9.996?kg).[20][21] In 1789, an encyclopedic enumeration of measurements was printed for the use of \\"his Majesty's Sheriffs and Stewards Depute, and Justices of Peace,?... and to the Magistrates of the Royal Boroughs of Scotland\\" and provided a county-by-county and commodity-by-commodity breakdown of values and conversions for the stone and other measures.[22] The Scots stone ceased to be used for trade when the Act of 1824 established a uniform system of measure across the whole of the United Kingdom, which at that time included all of Ireland.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the early 19th century, as in England, the stone varied both with locality and with commodity. For example, the Belfast stone for measuring flax equaled 16.75 avoirdupois pounds.[24]) The most usual value was 14 pounds.[25] Among the oddities related to the use of the stone was the practice in County Clare of a stone of potatoes being 16?lb in the summer and 18?lb in the winter.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1772 edition of the Encyclop?dia Britannica defined the stone:[26]\\r\\nSTONE also denotes a certain quantity or weight of some commodities. A stone of beef, in London, is the quantity of eight pounds; in Hertfordshire, twelve pounds; in Scotland sixteen pounds.\\r\\nThe Weights and Measures Act of 1824, which applied to all of the United Kingdom, consolidated the weights and measures legislation of several centuries into a single document. It revoked the provision that bales of wool should be made up of 20 stones, each of 14 pounds, but made no provision for the continued use of the stone. Ten years later, a stone still varied from 5 pounds (glass) to 8 pounds (meat and fish) to 14 pounds (wool and \\"horseman's weight\\").[27] However, the Act of 1835 permitted using a stone of 14 pounds for trade[28] but other values remained in use. James Britten, in 1880 for example, catalogued a number of different values of the stone in various British towns and cities, ranging from 4?lb to 26?lb.[29] The value of the stone and associated units of measure that were legalised for purposes of trade were clarified by the Weights and Measures Act 1835 as follows:[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured adopting the metric system. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. There would be minimal legislation, as the programme was to be voluntary and costs were to be borne where they fell.[30] Under the guidance of the Metrication Board, the agricultural product markets achieved a voluntary switchover by 1976.[31] The stone was not included in the Directive 80/181/EEC as a unit of measure that could be used within the EEC for \\"economic, public health, public safety or administrative purposes\\",[32] though its use as a \\"supplementary unit\\" was permitted. The scope of the directive was extended to include all aspects of the EU internal market as from 1 January 2010.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the adoption of metric units by the agricultural sector, the stone was, in practice, no longer used for trade; and, in the Weights and Measures Act 1985, passed in compliance with EU directive 80/181/EEC,[32] the stone was removed from the list of units permitted for trade in the United Kingdom.[34][35][36] In 1983, in response to the same directive, similar legislation was passed in Ireland.[37] The Act repealed earlier acts that defined the stone as a unit of measure for trade.[36] (British law had previously been silent regarding other uses of the stone.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stone remains widely used in the UK and Ireland for human body weight: in those countries people may commonly be said to weigh, e.g., \\"11 stone 4\\" (11 stones and 4 pounds), rather than \\"72 kilograms\\" as in many other countries, or \\"158 pounds\\" (the conventional way of expressing the same weight in the US).[38] The correct plural form of stone in this context is stone (as in, \\"11 stone\\" or \\"12 stone 6 pounds\\"); in other contexts, the correct plural is stones (as in, \\"Please enter your weight in stones and pounds\\"). In Australia and New Zealand, metrication has almost entirely displaced stones and pounds since the 1970s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many sports in both Britain and Ireland, such as professional boxing, wrestling and horse racing,[39] the stone is used to express body weights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of the stone in the British Empire was varied. In Canada for example, it never had a legal status.[40]\\r\\nShortly after the United States declared independence, Thomas Jefferson, then Secretary of State presented a report on weights and measures to the U.S. House of Representatives. Even though all the weights and measures in use in the United States at the time were derived from English weights and measures, his report made no mention of the stone being used. He did, however, propose a decimal system of weights in which his \\"[decimal] pound\\" would have been 9.375 ounces (265.8?g) and the \\"[decimal] stone\\" would have been 5.8595 pounds (2.6578?kg).[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the advent of metrication, units called \\"stone\\" (German: Stein; Dutch: steen; Polish: kamie) were used in many North-Western European countries.[42][43] Its value, usually between 3 and 10?kg, varied from city to city and sometimes from commodity to commodity. The number of local \\"pounds\\" in a stone also varied from city to city. During the early 19th century, states such as the Netherlands (including Belgium) and the South Western German states, which had redefined their system of measures using the kilogramme des Archives as a reference for weight (mass), also redefined their stone to align it with the kilogram.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis table shows a selection of stones from various North European Continental cities:\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the advent of the metric system spelt the demise of the stone as a unit of measure, the stone was used in some early discussions and implementations of the metric system. In his Philosophical essay written in 1668, John Wilkins proposed a system of measure whose unit of length, the standard, was approximately one metre and whose unit of mass was the mass of a cubic standard of rainwater (which would have been approximately 1,000?kg). He proposed that one tenth of this mass (100?kg) should be called a stone.[46][47] In 1791, a few years before the French Revolutionary Government agreed on the metre as the basis of the metric system, Thomas Jefferson, in a report to Congress proposed that the United States should adopt a decimal currency system (which was adopted) and a decimal-based system of measure (which was not adopted).[48] Jefferson's proposal for units of measure included a \\"decimal\\" pound equal to 9.375 ounces (265.8?g) in the \\"customary\\" system and a \\"decimal\\" stone of 10 \\"decimal\\" pounds or 5.8595 pounds (2.6578?kg).\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Wilkins' nor Jefferson's proposals were adopted; but, in the Netherlands, where the metric system was adopted in 1817, the pond (pound) was set equal to a kilogram.<ref group=nb>In modern colloquial Dutch, a pond is used as an alternative for 500 grams or half a kilogram, and the steen (stone), which had previously been 8 Amsterdam pond (3.953?kg), was redefined as being 3?kg.[43]","input":"What is 1 stone equal to in pounds?"},{"output":"Einstein","context":"","input":"Who discovered the theory of mass energy equivalence?"},{"output":"Portuguese","context":"Portuguese 97,9% German 1,9%, Indigenous languages 0,2%[1][2]\\r\\nPortuguese is the official language of Brazil,[5] and is widely spoken by most of population. Brazilian Sign Language is also an official language. Minority languages include indigenous languages and languages of more recent European and Asian immigrants. The population speaks or signs approximately 210 languages, of which 180 are indigenous.[6] Less than forty thousand people actually speak any one of the indigenous languages in the Brazilian territory.[7]\\r\\nLanguage is one of the strongest elements of Brazil's national unity. The only groups, and pockets of immigrants who maintain their heritage languages. Within Brazil, there is no major dialect variation of the Portuguese, only moderate regional variation in accent, vocabulary, and use of personal nouns, pronouns, and verb conjugations. Variations are diminishing as a result of mass media, especially national television networks that are viewed by the majority of Brazilians.\\r\\nThe written language is uniform across Brazil, and follows national rules of spelling and accentuation that are revised from time to time for simplification. With the implementation of the Orthographic Agreement of 1990, the orthographic norms of Brazil and Portugal were made virtually identical, with some minor differences. Brazil enacted these changes in 2009, and Portugal enacted them in 2012.\\r\\nWritten Brazilian Portuguese differs significantly from the spoken language, with only an educated subsection of the population adhering to prescriptive norms.[citation needed] The rules of grammar are complex and allow more flexibility than English or Spanish. Many foreigners who speak Portuguese fluently have difficulty writing it properly. Because of Brazil's size, self-sufficiency, and relative isolation, foreign languages are not widely spoken. English is often studied in school and is increasingly studied in private courses. It has replaced French as the principal second language among educated people.\\r\\nIn 2002, Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) was made the official language of the Bennidorm deaf community.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the first Portuguese arrived in 1500, what is now Brazil was inhabited by several Amerindian people, who spoke different languages. According to Aryon Dall'Igna Rodrigues[8] there were six million Indians in Brazil speaking 1,000 different languages. When the Portuguese settlers arrived, they encountered the Tupi people, who dominated most of the Brazilian coast and spoke a set of closely related languages. The Tupi called the non-Tupi peoples \\"Tapuias\\", a designation that the Portuguese adopted; however, there was little unity among the diverse Tapuia tribes other than their not being Tupi. In the first two centuries of colonization, a language based on Tupian languages (known as Lngua geral) was widely spoken in the colony,[citation needed] not only by the Amerindians, but also by the Portuguese settlers, Africans and their descendants. This language was spoken in a vast area from S?o Paulo to Maranh?o, as an informal language for domestic use, while Portuguese was the language used for public purposes. Lngua Geral was spread by the Jesuit missionaries and Bandeirantes to other areas of Brazil where the Tupi language was not spoken. Then, until the 1940s this language based on Tupi was widely spoken in some Northern Amazonian areas where the Tupi people were not present.[citation needed] In 1775, Marqus de Pombal prohibited the use of Lngua geral or any other indigenous language in Brazil.\\r\\nHowever, before that prohibition, the Portuguese language was dominant in Brazil. Most of the other Amerindian languages gradually disappeared as the populations that spoke them were integrated or decimated when the Portuguese-speaking population expanded to most of Brazil. The several African languages spoken[citation needed] in Brazil also disappeared. Since the 20th century there are no more records of speakers of African languages in the country. However, in some isolated communities settled by escaped slaves (Quilombo) the Portuguese language spoken by its inhabitants still preserves some lexicon of African origin, which is not understood by other Brazilians.[9] Due to the contact with several Amerindian and African languages, the Portuguese spoken in Brazil absorbed many influences from these languages, which led to a notable differentiation from the Portuguese spoken in Portugal.[10][not in citation given]\\r\\nStarting in the early 19th century, Brazil started to receive substantial immigration of non-Portuguese-speaking people from Europe and Asia. Most immigrants, particularly Italians[11] and Spaniards, adopted the Portuguese language after a few generations. Other immigrants, particularly Germans, Japanese and Ukrainians,[11][12] preserved their languages for more generations. German-speaking[13] immigrants started arriving in 1824. They came not only from Germany, but also from other countries that had a substantial German-speaking population (Switzerland, Poland, Austria and Russia (Volga Germans). During over 100 years of continuous emigration, it is estimated that some 300,000 German-speaking immigrants settled in Brazil. Italian immigration started in 1875 and about 1.5 million Italians immigrated to Brazil until World War II. They spoke several dialects from Italy. Other sources of immigration to Brazil included Spaniards, Poles, Ukrainians, Japanese and Middle-easterns. With the notable exception of the Germans, who preserved their language for several generations, and in some degree the Japanese, Ukrainians and Italians, most of the immigrants in Brazil adopted Portuguese as their mother tongue after a few generations.[14][15]\\r\\nPortuguese is the official language of Brazil, and is the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio and TV. It is used for all business and administrative purposes. Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, giving it a national culture sharply distinct from its Spanish-speaking neighbours and also being a major factor contributing to the differentiation between Brazilians and people from the rest of South America. Brazilian Portuguese has had its own development, influenced by the other European Languages such as Italian in the South and Southeast, Native American and African Languages in the Northeast. Due to this, the language is somewhat different from that spoken in Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries, mainly due to phonological differences,[citation needed] of similar importance to the differences between British English and American English.\\r\\nDuring the 18th century, other differences between the Brazilian and European Portuguese developed, mainly through the introduction of lexicon from African and Tupi languages, such as words related to fauna and flora. At that time Brazilian Portuguese failed to adopt linguistic changes taking place in Portugal produced by French influence.[which?][citation needed] The Brazilian Portuguese remained loyal to the pronunciation used at the time of its discovery. However, when Don Jo?o, the Portuguese king, and the royal entourage took refuge in Brazil in 1808 (when Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Portugal), he influenced the Portuguese spoken in the cities, making it more similar to the Portuguese of Portugal.[citation needed] After Brazilian independence in 1822, Brazilian Portuguese became influenced by Europeans who had migrated to the country.[citation needed] This is the reason that, in those areas (such as Rio de Janeiro and Recife), one finds variations in pronunciation (for instance, palatalization of post-vocalic /s/) and a few superficial lexical changes.[which?][citation needed] These changes reflect the linguistics of the nationalities settling in each area.[which?] In the 20th century, the divide between the Portuguese and Brazilian variants of Portuguese widened as the result of new words for technological innovations. This happened because Portuguese lacked a uniform procedure for adopting such words.[citation needed] Certain words took different forms in different countries. For example: in Portugal one hears \\"comboio,\\" and in Brazil one hears \\"trem\\", both meaning train. \\"Autocarro\\" in Portugal is the same thing as \\"?nibus\\" in Brazil, both meaning bus.[16]\\r\\nDespite the fact that Portuguese is the official language of Brazil and the vast majority of Brazilians speak only Portuguese, there are several other languages spoken in the country. According to the president of IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) there are an estimated 210 languages spoken in Brazil. Eighty[citation needed] are Amerindian languages, while the others are languages brought by immigrants. The 1950 Census was the last one to ask Brazilians which language they speak at home. Since then, the Census does not ask about language. However, the Census of 2010 asked respondents which languages they speak, allowing a better analysis of the languages spoken in Brazil.[17]\\r\\nAt least one of the indigenous languages, Nheengatu, became an official language alongside Portuguese in the municipality of S?o Gabriel da Cachoeira.[18]\\r\\nAccording to the 1940 Census, after Portuguese, German was the most widely spoken language in Brazil. Although the Italian immigration to Brazil was much more significant than the German one, the German language had many more speakers than the Italian one, according to the Census. The Census revealed that two-thirds of the children of German immigrants spoke German at home. In comparison, half of the children of Italians spoke Portuguese at home. The stronger preservation of the German language when compared to the Italian one has many factors: Italian is closer to Portuguese than German, leading to a faster assimilation of the Italian speakers. (One might compare this to the United States, where a huge wave of German immigrants almost completely switched to English and assimilated more thoroughly than the Italian-Americans.) Also, the German immigrants used to educate their children in German schools. The Italians, on the other hand, had less organized ethnic schools and the cultural formation was centered in church, not in schools. Most of the children of Italians went to public schools, where Portuguese was spoken.[19] Until World War II, some 1.5 million Italians had immigrated to Brazil, compared to only 250,000 Germans. However, the 1940 Census revealed that German was spoken as a home language by 644,458 people, compared to only 458,054 speakers of Italian.[20]\\r\\nSpaniards, who formed the third largest immigrant group in Brazil (after the Portuguese and Italians) were also quickly assimilated into the Portuguese-speaking majority. Spanish is similar to Portuguese, which led to a fast assimilation. Moreover, many of the Spanish immigrants were from Galicia, where the dominant language was not Spanish, but Galician, which is even closer to Portuguese, sometimes even being considered two dialects of the same language.[21][22] Despite the large influx of Spanish immigrants to Brazil from 1880 to 1930 (over 700,000 people) the Census of 1940 revealed that only 74,000 people spoke Spanish in Brazil.\\r\\nOther languages such as Polish and Ukrainian, along with German and Italian, are spoken in rural areas of Southern Brazil, by small communities of descendants of immigrants, who are for the most part bilingual. There are whole regions in southern Brazil where people speak both Portuguese and one or more of these languages. For example, it is reported that more than 90% of the residents of the small city of Presidente Lucena, located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, speak Riograndenser Hunsrckisch, a Brazilian form of the Hunsrckisch dialect of German.[23]\\r\\nSome immigrant communities in southern Brazil, chiefly the German and the Italian ones, have lasted long enough to develop distinctive dialects from their original European sources. For example, Brazilian German, also known as Riograndenser Hunsrckisch. In the Serra Ga~cha region, we can find Italian dialects such as Talian or italiano riograndense, based on the Venetian language.\\r\\nOther German dialects were transplanted to this part of Brazil. For example, the Austrian dialect spoken in Dreizehnlinden or Treze Tlias in the state of Santa Catarina; or the dialect Schwowisch, from Donauschwaben immigrants, is spoken in Entre Rios, Guarapuava, in the state of Paran; or the East Pomeranian dialect spoken in many different parts of southern Brazil (in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paran, Esprito Santo, S?o Paulo, etc.). Plautdietsch is spoken by the descendants of Russian Mennonites. However, these languages have been rapidly replaced by Portuguese in the last few decades, partly due to a government decision to integrate immigrant populations. Today, states like Rio Grande do Sul are trying to reverse that trend and immigrant languages such as German and Italian are being reintroduced into the curriculum again, in communities where they originally thrived. Meanwhile, on the Argentinian and Uruguayan border regions, Brazilian students are being introduced to the Spanish language.\\r\\nIn the city of S?o Paulo, Korean, Chinese and Japanese can be heard in the immigrants districts, like Liberdade. A Japanese-language newspaper, the S?o Paulo Shinbun, has been published in the city of S?o Paulo since 1946.[24] There is a significant community of Japanese speakers in S?o Paulo, Paran, Mato Grosso do Sul, Par and Amazonas. Much smaller groups exist in Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and other parts of Brazil. Many Chinese, especially from Macau, speak a Chinese creole called Macanese (patu or macasta), aside from Hakka, Mandarin and Cantonese. Brazil has the largest Japanese population outside of Japan. Japanese immigration to Brazil began in 1908. At first, Japanese immigrants were resigned to low paid farming jobs. With each generation, the Japanese have improved their lives in Brazil. [25]\\r\\nMany Amerindian minority languages are spoken throughout Brazil, mostly in Northern Brazil. Indigenous languages with about 10,000 speakers or more are Ticuna (language isolate), Kaingang (Gean family), Kaiw Guarani, Nheengatu (Tupian), Guajajra (Tupian), Macushi (Cariban), Terena (Arawakan), Xavante (Gean) and Maw (Tupian). Tucano (Tucanoan) has half that number, but is widely used as a second language in the Amazon.[citation needed]\\r\\nOne of the two Brazilian lnguas gerais (general languages), Nheengatu, was until the late 19th century the common language used by a large number of indigenous, European, African, and African-descendant peoples throughout the coast of Brazilit was spoken by the majority of the population in the land. It was proscribed by the Marquis of Pombal for its association with the Jesuit missions. A recent resurgence in popularity of this language occurred, and it is now an official language in the city of S?o Gabriel da Cachoeira. Today, in the Amazon Basin, political campaigning is still printed in this Tupian language.[citation needed]\\r\\nSpanish is understood to various degrees by many but not all Brazilians, due to the similarities of the languages. However, it is hardly spoken well by individuals who have not taken specific education in the language, due to the substantial differences in phonology between the two languages. In some parts of Brazil, close to the border of Brazil with Spanish-speaking countries, Brazilians will use a rough mixture of Spanish and Portuguese that is sometimes known as Portu?ol to communicate with their neighbors on the other side of the border; however, these Brazilians continue to speak Portuguese at home. In recent years, Spanish has become more popular as a second or third language in Brazil due in large part to the economic advantages that Spanish fluency brings in doing business with other countries in the region, since seven of the 11 countries that border Brazil use Spanish as an official language but falls behind English due to lack of interest by Brazilians in learning Spanish.\\r\\nIn S?o Paulo, the German-Brazilian newspaper Brasil-Post has been published for over fifty years. There are many other media organizations throughout the land specializing either in church issues, music, language etc.\\r\\nThe online newspaper La Rena is in Talian dialect and it offers Talian lessons. There are many other non-Portuguese publications, bilingual web sites, radio and television programs throughout the country.\\r\\nOn the Rio Grande do Sul state, there are several German and Italian colonized cities, communities and groups. Most small cities have German or Italian as their second language. In the capital Porto Alegre, it is easy to find people who speak one of those or both.\\r\\nThere are also at least two ethnic neighborhoods in the country: Liberdade, bastion of Japanese immigrants,[26][27] and Bixiga, stronghold of Italian immigrants,[28][29] both in S?o Paulo; however, these neighborhoods do not count yet with specific legislation for the protection of Japanese and Italian languages in these sites.[30][31]\\r\\nThis century has seen the growth of a trend of co-official languages in cities populated by immigrants (such as Italian and German) or indigenous in the north, both with support from the Ministry of Tourism, as was recently established in Santa Maria de Jetib, Pomerode and Vila Pav?o,[32] where German also has co-official status.[33]\\r\\nThe first municipality to adopt a co-official language in Brazil was S?o Gabriel da Cachoeira, in 2002.[34][35] Since then, other municipalities have attempted to adopt their own co-official languages.\\r\\nThe states of Santa Catarina[36][37][38] and Rio Grande do Sul have Talian officially approved as a heritage language in these states,[39] and Esprito Santo has the East Pomeranian dialect, along with the German language as cultural heritage.[40][41][42][43] [44] [45]\\r\\nAlso in production is the documentary video Brasil Talian,[46] with directed and written by Andr Costantin and executive producer of the historian Fernando Roveda.[47] The pre-launch occurred on 18 November 2011, the date that marked the start of production of the documentary.[48]\\r\\n[54]","input":"What is the official language of brazil today?"},{"output":"programming languages","context":"This list of JVM Languages comprises notable computer programming languages that are used to produce computer software that runs on the Java virtual machine (JVM).

There were usually 3 doors: The one in the center of the long south wall was called the \\"Door of Honor,\\" and was used by the minister and his family, and any honored out-of-town guests. The other doors were located in the middle of the east and west walls, and were used by women and men, respectively. A balcony (called a \\"gallery\\") would usually be built on the east, south, and west walls, and a high pulpit would be located on the north wall.\\r\\nAs separation of church and state took hold, some towns architecturally separated the building's religious and governmental functions by constructing a floor at the balcony level, and using the first floor for town business, and the second floor for church.\\r\\nMost of these structures that are still standing have been renovated several times to meet the needs of their owners and the styles of the times.

These structures were usually the largest building in the town. They were very simple buildings with no statues, decorations, or stained glass. Crosses would not even hang on the walls. Box pews were provided for families, and single men and women (and slaves) would typically sit in the balconies. Large windows would be located at both the ground floor and gallery levels. It was a status symbol to have lots of glass in the windows - the glass was expensive and had to be imported from England.

This window is one of the hallmarks of a colonial meeting house.\\r\\nSince it took considerable effort to build a new post-and-beam end wall, the need for additional space was often accommodated by cutting the building in half, separating the front and back halves, and filling in space between them.

He served as lead singer for the bands Linkin Park, Dead by Sunrise, Grey Daze, and Stone Temple Pilots.\\r\\nBennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory, in 2000, which became a commercial success. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the best-selling debut album of the decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to hit that many sales.[1] Linkin Park's following studio albums, from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017), continued the band's success. Linkin Park has sold over 100 million records worldwide.\\r\\nBennington formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. The band's debut album, Out of Ashes, was released on October 13, 2009. He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in 2013 to release the extended play record High Rise on October 8, 2013, via their own record label, Play Pen, but left in 2015 to focus solely on Linkin Park. He was widely regarded as one of the top rock vocalists of the 2000s. Hit Parader magazine placed him at number 46 on their list of the \\"100 Metal Vocalists of All Time\\".[2] He also appeared in cameo roles in several films, including Crank, Crank: High Voltage and Saw 3D.[3]\\r\\nOn July 20, 2017, Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California. His death was ruled as suicide by hanging.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChester Charles Bennington was born on March 20, 1976, in Phoenix, Arizona. His mother was a nurse, while his father was a police detective who worked on child sexual abuse cases.[5][6]\\r\\nBennington took interest in music at a young age, citing the bands Depeche Mode and Stone Temple Pilots as his earliest inspirations,[7] and dreamed of becoming a member of Stone Temple Pilots, which he later achieved when he became their lead singer.[8]\\r\\nBennington suffered sexual abuse from an older male friend when he was seven years old.[9] He was afraid to ask for help because he did not want people to think he was gay or lying, and the abuse continued until the age of 13 years.[10]\\r\\nHis parents divorced when he was 11 years old. The abuse and situation at home affected him so much that he felt the urge to kill people and run away.[10] To comfort himself, he drew pictures and wrote poetry and songs.[10]\\r\\nAfter the divorce his father gained custody of him.[6] Bennington started abusing alcohol, marijuana, opium, cocaine, meth, and LSD.[7][11][6] He was physically bullied in high school. In an interview, he said that he was \\"knocked around like a rag doll at school, for being skinny and looking different\\".[12]?\\r\\nAt the age of 17 years, Bennington moved in with his mother and was banned from leaving the house when his mother discovered his drug activity.[6] He worked at a Burger King before starting his career as a professional musician.[7]\\r\\nEventually, Bennington was able to overcome his drug addiction and would go on to denounce drug use in future interviews.[13] During one Linkin Park tour, he started drinking heavily.[5] In 2011, he said he had quit, noting, \\"I just don't want to be that person anymore.\\"[14]\\r\\nYears later he revealed the abuser's identity to his father but chose not to continue the case after he realized the abuser was a victim himself.[11]\\r\\nBennington first began singing with a band called Sean Dowdell and His Friends? They released an eponymous three-track cassette in 1993. Later, Dowdell and Bennington moved on to form a new band, Grey Daze, a post-grunge band from Phoenix, Arizona. The band recorded three albums: Demo in 1993, Wake/Me in 1994, and ...no sun today in 1997. Bennington left Grey Daze in 1998, but struggled to find another band.[15]\\r\\nBennington was frustrated and almost ready to quit his musical career altogether when Jeff Blue, the vice president of artists and repertoire at Zomba Music in Los Angeles, offered him an audition with the future members of Linkin Park.[15] Bennington quit his day job at a digital services firm[6] and took his family to California, where he had a successful audition with Linkin Park, who were then called Xero.[15] He managed to record the song for his audition in a day, missing his own birthday celebration in the process. Bennington and Mike Shinoda, the band's other vocalist, made significant progress together, but failed to find a record deal.[15] After facing numerous rejections, Blue, now a vice president of artists and repertoire at Warner Bros., intervened again to help the band sign with Warner Bros. Records.[15]\\r\\nOn October 24, 2000, Linkin Park released their debut album, Hybrid Theory, through Warner Bros. Records. Bennington and Shinoda wrote the lyrics to Hybrid Theory based on some early material.[5] Shinoda characterized the lyrics as interpretations of universal feelings, emotions, and experiences, and as \\"everyday emotions you talk about and think about.\\"[16][17] Bennington later described the songwriting experience to Rolling Stone magazine in early 2002, \\"It's easy to fall into that thing?ÿ 'poor, poor me', that's where songs like 'Crawling' come from: I can't take myself. But that song is about taking responsibility for your actions. I don't say 'you' at any point. It's about how I'm the reason that I feel this way. There's something inside me that pulls me down.\\"[5]\\r\\nBennington primarily served as Linkin Park's lead vocalist, but occasionally shared the role with Shinoda. All Music Guide described Bennington's vocals as \\"higher-pitched\\" and \\"emotional\\", in contrast to Shinoda's hip-hop-style delivery.[7] Both members also worked together to write lyrics for the band's songs.[18]\\r\\nBennington co-founded Dead by Sunrise, an electronic rock band from Los Angeles, California, with Orgy and Julien-K members Amir Derakh and Ryan Shuck in 2005 .[19][20] Dead by Sunrise made their live debut in May 2008, performing four songs at the 13th anniversary party for Club Tattoo in Tempe, Arizona.[21]\\r\\nThe band released their debut album Out of Ashes on October 13, 2009.[22]\\r\\nIn February 2013, Stone Temple Pilots parted ways with long-time lead singer Scott Weiland. The band recruited Bennington to replace Weiland in May 2013. On May 18, 2013, Bennington took the stage at KROQ's Weenie Roast with the band. The setlist included original Stone Temple Pilots songs, as well as their first single with Bennington on vocals called \\"Out of Time\\", which debuted on May 19 and was available for free download via their official website. It was later announced by Chester and the band in an exclusive KROQ interview that he was officially the new frontman of Stone Temple Pilots and discussed the possibility of a new album and tour. The song \\"Out of Time\\" is featured on their EP High Rise, which was released on October 8, 2013.[23]\\r\\nBennington reflected on joining Stone Temple Pilots, stating, \\"Every band has its own kind of vibe. Stone Temple Pilots has this sexier, more classic rock feel to it. Linkin Park is a very modern, very tech-heavy type of band. I grew up listening to these guys. When this opportunity came up, it was just like a no-brainer.\\" Bennington stated in interviews that singing lead vocals in Stone Temple Pilots was his lifelong dream. He left the band on good terms due to his commitments with Linkin Park in 2015.[8][24]\\r\\nBennington had a child, Jaime (born May 12, 1996), from his relationship with Elka Brand.[25] In 2006, he adopted Brand's other son, Isaiah[25] (born November 8, 1997). He married his first wife, Samantha Marie Olit, on October 31, 1996.[26] They had one child together, Draven Sebastian (born April 19, 2002).[25] Bennington's relationship with his first wife declined during his early years with Linkin Park, and they divorced in 2005.[27] In 2006, he married Talinda Ann Bentley, a former Playboy model with whom he had three children: Tyler Lee Bennington (born March 16, 2006) and twins Lilly and Lila (born November 6, 2011).[28]\\r\\nBennington and his wife were harassed by a cyberstalker named Devon Townsend (not to be confused with Canadian musician Devin Townsend) for almost a year. Townsend was found guilty of tampering with the couple's email, as well as sending threatening messages, and was later sentenced to two years in prison.[29]\\r\\nBennington was a tattoo enthusiast.[30] He had done work and promotions with Club Tattoo, a tattoo parlor in Tempe, Arizona. Club Tattoo is owned by Sean Dowdell, Bennington's friend since high school with whom he played in two bands.[31][32] Bennington was a fan of the Phoenix Suns,[33][34] Arizona Cardinals, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Arizona Coyotes.[35]\\r\\nIn a January 2011 interview, in response to the 2011 Tucson shooting, Bennington said, \\"There's a non-violent way to express yourself and get your point across?ÿ regardless of what you're saying or what your point is. In a free society, people have a right to believe whatever they want to believe. That's their business and they can speak their mind. But nobody, even in a free society, has the right to take another person's life. Ever. That's something that we really need to move beyond.[36]\\r\\nBennington was plagued with poor health during the making of Meteora, and struggled to attend some of the album's recording sessions.[37] In the summer of 2003, he began to suffer from extreme abdominal pain and gastrointestinal issues while filming the music video for \\"Numb\\" in Prague. He was forced to return to the United States for surgery, and filmed the remainder of the music video in Los Angeles.[38][39]\\r\\nBennington sustained a wrist injury in October 2007 while attempting to jump off a platform during a show in Melbourne at the Rod Laver Arena. Despite the injury, he continued to perform the entire show with a broken wrist, before heading to the emergency room. He received five stitches.[40][41]\\r\\nIn 2011, Bennington fell ill again, and Linkin Park was forced to cancel three shows and reschedule two from the A Thousand Suns World Tour.[42] Bennington injured his shoulder during the band's tour in Asia and was advised by doctors to have immediate surgery, cancelling their final show at Pensacola Beach, Florida, and ending their tour.[43]\\r\\nBennington injured his ankle in January 2015 during a basketball game.[44] He attempted to cope with the injury and perform with the aid of crutches and a knee scooter. Linkin Park later canceled the remainder of their tour to allow Bennington to undergo surgery and recover.[45][46][47]\\r\\nBennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California; his housekeeper discovered his body around 9:00?a.m. PDT on July 20, 2017.[48][49] His death was ruled as suicide by hanging. Mike Shinoda confirmed his death on Twitter, writing, \\"Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have one\\".[50] On July 21, Brian Elias, the chief of operations for the office of the medical examiner-coroner, confirmed that?a half-empty bottle of alcohol was found at the scene, but no other drugs were present.[51] The band announced that they had canceled the North American leg of their One More Light Tour following Bennington's death and that tickets would be refunded.[52]\\r\\nBennington's funeral was held at South Coast Botanic Garden in Palos Verdes, California, on July 29. In addition to his family members and close friends, many musicians who toured or played with Linkin Park were also in attendance. The service also included a full stage for musical tributes.[53] Bennington was cremated.[54]\\r\\nOn December 5, 2017, Billboard magazine wrote that Bennington's toxicology report showed \\"a trace amount\\" of alcohol in the singer's system at the time of death.[55]\\r\\nBennington filmed an episode of Carpool Karaoke six days before his death. Benningtons family allowed the episode to be aired on October 12, 2017.[56] On August 27, during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards ceremony, Jared Leto received media attention for his tribute to Bennington and Chris Cornell.[57] Some of his former bandmates from Dead By Sunrise and Grey Daze united to perform a tribute for Bennington during a concert on September 2 in Las Vegas.[58] Linkin Park also hosted a public tribute for Bennington in Los Angeles on October 27, titled Linkin Park and Friends: Celebrate Life in Honor of Chester Bennington. The event featured the band's first performance following his death, along with performances from Blink-182, members of System of a Down, Korn, Avenged Sevenfold, Bring Me the Horizon, and Yellowcard, and the singer Kiiara, among others.[59][60][61]\\r\\nAmerican rapper Jay-Z paid tribute to Bennington on several occasions by performing Numb/Encore live. Jay-Z and Bennington (with Linkin Park) collaborated on the song.\\r\\nColdplay's Chris Martin paid tribute to Bennington during the band's North American tour concert at MetLife Stadium, playing an acoustic version of \\"Crawling\\" on piano.[62]\\r\\nDuring the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, American rapper Logic performed the song 1-800-273-8255 live alongside Alessia Cara and Khalid. Performed as a tribute to both Cornell and Bennington, the song's title is the phone number of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. It was performed after the annual in memoriam tribute, which ended with Bennington.[63]\\r\\nBennington's death occurred on what would have been Chris Cornell's 53rd birthday.[64] Cornell was a close friend of Bennington. Cornell's death was also ruled as suicide two months prior.[64] Bennington commented on Cornell's death on Instagram by stating, \\"I can't imagine a world without you in it.\\"[64] Shinoda noted that Bennington was very emotional when the band performed \\"One More Light\\" in his honor on Jimmy Kimmel Live!,[65] where he could not finish singing the song and started getting choked up during both the rehearsal and at the live performance setting.[66] The band was due to record a live performance of their single \\"Heavy\\" on the show, but decided instead to play \\"One More Light\\" after hearing the news about Cornell's death because the song is about the loss of a friend.[66] Bennington sang Leonard Cohen's song \\"Hallelujah\\" at Cornell's funeral.[64] He was also the godfather of Cornell's son Christopher.[64]\\r\\nAlthea Legaspi of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"Bennington's voice embodied the anguish and wide-ranging emotions of the lyrics, from capturing life's vulnerable moments to the fury and catharsis found in his belted screams, which he would often move between at the turn of a dime.\\"[67]\\r\\nTalking about his favorite bands and influences, Bennington mentioned Alice in Chains, Arcade Fire, Circle Jerks, Descendents, Deftones, Jane's Addiction, Metallica, Ministry, Minor Threat, Misfits, The Naked and Famous, Nine Inch Nails, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Refused, Skinny Puppy, Soundgarden, and A Tribe Called Quest.[68][69] Bennington also considered himself as \\"a huge Madonna fan\\", crediting her for making him grow up wanting to be a musician.[70]\\r\\nSeveral publications have commented on the music legacy Bennington left with the bands and projects he worked in.[71][72] While describing the success of Bennington and Linkin Park, Allmusic's Andrew Leahey said, \\"Although rooted in alternative metal, Linkin Park became one of the most successful acts of the 2000s by welcoming elements of hip-hop, modern rock, and atmospheric electronica into their music?... focusing as much on the vocal interplay between singer Chester Bennington and rapper Mike Shinoda\\".[73] Writing for Billboard, Dan Weiss stated that Bennington \\"turned nu-metal universal,\\" as he was \\"clearly an important conduit for his far-ranging audience\\".[74]\\r\\nThe New York Times' Jon Caramanica commented that Bennington's ability to \\"pair serrated rawness with sleek melody\\" separated him from other contemporary singers, and also from the artists he was influenced by. Caramanica noted, \\"He was an emo sympathizer in a time when heavy metal was still setting the agenda for mainstream hard rock, and a hip-hop enthusiast who found ways to make hip-hop-informed music that benefited from his very un-hip-hop skill set\\". As Bennington acquired influences from industrial and hardcore punk acts, the journalist believed this was the factor that made Linkin Park survive the \\"rise and precipitous fall of the rap-rock era\\". calling the musician \\"a rock music polymath\\".[75] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times argued, \\"Perhaps more than Linkin Park's influential sound, Bennington's real artistic legacy will be the message he put across?ÿ the reassurance he offered from the dark\\".[76]\\r\\nBBC's Steve Holden called Bennington the \\"voice of a generation\\", saying his voice was arguably Linkin Park's greatest asset.[77] Jonathan McAloon of The Daily Telegraph commented, \\"Benningtons death will have an impact on many millennials because his voice was the sound of their millennium\\".[78] While talking about Linkin Park's popularity, Corey Apar, of AllMusic, commented, \\"Bennington's oft-tortured vocals became one of the most distinctive in the alternative rock scene\\".[79] Writing for The Guardian, Ben Beaumont-Thomas noted \\"Benningtons decision to sing clearly and openly was, therefore, more radical than he is given credit for, and indeed more socially valuable\\". The journalist continued to discuss Bennington's impact, commenting,\\r\\nHis cleanly articulated tales of emotional struggle gave millions the sense that someone understood them, and the huge sound of his band around him magnified that sense, moving listeners from the psychic space of their bedrooms into an arena of thousands of people who shared their pain.[80]\\r\\nJames Hingle echoed this sentiment, writing for Kerrang! he said that Bennington \\"was one of the most honest vocalists out there when it came to his mental health\\".[81] In the same topic, William Goodman from Billboard said Bennington and fellow musicians Chris Cornell and Scott Weiland \\"helped define a generation of the hard rock sound, who were tied together artistically and personally\\".[82]\\r\\nThe Straits Times' music correspondent Eddino Abdul Hadi stated Bennington was an inspiration to many artists in the Singapore music scene.[83] Calum Slingerland, editor of the Canadian periodical Exclaim!, expressed, \\"[H]is influence has been felt in the worlds of rock, metal, rap, and beyond\\".[84]\\r\\nIn 2005, Bennington appeared on \\"Walking Dead\\", the lead single from turntablist Z-Trip's debut album Shifting Gears. Bennington also made a surprise guest appearance during Z-Trip's performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2005.[85] He also joined Alice in Chains and performed the song \\"Man in the Box\\" at KROQ's Inland Invasion Festival in 2006.[86][87] Bennington performed with Kings of Chaos during their six-show 2016 concert tour.[88]\\r\\nA Decade Underground\\r\\nBennington executive-produced the 2012 debut EP UsÿYou for Los Angeles hard rock band Hellflower, which is fronted by his long-time friend and Director of Activities (D.O.A.) Church.[89]\\r\\nBennington made a cameo appearance in the 2006 film Crank as a customer in a pharmacy.[90] He later appeared as a horse-track spectator in the film's 2009 sequel, Crank: High Voltage.[91] Bennington also played the role of the ill-fated racist Evan in the 2010 film Saw 3D: The Final Chapter.[92] He was one of several rock musicians who spoke about the industry on Jared Leto's 2012 documentary, Artifact.[93]\\r\\nBennington was working with Church on developing an upcoming television show, Mayor of the World, with executive producer Trip Taylor.[94]","input":"When did lead singer of linkin park die?"},{"output":"Justify","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, commonly known as the Triple Crown, is a title awarded to a three-year-old Thoroughbred horse who wins the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes. The three races were inaugurated in different years, the last being the Kentucky Derby in 1875. These races are now run annually in May and early June of each year. The Triple Crown Trophy, commissioned in 1950 but awarded to all previous winners as well as those after 1950, is awarded to a Triple Crown winner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first winner of all three Triple Crown races was Sir Barton in 1919. Some journalists began using the term Triple Crown to refer to the three races as early as 1923, but it was not until Gallant Fox won the three events in 1930 that Charles Hatton of the Daily Racing Form put the term into common use.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the history of the Triple Crown, 13 horses have won all three races: Sir Barton (1919), Gallant Fox (1930), Omaha (1935), War Admiral (1937), Whirlaway (1941), Count Fleet (1943), Assault (1946), Citation (1948), Secretariat (1973), Seattle Slew (1977), Affirmed (1978), American Pharoah (2015), and Justify (2018). As of 2018, American Pharoah and Justify are the only living Triple Crown winners.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames E. \\"Sunny Jim\\" Fitzsimmons was the first trainer to win the Triple Crown more than once; he trained both Gallant Fox and his son Omaha for the Belair Stud breeding farm. Gallant Fox and Omaha are the only father-son duo to win the Triple Crown. Bob Baffert became the second trainer to win the Triple Crown twice, training American Pharoah and Justify. Belair Stud and Calumet Farm are tied as the owners with the most Triple Crown victories with two apiece. Calumet Farms won with Whirlaway and Citation. Eddie Arcaro rode both of Calumet Farms' Triple Crown champions and is the only jockey to win more than one Triple Crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretariat holds the stakes record time for each of the three races. His time of 2:24 for ?1?1?2 miles in the 1973 Belmont Stakes also set a world record that still stands.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three Triple Crown races had been run for decades before the series received its name; the Belmont Stakes was first run in 1867; the Preakness, in 1873;[2] and the Kentucky Derby, in 1875. The term was in use at least by 1923, although Daily Racing Form writer Charles Hatton is commonly credited with originating the term in 1930.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir order has varied. Before 1931, the Preakness was run before the Kentucky Derby eleven times. On May 12, 1917, and May 13, 1922, the Kentucky Derby and Preakness were run on the same day. Since 1931, the Kentucky Derby has been run first, followed by the Preakness, and then the Belmont.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach Triple Crown race is open to both colts and fillies. Although fillies have won each of the individual Triple Crown races, none has won the Triple Crown itself.[5]  Despite attempts to develop a \\"Filly Triple Crown\\" or a \\"Triple Tiara\\" for fillies only, no set series of three races has consistently remained in the public eye, and at least four different configurations of races have been used.  Two fillies won the series of the Kentucky Oaks, the Pimlico Oaks (now the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes), and the Coaching Club American Oaks, in 1949 and 1952, but the racing press did not designate either accomplishment as a \\"triple crown\\".  In 1961, the New York Racing Association created a filly triple crown of in-state races only, but the races changed over the years.  Eight fillies won the NYRA Triple Tiara between 1968 and 1993.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nGelded colts may run in any of the three races today, but they were prohibited from entering the Belmont between 1919 and 1957. Geldings have won each of the individual races,[7][8] but like fillies, no gelding has ever won the Triple Crown. The closest was Funny Cide, who won the Derby and the Preakness in 2003.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the races are held on dirt tracks, rather than the turf commonly used for important races in Europe.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt completion of the 2016 season, the three Triple Crown races have attracted 4,224 entrants. Of these, 292 horses have won a single leg of the Triple Crown, 52 horses have won two of the races (23 the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, 18 the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes, and 11 the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes), and 13 horses have won all three races. Pillory won both the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes in 1922, a year when it was impossible to win the Triple Crown because the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes were run on the same day.\\r\\n\\r\\n10 of the 13 winners have been \\"homebreds\\", owned at the time of their win by their breeders.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Fitzsimmons and Bob Baffert are the only two trainers to have two horses win the Triple Crown, with Fitzsimmons training the sire/son combination of 1930 winner Gallant Fox and 1935 winner Omaha and Baffert training 2015 winner American Pharoah and 2018 winner Justify. The wins by Fitzsimmons were also the first time that an owner and the first time that a breeder, Belair Stud holding both duties, had a repeat win of the Triple Crown. Calumet Farm is the only other owner with two Triple Crown horses, 1941 winner Whirlaway and 1948 winner Citation. Eddie Arcaro is the only jockey to ride two horses to the Triple Crown, both for Calumet, Whirlaway and Citation. Those two horses' trainers, Ben Jones and Jimmy Jones, were father and son.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll 13 horses, and most owners, trainers, and jockeys were born in the United States. The exceptions were jockey Johnny Longden, born in England and raised in Canada; French-born jockey Jean Cruguet; trainer Laz Barrera, from Cuba; and jockey Victor Espinoza, from Mexico. Secretariat's trainer, Lucien Laurin and jockey, Ron Turcotte were both Canadians. Owner Fannie Hertz was married to John D. Hertz, who was born in Slovakia; owner Ahmed Zayat was born in Egypt. Jockey Willie Saunders is considered a Canadian jockey because he grew up and established his career there, but was born in Montana. The horse Sir Barton was foaled in the United States but had a Canadian owner,  J. K. L. Ross, at the time of his Triple Crown win, while Justify's owners were from both the United States and China.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretariat holds the stakes record for each of the Triple Crown races, the Kentucky Derby (1:59 2/5), the Preakness Stakes (1:53), and the Belmont Stakes (2:24).[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 18, Steve Cauthen became the youngest jockey to win the Triple Crown, riding Affirmed in 1978. At 52, Mike Smith became the oldest jockey to win the Triple Crown, riding Justify in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one horse, Alydar, has placed (finished second) in all three races. He was defeated by Affirmed in all three races in 1978 by a combined margin of two lengths. His trainer John Veitch is the only trainer to have done this with one horse. In 1995, D. Wayne Lukas became the first and only major figure (owner, jockey, or trainer) to win all three Triple Crown races with different horses, Thunder Gulch in the Derby and Belmont, Timber Country in the Preakness.  Lukas also is the only trainer to have won six straight Triple Crown races, adding his 1995 wins, having won the 1994 Preakness and Belmont with Tabasco Cat and the 1996 Derby with Grindstone.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Veitch, only with two different horses, Bob Baffert also had second-place finishes in all three legs of the Triple Crown, both owned by Ahmed Zayat: in 2012, Bodemeister finished second in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness stakes to I'll Have Another, then Paynter was entered and finished second to Union Rags.[21]  Baffert and Zayat teamed up again for the 2015 Triple Crown victory of American Pharoah.\\r\\n\\r\\nGallant Fox is the only Triple Crown winner to sire another U.S. Triple Crown winner, Omaha. Affirmed sired Peteski, winner of the 1993 Canadian Triple Crown.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhirlaway, in addition to winning the 1941 Triple Crown, also won the Travers Stakes that year, becoming the first and only horse to date to accomplish that feat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Pharoah, in addition to winning the 2015 Triple Crown, also won the Breeders' Cup Classic that year. As the Breeders' Cup was not established until 1984, American Pharoah was the first (and, as of 2018, only) horse to sweep all four races, a feat that came to be known as the Grand Slam.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first Triple Crown winner, Sir Barton, in 1919, there was not another winner until Gallant Fox in 1930, a gap of 11 years. Between 1930 and 1948, seven horses won the Triple Crown, with five years being the longest gap between winners. However, following the 1948 win of Citation, there was a considerable gap of 25 years before Secretariat ended the drought of Triple Crown champions in 1973. Between 1973 and 1978, there were three Triple Crown winners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Affirmed's Triple Crown in 1978, the longest drought in Triple Crown history began in 1979 with Spectacular Bid's failed Triple Crown attempt at the Belmont Stakes, and lasted until American Pharoah won in 2015. Between 1979 and 2014 thirteen horses won both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, but either failed to win the Belmont Stakes or could not start in the race. Of those, Real Quiet came the closest to winning the Triple Crown, losing the Belmont Stakes by a nose in 1998. \\r\\nSpectacular Bid finished 3rd in 1979.\\r\\nPleasant Colony finished 3rd in 1981.\\r\\nAlysheba finished 4th in 1987.\\r\\nSunday Silence finished 2nd in 1989.\\r\\nReal Quiet finished 2nd in 1998.\\r\\nCharismatic finished 3rd in 1999.\\r\\nWar Emblem finished 8th in 2002.\\r\\nFunny Cide finished 3rd in 2003.\\r\\nSmarty Jones finished 2nd in 2004.\\r\\nBig Brown did not finish in 2008.\\r\\nI'll Have Another did not start (injury) 2012.\\r\\nCalifornia Chrome finished 4th in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1979-2015 period, horses who contested all three races, losing the Kentucky Derby but winning the Preakness and the Belmont were Risen Star in 1988, Hansel in 1991, Tabasco Cat in 1994, Point Given in 2001, and Afleet Alex in 2005. In 1984, Swale and in 1995, Thunder Gulch ran all three races, winning the Derby and the Belmont, but not the Preakness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 37-year gap between the Triple Crown wins of Affirmed and American Pharoah drew criticism of the system. As far back as 1986, reporters noted that horses who were fresh for the Belmont had an advantage.[25]  In 2003, Gary Stevens stated in an interview with Charlie Rose that he did not believe there would be another Triple Crown winner because of the tendency for owners to put fresh horses in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.[26] California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn was particularly critical of the Triple Crown system in post-Belmont remarks in 2014; he considered the system to be unfair, arguing that there would never be another Triple Crown winner in his lifetime unless only horses that competed in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness competed at the Belmont. By 2014, six of the previous eight Belmont winners had not competed in either of the first two legs of the Triple Crown.[27]  Additionally, from 2006 to 2014, the Belmont winner was a horse who had not competed in the Preakness.[28] American Pharoah was the first Belmont winner since Afleet Alex in 2005 to have run all three Triple Crown races.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince all three races were inaugurated, as of  2017[update], 23 horses have won the Derby and Preakness but not the Belmont:\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, the three races largely organized their own nominations procedure, marketing and television broadcast rights. In 1985, Triple Crown Productions was created when the owner of Spend a Buck chose not to run in the other two Triple Crown races because of a financial incentive offered to any Kentucky Derby winner who could win a set of competing races in New Jersey. The organizers of the three races realized that they needed to work together.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nEfforts to unify the sponsorship and marketing of all three Triple Crown races began in 1987 when ABC Sports negotiated a deal with Chrysler to pay $5 million to any horse that swept all three races, and $1 million each year there was no Triple Crown sweep to the horse with the highest combined Triple Crown finish.[46]  This sponsorship lasted until 1993. The end of the $1 million participation bonus was linked to the breakdown of Prairie Bayou at the Belmont Stakes that year and the uncomfortable situation that arose when the Kentucky Derby winner, Sea Hero, was given the bonus following a seventh-place finish.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, Visa USA took over the sponsorship with a 10-year contract, naming the series the Visa Triple Crown and offering only the $5 million bonus to a horse that could sweep the Triple Crown.[47] Along with sponsorship by VISA, NBC Sports paid $51.5 million for broadcast rights to all three races, with the revenue split giving 50% of the total to Churchill Downs and 25% each to Pimlico and to the New York Racing Association (NYRA).[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Visa dealand the cooperative effortended after 2005. The NYRA felt that they did not get a fair share of the revenue, particularly when the Belmont had the highest ratings of all three races in the years where a Triple Crown was on the line.[45]  From 2001 through 2013, average viewership for the Belmont was 7 million when the Triple Crown was not at stake, whereas viewership averaged 13 million when it was.[a][48]  With the contract term ending, the NYRA went to ESPN on ABC for the 2006 Belmont, while the broadcasts of the Derby and Preakness remained with NBC.[45] Visa chose to remain as a sponsor of only Kentucky Derby for the next five years.[47] As a result of the divided broadcast, Triple Crown Productions was unable to obtain a new sponsor.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2011, ABC/ESPN dropped out of the negotiations to renew broadcast rights to the Belmont Stakes. NBC obtained the contract through 2015, once again uniting all three races on the same network.[49][50][51]  In 2014, NBC extended their contract for the Kentucky Derby through 2025.[52] As of  August 2015[update], NBC obtained a broadcast contract for the Belmont through 2020 and the Preakness through 2022.[53]","input":"What was the last horse to win the triple crown?"},{"output":"Kavi Pradeep","context":"\\"Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo\\" (Hindi: ? ???? ??? ?? ?????; \\"O' people of my country\\") is a Hindi patriotic song written by Kavi Pradeep, composed by C. Ramchandra, and performed by Lata Mangeshkar. The song commemorates Indian soldiers who died during the Sino-Indian War in 1962. The song was first performed live by Mangeshkar on 27 January 1963 at the National Stadium in New Delhi in the presence of President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, on account of Republic Day (26 January) 1963, which was just two months after the end of the war.\\r\\nThe song is often rendered at patriotic occasions in India, and is one of the most prominent patriotic songs alongside Jana Gana Mana (the national anthem), Vande Mataram (the national song), and Sare Jahan se Accha.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAye Mere Watan Ke Logo was written by Kavi Pradeep to commemorate the Indian soldiers who died during the Sino-Indian War. Pradeep was deeply moved by accounts of casualties of the war. In late 1962, while taking a walk along Mahim beach in Mumbai, Pradeep received a sudden bout of inspiration. He borrowed a pen from a fellow walker, and wrote the opening stanza of the song on a foil that he ripped out from his cigarette pack. A few weeks later, Pradeep was approached by producer Mehboob Khan to write a song for a fund-raiser scheduled to be held at the National Stadium in New Delhi. Pradeep accepted the offer, but did not reveal any details about the song he intended to write. He recruited music director C. Ramchandra to write the music, and Lata Mangeshkar to perform the song. According to Pradeep's daughter, Mitul, \\"Due to some misunderstanding between Ramchandra and Lata-didi, it was to be sung by Asha Bhosale. However, my father felt nobody except Lata-didi could do justice to it. He even personally convinced her and she agreed to sing it. But with a rider - Mr Pradeep must be present at the rehearsals!\\"[1]\\r\\nAccording to Mangeshkar, \\"I suggested we format the song into a duet with me and my sister Asha (Bhosle). Pradeepji wanted it to be a solo. I insisted that we do it as a duet. In fact, Asha had even rehearsed for the song. Then, days before we were to fly to Delhi, she came to me and said, 'Didi, I'm not coming to Delhi.' I tried to convince her to change her mind arguing that her name had even been printed in the newspapers as one of the singers. But she was adamant. Composer-singer Hemant Kumar had actually orchestrated the whole project. I told Hemantda about Ashas decision to not accompany us to Delhi to perform the song. Hemantda also tried to convince Asha. Lekin who nahin manee (But she didn't relent). Then it was left to me to rehearse alone for the song.\\"[2]\\r\\nIn January 2013, Lata Mangeshkar told a TV channel that initially she had declined to sing the song as she had not enough time to rehearse it. \\"It was Pradeepji, ( Kavi Pradeep) the poet, who wrote the immortal lyrics, who came to me and asked me to sing the song. I declined, because there was no time to rehearse. You see, at that time I was working round-the-clock. To give special attention to one song seemed impossible. But Pradeepji insisted,\\" Lata said, admitting that she was very nervous before the performance. Kavi Pradeep, the man who penned lyrics of the song, couldn't witness the event. \\"My regret is that Pradeepji had not been called for the Republic Day function where I sang the song. If he was there, he would have seen with his own eyes what impact 'Ae mere watan ke logo' had,\\" Lata told.[2][3][4]\\r\\nThe song was first performed live on 27 January 1963, by Lata Mangeshkar at an event at the National Stadium in New Delhi in the presence of President S. Radhakrishnan and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, on account of Republic Day (26 January) 1963, which was just two months after the end of the war.[5] Mangeshkar sang two songs at the event, opening with the bhajan (devotional song) Allah tero naam followed by Ae mere watan ke logon.[6] The performance of the latter song moved Nehru to tears.[1][7] \\"Those who don't feel inspired by Aye mere watan ke logo don't deserve to be called a Hindustani\\", said Nehru, who was visibly moved by the song.[3][6][8]\\r\\nThe event raised ?2 lakh (equivalent to ?1.2?crore or US$180,000 in 2017) for the Army Welfare Fund.[9] The song's lyricist, Pradeep, was not invited to the performance. Pradeep performed the song for Nehru on 21 March 1963 at a function at R.M. High School in Mumbai. He also presented Nehru with the original handwritten lyrics of the song.[1][7]\\r\\nThe song received rave appreciation from across the country.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the artists and technicians involved with the song  including singers, musicians, music director, lyricist, recording studio, sound recordist  pledged the royalty of the song in perpetuity to the War Widows Fund.[10] Per Pradeep's last wishes, royalties for sale of records of the song were to be donated to war widows. In 2005, the Bombay High Court asked the music company HMV to indicate a lump sum payable to the Army Welfare Fund for the disabled and war widows from the song's royalty proceeds.[6][11]\\r\\nBrigadier Chitranjan Sawant, who served in the Sino-Indian War,[12] stated that the song inspired soldiers to withstand the difficult situations they were in.[3]\\r\\nRecalling the song in 2013, Mangeshkar stated that she never expected the song to be so successful saying, \\"Since it was not part of a film, I thought it would have a limited impact. Ae mere watan ke logon became my signature tune. No show of mine, no concert or event is complete until I sing it.\\"[6] She also stated that Pradeep was always sure of the song's success saying, \\"Only Pradeepji had faith in the song.

Lined by bars, shops, restaurants, nature, and public art, the River Walk is an important part of the city's urban fabric and a tourist attraction in its own right.\\r\\nThe River Walk is a successful special-case pedestrian street, one level down from the automobile street. The River Walk winds and loops under bridges as two parallel sidewalks lined with restaurants and shops, connecting the major tourist draws from the Shops at Rivercenter, to the Arneson River Theatre, to Marriage Island, to La Villita, to HemisFair Park, to the Tower Life Building, to the San Antonio Museum of Art, to the Pearl and the city's five Spanish colonial missions, which have been named a World Heritage Site, including the Alamo. During the annual springtime Fiesta San Antonio, the River Parade features flowery floats that float down the river.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1921, a disastrous flood along the San Antonio River took 50 lives.[1] Plans were then developed for flood control of the river. Among the plans was to build an upstream dam (Olmos Dam) and bypass a prominent bend of the river in the Downtown area (between present day Houston Street and Villita Parkway), then to pave over the bend, and create a storm sewer.\\r\\nWork began on the Olmos Dam and bypass channel in 1926; however, the San Antonio Conservation Society successfully protested the paved sewer option. No major plans came into play until 1929, when San Antonio native and architect Robert Hugman submitted his plans for what would become the River Walk. Although many have been involved in development of the site, the leadership of former mayor Jack White was instrumental in passage of a bond issue that raised funds to empower the 1938 San Antonio River Beautification Project, which began the evolution of the site into the present 2.5-mile-long (4 km) River Walk.\\r\\nHugman endorsed the bypass channel idea (which would be completed later that year) but, instead of paving over the bend, Hugman suggested 1) a flood gate at the northern (upstream) end of the bend; 2) a small dam at the southern (downstream) end of the bend; and 3) a Tainter gate in the channel to regulate flow. The bend would then be surrounded by commercial development, which he titled \\"The Shops of Aragon and Romula\\". Hugman went as far as to maintain his architect's office along the bend.\\r\\nHugman's plan was initially not well-received ÿ the area was noted for being dangerous. At one point, it was declared off-limits to military personnel. People were warned of the threat of being \\"drowned like a rat\\" should the river flood. However, over the next decade support for commercial development of the river bend grew, and crucial funding came in 1939 under the WPA which resulted in the initial construction of a network of some 17,000 feet (5,200?m) of walkways, about twenty bridges, and extensive plantings including some of the bald cypress (others are several hundred years old) whose branches stretch up to ten stories and are visible from street level.\\r\\nHugman's persistence paid off; he was named project architect. His plan would be put to the test in 1946, when another major flood threatened Downtown San Antonio, but the Olmos Dam and bypass channel minimized the area damage. Casa Rio, a landmark River Walk restaurant, became the first restaurant in the area in 1946, opening next door to Hugman's office.\\r\\nThrough the following decades the network has been improved and extended. The first major extension of the Riverwalk was constructed by the joint venture of two general contractors Darragh & Lyda Inc. and H. A. Lott Inc. to Tower of the Americas as part of HemisFair '68. The expansion extended the Riverwalk beyond its natural banks at the horseshoe bend to the new convention center and theater by excavating much of the block bordered by Commerce, Bowie, Market and Alamo Streets. That was also the year the Hilton Palacio del Rio was built, the first of many downtown hotels that leverage their slice of urban \\"riverfront.\\" A subsequent major expansion opened in 1988 that extended a branch from the 1968 extension to create a lagoon at the new Rivercenter Mall and the Marriott Rivercenter Hotel.\\r\\nIn 1981 the Hyatt Regency San Antonio opened with a new pedestrian connector that linked Alamo Plaza to the River Walk with concrete waterfalls, waterways and indigenous landscaping. Known as the Paseo del Alamo, this river \\"extension\\" actually flows from Alamo Plaza into the San Antonio River through the atrium of the hotel. This connector not only allows the hotel to market itself as being on Alamo Plaza and on the River Walk, but it provides the city with an urban park that connects the city's two largest tourist attractions.\\r\\nMany downtown buildings like the Casino Club Building have street entrances and separate river entrances one level below. This separates the automotive service grid (for delivery and emergency vehicles) and pedestrian traffic below, and creating an intricate network of bridges, walkways, and old staircases. The San Antonio Spurs had their five NBA Championship victory parades/cruises along the river.\\r\\nExpansion plans are planned for areas of the river north and south of Downtown. As chain restaurants and establishments have begun to flourish, now taking up about a third of commercial space, talk has begun at City Hall about limiting their existence on the River Walk and keeping a distinctively local flair. On May 30, 2009 the city opened the $72 million Museum Reach.[2] The Museum Reach features local attractions such as the San Antonio Museum of Art and The Pearl Brewery, which has become one of the most popular areas for locals.[3][4]\\r\\nTwo years later, in May 2011, the River Walk was extended by several miles to extend from Downtown to Mission Espada which is on the city's south side. This addition (named the \\"Mission Reach\\") is notable for its emphasis on ecological controls and improvements, as well as trail improvements to support both hiking and biking.[5] The Mission Reach has paddling trails[6] and biking trails which allow tourists to experience the UNESCO World Heritage Missions.[7][8]\\r\\nThe River Walk has inspired similar projects in other cities, such as the Little Sugar Creek Greenway in Charlotte, North Carolina,[9] the Cherry Creek Greenway in Denver, Colorado,[10] and the Santa Luca Riverwalk in Monterrey, Mexico.[11]\\r\\nAfter years of murmuring from locals and tourists about the water's quality, talk has also begun about cleaning up the water, although the muddy bottom and silt deposits make this difficult.[12] The muddy bottom does receive an annual cleaning during the Mud Festival.[13]\\r\\nIn early 2016, for the first time in its history, the River Walk was connected with another linear urban walkway, the San Pedro Creek Greenway. The greenway joins with the River Walk at the confluence of the San Pedro Creek and the San Antonio River near Mission Concepci܇n.\\r\\nOn May 25, 2017, Esperanza Andrade, a former Texas secretary of state, and Lisa Wong, her business partner in the company Go Rio San Antonio, prevailed in?a 10-1 vote from the San Antonio City Council for the $100 million contract to operate the barges on the River Walk.

Darwin promptly replied that Wallace's letter was \\"as clear as daylight. I fully agree with all that you say on the advantages of H. Spencer's excellent expression of 'the survival of the fittest'. This however had not occurred to me till reading your letter. It is, however, a great objection to this term that it cannot be used as a substantive governing a verb\\". Had he received the letter two months earlier, he would have worked the phrase into the fourth edition of the Origin which was then being printed, and he would use it in his \\"next book on Domestic Animals etc.\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nDarwin wrote on page 6 of The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication published in 1868, \\"This preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which possess any advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct, I have called Natural Selection; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has well expressed the same idea by the Survival of the Fittest. The term \\"natural selection\\" is in some respects a bad one, as it seems to imply conscious choice; but this will be disregarded after a little familiarity\\". He defended his analogy as similar to language used in chemistry, and to astronomers depicting the \\"attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets\\", or the way in which \\"agriculturists speak of man making domestic races by his power of selection\\". He had \\"often personified the word Nature; for I have found it difficult to avoid this ambiguity; but I mean by nature only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws,and by laws only the ascertained sequence of events.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first four editions of On the Origin of Species, Darwin had used the phrase \\"natural selection\\".[8] \\r\\nIn Chapter 4 of the 5th edition of The Origin published in 1869,[3] Darwin implies again the synonym: \\"Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest\\".[4] By \\"fittest\\" Darwin meant \\"better adapted for the immediate, local environment\\", not the common modern meaning of \\"in the best physical shape\\" (think of a puzzle piece, not an athlete).[5] In the introduction he gave full credit to Spencer, writing \\"I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn The Man Versus The State, Spencer used the phrase in a postscript to justify a plausible explanation of how his theories would not be adopted by \\"societies of militant type\\". He uses the term in the context of societies at war, and the form of his reference suggests that he is applying a general principle.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n \\"Thus by survival of the fittest, the militant type of society becomes characterized by profound confidence in the governing power, joined with a loyalty causing submission to it in all matters whatever\\".[11]\\r\\nThough Spencers conception of organic evolution is commonly interpreted as a form of Lamarckism,[a] Herbert Spencer is sometimes credited with inaugurating Social Darwinism. The phrase \\"survival of the fittest\\" has become widely used in popular literature as a catchphrase for any topic related or analogous to evolution and natural selection. It has thus been applied to principles of unrestrained competition, and it has been used extensively by both proponents and opponents of Social Darwinism.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEvolutionary biologists criticise the manner in which the term is used by non-scientists and the connotations that have grown around the term in popular culture. The phrase also does not help in conveying the complex nature of natural selection, so modern biologists prefer and almost exclusively use the term natural selection. The biological concept of fitness refers to reproductive success, as opposed to survival, and is not explicit in the specific ways in which organisms can be more \\"fit\\" (increase reproductive success) as having phenotypic characteristics that enhance survival and reproduction (which was the meaning that Spencer had in mind).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the phrase \\"survival of the fittest is often used to refer to natural selection, it is avoided by modern biologists, because the phrase can be misleading. For example, survival is only one aspect of selection, and not always the most important.  Another problem is that the word fit is frequently confused with a state of physical fitness.  In the evolutionary meaning fitness is the rate of reproductive output among a class of genetic variants.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase can also be interpreted to express a theory or hypothesis: that \\"fit\\" as opposed to \\"unfit\\" individuals or species, in some sense of \\"fit\\", will survive some test.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterpretations of the phrase as expressing a theory are in danger of being tautological, meaning roughly \\"those with a propensity to survive have a propensity to survive\\"; to have content the theory must use a concept of fitness that is independent of that of survival.[5][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nInterpreted as a theory of species survival, the theory that the fittest species survive is undermined by evidence that while direct competition is observed between individuals, populations and species, there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups such as, for example,  amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Instead, these groups have evolved by expanding into empty ecological niches.[15] In the punctuated equilibrium model of environmental and biological change, the factor determining survival is often not superiority over another in competition but ability to survive dramatic changes in environmental conditions, such as after a meteor impact energetic enough to greatly change the environment globally. The main land dwelling animals to survive the K-Pg impact 66 million years ago had the ability to live in underground tunnels, for example.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010 Sahney et al. argued that there is little evidence that intrinsic, biological factors such as competition have been the driving force in the evolution of large groups. Instead, they cited extrinsic, abiotic factors such as expansion as the driving factor on a large evolutionary scale. The rise of dominant groups such as amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds occurred by opportunistic expansion into empty ecological niches and the extinction of groups happened due to large shifts in the abiotic environment.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been claimed that \\"the survival of the fittest\\" theory in biology was interpreted by late 19th century capitalists as \\"an ethical precept that sanctioned cut-throat economic competition\\" and led to the advent of the theory of \\"social Darwinism\\" which was used to justify laissez-faire economics, war and racism. However, these ideas predate and commonly contradict Darwin's ideas, and indeed their proponents rarely invoked Darwin in support.[citation needed] The term \\"social Darwinism\\" referring to capitalist ideologies was introduced as a term of abuse by Richard Hofstadter's Social Darwinism in American Thought published in 1944.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics of theories of evolution have argued that \\"survival of the fittest\\" provides a justification for behaviour that undermines moral standards by letting the strong set standards of justice to the detriment of the weak.[18] However, any use of evolutionary descriptions to set moral standards would be a naturalistic fallacy (or more specifically the isÿought problem), as prescriptive moral statements cannot be derived from purely descriptive premises. Describing how things are does not imply that things ought to be that way. It is also suggested that \\"survival of the fittest\\" implies treating the weak badly, even though in some cases of good social behaviour?ÿ co-operating with others and treating them well?ÿ might improve evolutionary fitness.[16][19]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRussian anarchist Peter Kropotkin viewed the concept of \\"survival of the fittest\\" as supporting co-operation rather than competition. In his book Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution he set out his analysis leading to the conclusion that the fittest was not necessarily the best at competing individually, but often the community made up of those best at working together. He concluded that \\r\\nIn the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense  not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nApplying this concept to human society, Kropotkin presented mutual aid as one of the dominant factors of evolution, the other being self-assertion, and concluded that \\r\\nIn the practice of mutual aid, which we can retrace to the earliest beginnings of evolution, we thus find the positive and undoubted origin of our ethical conceptions; and we can affirm that in the ethical progress of man, mutual support not mutual struggle ÿ has had the leading part. In its wide extension, even at the present time, we also see the best guarantee of a still loftier evolution of our race.\\r\\n\\"Survival of the fittest\\" is sometimes claimed to be a tautology.[20] The reasoning is that if one takes the term \\"fit\\" to mean \\"endowed with phenotypic characteristics which improve chances of survival and reproduction\\" (which is roughly how Spencer understood it), then \\"survival of the fittest\\" can simply be rewritten as \\"survival of those who are better equipped for surviving\\". Furthermore, the expression does become a tautology if one uses the most widely accepted definition of \\"fitness\\" in modern biology, namely reproductive success itself (rather than any set of characters conducive to this reproductive success). This reasoning is sometimes used to claim that Darwin's entire theory of evolution by natural selection is fundamentally tautological, and therefore devoid of any explanatory power.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the expression \\"survival of the fittest\\" (taken on its own and out of context) gives a very incomplete account of the mechanism of natural selection. The reason is that it does not mention a key requirement for natural selection, namely the requirement of heritability. It is true that the phrase \\"survival of the fittest\\", in and by itself, is a tautology if fitness is defined by survival and reproduction. Natural selection is the portion of variation in reproductive success that is caused by heritable characters (see the article on natural selection).[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf certain heritable characters increase or decrease the chances of survival and reproduction of their bearers, then it follows mechanically (by definition of \\"heritable\\") that those characters that improve survival and reproduction will increase in frequency over generations. This is precisely what is called \\"evolution by natural selection.\\" On the other hand, if the characters which lead to differential reproductive success are not heritable, then no meaningful evolution will occur, \\"survival of the fittest\\" or not: if improvement in reproductive success is caused by traits that are not heritable, then there is no reason why these traits should increase in frequency over generations. In other words, natural selection does not simply state that \\"survivors survive\\" or \\"reproducers reproduce\\"; rather, it states that \\"survivors survive, reproduce and therefore propagate any heritable characters which have affected their survival and reproductive success\\". This statement is not tautological: it hinges on the testable hypothesis that such fitness-impacting heritable variations actually exist (a hypothesis that has been amply confirmed.)[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nMomme von Sydow suggested further definitions of 'survival of the fittest' that may yield a testable meaning in biology and also in other areas where Darwinian processes have been influential. However, much care would be needed to disentangle tautological from testable aspects. Moreover, an \\"implicit shifting between a testable and an untestable interpretation can be an illicit tactic to immunize natural selection [...] while conveying the impression that one is concerned with testable hypotheses.\\"[14][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nSkeptic Society founder and Skeptic magazine publisher Michael Shermer addresses the tautology problem in his 1997 book, Why People Believe Weird Things, in which he points out that although tautologies are sometimes the beginning of science, they are never the end, and that scientific principles like natural selection are testable and falsifiable by virtue of their predictive power. Shermer points out, as an example, that population genetics accurately demonstrate when natural selection will and will not effect change on a population. Shermer hypothesizes that if hominid fossils were found in the same geological strata as trilobites, it would be evidence against natural selection.[22]","input":"Who coined the term survival of the fittest?"},{"output":"Barbados","context":"Sugar was the main crop produced on plantations throughout the Caribbean through the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Most islands were covered with sugar cane and mills for refining it. The main source of labor, until the abolition of the system, was African slaves. These plantations produced 80 to 90 percent of the sugar consumed in Western Europe.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSugar was the most important crop throughout the Caribbean, although other crops such as coffee, indigo, and rice were also grown. Sugar cane was best grown on relatively flat land that was near the coast, where the soil was naturally yellow and fertile; mountainous parts of the islands were less likely to be used for cane cultivation.\\r\\nIn the mid-17th century, sugar cane was brought into what later became the British West Indies by the Dutch,[1][2][3] from Brazil. Upon landing in Barbados and other islands, they quickly urged local growers to change their main crops from cotton and tobacco to sugar cane. With depressed prices of cotton and tobacco, due mainly to stiff competition from the North American colonies, the farmers switched, leading to a boom in the Caribbean economies. Sugar was quickly snapped up by the British, who used it in cakes and to sweeten teas.\\r\\nDuring the colonial period, the arrival of sugar culture deeply impacted the society and economy in the Caribbean. It not only dramatically increased the ratio of slaves to free men, but it increased the average size of slave plantations. Early sugar plantations made extensive use of slaves because sugar was considered a cash crop that exhibited economies of scale in cultivation; it was most efficiently grown on large plantations with many workers. As a result, black men and women were forcibly taken from Africa and made into slaves to work on the plantations. For example, before 1650 more than three-quarters of the islands' population was white. In 1680, the median size of a plantation in Barbados had increased to about 60 slaves. Over the decades, the sugar plantations became larger and larger. In 1832, the median-size plantation in Jamaica had about 150 slaves, and nearly one of every four bondsmen lived on units that had at least 250 slaves.[4]\\r\\nFor about 100 years, Barbados remained the richest of all the European colonies in the Caribbean. The colony's prosperity remained regionally unmatched until sugar cane production expanded in larger countries, such as Saint Domingue and Jamaica. As part of the mass sugar industry, sugar cane processing gave rise to related commodities such as rum, molasses, and falernum.\\r\\nThe West India Interest[5] was formed in the 1740s, when the British merchants joined with the West Indian sugar planters. The British and West Indies shared profits and needs. This organization was the first sugar-trading organization which had a large voice in Parliament.\\r\\nIn the 1740s, Jamaica and Saint Domingue (Haiti) became the worlds main sugar producers. They increased production in Saint Domingue by using an irrigation system that French engineers built. The engineers also built reservoirs, diversion dams, levees, aqueducts, and canals. In addition, they improved their mills and used varieties of cane and grasses.\\r\\nAfter the end of slavery in Saint Domingue at the turn of the 19th century, with the Haitian Revolution, Cuba became the most substantial sugar plantation colony in the Caribbean, outperforming the British islands.\\r\\nIn the 19th century, sugar dominated Martinique, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Croix, Barbados, Leeward Islands, Saint Domingue, Cuba, and many other islands that had been run by French, British, or Spanish owners. During the late 19th and 20th centuries, the sugar cane industry came to dominate Puerto Rico's economy, both under the colonial rule of Spain and under the United States.\\r\\nAfter slavery, sugar plantations used a variety of forms of labour including workers imported from India under contracts of indenture (see coolie). In the 20th century, large-scale sugar production using wage labour continued in many parts of the region.\\r\\nBy the early 21st century, many Caribbean islands were no longer producing sugar. However, sugar is still produced in Barbados, Jamaica, and Cuba, among other countries.[citation needed]","input":"Where is sugar cane grown in the caribbean?"},{"output":"insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order Lepidoptera","context":"Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order Lepidoptera, which also includes moths. Adult butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the large superfamily Papilionoidea, which contains at least one former group, the skippers (formerly the superfamily \\"Hesperioidea\\") and the most recent analyses suggest it also contains the moth-butterflies (formerly the superfamily \\"Hedyloidea\\"). Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene, which was about 56 million years ago.\\r\\nButterflies have the typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as caterpillars, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire life cycle.\\r\\nButterflies are often polymorphic, and many species make use of camouflage, mimicry and aposematism to evade their predators. Some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances. Many butterflies are attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oxford English Dictionary derives the word straightforwardly from Old English butorfloge, butter-fly; similar names in Old Dutch and Old High German show that the name is ancient. A possible source of the name is the bright yellow male of the brimstone (Gonepteryx rhamni); another is that butterflies were on the wing in meadows during the spring and summer butter season while the grass was growing.[1][2]\\r\\nThe earliest Lepidoptera fossils are of a small moth, Archaeolepis mane, of Jurassic age, around 190 million years ago (mya).[3][4] Butterflies evolved from moths, so while the butterflies are monophyletic (forming a single clade), the moths are not. The oldest butterflies are from the Palaeocene MoClay or Fur Formation of Denmark, approximately 55 million years old. The oldest American butterfly is the Late Eocene Prodryas persephone from the Florissant Fossil Beds,[5][6] approximately 34 million years old.[7]\\r\\nTraditionally, the butterflies have been divided into the superfamily Papilionoidea excluding the smaller groups of the Hesperiidae (skippers) and the more moth-like Hedylidae of America. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the traditional Papilionoidea is paraphyletic with respect to the other two groups, so they should both be included within Papilionoidea, to form a single butterfly group, thereby synonymous with the clade Rhopalocera.[8][9]\\r\\nButterfly adults are characterized by their four scale-covered wings, which give the Lepidoptera their name (Ancient Greek ?? leps, scale + ? pter܇n, wing). These scales give butterfly wings their colour: they are pigmented with melanins that give them blacks and browns, as well as uric acid derivatives and flavones that give them yellows, but many of the blues, greens, reds and iridescent colours are created by structural coloration produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.[10][11][12][13]\\r\\nAs in all insects, the body is divided into three sections: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The thorax is composed of three segments, each with a pair of legs. In most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed, unlike those of moths which may be threadlike or feathery. The long proboscis can be coiled when not in use for sipping nectar from flowers.[14]\\r\\nNearly all butterflies are diurnal, have relatively bright colours, and hold their wings vertically above their bodies when at rest, unlike the majority of moths which fly by night, are often cryptically coloured (well camouflaged), and either hold their wings flat (touching the surface on which the moth is standing) or fold them closely over their bodies. Some day-flying moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth,[15] are exceptions to these rules.[14][16]\\r\\nButterfly larvae, caterpillars, have a hard (sclerotised) head with strong mandibles used for cutting their food, most often leaves. They have cylindrical bodies, with ten segments to the abdomen, generally with short prolegs on segments 3ÿ6 and 10; the three pairs of true legs on the thorax have five segments each.[14] Many are well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing toxic chemicals obtained from their food plants. The pupa or chrysalis, unlike that of moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.[14]\\r\\nMany butterflies are sexually dimorphic. Most butterflies have the ZW sex-determination system where females are the heterogametic sex (ZW) and males homogametic (ZZ).[17]\\r\\nButterflies are distributed worldwide except Antarctica, totalling some 18,500 species.[18] Of these, 775 are Nearctic; 7,700 Neotropical; 1,575 Palearctic; 3,650 Afrotropical; and 4,800 are distributed across the combined Oriental and Australian/Oceania regions.[18] The monarch butterfly is native to the Americas, but in the nineteenth century or before, spread across the world, and is now found in Australia, New Zealand, other parts of Oceania, and the Iberian Peninsula. It is not clear how it dispersed; adults may have been blown by the wind or larvae or pupae may have been accidentally transported by humans, but the presence of suitable host plants in their new environment was a necessity for their successful establishment.[19]\\r\\nMany butterflies, such as the painted lady, monarch, and several danaine migrate for long distances. These migrations take place over a number of generations and no single individual completes the whole trip. The eastern North American population of monarchs can travel thousands of miles south-west to overwintering sites in Mexico. There is a reverse migration in the spring.[20][21] It has recently been shown that the British painted lady undertakes a 9,000-mile round trip in a series of steps by up to six successive generations, from tropical Africa to the Arctic Circle??almost double the length of the famous migrations undertaken by monarch.[22] Spectacular large-scale migrations associated with the monsoon are seen in peninsular India.[23] Migrations have been studied in more recent times using wing tags and also using stable hydrogen isotopes.[24][25]\\r\\nButterflies navigate using a time-compensated sun compass. They can see polarized light and therefore orient even in cloudy conditions. The polarized light near the ultraviolet spectrum appears to be particularly important.[26][27] Many migratory butterflies live in semi-arid areas where breeding seasons are short.[28] The life histories of their host plants also influence butterfly behaviour.[29]\\r\\nButterflies in their adult stage can live from a week to nearly a year depending on the species. Many species have long larval life stages while others can remain dormant in their pupal or egg stages and thereby survive winters.[30] The Melissa Arctic (Oeneis melissa) overwinters twice as a caterpillar.[31] Butterflies may have one or more broods per year. The number of generations per year varies from temperate to tropical regions with tropical regions showing a trend towards multivoltinism.[32]\\r\\nCourtship is often aerial and often involves pheromones. Butterflies then land on the ground or on a perch to mate.[14] Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. Simple photoreceptor cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours.[33] The male passes a spermatophore to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may cover her with his scent, or in some species such as the Apollos (Parnassius) plugs her genital opening to prevent her from mating again.[34]\\r\\nThe vast majority of butterflies have a four-stage life cycle; egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis) and imago (adult). In the genera Colias, Erebia, Euchloe, and Parnassius, a small number of species are known that reproduce semi-parthenogenetically; when the female dies, a partially developed larva emerges from her abdomen.[35]\\r\\nButterfly eggs are protected by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; the purpose of these holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.[35]\\r\\nButterfly eggs are fixed to a leaf with a special glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, deforming the shape of the egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched but in the case of Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid.[36] Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall to the base of the plant.[37]\\r\\nEggs are almost invariably laid on plants. Each species of butterfly has its own host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family.[38] In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to but not on the food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.[39]\\r\\nThe egg stage lasts a few weeks in most butterflies, but eggs laid close to winter, especially in temperate regions, go through a diapause (resting) stage, and the hatching may take place only in spring.[40] Some temperate region butterflies, such as the Camberwell beauty, lay their eggs in the spring and have them hatch in the summer.[41]\\r\\nButterfly larvae, or caterpillars, consume plant leaves and spend practically all of their time searching for and eating food. Although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are predators: Spalgis epius eats scale insects,[42] while lycaenids such as Liphyra brassolis are myrmecophilous, eating ant larvae.[43]\\r\\nSome larvae, especially those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants. They communicate with the ants using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well as using chemical signals.[44][45] The ants provide some degree of protection to these larvae and they in turn gather honeydew secretions. Large blue (Phengaris arion) caterpillars trick Myrmica ants into taking them back to the ant colony where they feed on the ant eggs and larvae in a parasitic relationship.[46]\\r\\nCaterpillars mature through a series of developmental stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment.[47] Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.\\r\\nCaterpillars have short antennae and several simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles and a pair maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk.[10] Caterpillars such as those in the genus Calpodes (family Hesperiidae) have a specialized tracheal system on the 8th segment that function as a primitive lung.[48] Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate.[49] The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration in the form of hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development in the egg stage.[10]\\r\\nWhen the larva is fully grown, hormones such as prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) are produced. At this point the larva stops feeding, and begins \\"wandering\\" in the quest for a suitable pupation site, often the underside of a leaf or other concealed location. There it spins a button of silk which it uses to fasten its body to the surface and moults for a final time. While some caterpillars spin a cocoon to protect the pupa, most species do not. The naked pupa, often known as a chrysalis, usually hangs head down from the cremaster, a spiny pad at the posterior end, but in some species a silken girdle may be spun to keep the pupa in a head-up position.[35] Most of the tissues and cells of the larva are broken down inside the pupa, as the constituent material is rebuilt into the imago. The structure of the transforming insect is visible from the exterior, with the wings folded flat on the ventral surface and the two halves of the proboscis, with the antennae and the legs between them.[10]\\r\\nThe pupal transformation into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings visible on the outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed from top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.[50]\\r\\nThe reproductive stage of the insect is the winged adult or imago. The surface of both butterflies and moths is covered by scales, each of which is an outgrowth from a single epidermal cell. The head is small and dominated by the two large compound eyes. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but not for clearly viewing distant objects. Colour perception is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The antennae are composed of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are designed for sucking and the mandibles are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular proboscis which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.[10]\\r\\nMany Heliconius butterflies also use their proboscis to feed on pollen;[51] in these species only 20% of the amino acids used in reproduction come from larval feeding, which allow them to develop more quickly as caterpillars, and gives them a longer lifespan of several months as adults.[52]\\r\\nThe thorax of the butterfly is devoted to locomotion. Each of the three thoracic segments has two legs (among nymphalids, the first pair is reduced and the insects walk on four legs). The second and third segments of the thorax bear the wings. The leading edges of the forewings have thick veins to strengthen them, and the hindwings are smaller and more rounded and have fewer stiffening veins. The forewings and hindwings are not hooked together (as they are in moths) but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping parts. The front two segments have a pair of spiracles which are used in respiration.[10]\\r\\nThe abdomen consists of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs. The front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has a pair of clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female's vagina. A spermatophore is deposited in the female, following which the sperm make their way to a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species.[10] After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with hemolymph and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.[53]\\r\\nButterflies feed primarily on nectar from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from pollen,[54] tree sap, rotting fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, they do not carry as much pollen load as bees, but they are capable of moving pollen over greater distances.[55] Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.[56]\\r\\nAdult butterflies consume only liquids, ingested through the proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, from which they obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and studies have suggested that the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift, along with the spermatophore, during mating.[57]\\r\\nIn hilltopping, males of some species seek hilltops and ridge tops, which they patrol in search for females. Since it usually occurs in species with low population density, it is assumed these landscape points are used as meeting places to find mates.[58]\\r\\nButterflies use their antennae to sense the air for wind and scents. The antennae come in various shapes and colours; the hesperiids have a pointed angle or hook to the antennae, while most other families show knobbed antennae. The antennae are richly covered with sensory organs known as sensillae. A butterfly's sense of taste is coordinated by chemoreceptors on the tarsi, or feet, which work only on contact, and are used to determine whether an egg-laying insect's offspring will be able to feed on a leaf before eggs are laid on it.[59] Many butterflies use chemical signals, pheromones; some have specialized scent scales (androconia) or other structures (coremata or \\"hair pencils\\" in the Danaidae).[60] Vision is well developed in butterflies and most species are sensitive to the ultraviolet spectrum. Many species show sexual dimorphism in the patterns of UV reflective patches.[61] Colour vision may be widespread but has been demonstrated in only a few species.[62][63] Some butterflies have organs of hearing and some species make stridulatory and clicking sounds.[64]\\r\\nMany species of butterfly maintain territories and actively chase other species or individuals that may stray into them. Some species will bask or perch on chosen perches. The flight styles of butterflies are often characteristic and some species have courtship flight displays. Butterflies can only fly when their temperature is above 27?C (81?F); when it is cool, they can position themselves to expose the underside of the wings to the sunlight to heat themselves up. If their body temperature reaches 40?C (104?F), they can orientate themselves with the folded wings edgewise to the sun.[65] Basking is an activity which is more common in the cooler hours of the morning. Some species have evolved dark wingbases to help in gathering more heat and this is especially evident in alpine forms.[66]\\r\\nAs in many other insects, the lift generated by butterflies is more than can be accounted for by steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics. Studies using Vanessa atalanta in a wind tunnel show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.[67]\\r\\nButterflies are threatened in their early stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some have been used as biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly.[68] When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained.[69] Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae.[70] Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.[71]\\r\\nCaterpillars are also affected by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and only a small percentage of the butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood.[70] The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis has been used in sprays to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large white butterfly, and the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has proved effective for the same purpose.[72]\\r\\nQueen Alexandra's birdwing is the largest butterfly in the world. The species is endangered, and is one of only three (3) insects (the other two being butterflies as well) to be listed on Appendix I of CITES, making international trade illegal.[73]\\r\\nBlack grass-dart butterfly (Ocybadistes knightorum) is a butterfly of the Hesperiidae family. It is endemic to New South Wales. It has a very limited distribution in the Boambee area.\\r\\nButterflies protect themselves from predators by a variety of means.\\r\\nChemical defences are widespread and are mostly based on chemicals of plant origin. In many cases the plants themselves evolved these toxic substances as protection against herbivores. Butterflies have evolved mechanisms to sequester these plant toxins and use them instead in their own defence.[75] These defence mechanisms are effective only if they are well advertised; this has led to the evolution of bright colours in unpalatable butterflies (aposematism). This signal is commonly mimicked by other butterflies, usually only females. A Batesian mimic imitates another species to enjoy the protection of that species' aposematism.[76] The common Mormon of India has female morphs which imitate the unpalatable red-bodied swallowtails, the common rose and the crimson rose.[77] Mllerian mimicry occurs when aposematic species evolve to resemble each other, presumably to reduce predator sampling rates; Heliconius butterflies from the Americas are a good example.[76]\\r\\nCamouflage is found in many butterflies. Some like the oakleaf butterfly and autumn leaf are remarkable imitations of leaves.[78] As caterpillars, many defend themselves by freezing and appearing like sticks or branches.[79] Others have deimatic behaviours, such as rearing up and waving their front ends which are marked with eyespots as if they were snakes.[80] Some papilionid caterpillars such as the giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes) resemble bird droppings so as to be passed over by predators.[81] Some caterpillars have hairs and bristly structures that provide protection while others are gregarious and form dense aggregations.[76] Some species are myrmecophiles, forming mutualistic associations with ants and gaining their protection.[82] Behavioural defences include perching and angling the wings to reduce shadow and avoid being conspicuous. Some female Nymphalid butterflies guard their eggs from parasitoidal wasps.[83]\\r\\nThe Lycaenidae have a false head consisting of eyespots and small tails (false antennae) to deflect attack from the more vital head region. These may also cause ambush predators such as spiders to approach from the wrong end, enabling the butterflies to detect attacks promptly.[84][85] Many butterflies have eyespots on the wings; these too may deflect attacks, or may serve to attract mates.[50][86]\\r\\nAuditory defenses can also be used, which in the case of the Grizzled skipper refers to vibrations generated by the butterfly upon expanding its wings in an attempt to communicate with ant predators.[87]\\r\\nMany tropical butterflies have seasonal forms for dry and wet seasons.[88][89] These are switched by the hormone ecdysone.[90] The dry-season forms are usually more cryptic, perhaps offering better camouflage when vegetation is scarce. Dark colours in wet-season forms may help to absorb solar radiation.[91][92][93]\\r\\nButterflies without defences such as toxins or mimicry protect themselves through a flight that is more bumpy and unpredictable than in other species. It is assumed this behavior makes it more difficult for predators to catch them, and is caused by the turbulence created by the small whirlpools formed by the wings during flight.[94]\\r\\nButterflies have appeared in art from 3500 years ago in ancient Egypt.[95] In the ancient Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan, the brilliantly coloured image of the butterfly was carved into many temples, buildings, jewellery, and emblazoned on incense burners. The butterfly was sometimes depicted with the maw of a jaguar, and some species were considered to be the reincarnations of the souls of dead warriors. The close association of butterflies with fire and warfare persisted into the Aztec civilisation; evidence of similar jaguar-butterfly images has been found among the Zapotec and Maya civilisations.[96]\\r\\nButterflies are widely used in objects of art and jewellery: mounted in frames, embedded in resin, displayed in bottles, laminated in paper, and used in some mixed media artworks and furnishings.[97] The Norwegian naturalist Kjell Sandved compiled a photographic Butterfly Alphabet containing all 26 letters and the numerals 0 to 9 from the wings of butterflies.[98]\\r\\nSir John Tenniel drew a famous illustration of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, c. 1865. The caterpillar is seated on a toadstool and is smoking a hookah; the image can be read as showing either the forelegs of the larva, or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin.[1] Eric Carle's children's book The Very Hungry Caterpillar portrays the larva as an extraordinarily hungry animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and the days of the week.[1]\\r\\nOne of the most popular, and most often recorded, songs by Sweden's eighteenth-century bard, Carl Michael Bellman, is \\"Fj?riln vingad syns p? Haga\\" (The butterfly wingd is seen in Haga), one of his Fredman's Songs.[99]\\r\\nMadam Butterfly is a 1904 opera by Giacomo Puccini about a romantic young Japanese bride who is deserted by her American officer husband soon after they are married. It was based on John Luther Long's short story written in 1898.[100]\\r\\nAccording to Lafcadio Hearn, a butterfly was seen in Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if a butterfly enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightenedthinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.[101]\\r\\nDiderot's Encyclopdie cites butterflies as a symbol for the soul. A Roman sculpture depicts a butterfly exiting the mouth of a dead man, representing the Roman belief that the soul leaves through the mouth.[102] In line with this, the ancient Greek word for \\"butterfly\\" is ? (ps?ch), which primarily means \\"soul\\" or \\"mind\\".[103] According to Mircea Eliade, some of the Nagas of Manipur claim ancestry from a butterfly.[104] In some cultures, butterflies symbolise rebirth.[105] The butterfly is a symbol of being transgender, because of the transformation from caterpillar to winged adult.[106] In the English county of Devon, people once hurried to kill the first butterfly of the year, to avoid a year of bad luck.[107] In the Philippines, a lingering black butterfly or moth in the house is taken to mean a death in the family.[108] Several American states have chosen an official state butterfly.[109]\\r\\nCollecting butterflies was once a popular hobby; it has now largely been replaced by photography, recording, and rearing butterflies for release into the wild.[1] The zoological illustrator Frederick William Frohawk succeeded in rearing all the butterfly species found in Britain, at a rate of four per year, to enable him to draw every stage of each species. He published the results in the folio sized handbook The Natural History of British Butterflies in 1924.[1]\\r\\nStudy of the structural coloration of the wing scales of swallowtail butterflies has led to the development of more efficient light-emitting diodes,[110] and is inspiring nanotechnology research to produce paints that do not use toxic pigments and the development of new display technologies.[111]","input":"What is the scientific classification of a butterfly?"},{"output":"Common law","context":"The contemporary legal systems of the world are generally based on one of four basic systems: civil law, common law, statutory law, religious law or combinations of these. However, the legal system of each country is shaped by its unique history and so incorporates individual variations.[1]\\r\\nBoth civil (also known as Roman) and common law systems can be considered the most widespread in the world: civil law because it is the most widespread by landmass, and common law because it is employed by the greatest number of people.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central source of law that is recognized as authoritative is codifications in a constitution or statute passed by legislature, to amend a code. While the concept of codification dates back to the Code of Hammurabi in Babylon ca. 1790 BC, civil law systems derive from the Roman Empire and, more particularly, the Corpus Juris Civilis issued by the Emperor Justinian ca. AD 529. This was an extensive reform of the law in the Byzantine Empire, bringing it together into codified documents. Civil law was also partly influenced by religious laws such as Canon law and Islamic law.[5][6] Civil law today, in theory, is interpreted rather than developed or made by judges. Only legislative enactments (rather than legal precedents, as in common law) are considered legally binding.\\r\\nScholars of comparative law and economists promoting the legal origins theory usually subdivide civil law into four distinct groups:\\r\\nHowever, some of these legal systems are often and more correctly said to be of hybrid nature:\\r\\nThe Italian civil code of 1942 replaced the original one of 1865, introducing germanistic elements due to the geopolitical alliances of the time.[7] The Italian approach has been imitated by other countries including the Netherlands (1992), Argentina (2014), Brazil (2002) and Portugal (1966). Most of them have innovations introduced by the Italian legislation, including the unification of the civil and commercial codes.[8]\\r\\nThe Swiss civil code is considered mainly influenced by the German civil code and partly influenced by the French civil code. The civil code of the Republic of Turkey is a slightly modified version of the Swiss code, adopted in 1926 during Mustafa Kemal Atatrk's presidency as part of the government's progressive reforms and secularization.\\r\\nA comprehensive list of countries that base their legal system on a codified civil law follows:\\r\\nThe Argentinian Civil Code was also in effect in Paraguay, as per a Paraguayan law of 1880, until the new Civil Code went in force in 1987.\\r\\nIn Argentina, this 1871 Civil Code remained in force until August 2015, when it was replaced by the new C܇digo Civil y Comercial de la Naci܇n.[9][10]\\r\\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the German legal theory became increasingly influential in Argentina.\\r\\nThe Civil Code came into effect on 1 January 1857. The influence of the Napoleonic code and the Law of Castile of the Spanish colonial period (especially the Siete Partidas), is great; it is observed however that e.g. in many provisions of property or contract law, the solutions of the French code civil were put aside in favor of pure Roman law or Castilian law.\\r\\nRegarding the theory of 'sources of law' in the Guatemalan legal system, the 'Ley del Organismo Judicial' recognizes 'the law' as the main legal source (in the sense of legislative texts), although it also establishes 'jurisprudence' as a complementary source. Although jurisprudence technically refers to judicial decisions in general, in practice it tends to be confused and identified with the concept of 'legal doctrine', which is a qualified series of identical resolutions in similar cases pronounced by higher courts (the Constitutional Court acting as a 'Tribunal de Amparo', and the Supreme Court acting as a 'Tribunal de Casaci܇n') whose theses become binding for lower courts.\\r\\nCommon law and equity (legal concept) are systems of law whose sources are the decisions in cases by judges. Alongside, every system will have a legislature that passes new laws and statutes. The relationships between statutes and judicial decisions can be complex. In some jurisdictions, such statutes may overrule judicial decisions or codify the topic covered by several contradictory or ambiguous decisions. In some jurisdictions, judicial decisions may decide whether the jurisdiction's constitution allowed a particular statute or statutory provision to be made or what meaning is contained within the statutory provisions. Statutes were allowed to be made by the government. Common law developed in England, influenced by Anglo-Saxon law and to a much lesser extent by the Norman conquest of England, which introduced legal concepts from Norman law, which, in turn, had its origins in Salic law. Common law was later inherited by the Commonwealth of Nations, and almost every former colony of the British Empire has adopted it (Malta being an exception). The doctrine of stare decisis, also known as case law or precedent by courts, is the major difference to codified civil law systems.\\r\\nCommon law is currently in practice in Ireland, most of the United Kingdom (England and Wales and Northern Ireland), Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, India (excluding Goa),[citation needed] Pakistan, South Africa, Canada (excluding Quebec), Hong Kong, the United States (on a state level excluding Louisiana), and many other places. In addition to these countries, several others have adapted the common law system into a mixed system. For example, Nigeria operates largely on a common law system, but incorporates religious law.\\r\\nIn the European Union, the Court of Justice takes an approach mixing civil law (based on the treaties) with an attachment to the importance of case law. One of the most fundamental documents to shape common law is the English Magna Carta,[17] which placed limits on the power of the English Kings. It served as a kind of medieval bill of rights for the aristocracy and the judiciary who developed the law.\\r\\nReligious law refers to the notion of a religious system or document being used as a legal source, though the methodology used varies. For example, the use of Jewish and Halakha for public law has a static and unalterable quality, precluding amendment through legislative acts of government or development through judicial precedent; Christian Canon law is more similar to civil law in its use of codes; and Islamic Sharia law (and Fiqh jurisprudence) is based on legal precedent and reasoning by analogy (Qiyas), and is thus considered similar to common law.[21]\\r\\nThe main kinds of religious law are Sharia in Islam, Halakha in Judaism, and canon law in some Christian groups. In some cases these are intended purely as individual moral guidance, whereas in other cases they are intended and may be used as the basis for a country's legal system. The latter was particularly common during the Middle Ages.\\r\\nThe Halakha is followed by orthodox and conservative Jews in both ecclesiastical and civil relations. No country is fully governed by Halakha, but two Jewish people may decide, because of personal belief, to have a dispute heard by a Jewish court, and be bound by its rulings.\\r\\nThe Islamic legal system of Sharia (Islamic law) and Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) is the most widely used religious law, and one of the three most common legal systems in the world alongside common law and civil law.[22] It is based on both divine law, derived from the Qur'an and Sunnah, and the rulings of Ulema (jurists), who used the methods of Ijma (consensus), Qiyas (analogical deduction), Ijtihad (research) and Urf (common practice) to derive Fatw (legal opinions). An Ulema was required to qualify for an Ijazah (legal doctorate) at a Madrasa (law school/college) before they could issue Fatw.[23] During the Islamic Golden Age, classical Islamic law may have had an influence on the development of common law[6] and several civil law institutions.[24] Sharia law governs a number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, though most countries use Sharia law only as a supplement to national law. It can relate to all aspects of civil law, including property rights, contracts or public law.\\r\\nCanon law is not divine law, properly speaking, because it is not found in revelation. Instead, it is seen as human law inspired by the word of God and applying the demands of that revelation to the actual situation of the church. Canon law regulates the internal ordering of the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican Communion. Canon law is amended and adapted by the legislative authority of the church, such as councils of bishops, individual bishops for their respective sees, the Pope for the entire Catholic Church, and the British Parliament for the Church of England.\\r\\nDespite the usefulness of different classifications, every legal system has its own individual identity. Below are groups of legal systems, categorised by their geography. Click the \\"show\\" buttons on the right for the lists of countries. Some studies show that ethnic minorities are more likely to feel that the legal system within their particular jurisdiction is unfair and unjust.[30] People with mental health issues, particularly young ones are also likely to have a low opinion of the justice system.[31]","input":"Is the usa common law or civil law?"},{"output":"non-Hodgkin's lymphoma","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nCreed is a 2015 American sports drama film directed by Ryan Coogler and written by Coogler and Aaron Covington. A spin-off and sequel to the Rocky film series, becoming its seventh installment,[4][5][6] the film stars Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson Creed, Apollo Creed's son, with Sylvester Stallone reprising the role of Rocky Balboa. It also features Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashd, Tony Bellew and Graham McTavish. The film reunites Jordan with Fruitvale Station writer-director Coogler, as well as Wood Harris, with whom Jordan had worked on The Wire.\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming began in Liverpool on January 19, 2015, and later also took place in Philadelphia, Rocky's hometown. Creed was released in the United States on November 25, 2015, the 40th anniversary of the date of the opening scene in 1976's Rocky. The seventh installment of the series and sequel to 2006's Rocky Balboa, the film received acclaim from critics, who called it the best Rocky film in many years. For his performance, Stallone was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, his first Oscar nomination since the original film. He also won the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor, Critics' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. A sequel, titled Creed II, is scheduled to be released in November 2018, directed by Steven Caple Jr. and written by Stallone and Cheo Hodari Coker.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, Adonis \\"Donnie\\" Johnson, the son of an extramarital lover of former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, is serving time in a Los Angeles youth detention center when Creed's widow, Mary Anne, visits and offers to take him in.\\r\\nIn 2015, Donnie resigns from the Smith Boardley Financial Group to pursue his dream of becoming a professional boxer. Mary Anne vehemently opposes his aspiration, remembering how her husband was killed in the ring against Ivan Drago thirty years ago.[a] Donnie auditions at the Los Angeles's elite Delphi Boxing Academy, managed by family friend Tony \\"Little Duke\\" Evers Jr., the son of Rocky's trainer Tony \\"Duke\\" Evers, but is turned down. Undaunted, Donnie travels to Philadelphia in hopes of getting in touch with his father's old friend and rival, former heavyweight champion, Rocky Balboa.\\r\\n\\r\\nDonnie meets Rocky at Rocky's Italian restaurant, Adrian's, named in honor of his deceased wife, and asks Rocky to become his trainer. Rocky is reluctant to return to boxing, having already made a one-off comeback[b] at a very advanced age despite having suffered brain trauma[c] during his career as a fighter. However, he eventually agrees. Donnie asks him about the \\"secret third fight\\" between him and Apollo just after Apollo helped Rocky regain the heavyweight title,[d] and Rocky reveals that Apollo won. Donnie trains at the Front Street Gym, with several of Rocky's longtime friends as cornermen. He also finds a love interest in Bianca, an up-and-coming singer and songwriter.\\r\\n\\r\\nDonnie, now known as \\"Hollywood Donnie\\", defeats a local fighter, and word gets out that he is Creed's illegitimate son. Rocky receives a call from the handlers of world light heavyweight champion \\"Pretty\\" Ricky Conlan, who is being forced into retirement by an impending prison term. He offers to make Donnie his final challengerprovided that he change his name to Adonis Creed. Donnie balks at first, wanting to forge his own legacy. However, he eventually agrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile helping Donnie train, Rocky learns he has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He is unwilling to undergo chemotherapy, remembering that it was not enough to save Adrian when she had ovarian cancer. His diagnosis and the fact that his best friend and brother-in-law Paulie PenninoAdrian's brotherhas now died in addition to Adrian, Apollo, and his old trainer, Mickey Goldmill, further force him to confront his own mortality. Seeing Rocky shaken, Donnie urges him to seek treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDonnie fights Conlan at Goodison Park in Conlan's hometown of Liverpool, and many parallels emerge between the bout that ensues and Apollo and Rocky's first fight[e] forty years earlier. First, before entering the ring, Donnie receives a present from Mary Anne  new American flag trunks similar to the ones Apollo and later Rocky wore. Additionally, to the surprise of nearly everyone, Donnie gives Conlan all he can handle. Conlan knocks Donnie down, but Donnie recovers to knock Conlan down for the first time in his career. Donnie goes the distance, but Conlan wins on a split decision (just as Apollo retained his title by split decision against Rocky). However, Donnie has won the respect of Conlan and the crowd; as Max Kellerman puts it while calling the fight for HBO, \\"Conlan won the fight, but Creed won the night.\\" Conlan tells Donnie that he is the future of the light heavyweight division.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film ends with Donnie and a frail but improving Rocky climbing the 72 steps outside the entrance of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of figures (real-life fighters and trainers) from the sport of boxing play roles in the film:\\r\\n\\r\\nLiev Schreiber voices an HBO 24/7 announcer, while Michael Buffer cameos as himself serving as ring announcer.

Michael B. Jordan was set for the role of Creed's son, Adonis Creed,[20] and Stallone was set to reprise his character of Rocky.[16] Original producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff would produce, along with Stallone and Kevin King-Templeton.[16] On April 25, 2014, while talking to THR, Coogler stated that he had sent his latest draft to the studio, and confirmed the involvement of Jordan and Stallone.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 10, real-life boxers Tony Bellew and Andre Ward joined the film, with Bellew to play a fighter, \\"Pretty\\" Ricky Conlan, the main opponent for Creed. Shooting was set to begin in January 2015, in Las Vegas and Philadelphia.[14] On December 16, Tessa Thompson was added to the cast as the female lead.[8] On January 8, 2015, Phylicia Rashad reportedly joined the film to play Mary Anne Creed, Apollo's widow.[10] On January 21, Graham McTavish tweeted about his involvement in the film.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipal photography began on January 19, 2015 on location at Goodison Park, with the first scene shot taking place during a Barclays Premier League football match between Everton (of which Stallone and native Evertonian Bellew are fans) and West Bromwich Albion.[21][22] Goodison would later host both the climactic film fight between Donnie and Conlan and also Bellew's real-life title fight against Ilunga Makabu in May 2016, which was the first outdoor boxing match in Liverpool since 1949.\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming also took place in Philadelphia.[23][24] In early February, an empty store in Philadelphia was converted into a boxing gym, where some training scenes were shot.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 13, the crew was spotted filming in the Victor Cafe in South Philadelphia.[27] The cafe was transformed into the \\"Adrian's Restaurant\\", and crew were again spotted filming there on February 16.[28] Stallone and Jordan were also spotted on the set of the film on February 18.[29] From February 24ÿ27 and then on March 3, filming took place at Sun Center Studios in Aston Township.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musical score for Creed was written by Swedish composer Ludwig G?ransson, who is only the third composer in the history of the Rocky series, following Bill Conti (Rocky I, II, III, V, and Balboa) and Vince DiCola (Rocky IV). Creed also features a soundtrack that consists mostly of music new to the series, including hip hop tracks by artists such as Future, Meek Mill, and White Dave.[31] Both a score and a soundtrack album were released on November 20, 2015 by WaterTower Music and Atlantic Records, respectively.[32] One tribute to Conti's original soundtrack is included ÿ the track \\"You're a Creed\\" uses both \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" and \\"Going The Distance\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 3, 2015, Warner Bros. slated the film to be released domestically on November 25, 2015.[33] This date coincides with the 40th anniversary of the opening scene in the original film, where Rocky fights Spider Rico.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 20, 2015, screeners of numerous prospective awards contenders, including Creed, were uploaded to torrent sites. The FBI has linked the case to co-CEO Andrew Kosove of Alcon Entertainment.

The film was originally projected to gross $35 million from 3,404 theaters in its first five days, including $20 million in its opening weekend.[36] However, after grossing $1.4 million from its Tuesday night previews (a record for a Thanksgiving week release) and $6 million on its opening day, five-day projections were increased to $39ÿ42 million. The film ended up grossing $42.6 million in its first five days, including $30.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing third at the box office.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nCreed has received critical acclaim.[38] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on 273 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Creed brings the Rocky franchise off the mat for a surprisingly effective seventh round that extends the boxer's saga in interesting new directions while staying true to its classic predecessors' roots.\\"[39] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".[40] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an overall positive score of 85%.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nA.V. Wire's Herman Dhaliwal gave the film a very positive review, writing, \\"I will say the film was everything I could have ever wanted and then some. Its a film that could have gone so wrong in so many ways so easily, but the results show something that is genuine and inspired. It takes the smartest possible routes with the story it wants to tell and delivers in basically every way it needed to. Ryan Coogler cements himself as one of the best rising filmmakers working today, as he crafts an emotional, funny, compelling and uplifting film that is full of strong performances.\\"[41] Andrew Barker of Variety stated that the film lives up to the expectation of its predecessors, while forging its own unique path. He also appreciated the performances of Stallone and Jordan, saying that Stallone deserved credit for taking a chance on young director Coogler, and that his trust had paid off. He concluded that the director \\"offered a smart, kinetic, exhilaratingly well-crafted piece of mainstream filmmaking\\".[42] IGN reviewer John Lasser gave the film an 8.5 out of 10, saying, \\"Creed is a mirror of Rocky's story and we have all been watching that unfold on the big screen for decades. Coogler's film does nothing to break the mold. Rather, it shows that the mold exists for a reason. Jordan delivers a knockout performance, and Stallone does as well.

If they didn't, I wouldn't be offended.\\"[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso that month, it was reported that the sequel's release was tentatively set for November 2017, although it was later pushed back to an unconfirmed date.[68][69][70][71] Development was seemingly delayed by the announcement Coogler had cast Michael B. Jordan in his next film, Marvel's Black Panther, thus delaying production until both men's schedules permitted.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nA confrontation between Adonis Creed and Ivan Drago was hinted at on Instagram.[73] Stallone later confirmed that he had finished writing the script for the sequel, which would see Dolph Lundgren reprising his role as Ivan Drago from Rocky IV.[74] By October 2017, Stallone stated on his social media page that he would direct the film,[75] however, by December of the same year, Steven Caple Jr. was announced as the director of Creed 2.[76] Boxer Florian Munteanu was cast as Drago's son.[77] In an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Jordan confirmed that Creed 2 was his next project.[78]","input":"What type of cancer did rocky have in creed?"},{"output":"11,072.76 miles","context":"The coastline of the United Kingdom is formed by a variety of natural features including islands, bays, headlands and peninsulas. It consists of the coastline of the island of Great Britain and the north-east coast of the island of Ireland, as well as a large number of much smaller islands. Much of the coastline is accessible and quite varied in geography and habitats. Large stretches have been designated areas of natural beauty, notably the Jurassic Coast and the Heritage Coast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mapping authority for the United Kingdom, the Ordnance Survey, records the coastline of the main island, Great Britain, as 11,072.76 miles rounding to 11,073 miles (17,820?km).[1] The British Cartographic Society points out that \\"The true answer is: it depends!\\". If the larger islands are added, the coastline as measured by the standard method at Mean High Water Mark rises to about 19,491 miles (31,368?km).[2] According to the CIA Factbook, the length of the UK coastline is around 12,429?km or 7,723 miles, although no details are provided about how this figure was calculated.[3] On the basis of EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive boundaries,[4] the UK coastline can be divided into the eastern, Greater North Sea section, which using 1km2 box counts and including islands is 4,994?km, and a western Celtic Seas coastline, which using the same measurement approach and including Northern Ireland is 14,201?km.\\r\\nFurthermore, the measurement of any coastline is subject to variation depending upon the scale of map used. It is a meaningless statistic without knowing the scale of the map being used and the accuracy of the measurement. A larger map scale and smaller unit of measure will result in more detail being revealed and measured and thus a greater length.[2] And because the resultant length increases exponentially faster than the increase of scale of measurement, there is no such thing as \\"an approximate answer\\" to this question. This is referred to as the coastline paradox. A coastline is fractal-like  which means that it has self-similar properties, similar at every scale  therefore the closer the observer looks, the more detail is revealed, leading to a greater overall length.[5]\\r\\nThe United Kingdom's coastline is more broken than coastlines of many other countries. It has a fractal or Hausdorff dimension or 'wiggliness' of 1.25, which is comparatively high; the Australian coastline for example has a fractal dimension of 1.13, and that of South Africa is 1.02.[6]\\r\\nAs a result of this shape and the number of islands, the coastline of the UK is longer than that of similar sized countries. For example, the coastline of Italy is around 9,226?km in length, France 7,330?km and Spain 7,268?km. Greece, which has a large number of islands similar to the UK, has a coastline of around 15,147?km. This means the UK has a relatively high coast/area ratio.[7]\\r\\nNowhere in the UK is more than 113 kilometres (70?mi) from the coast. It is estimated that around 3 million people (out of 60 million) live on the coast of the UK. The place furthest from the coast is Coton in the Elms in Derbyshire, which is equidistant from Fosdyke Wash in Lincolnshire; White Sands between Neston in Cheshire and Flint, Flintshire in Wales; and Westbury-on-Severn Gloucestershire.[8][9]\\r\\nThere are over 1,000 islands within the UK; about 130 are permanently inhabited according to the 2001 Census. Of the remaining islands, some are used for farming and are occupied occasionally, some are nature reserves with restricted access and some are little more than sea-swept rocks. The main occupied islands and island groups in the UK are as follows:\\r\\nThe Channel Islands (including Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney and Sark) and the Isle of Man are not part of the UK; they are self-governing Crown dependencies therefore their coastlines are not coastlines of the United Kingdom.\\r\\nPeninsulas around the UK coast include:\\r\\nBays, sea lochs (loughs) and large estuaries include:\\r\\n Media related to Coasts of the United Kingdom at Wikimedia Commons","input":"How far is it around the coast of britain?"},{"output":"a cross-breed dog, which is obtained by breeding a Golden Retriever with a Poodle","context":"The Goldendoodle is a cross-breed dog, which is obtained by breeding a Golden Retriever with a Poodle. The name, which alters \\"poodle\\" to \\"doodle\\" by analogy to \\"Labradoodle\\", was coined in 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Goldendoodle was first bred by Monica Dickens in 1969.[1] Popularity for the goldendoodle grew in the 1990s[2] when breeders in North America and Australia began crossing Golden Retrievers with Standard Poodles.[3] The original purpose of the cross was to develop guide dogs suitable for visually impaired individuals with allergies. Poodles are considered to be hypoallergenic. Their coats do not shed, which reduces dander.[4] Dander is a protein that sheds from the skin and causes allergies in humans.\\r\\nThe goldendoodle is referred to as a designer dog. The Encyclop?dia Britannica traces the term \\"designer dog\\" to the late 20th century when breeders began to cross purebred Poodles with other purebred breeds in order to obtain a dog with the poodle's non-shedding coat, along with various desirable characteristics from other breeds.[5] In regards to goldendoodles, golden retrievers are considered a great family dog,[6] which is why they have been used to cross breed with poodles.\\r\\nAlthough not all goldendoodles exhibit the hypoallergenic coat type of the Standard Poodle, most goldendoodles do have a low to non-shedding coat.[3] While the degree of shedding varies from dog to dog, overall, the goldendoodle exhibits less shedding than other dogs. Grooming requirements include regular brushing, occasional bathing and some fur trimming. Due to minimal shedding, Goldendoodles tend to have less dander, reducing allergic responses.[7]\\r\\nThere are three main coat types. There is the straight coat, which is flat and resembles more of a golden retriever coat. The wavy coat type is a mixture of a poodle's curls, and a golden retriever's straighter coat. The last coat type is curly, which tends to look more like the poodle coat. A goldendoodle's size is generally somewhere between that of its poodle parent and golden retriever parent. The ranges of size include standard, medium, and miniature (if the poodle parent was miniature). Upon reaching adulthood, a standard goldendoodle will often weigh 60 to 100 pounds. A medium goldendoodle will weigh between 30 and 45 pounds and a miniature goldendoodle will weigh approximately 15 to 30 pounds. The standard in height at the shoulder for a male goldendoodle is about 24-26 inches. For females, it is 22-23 inches. Often, taller goldendoodles inherit more from the golden retriever and will weigh substantially more. It is very common for the goldendoodle to inherit the \\"golden retriever bump\\" on top of his/her head.[3][8] Common coat colors include white, cream, apricot, gold, red, and sometimes gray and black (also called phantom). Goldendoodles may also be black or a light sandy brown.[9] They are classified into types according to the breed of its parents. An F1 goldendoodle is the offspring of a poodle mated with a golden retriever. An F1B goldendoodle is the offspring of a poodle with an F1 goldendoodle.[10] An F2 goldendoodle is the offspring of an F1 and another F1 goldendoodle, and an F2B goldendoodle is the offspring of an F1 and an F1B goldendoodles.\\r\\nSome breeders prefer to restrict breeding to the first generation (F1) and first generation cross-back (F1B).[7] This is done in an attempt to maximize genetic diversity and avoid the inherited health problems that have plagued many dog breeds.[10]\\r\\nEstablished breed associations such as the AKC, the UKC, and the CKC, do not recognize this hybrid, nor any other designer cross, as a breed. However, some major kennel clubs do accept registration of crossbreed and mixed-breed dogs for performance events such as agility and obedience such as the Continental Kennel Club. The Continental Kennel Club will accept and grant a pedigree on a goldendoodle as long as the parents have registration.\\r\\nWith knowledgeable breeding, the goldendoodle tends to be a rather healthy dog, but Poodles and Golden Retrievers are both susceptible to hip dysplasia. Therefore, an OFA or PennHIP exam is highly recommended to check for this problem before dogs are bred.\\r\\nBoth breeds can also suffer from a number of inheritable eye disorders, so it is important that annual CERF (Canine Eye Registration Foundation) exams are performed before breeding.[citation needed] The goldendoodle inherits the ears of Golden Retrievers; because their ears hang and do not allow water to drain, they are prone to ear infections and yeast infections in the ears from swimming. Von Willebrands disease (vWD), a bleeding disorder, can also be found in the Poodle and should be screened through DNA tests before breeding.\\r\\nSince 2005, Goldendoodles have been used as pets, agility dogs, guide dogs, therapy dogs, diabetic dogs, search dogs and rescue dogs, as they have inherited the poodle's intelligence and the golden retriever's ease of training.[11] Goldendoodles have also become increasingly used as domestic pets due to their affection towards families, as well as their friendliness and patience with children and strangers.[12]","input":"What kind of dog is a golden doodle?"},{"output":"a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web","context":"A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) that may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content.[1] Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources.\\r\\nAlthough browsers are primarily intended to use the World Wide Web, they can also be used to access information provided by web servers in private networks or files in file systems.\\r\\nThe most popular web browsers are Chrome, Edge (preceded by Internet Explorer),[2][3][4] Safari, Opera and Firefox.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first web browser was invented in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the Web's continued development, and is also the founder of the World Wide Web Foundation. His browser was called WorldWideWeb and later renamed Nexus.[5]\\r\\nIn 1991 after the release of WorldWideWeb, Nicola Pellow developed the first cross-platform web browser, Line Mode Browser, which is credited for making the internet accessible to consumers for the first time.[6]\\r\\nThe first commonly available web browser with a graphical user interface was Erwise. The development of Erwise was initiated by Robert Cailliau.\\r\\nIn 1993, browser software was further innovated by Marc Andreessen with the release of Mosaic, \\"the world's first popular browser\\",[7] which made the World Wide Web system easy to use and more accessible to the average person. Andreesen's browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s.[7] The introduction of Mosaic in 1993 ÿ one of the first graphical web browsers ÿ led to an explosion in web use. Andreessen, the leader of the Mosaic team at National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), soon started his own company, named Netscape, and released the Mosaic-influenced Netscape Navigator in 1994, which quickly became the world's most popular browser, accounting for 90% of all web use at its peak (see usage share of web browsers).\\r\\nMicrosoft responded with its Internet Explorer in 1995, also heavily influenced by Mosaic, initiating the industry's first browser war. Bundled with Windows, Internet Explorer gained dominance in the web browser market; Internet Explorer usage share peaked at over 95% by 2002.[8]\\r\\nOpera debuted in 1996; it has never achieved widespread use, having less than 2% browser usage share as of February 2012 according to Net Applications.[10] Its Mini version has an additive share, in April 2011 amounting to 1.1% of overall browser use, but focused on the fast-growing mobile phone web browser market, being preinstalled on over 40 million phones. It is also available on several other embedded systems, including Nintendo's Wii video game console.\\r\\nIn 1998, Netscape launched what was to become the Mozilla Foundation in an attempt to produce a competitive browser using the open source software model. That browser would eventually evolve into Firefox, which developed a respectable following while still in the beta stage of development; shortly after the release of Firefox 1.0 in late 2004, Firefox (all versions) accounted for 7% of browser use.[8] As of August 2011, Firefox has a 28% usage share.[10]\\r\\nApple's Safari had its first beta release in January 2003; as of April 2011, it had a dominant share of Apple-based web browsing, accounting for just over 7% of the entire browser market.[10]\\r\\nThe most recent major entrant to the browser market is Chrome, first released in September 2008. Chrome's take-up has increased significantly year by year, by doubling its usage share from 8% to 16% by August 2011. This increase seems largely to be at the expense of Internet Explorer, whose share has tended to decrease from month to month.[11] In December 2011, Chrome overtook Internet Explorer 8 as the most widely used web browser but still had lower usage than all versions of Internet Explorer combined.[12] Chrome's user-base continued to grow and in May 2012, Chrome's usage passed the usage of all versions of Internet Explorer combined.[13] By April 2014, Chrome's usage had hit 45%.[14]\\r\\nInternet Explorer was deprecated in Windows 10, with Microsoft Edge replacing it as the default web browser.[15]\\r\\nThe ways that web browser makers fund their development costs has changed over time. The first web browser, WorldWideWeb, was a research project.\\r\\nIn addition to being freeware, Netscape Navigator and Opera were also sold commercially.\\r\\nInternet Explorer, on the other hand, was bundled free with the Windows operating system (and was also downloadable free), and therefore it was funded partly by the sales of Windows to computer manufacturers and direct to users. Internet Explorer also used to be available for the Mac. It is likely that releasing IE for the Mac was part of Microsoft's overall strategy to fight threats to its quasi-monopoly platform dominance ÿ threats such as web standards and Java ÿ by making some web developers, or at least their managers, assume that there was \\"no need\\" to develop for anything other than Internet Explorer. In this respect, IE may have contributed to Windows and Microsoft applications sales in another way, through \\"lock-in\\" to Microsoft's browser.\\r\\nIn January 2009, the European Commission announced it would investigate the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows operating systems from Microsoft, saying \\"Microsoft's tying of Internet Explorer to the Windows operating system harms competition between web browsers, undermines product innovation and ultimately reduces consumer choice.\\" Microsoft Corp v Commission[16][17]\\r\\nSafari and Mobile Safari were likewise always included with macOS and iOS respectively, so, similarly, they were originally funded by sales of Apple computers and mobile devices, and formed part of the overall Apple experience to customers.\\r\\nSome commercial web browsers are paid by search engine companies to make their engine default, or to include them as another option. For example, Yahoo! pays Mozilla, the maker of Firefox, to make Yahoo! Search the default search engine in Firefox. Mozilla makes enough money from this deal that it does not need to charge users for Firefox. By virtue of common ownership, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome default to their respective vendors' own search engines, Bing and Google Search, and may integrate with other platforms offered by the vendor. This encourages the use of their first-party services, which in turn, exposes users to advertising that can be used as a source of revenue.\\r\\nMany less-well-known free software browsers, such as Konqueror, were hardly funded at all and were developed mostly by volunteers free of charge.\\r\\nThe primary purpose of a web browser is to bring information resources to the user (\\"retrieval\\" or \\"fetching\\"), allowing them to view the information (\\"display\\", \\"rendering\\"), and then access other information (\\"navigation\\", \\"following links\\").\\r\\nThis process begins when the user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), for example http://en.wikipedia.org/, into the browser. The prefix of the URL, the Uniform Resource Identifier or URI, determines how the URL will be interpreted. The most commonly used kind of URI starts with http: and identifies a resource to be retrieved over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).[18] Many browsers also support a variety of other prefixes, such as https: for HTTPS, ftp: for the File Transfer Protocol, and file: for local files. Prefixes that the web browser cannot directly handle are often handed off to another application entirely. For example, mailto: URIs are usually passed to the user's default e-mail application, and news: URIs are passed to the user's default newsgroup reader.\\r\\nIn the case of http, https, file, and others, once the resource has been retrieved the web browser will display it. HTML and associated content (image files, formatting information such as CSS, etc.) is passed to the browser's layout engine to be transformed from markup to an interactive document, a process known as \\"rendering\\". Aside from HTML, web browsers can generally display any kind of content that can be part of a web page. Most browsers can display images, audio, video, and XML files, and often have plug-ins to support Flash applications and Java applets. Upon encountering a file of an unsupported type or a file that is set up to be downloaded rather than displayed, the browser prompts the user to save the file to disk.\\r\\nInformation resources may contain hyperlinks to other information resources. Each link contains the URI of a resource to go to. When a link is clicked, the browser navigates to the resource indicated by the link's target URI, and the process of bringing content to the user begins again.\\r\\nAvailable web browsers range in features from minimal, text-based user interfaces with bare-bones support for HTML to rich user interfaces supporting a wide variety of file formats and protocols. Browsers which include additional components to support e-mail, Usenet news, and Internet Relay Chat (IRC), are sometimes referred to as \\"Internet suites\\" rather than merely \\"web browsers\\".[20][21][22]\\r\\nAll major web browsers allow the user to open multiple information resources at the same time, either in different browser windows or in different tabs of the same window. Major browsers also include pop-up blockers to prevent unwanted windows from \\"popping up\\" without the user's consent.[23][24][25][26]\\r\\nMost web browsers can display a list of web pages that the user has bookmarked so that the user can quickly return to them. Bookmarks are also called \\"Favorites\\" in Internet Explorer. In addition, all major web browsers have some form of built-in web feed aggregator. In Firefox, web feeds are formatted as \\"live bookmarks\\" and behave like a folder of bookmarks corresponding to recent entries in the feed.[27] In Opera, a more traditional feed reader is included which stores and displays the contents of the feed.[28]\\r\\nFurthermore, most browsers can be extended via plug-ins, downloadable components that provide additional features.\\r\\nMost major web browsers have these user interface elements in common:[29]\\r\\nMajor browsers also possess incremental find features to search within a web page.\\r\\nMost browsers support HTTP Secure and offer quick and easy ways to delete personally identifiable information such as the web cache, download history, form and search history, cookies, and browsing history. For a comparison of the current security vulnerabilities of browsers, see comparison of web browsers.\\r\\nEarly web browsers supported only a very simple version of HTML. The rapid development of proprietary web browsers led to the development of non-standard dialects of HTML, leading to problems with interoperability. Modern web browsers support a combination of standards-based and de facto HTML and XHTML, which should be rendered in the same way by all browsers.\\r\\nA browser extension is a computer program that extends the functionality of a web browser. Every major web browser supports the development of browser extensions.\\r\\nWeb browsers consist of a user interface, layout engine, rendering engine, JavaScript interpreter, UI backend, networking component and data persistence component. These components achieve different functionalities of a web browser and together provide all capabilities of a web browser.[30]\\r\\n Media related to Web browsers at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is a web browser on a computer?"},{"output":"1 April 1957","context":"\\r\\nDecimalisation is the process of converting a currency from its previous non-decimal denominations to a decimal system (i.e., a system based on one basic unit of currency and one or more sub-units, such that the number of sub-units in one basic unit is a power of 10, most commonly 100).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only[citation needed] current non-decimal currencies are the Malagasy ariary (equal to five iraimbilanja) and the Mauritanian ouguiya (equal to five khoums), though in practice both just have one currency unit and no sub-unit because khoums and iraimbilanja are no longer minted.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDecimal currencies have sub-units based on a factor of 10. There are most commonly 100 sub-units to the base currency unit, but currencies based on 1,000 sub-units also exist, especially in Arab countries. The Chinese Yuan is widely considered to be the first to use decimal currency[when?].[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example:\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, non-decimal currencies were much more common: such as the British pound sterling before decimalisation in 1971.  Until 1971, the pound sterling had sub-units of account of shillings (20 to a pound) and pence (12 to a shilling). Like other currencies, it also had coins with other names (ha'pence, guineas, and crowns); and in addition, until 1960 the penny was divided into 4 farthings. There were nineteen different fractions of a pound of a whole number of pence. For example, a third, quarter, fifth and sixth of a pound were respectively 80, 60, 48, and 40 pence, normally written as shillings and pence: 6/8, 5/-, 4/-, and 3/4. There were eight additional fractions which were a whole number of farthings (for example, one sixty-fourth of a pound was three pence three farthings, written ?3?3?4d).\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia converted to a decimal currency under Tsar Peter the Great in 1704, with the ruble being equal to 100 kopeks, thus making the Russian ruble the world's first decimal currency.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance introduced the franc in 1795 to replace the livre tournois,[3] abolished during the French Revolution. France introduced decimalisation in a number of countries that it occupied during the Napoleonic period.\\r\\n\\r\\nDutch guilder decimalised in 1817 (became equal to 100 centen instead of 20 stuivers = 160 duits = 320 penningen), with last pre-decimal coins withdrawn from circulation in 1848.\\r\\n\\r\\nSweden introduced decimal currency in 1855.

In 1971, a new penny would have been worth 9.6 farthings (making a farthing slightly more than 0.104 new pence).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1784, Thomas Jefferson proposed a decimal currency system based on the Spanish dollar, with coins for 10 dollars, 1 dollar, ?1?10 dollar, and ?1?100 dollar; possibly supplemented by a half-dollar, \\"double tenth\\", and \\"five copper piece\\".  One argument he advanced in favour of this system was that the ?1?100-dollar coin would be similar in value to existing copper coins:[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial currency of the United States was of decimal denomination from the outset of home minted currency in 1792 with the dollar being equal to 100 cents, but other currencies were also accepted for some time afterwards. For example, the Spanish dollar, a non-decimalized currency, was accepted as official currency in the United States alongside the U.S. dollar until 1857.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDecimalisation in Canada was complicated by the different jurisdictions before Confederation in 1867.  In 1841, the united Province of Canada's Governor General, Lord Sydenham, argued for establishment of a bank that would issue dollar currency (the Canadian dollar).  Francis Hincks, who would become the Province of Canada's Prime Minister in 1851, favoured the plan. Ultimately the provincial assembly rejected the proposal.[6] In June 1851, the Canadian legislature passed a law requiring provincial accounts to be kept decimalised as dollars and cents. The establishment of a central bank was not touched upon in the 1851 legislation. The British government delayed the implementation of the currency change on a technicality, wishing to distinguish the Canadian currency from the United States' currency by referencing the units as \\"Royals\\" rather than \\"Dollars\\".[7] The British delay was overcome by the Currency Act of 1 August 1854. In 1858, coins denominated in cents and imprinted with \\"Canada\\" were issued for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecimalisation occurred in:[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonial elite, the main advocates of decimalisation, based their case on two main arguments:[9]  The first was for facilitation of trade and economic ties with the United States, the colonies' largest trading partner; the second was to simplify calculations and reduce accounting errors.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mexican peso was formally decimalised in the 1860s with the introduction of coins denominated in centavos; however, the currency did not fully decimalise in practice immediately and pre-decimal reales were issued until 1897.\\r\\n\\r\\nBermuda decimalised in 1970, by introducing the  Bermudian dollar equal to 8 shillings 4 pence (100 pence, effectively equal to the US dollar under the Bretton Woods system).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rand was introduced on 14 February 1961. A Decimal Coinage Commission had been set up in 1956 to consider a move away from the denominations of pounds, shillings and pence, submitting its recommendation on 8 August 1958.[11] It replaced the South African pound as legal tender, at the rate of 2 rand = 1 pound or 10 shillings to the rand.  Australia, New Zealand and Rhodesia also chose ten shillings as the base unit of their new currency.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia decimalised on 14 February 1966, with the new Australian dollar equivalent to ten shillings or half an Australian pound in the previous currency. Since a shilling became equal to ten cents, the Australian cent was equal to 1.2 Australian pence, although they were usually exchanged on a 1:1 basis during the brief period when both were circulating.[citation needed] A television campaign containing a memorable jingle, sung to the tune of Click Go the Shears, was used to help the public to understand the changes.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Zealand decimalised on 10 July 1967, with the New Zealand dollar replacing the New Zealand pound. The conversion rates were the same as Australia's10c to one shilling, one dollar to 10 shillings, and two dollars to one pound. Confusion was expected with twelve pence becoming ten cents, such as people expecting four cents' change from paying ten cents/one shilling for an item costing eight cents. To help avoid this, the Decimal Currency Board recommended on inter-currency transactions (e.g., paying 4c with Ssd coins, or paying 4d with decimal coins) to pay to the next highest five cents or sixpence to get the correct change.\\r\\n\\r\\nSri Lanka (known as Ceylon at the time) decimalised in 1869.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia changed from the rupee, anna, pie system to decimal currency on 1 April 1957.\\r\\n\\r\\nYemen Arab Republic introduced coinage system of 1 North Yemeni rial=100 fils in 1974, to replace former system of 1 rial = 40 buqsha = 80 halala = 160 zalat.

However, they were taken out of circulation as of December 31, 1953, and all transactions are now conducted in round amounts of 1 yen or greater.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn India, Pakistan, and other places where a system of 1 rupee = 16 annas = 64 paise = 192 pies was used, the decimalisation process defines 1 new paisa = ?1?100 rupee.

(During its first season, it ran from 9 to 10 p.m. E.T.) Virtually every type of entertainment appeared on the show; classical musicians, opera singers, popular recording artists, songwriters, comedians, ballet dancers, dramatic actors performing monologues from plays, and circus acts were regularly featured. The format was essentially the same as vaudeville, and although vaudeville had undergone a slow demise for a generation, Sullivan presented many ex-vaudevillians on his show.[5]\\r\\nOriginally co-created and produced by Marlo Lewis, the show was first titled Toast of the Town, but was widely referred to as The Ed Sullivan Show for years before September 25, 1955, when that became its official name. In the show's June 20, 1948 debut, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis performed along with singer Monica Lewis and Broadway composers Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II previewing the score to their then-new show South Pacific, which opened on Broadway in 1949.\\r\\nFrom 1948 through 1962, the program's primary sponsor was the Lincoln-Mercury Division of the Ford Motor Company; Sullivan read many commercials for Mercury vehicles live on the air during this period.\\r\\nThe Ed Sullivan Show was originally broadcast via live television from CBS-TV studio 51, the Maxine Elliott Theatre, at Broadway and 39th St. before moving to its permanent home at CBS-TV Studio 50 in New York City (1697 Broadway, at 53rd Street), which was renamed The Ed Sullivan Theater[6] on the occasion of the program's 20th anniversary in June 1968. The last original Sullivan show telecast (#1068) was on March 28, 1971, with guests Melanie, Joanna Simon, Danny Davis and the Nashville Brass, and Sandler and Young. Repeats were scheduled through June 6, 1971.\\r\\nAlong with the new talent Sullivan booked each week, he also had recurring characters appear many times a season, such as his \\"Little Italian Mouse\\" puppet sidekick Topo Gigio, who debuted December 9, 1962,[7] and ventriloquist Se?or Wences debuted December 31, 1950.[8] While most of the episodes aired live from New York City, the show also aired live on occasion from other nations, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan. For many years, Ed Sullivan was a national event each Sunday evening, and was the first exposure for foreign performers to the American public. On the occasion of the show's tenth anniversary telecast, Sullivan commented on how the show had changed during a June 1958 interview syndicated by the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA):\\r\\nThe chief difference is mostly one of pace. In those days, we had maybe six acts. Now we have 11 or 12. Then, each of our acts would do a leisurely ten minutes or so. Now they do two or three minutes. And in those early days I talked too much. Watching these kines I cringe. I look up at me talking away and I say \\"You fool! Keep quiet!\\" But I just keep on talking. I've learned how to keep my mouth shut.\\r\\nThe show enjoyed phenomenal popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. As had occurred with the annual telecasts of The Wizard of Oz in the 1960s and '70s, the family ritual of gathering around the television set to watch Ed Sullivan became almost a U.S. cultural universal. He was regarded as a kingmaker, and performers considered an appearance on his program as a guarantee of stardom, although this sometimes did not turn out to be the case. The show's iconic status is illustrated by the song \\"Hymn for a Sunday Evening\\" from the 1960 musical Bye Bye Birdie. In the song, a family of viewers expresses their regard for the program in worshipful tones.\\r\\nIn September 1965, CBS started televising the program in compatible color, as all three major networks began to switch to 100 percent color prime time schedules. CBS had once backed its own color system, developed by Peter Goldmark, and resisted using RCA's compatible process until 1954. At that time, it built its first New York City color TV studio, Studio 72, in a former RKO movie theater at 2248 Broadway (81st Street). One Ed Sullivan Show was broadcast on August 22, 1954, from the new studio, but it was mostly used for one-time-only specials such as Rodgers and Hammerstein's March 31, 1957 Cinderella. (The facility was later acquired by TeleTape Productions and notably became the first studio where the PBS children's program Sesame Street was produced.) CBS Studio 72 was demolished in 1986 and replaced by an apartment house. CBS Studio 50 was finally \\"colorized\\" in 1965. The 1965ÿ66 season premiere starred the Beatles in an episode airing on September 12, which was the last episode to air in black and white. This occurred because the episode was taped at the Beatles' convenience on August 14, the eve of their Shea Stadium performance and a two-week tour of North America, slightly before the program was ready for color transmission.\\r\\nIn the late 1960s, Sullivan remarked that his program was waning as the decade went on. He realized that to keep viewers, the best and brightest in entertainment had to be seen, or else the viewers were going to keep on changing the channel. Along with declining viewership, Ed Sullivan attracted a higher median age for the average viewer (which most sponsors found undesirable) as the seasons went on. These two factors were the reason the show was canceled by CBS as part of a mass cancellation of advertiser-averse programming after the end of the 1970ÿ1971 season. Because there was no notice of cancellation, Sullivan's landmark program ended without a proper finale. Sullivan would produce one-off specials for CBS until his death in 1974.\\r\\nIn 1990, television documentary producer Andrew Solt formed SOFA Entertainment, Inc. and purchased the exclusive rights to the complete library of The Ed Sullivan Show from Ed Sullivan's daughter Elizabeth and her husband Bob Precht.[9][10] The collection consists of 1,087 hours of kinescopes and videotapes broadcast by CBS on Sunday nights from 1948 to 1971.\\r\\nSince acquiring the rights to The Ed Sullivan Show library, SOFA Entertainment has catalogued, organized and cleared performance rights for the original shows. Starting in 1991, SOFA Entertainment has re-introduced The Ed Sullivan Show to the American public by producing numerous network specials, half-hour series (airing on TV Land, PBS, VH1 and Decades), and home video compilations.[11] Some of these compilations include The 4 Complete Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Beatles, All 6 Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Rolling Stones, Elvis: The Ed Sullivan Shows, Motown Gold from the Ed Sullivan Show, Ed Sullivan's Rock 'n Roll Classics, and 115 half-hour The Best of The Ed Sullivan Show specials, among others.[12][13][14][15] The legendary performances of this show are also available as video and audio downloads and an app on iTunes.\\"[16]\\r\\nIn the early years of television, both CBS and NBC networks had their own symphony orchestras. NBC's was conducted by Arturo Toscanini and CBS's by Alfredo Antonini. The Ed Sullivan Show was basically a musical variety show, and thus members of the CBS orchestra were folded into the Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra, conducted by Ray Bloch. During the early days of television, the demands on studio musicians were many-tiered. They needed to be proficient in all genres of music, from classical, to jazz and to rock and roll. The Ed Sullivan Show would regularly feature singers from the Metropolitan Opera and the staff orchestra would accompany divas such as Eileen Farrell, Maria Callas or Joan Sutherland. The musicians needed to be prepared to switch gears for Ella Fitzgerald, Diahann Carroll or Sammy Davis, Jr. and then onto The Jackson Five, Stevie Wonder or Tom Jones or Itzhak Perlman. They also needed to perform with some of the greatest dancers and ballerinas of the time, from Gregory Hines, Juliet Prowse or Margo Fonteyn to the Peter Genarro dancers. Few musicians are capable of crossing over from one genre to another. However, each member of the Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra was a specialist and more than capable of covering the complete spectrum of music.\\r\\nMusic Hall Of Fame inductee Gordon Chris Griffin (formerly with the trumpet section of Harry James, Ziggy Elman and Chris Griffin of The Benny Goodman Band) was Ray Bloch's lead trumpet player for the many radio and television shows that he conducted including the Ed Sullivan Show. \\"Chris\\" remained the lead trumpet player with The Ed Sullivan show from the first show in 1948 to the last show in 1971. Unlike \\"The Tonight Show\\" of NBC, which celebrated the notoriety of their musicians in Skitch Henderson's or Doc Severinsen's Band, the CBS producers of The Ed Sullivan show decided to hide their famed musicians behind a curtain. Occasionally, CBS would broadcast \\"Specials\\" and they would call upon the orchestra to perform. When Robert Kennedy was assassinated, music was hastily composed for the orchestra in a special tribute that also featured Bill Evans, who had recently composed an Elegy To His Father. In 1971, The Ed Sullivan Show came to an abrupt end. The CBS board of directors chose this occasion to terminate any and all contracts with their musicians as they were unceremoniously shown the door.\\r\\nThe Ed Sullivan Show is especially known to the World War II and baby boomer generations for introducing acts and airing breakthrough performances by popular 1950s and 1960s musicians such as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, The Supremes, The Dave Clark Five, The Animals, The Beach Boys, The Jackson 5, Janis Joplin, The Rolling Stones, The Mamas & the Papas, The Lovin' Spoonful, Herman's Hermits, The Doors, and The Band. The Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster appeared on the program 67 times, a record for any performer.[17]\\r\\nThe American public's first exposure to Itzhak Perlman was on the show in 1958, when he was just 13. This performance was a breakthrough not only for classical music, but also for Perlman, who rode the waves of admiration that came with performing on the show to new heights of fame and has remained one of the most famous violinists for decades.\\r\\nOn September 9, 1956, Presley made his first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show (after earlier appearances on shows hosted by the Dorsey Brothers, Milton Berle, and Steve Allen), even though Sullivan had previously vowed never to allow Presley on the show.[18] According to biographer Michael David Harris, \\"Sullivan signed Presley when the host was having an intense Sunday-night rivalry with Steve Allen. Allen had the singer on July 1 and trounced Sullivan in the ratings. When asked to comment, the CBS star said that he wouldn't consider presenting Presley before a family audience. Less than two weeks later he changed his mind and signed a contract. The newspapers asked him to explain his reversal. 'What I said then was off the reports I'd heard. I hadn't even seen the guy. Seeing the kinescopes, I don't know what the fuss was all about. For instance, the business about rubbing the thighs. He rubbed one hand on his hip to dry off the perspiration from playing his guitar.' \\"[19]\\r\\nSullivan's reaction to Presley's performance on The Milton Berle Show was, \\"I don't know why everybody picked on Presley, I thought the whole show was dirty and vulgar.\\"[20]\\r\\nElvis mythology states that Sullivan censored Presley by only shooting him from the waist up. Sullivan may have helped create the myth when he told TV Guide, \\"as for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots.\\" In truth Presley's whole body was shown in the first and second shows.[20]\\r\\nAt the time, Presley was filming Love Me Tender, so Sullivan's producer, Marlo Lewis, flew to Los Angeles to supervise the two segments telecast that night from CBS Television City in Hollywood. Sullivan, however, was not able to host his show in New York City because he was recovering from a near fatal automobile accident. Charles Laughton guest-hosted in Sullivan's place. Laughton appeared in front of plaques with gold records and stated, \\"These gold records, four of them... are a tribute to the fact that four of his recordings have sold, each sold, more than a million copies. And this, by the way, is the first time in record-making history that a singer has hit such a mark in such a short time. ... And now, away to Hollywood to meet Elvis Presley.\\"[21]\\r\\nHowever, according to Greil Marcus, Laughton was the main act of Sullivan's show. \\"Presley was the headliner, and a Sullivan headliner normally opened the show, but Sullivan was burying him. Laughton had to make the moment invisible: to act as if nobody was actually waiting for anything. He did it instantly, with complete command, with the sort of television presence that some have and someSteve Allen, or Ed Sullivan himselfdon't.\\"[22]\\r\\nHost Laughton introduced the singer from New York. Once on camera, Elvis cleared his throat and said, \\"Thank you, Mr. Laughton, ladies and gentlemen. Wow\\", and wiped his brow. \\"This is probably the greatest honor I've ever had in my life. Ah. There's not much I can say except, it really makes you feel good. We want to thank you from the bottom of our heart. And now ...\\" \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", which was, after a short introduction by Elvis, followed by \\"Love Me Tender\\".[21] According to Elaine Dundy, Presley sang \\"Love Me Tender\\" \\"straight, subdued and tender ... a very different Elvis from the one on The Steve Allen Show three months before\\".[23]\\r\\nWhen the camera returned to Laughton, he stated, \\"Well, well, well well well. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis Presley. And Mr. Presley, if you are watching this in Hollywood, and I may address myself to you. It has been many a year since any young performer has captured such a wide, and, as we heard tonight, devoted audience.\\"[21]\\r\\nElvis's second set in the show consisted of \\"Ready Teddy\\" and a short on-air comment to Sullivan, \\"Ah, Mr. Sullivan. We know that somewhere out there you are looking in, and, ah, all the boys and myself, and everybody out here, are looking forward to seeing you back on television.\\" Next, Elvis declared, \\"Friends, as a great philosopher once said, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog ...,' \\" as he launched into a short (1:07) version of the song.[21]\\r\\nAccording to Marcus, \\"For the first of his two appearances that night, as a performer Elvis had come on dressed in grandma's nightgown and nightcap.\\" Concerning the singer's second set in the show, the author adds that there were \\"Elvis, Scotty Moore on guitar, Bill Black on stand-up bass, D. J. Fontana on drums, three Jordanaires on their feet, one at a piano. They were shown from behind; the camera pulled all the way back. They went into 'Ready Teddy.' It was Little Richard's most thrilling record\\", however, \\"there was no way Elvis was going to catch him, but he didnt have tothe song is a wave and he rode it. Compared to moments on the Dorsey shows, on the Berle show, it was ice creamElvis's face unthreatening, his legs as if in casts ...\\"[22] When \\"he sang Little Richard's 'Reddy Teddy' and began to move and dance, the camera pulled in, so that the television audience saw him from the waist up only.\\"[24]\\r\\nAlthough Laughton was the main star and there were seven other acts on the show, Elvis was on camera for more than a quarter of the time allotted to all acts.[25] The show was viewed by a record 60 million people which at the time was 82.6 percent of the television audience, and the largest single audience in television history. \\"In the New York Times\\", however, \\"Jack Gould began his review indignantly: Elvis Presley had 'injected movements of his tongue and indulged in wordless singing that were singularly distasteful.' Overstimulating the physical impulses of the teenagers was 'a gross national disservice.'\\"[26]\\r\\nSullivan hosted a second appearance by Presley on October 28, 1956. Elvis performed \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", then \\"Love Me Tender\\". Sullivan then addressed the audience as he stood beside Elvis, who began shaking his legs, eliciting screams from the audience. By the time Sullivan turned his head, Elvis was standing motionless. After Presley left the stage, Sullivan stated, \\"I cant figure this darn thing out. You know. He just does this [Ed shakes his legs] and everybody yells.\\" Elvis appeared a second time in the show and sang \\"Love Me\\". Later on, he sang a nearly four-minute-long version of \\"Hound Dog\\" and was shown in full the entire song.\\r\\nFor the third and final appearance on January 6, 1957, Presley performed a medley of \\"Hound Dog\\", \\"Love Me Tender\\", and \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", followed by a full version of \\"Don't Be Cruel\\". For a second set later in the show he did \\"Too Much\\" and \\"When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again\\". For his last set he sang \\"Peace in the Valley\\". According to Sullivan's co-producer Marlo Lewis, the rumor had it that \\"Elvis has been hanging a small soft-drink bottle from his groin underneath his pants, and when he wiggles his leg it looks as though his pecker reaches down to his knee!\\"[27] It was decided to shoot the singer only from the waist while he performed. Although much has been made of the fact that Elvis was shown only from the waist up, except for the short section of \\"Hound Dog\\", all of the songs on this show were ballads. \\"Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows\\", Greil Marcus says, Elvis \\"stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out. That he did so in front of the Jordanaires, who this night appeared as the four squarest-looking men on the planet, made the performance even more potent.\\"[28]\\r\\nSullivan praised Elvis at the end of the show, saying \\"This is a real decent, fine boy. We've never had a pleasanter experience on our show with a big name than we've had with you.... You're thoroughly all right\\"[29]a remark that could either be interpreted as a \\"ringing endorsement\\" that \\"legitimized the singer with an adult audience\\"[30] or as \\"a somewhat hypocritical statement considering what the CBS censors had just done to his performance on that show.\\"[31] Eyewitness Jerry Schilling writes, \\"The way Elvis looked out at us at that moment, I thought I could see a mix of hurt over the attacks hed been subjected to in the press, and a deep pride in who he was and what he was doing.\\"[32] (According to historian Tim Parrish, Presley's manager, Colonel Parker, \\"had threatened to remove Elvis from the show if Sullivan did not apologize for telling the press that Elvis's 'gyrations' were immoral.\\"[33]) Reflecting on the event in 1969, Presley claimed that Sullivan had expressed a very different opinion off-camera: \\"So they arranged to put me on television. At that particular time there was a lot of controversyyou didn't see people movingout in public. They were gettin' it on in the back rooms, but you didn't see it out in public too much. So there was a lot of controversy ... and I went to the Ed Sullivan Show. They photographed me from the waist up. And Sullivan's standing over there saying, 'Sumbitch.' I said, 'Thank you, Ed, thank you.' I didn't know what he was calling me, at the time.\\"[34]\\r\\nYears later, Sullivan \\"tried to sign the singer up again... He phoned Presley's manager, Col. Tom Parker, and asked about a price. Parker came up with a list of instructions and conditions and after hearing the demands Sullivan said, 'Give Elvis my bestand my sympathy,' and he hung up.\\"[19] The singer never again appeared in Sullivan's show, although in February 1964 at the start of the first of three broadcasts featuring the Beatles (see below), Sullivan announced that a telegram had been received from Presley and Parker wishing the British group luck.\\r\\nIn late 1963, Sullivan and his entourage happened also to be passing through Heathrow and witnessed how The Beatles' fans greeted the group on their return from Stockholm, where they had performed a television show as warmup band to local stars Suzie and Lill Babs. Sullivan was intrigued, telling his entourage it was the same thing as Elvis all over again. He initially offered Beatles manager Brian Epstein top dollar for a single show but the Beatles manager had a better idea  he wanted exposure for his clients: the Beatles would instead appear three times on the show, at bottom dollar, but receive top billing and two spots (opening and closing) on each show.[35]\\r\\nThe Beatles appeared on three consecutive Sundays in February 1964 to great anticipation and fanfare as \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" had swiftly risen to No. 1 in the charts. Their first appearance on February 9 is considered a milestone in American pop culture and the beginning of the British Invasion in music. The broadcast drew an estimated 73 million viewers, at the time a record for US television. The Beatles followed Ed's show opening intro, performing \\"All My Loving\\"; \\"Till There Was You\\", which featured the names of the group members superimposed on closeup shots, including the famous \\"SORRY GIRLS, HE'S MARRIED\\" caption on John Lennon; and \\"She Loves You\\". The act that followed Beatles in the broadcast, magician Fred Kaps, was pre-recorded in order to allow time for an elaborate set change.[36] The group returned later in the program to perform \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" and \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\".\\r\\nThe following week's show was broadcast from Miami Beach where Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Clay) was in training for his first title bout with Sonny Liston. The occasion was used by both camps for publicity. On the evening of the television show (February 16) a crush of people nearly prevented the band from making it onstage. A wedge of policemen were needed and the band began playing \\"She Loves You\\" only seconds after reaching their instruments. They continued with \\"This Boy\\", and \\"All My Loving\\" and returned later to close the show with \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", \\"From Me to You\\" and \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\".\\r\\nThey were shown on tape February 23 (this appearance had been taped earlier in the day on February 9 before their first live appearance). They followed Ed's intro with \\"Twist and Shout\\" and \\"Please Please Me\\" and closed the show once again with \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\".\\r\\nThe Beatles appeared live for the final time on August 14, 1965. The show was broadcast September 12, 1965, and earned Sullivan a 60-percent share of the nighttime audience for one of the appearances. This time they followed three acts before coming out to perform \\"I Feel Fine\\", \\"I'm Down\\", and \\"Act Naturally\\" and then closed the show with \\"Ticket to Ride\\", \\"Yesterday\\", and \\"Help!\\" Although this was their final live appearance on the show, the group would, for several years, provide filmed promotional clips of songs to air exclusively on Sullivan's program such as the 1966 and 1967 clips of \\"Paperback Writer\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\".\\r\\nAlthough the appearances by The Beatles, Elvis and The Supremes are considered the most famous rock and roll performances on Ed Sullivan, several months before Elvis debuted, Sullivan invited Bill Haley & His Comets to perform their then-current hit \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" in early August 1955. This was later recognized by CBS and others (including music historian Jim Dawson in his book on \\"Rock Around the Clock\\") as the first performance of a rock and roll song on a national television program.\\r\\nWatkins was born in?New Brunswick, New Jersey?in 1938. He was of African, Indian and Spanish heritage.?When his mother gave birth to him, she was only fourteen years old and Watkins was raised by his grandmother. He studied microbiology at?Rutgers University?and also trained as a boxer. His operatically trained and signature booming voice took him to Europe where he became so popular that he was invited to entertain at the?Royal Command Performance?for the Queen of the United Kingdom.?The Times?called him the best entertainer on earth. In?South Africa?he received two gold albums and was so celebrated that a public parade was held in his honor ÿ an unprecedented reception for a black entertainer at the height of?Apartheid. He appeared on?The Ed Sullivan Show?in 1961 while promoting his album \\"The Big, Big Voice of Lovelace Watkins\\", music arranged and conducted by?Ray Ellis. In addition to appearing on?The Ed Sullivan Show, Lovelace also appeared on the?Johnny Carson?and?Mike Douglasshows.\\r\\nThe Supremes were a special act for The Ed Sullivan Show. In addition to 14 appearances,[37] they were a personal favorite of Sullivan, whom he affectionately called \\"The Girls\\".[38] Over the five years they performed on the program, the Supremes performed 15 of their hit singles, and numerous Broadway showtunes and other non-Motown songs. The group featuring the most popular lineup of Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, and Florence Ballard appeared 15 times from December 1964 through May 1967.\\r\\nThe group reappeared on the series in October 1967 as the newly rebilled \\"Diana Ross & the Supremes\\", with Ballard replacement Cindy Birdsong and Ross more prominently featured. The Supremes' final appearance on the show, shortly before it ended, served as the platform to introduce America to Ross's replacement, Jean Terrell, in March 1970.\\r\\nLike The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, there is a DVD of some of their appearances, The Best of The Supremes on the Ed Sullivan Show.\\r\\nIn an era when few opportunities existed for African American performers on national television, Sullivan was a champion of black talent. He launched the careers of many performers by presenting them to a nationwide TV audience and ignored the criticism. In an NEA interview, Sullivan commented:\\r\\nThe show included entertainers such as Frankie Lymon, The Supremes, Marian Anderson, Louis Armstrong, Pearl Bailey, LaVern Baker, Harry Belafonte, James Brown (and The Famous Flames),[40] Cab Calloway, Godfrey Cambridge, Diahann Carroll, Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Bill Cosby, Count Basie, Dorothy Dandridge, Sammy Davis, Jr., Bo Diddley, Duke Ellington, Lola Falana, The 5th Dimension, Ella Fitzgerald, The Four Tops, Dick Gregory, W. C. Handy, Lena Horne, The Jackson 5, Mahalia Jackson, Bill Kenny, George Kirby, Eartha Kitt, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Moms Mabley, Johnny Mathis, The Miracles, Melba Moore, The Platters, Leontyne Price, Richard Pryor, Lou Rawls, Della Reese, Nipsey Russell, Nina Simone, Sly and the Family Stone, The Temptations, Martha and the Vandellas, Ike & Tina Turner, Leslie Uggams, Sarah Vaughan, William Warfield, Dionne Warwick, Dinah Washington, Ethel Waters, Flip Wilson, Jackie Wilson, Nancy Wilson, and Stevie Wonder.\\r\\nBefore his death in a plane crash in December 1967, soul singer Otis Redding had been booked to appear on the show the following year. One telecast included African-American bass-baritone Andrew Frierson singing \\"Ol' Man River\\" from Kern and Hammerstein's Show Boat, a song that, at that time, was usually sung on television by white singers, although it was written for a black character in the musical.\\r\\nHowever, Sullivan featured \\"rockers\\", and gave prominence to black musicians \\"not without censorship\\". For instance, he scheduled Fats Domino \\"at the show's end in case he had to cancel a guest\\". He presented Domino alone at his piano singing as if he were a young Nat 'King' Cole or Fats Waller, as he performed \\"Blueberry Hill\\".[41][42] On March 4, 1962, Sullivan presented Domino and his band, who did \\"Jambalaya\\", Hank Williams' \\"You Win Again\\", and \\"Let the Four Winds Blow\\". All seven of Domino's band members were visible to millions of viewers.[43] On December 1, 1957, Sam Cooke performed a complete version of \\"For Sentimental Reasons\\".[44] Cooke had been cut off four weeks earlier during a live performance of \\"You Send Me\\" as the show's allotted time expired, leading Sullivan to rebook Cooke for the December 1 show.[45]\\r\\nBetween 1966 and 1971, Jim Henson performed some of his Muppet characters on the show. The characters made a total of 25 appearances.\\r\\nHenson's Muppets were introduced on The Ed Sullivan Show on September 18, 1966. Sullivan introduced the characters as \\"Jim, uh?... Newsom's puppets.\\" The act featured a small ball of fur growing into the Rock and Roll Monster (performed by Jim Henson, Jerry Nelson, and Frank Oz) with three heads and six arms lip-syncing to the unreleased song \\"Rock It to Me\\" by The Bruthers. After the act was done, the Rock and Roll Monster shrunk back into the ball of fur which is then eaten by Sour Bird (who was previously used in a commercial for Royal Crown Cola).\\r\\nOver the next few years, Henson's Muppets would make more appearances, with performances including:\\r\\nLater performances by the Muppets include:\\r\\nThe show is also noteworthy for showcasing performances from numerous classic Broadway musicals of the era, often featuring members of the original Broadway casts. These include:\\r\\nMost of these artists performed in the same makeup and costumes that they wore in the shows, often providing the only visual recordings of these legendary performances by the original cast members, since there were no network telecasts of the Tony Awards until 1967. (There are traditionally no Broadway performances on Sunday nights, allowing the actors to perform without impacting the Broadway show.) Many performances have been compiled and released on DVD as The Best of Broadway MusicalsOriginal Cast Performances from The Ed Sullivan Show.\\r\\nIn that same 1958 NEA interview, Sullivan noted his pride about the role that the show had had in improving the public's understanding of mental illness. Sullivan considered his May 17, 1953, telecast to be the single most important episode in the show's first decade. During that show, a salute to the popular Broadway director Joshua Logan, the two men were watching in the wings, and Sullivan asked Logan how he thought the show was doing. According to Sullivan, Logan told him that the show was dreadfully becoming \\"another one of those and-then-I-wrote shows\\"; Sullivan asked him what he should do about it, and Logan volunteered to talk about his experiences in a mental institution.[48]\\r\\nSullivan took him up on the offer, and in retrospect believed that several advances in the treatment of mental illness could be attributed to the resulting publicity, including the repeal of a Pennsylvania law about the treatment of the mentally ill and the granting of funds for the construction of new psychiatric hospitals.\\r\\nOccasionally Sullivan would feature a Hollywood actor introducing a clip from a film in which he or she currently starred. Burt Lancaster made an appearance in 1962, speaking about Robert Stroud, the character he portrayed in Birdman of Alcatraz, and introducing a clip from the film. And although Olivier personally did not appear on the show, in 1966 Sullivan showed a clip from the Laurence Olivier Othello, the film version of which was then currently showing in New York.[49]\\r\\nOn November 20, 1955, African-American rock 'n' roll singer and guitarist Bo Diddley appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, only to infuriate Sullivan (\\"I did two songs and he got mad\\"). Diddley had been asked to sing Tennessee Ernie Ford's hit \\"Sixteen Tons\\", which he agreed. But when he appeared on stage, he forgot his cue and instead sang his #1 R&B hit song that bears his name. Diddley later recalls, \\"Ed Sullivan says to me in plain words: 'You are the first black boyquotethat ever double crossed me!' I was ready to fight, because I was a little young dude off the streets of Chicago, an' him callin' me 'black' in them days was as bad as sayin' 'nigger'. My manager says to me 'That's Mr. Sullivan!' I said: 'I dont give a shit about Mr. Sullivan, [h]e don't talk to me like that!' An' so he told me, he says, 'I'll see that you never work no more in show business. You'll never get another TV show in your life!'\\"[50] Indeed, Diddley seems to have been banned from further appearances, as \\"the guitarist never did appear on The Ed Sullivan Show again.\\"[51]\\r\\nOn January 26, 1958, for their second appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, Buddy Holly and The Crickets were scheduled to perform two songs. Sullivan wanted the band to substitute a different song for their record hit \\"Oh, Boy!\\", which he felt was too raucous. Holly had already told his hometown friends in Texas that he would be singing \\"Oh, Boy!\\" for them, and told Sullivan as much. During the afternoon the Crickets were summoned to rehearsal at short notice, but only Holly was in their dressing room. When asked where the others were, Holly replied, \\"I don't know. No telling.\\" Sullivan then turned to Holly and said \\"I guess The Crickets are not too excited to be on The Ed Sullivan Show\\" to which Holly caustically replied, \\"I hope they're damn more excited than I am.\\"\\r\\nSullivan, already bothered by the choice of songs, was now even angrier. He cut the Crickets' act from two songs to one, and when introducing them mispronounced Holly's name, so it came out vaguely as \\"Hollered\\" or \\"Holland.\\" In addition, Sullivan saw to it that the microphone for Holly's electric guitar was turned off. Holly tried to compensate by singing as loudly as he could, and repeatedly trying to turn up the volume on his guitar. For the instrumental break he cut loose with a dramatic solo, making clear to the audience that the technical fault wasn't his. The band was received so well that Sullivan was forced to invite them back for a third appearance. Holly's response was that Sullivan did not have enough money. Film of the performance survives; photographs taken that day show Sullivan looking angry and Holly smirking and perhaps ignoring Sullivan.\\r\\nOn October 18, 1964, Jackie Mason allegedly gave Sullivan the finger on air. A tape of the incident shows Mason doing his stand-up comedy act and then looking toward Sullivan, commenting that Sullivan was signaling him. Sullivan was reportedly letting Mason know (by pointing two fingers) that he had only two minutes left, as CBS was about to cut away to show a speech by President Lyndon Johnson. Mason began working his own fingers into his act and pointed toward Sullivan with his middle finger slightly separated. After Mason left the stage, the camera then cut to a visibly angry Sullivan. Sullivan argued with Mason backstage, then terminated his contract. Mason denied knowingly giving Sullivan the middle finger, and Mason later claimed that he had never even heard of the gesture at that time. In retaliation, to protect the perceived threat to his career, Mason filed a libel suit at the New York Supreme Court, which he won.[52] Sullivan publicly apologized to Mason when he appeared on the show two years later, in 1966. At that time, Mason opened his monologue by saying, \\"It's a great thrill and a fantastic opportunity to see me in person again,\\" and impersonated Sullivan during his act.[53] Mason later appeared on the show five times: April 23, 1967; Feb. 25, 1968; Nov. 24, 1968; Jul. 22, 1969; and Aug. 31, 1969.\\r\\nBob Dylan was slated to make his first nationwide television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on May 12, 1963, and intended to perform \\"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\\", a song he wrote lampooning the John Birch Society and the red-hunting paranoia associated with it. During the afternoon rehearsal that day, CBS officials told Dylan they had deemed the song unacceptable for broadcast and wanted him to substitute another. \\"No; this is what I want to do,\\" Dylan responded. \\"If I can't play my song, I'd rather not appear on the show.\\" He then left the studio, rather than altering the act.\\r\\nThe Doors were notorious for their appearance on the show. CBS network censors demanded that lead singer Jim Morrison change the lyrics to their hit single \\"Light My Fire\\" by altering the line, \\"Girl, we couldn't get much higher\\", before the band performed the song live on September 17, 1967. However, Morrison sang the original line, and on live television with no delay, CBS was powerless to stop it.[54] They were never invited back to the show. According to Ray Manzarek, the band was told, \\"Mr. Sullivan liked you boys. He wanted you on six more times. ... You'll never do the Sullivan show again.\\" Morrison replied with glee, \\"Hey man, we just did the Sullivan show.\\"[55]at the time, an appearance was a hallmark of success. Manzarek has given differing accounts of what happened. He has said that the band only pretended to agree to change the line but also that Morrison was nervous and simply forgot to change the line. The performance and incident was re-enacted in the 1991 biographical film, The Doors.\\r\\nSullivan apparently felt the damage had been done and relented on bands using the word \\"higher\\". The following year, Sly & the Family Stone sang a medley where Sly repeated the lyric \\"Wanna take you higher!\\"[56]\\r\\nIn contrast, the Rolling Stones were instructed to change the title of their \\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\" single for the band's January 15, 1967, appearance. The band complied, with Mick Jagger and Bill Wyman ostentatiously rolling their eyes heavenward whenever they reached the song's one-night-only, clean refrain, \\"Let's spend some time together\\". Mick Jagger did not wear a jacket on their first appearance on the show (October 25, 1964) and this annoyed Sullivan. They were asked to appear again, but they were asked to wear jackets for their 1965 appearance. The Stones would ultimately play on the Ed Sullivan Show six times.[57]\\r\\nIn contrast, Diana Ross & the Supremes, frequent guests on Sullivan's show, debuted their then-release and eventually controversial #1 hit song \\"Love Child\\" on Sullivan's show, but nothing about its title or its content about a woman in poverty having a child out of wedlock (which was exceptionally taboo to mention on television at the time) seemed to faze Sullivan, the show's producers, or the network.[58]\\r\\nHighlights:\\r\\n9/09/1956: Elvis Presley's first appearance yielding a 82.6 percentage share, the highest in television history for any program up to this date (2015).

Fenfluramine was marketed by American Home Products (later known as Wyeth) as Pondimin, but was shown to cause potentially fatal pulmonary hypertension and heart valve problems, which eventually led to its withdrawal and legal damages of over $13 billion.[1] Phentermine was not shown to have harmful effects.[1]\\r\\nFenfluramine acts as a serotonin releasing agent,[2] phentermine as primarily a norepinephrine releasing agent. Phentermine also induces the release of serotonin and dopamine, although to a far lesser extent than it induces the release of norepinephrine.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFenfluramine as a single drug was first introduced in the 1970s, but was not popular because it only temporarily reduced weight.[1] A 1984 study found a weight loss of 7.5?kg on average in 24 weeks, as compared to 4.4?kg under placebo.[4] It sold modestly until the 1990s, when it was combined with phentermine and heavily marketed.[1] A similar drug, aminorex, had caused severe lung damage and \\"provided reason to worry that similar drugs ... could increase the risk of a rare but often fatal lung disease, pulmonary hypertension.\\"[1] In 1994, Wyeth official Fred Wilson expressed concerns about fenfluramine's labeling containing only four cases of pulmonary hypertension when a total of 41 had been observed, but no action was taken until 1996.[1] In 1995, Wyeth introduced dexfenfluramine (the dextro isomer, marketed as Redux), which it hoped would cause fewer adverse effects. However, the medical officer of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Leo Lutwak, insisted upon a black box warning of pulmonary hypertension risks. After Lutwak refused to approve the drug, the FDA management had someone else sign it and approved the drug with no black box warning for marketing in 1996.[1] European regulators required a major warning of pulmonary hypertension risks.[1]\\r\\nIn 1996, a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) from the Mayo Clinic discussed clinical findings in 24 people who had taken fen-phen. The authors noted that their findings suggested a possible correlation between mitral valve dysfunction and the use of these anorectic agents.[5] Later in 1996, a 30-year-old woman developed heart problems after a month of using it; when she died in February 1997, the Boston Herald devoted a front page article to her.[6] The FDA alerted medical doctors that it had received nine additional reports of the same type, and requested all health care professionals to report any such cases to the agencys MedWatch program, or to their respective pharmaceutical manufacturers. The FDA subsequently received over a hundred additional reports of valvular heart disease in people taking fen-phen, fenfluramine alone or dexfenfluramine alone.[7] The FDA requested that the manufacturers of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine stress the potential risk to the heart in the drugs' labeling and in package inserts. As of 1997, the FDA was continuing to receive reports of valvular heart disease in persons who had taken these drugs. This disease typically involves the aortic and mitral valves.\\r\\nAfter reports of valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension, primarily in women who had been undergoing treatment with fen-phen or (dex)fenfluramine, the FDA requested its withdrawal from the market in September 1997.[7]\\r\\nThe action was based on findings from doctors who had evaluated people taking these two drugs with echocardiograms, a procedure that can test the functioning of heart valves. The findings indicated that approximately 30 percent of people who had taken the combination up to 24 months had abnormal echocardiograms, even though they had no symptoms. This percentage of abnormal test results was much higher than would be expected from a comparatively sized sample of the population who had not been exposed to either fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine.[5][8] Follow up studies showed that for people who took the combination for 3 months or less, the rate of heart valve complications was less than 3%.[8]\\r\\nUpon the release of the information regarding fen-phen's cardiac risks, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America formed a large trial lawyer group to seek damages from American Home Products, the distributor of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine.[9]\\r\\nFen-phen is no longer widely available. In April 2005, American Lawyer magazine ran a cover story on the wave of fen-phen litigation, reporting that more than 50,000 product liability lawsuits had been filed by alleged fen-phen victims. Estimates of total liability ran as high as $14 billion. As of February 2005, Wyeth was still in negotiations with injured parties, offering settlements of $5,000 to $200,000 to some of those who had sued, and stating they might offer more to those who were most seriously injured.[10] One plaintiff's attorney claimed that \\"the payments [were] not going to be large enough to cover medical expenses.\\"[11] Thousands of injured persons rejected these offers.[10] At the time, Wyeth announced it has set aside $21.1 billion (U.S.) to cover the cost of the lawsuits.[10]\\r\\nIn 1984, researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center reported that they had performed a double-blind, controlled clinical trial comparing phentermine alone, fenfluramine alone, a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine, and placebo, for weight loss in humans. Weight loss in those receiving the fen-phen combination was significantly greater (8.4I1.1?kg) than in those receiving placebo (4.4I0.9?kg) and equivalent to that of those receiving fenfluramine (7.5I1.2?kg) or phentermine alone (10.0I1.2?kg). This amounts to an additional weight loss of 4I2?kg over the course of 24 weeks. Adverse effects were less frequent with the combination regimen than with the other active (non-placebo) treatments. The authors felt that combining fenfluramine and phentermine capitalized on their pharmacodynamic differences, resulting in equivalent weight loss, fewer adverse effects, and better appetite control.[4]\\r\\nThe term fen-phen was coined in 1994 when Pietr Hitzig and Richard B. Rothman reported that this combination could presumptively remit alcohol and cocaine craving. The authors suggested that other combined dopamine and serotonin agonists or precursors might share this therapeutic potential.[12][13] Subsequent experiments in rats supported these preliminary reports.[14][15] In 2006 it was confirmed that the combination of phentermine and the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), in place of fenfluramine, significantly decreased alcohol withdrawal seizures in rats.[16]\\r\\nIntramural National Institutes of Health (NIH) double-blind protocols to demonstrate the efficacy of fen-phen in alcohol and cocaine addiction were designed,[17] but never performed.\\r\\nThe findings on fen-phen, specifically fenfluramine, causing valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension prompted a renewed interest in the deleterious effects of systemic serotonin. It had already been known for decades that two of the major side-effects of the carcinoid syndrome, in which excessive serotonin is produced endogenously, are valvular disease and pulmonary hypertension. Several centers were able to note a relationship to an excessive activation of the serotonin receptor subtype 5-HT2B.[18][19]","input":"When was fen phen taken off the market?"},{"output":"Salman","context":"The King of Saudi Arabia is Saudi Arabia's head of state and absolute monarch (i.e. head of government).

They comprise the First Nations,[3] Inuit[4] and Mtis.[5] Although \\"Indian\\" is a term still commonly used in legal documents, the descriptors \\"Indian\\" and \\"Eskimo\\" have somewhat fallen into disuse in Canada and some consider them to be pejorative.[6][7][8] Similarly, \\"Aboriginal\\" as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in some legal documents, including the Constitution Act, 1982, though in some circles that word is also falling into disfavour.[9]\\r\\nOld Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are some of the earliest known sites of human habitation in Canada. The Paleo-Indian Clovis, Plano and Pre-Dorset cultures pre-date current indigenous peoples of the Americas. Projectile point tools, spears, pottery, bangles, chisels and scrapers mark archaeological sites, thus distinguishing cultural periods, traditions and lithic reduction styles.\\r\\nThe characteristics of Canadian Aboriginal culture included permanent settlements,[10] agriculture,[11] civic and ceremonial architecture,[12] complex societal hierarchies and trading networks.[13] The Mtis culture of mixed blood originated in the mid-17th century when First Nation and Inuit people married Europeans.[14] The Inuit had more limited interaction with European settlers during that early period.[15] Various laws, treaties, and legislation have been enacted between European immigrants and First Nations across Canada. Aboriginal Right to Self-Government provides opportunity to manage historical, cultural, political, health care and economic control aspects within first people's communities.\\r\\nAs of the 2011 census, Aboriginal peoples in Canada totaled 1,400,685 people, or 4.3% of the national population, spread over 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands with distinctive cultures, languages, art, and music.[1][16] National Indigenous Peoples Day recognizes the cultures and contributions of Aboriginal peoples to the history of Canada.[17] First Nations, Inuit and Mtis peoples of all backgrounds have become prominent figures and have served as role models in the Aboriginal community and help to shape the Canadian cultural identity.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982, \\"Aboriginal peoples of Canada\\" includes the Indian, Inuit and Mtis peoples.[19] Aboriginal peoples is a legal term encompassing all indigenous Canadian groups.[20][21] Aboriginal peoples is beginning to be considered outdated and slowly being replaced by the term Indigenous peoples.[2] First Nations (most often used in the plural) has come into general use since the 1970s replacing \\"Indians\\" in everyday vocabulary.[20][21] However, on reserves, First Nations is being supplanted by members of various nations referring to themselves by their group or ethnical identity. In conversation this would be \\"I am Haida\\", or \\"we are Kwantlens\\", in recognition of their First Nations ethnicities.[22]\\r\\nThe Indian Act?(R.S.C., 1985, c. I-5) sets the legal term Indian and \\"means a person who pursuant to this Act is registered as an Indian or is entitled to be registered as an Indian\\".[23] Section 5 of this act states that a registry shall be maintained \\"in which shall be recorded the name of every person who is entitled to be registered as an Indian under this Act\\".[23] No other term is legally recognized for the purpose of registration and the term Indian specifically excludes reference to Inuit as per section 4 of the Indian Act?(R.S.C., 1985, c. I-5). Indian remains in place as the legal term used in the Canadian Constitution. Its usage outside such situations can be considered offensive.[7]\\r\\nThe term Eskimo has pejorative connotations in Canada and Greenland. Indigenous peoples in those areas have replaced the term Eskimo with Inuit.[24][25] The Yupik of Alaska and Siberia do not consider themselves Inuit, and ethnographers agree they are a distinct people.[8][25] They prefer the terminology Yupik, Yupiit, or Eskimo. The Yupik languages are linguistically distinct from the Inuit languages.[8] Linguistic groups of Arctic people have no universal replacement term for Eskimo, inclusive of all Inuit and Yupik people across the geographical area inhabited by the Inuit and Yupik peoples.[8]\\r\\nBesides these ethnic descriptors, Aboriginal peoples are often divided into legal categories based on their relationship with the Crown (i.e. the state). Section 91 (clause 24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 gives the federal government (as opposed to the provinces) the sole responsibility for \\"Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\\". The government inherited treaty obligations from the British colonial authorities in Eastern Canada and signed treaties itself with First Nations in Western Canada (the Numbered Treaties). It also passed the Indian Act in 1876 which governed its interactions with all treaty and non-treaty peoples. Members of First Nations bands that are subject to the Indian Act with the Crown are compiled on a list called the Indian Register, and such people are called Status Indians. Many non-treaty First Nations and all Inuit and Mtis peoples are not subject to the Indian Act. However, two court cases have clarified that Inuit, Mtis, and non-status First Nations people, all are covered by the term \\"Indians\\" in the Constitution Act, 1867. The first was Re Eskimos in 1939 covering the Inuit, the second being Daniels v. Canada in 2013 which applies to Mtis and non-Status First Nations.[26]\\r\\nNotwithstanding Canada's location within the Americas, the term \\"Native American\\" is not used in Canada as it is typically used solely to describe the indigenous peoples within the boundaries of the present-day United States.[27]\\r\\nAccording to archaeological and genetic evidence, North and South America were the last continents in the world with human habitation.[28] During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,000ÿ17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to north west North America (Alaska).[29] Alaska was ice-free because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.[30][31]\\r\\nAboriginal genetic studies suggest that the first inhabitants of the Americas share a single ancestral population, one that developed in isolation, conjectured to be Beringia.[32][33] The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10,000ÿ20,000 years.[34][35][36] Around 16,500 years ago, the glaciers began melting, allowing people to move south and east into Canada and beyond.[37][38][39]\\r\\nThe first inhabitants of North America arrived in Canada at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.[40] It is believed the inhabitants entered the Americas pursuing Pleistocene mammals such as the giant beaver, steppe wisent, musk ox, mastodons, woolly mammoths and ancient reindeer (early caribou).[41] One route hypothesized is that people walked south by way of an ice-free corridor on the east side of the Rocky Mountains, and then fanned out across North America before continuing on to South America.[42] The other conjectured route is that they migrated, either on foot or using primitive boats, down the Pacific Coast to the tip of South America, and then crossed the Rockies and Andes.[43] Evidence of the latter has been covered by a sea level rise of hundreds of metres following the last ice age.[44][45]\\r\\nThe Old Crow Flats and basin was one of the areas in Canada untouched by glaciations during the Pleistocene Ice ages, thus it served as a pathway and refuge for ice age plants and animals.[46] The area holds evidence of early human habitation in Canada dating from about 12,000.[47] Fossils from the area include some never accounted for in North America, such as hyenas and large camels.[48] Bluefish Caves is an archaeological site in Yukon, Canada from which a specimen of apparently human-worked mammoth bone has been radiocarbon dated to 12,000 years ago.[47]\\r\\nClovis sites dated at 13,500 years ago were discovered in western North America during the 1930s. Clovis peoples were regarded as the first widespread Paleo-Indian inhabitants of the New World and ancestors to all indigenous peoples in the Americas.[49] Archaeological discoveries in the past thirty years have brought forward other distinctive knapping cultures who occupied the Americas from the lower Great Plains to the shores of Chile.[50]\\r\\nLocalized regional cultures developed from the time of the Younger Dryas cold climate period from 12,900 to 11,500 years ago.[51] The Folsom tradition are characterized by their use of Folsom points as projectile tips at archaeological sites. These tools assisted activities at kill sites that marked the slaughter and butchering of bison.[52]\\r\\nThe land bridge existed until 13,000ÿ11,000 years ago, long after the oldest proven human settlements in the New World began.[53] Lower sea levels in the Queen Charlotte sound and Hecate Strait produced great grass lands called archipelago of Haida Gwaii.[54] Hunter-gatherers of the area left distinctive lithic technology tools and the remains of large butchered mammals, occupying the area from 13,000ÿ9,000 years ago.[54] In July 1992, the Federal Government officially designated X?:ytem (near Mission, British Columbia) as a National Historic Site, one of the first Indigenous spiritual sites in Canada to be formally recognized in this manner.[55]\\r\\nThe Plano cultures was a group of hunter-gatherer communities that occupied the Great Plains area of North America between 12,000ÿ10,000 years ago.[56] The Paleo-Indians moved into new territory as it emerged from under the glaciers. Big game flourished in this new environment.[57] The Plano culture are characterized by a range of projectile point tools collectively called Plano points, which were used to hunt bison. Their diets also included pronghorn, elk, deer, raccoon and coyote.[56] At the beginning of the Archaic Era, they began to adopt a sedentary approach to subsistence.[56] Sites in and around Belmont, Nova Scotia have evidence of Plano-Indians, indicating small seasonal hunting camps, perhaps re-visited over generations from around 11,000ÿ10,000 years ago.[56] Seasonal large and smaller game fish and fowl were food and raw material sources. Adaptation to the harsh environment included tailored clothing and skin-covered tents on wooden frames.[56]\\r\\nThe North American climate stabilized by 8000?BCE (10,000 years ago); climatic conditions were very similar to today's.[58] This led to widespread migration, cultivation and later a dramatic rise in population all over the Americas.[58] Over the course of thousands of years, American indigenous peoples domesticated, bred and cultivated a large array of plant species. These species now constitute 50 ÿ 60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide.[59]\\r\\nThe vastness and variety of Canada's climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landform separations have defined ancient peoples implicitly into cultural or linguistic divisions. Canada is surrounded north, east, and west with coastline and since the last ice age, Canada has consisted of distinct forest regions. Language contributes to the identity of a people by influencing social life ways and spiritual practices.[60] Aboriginal religions developed from anthropomorphism and animism philosophies.[61]\\r\\nThe placement of artifacts and materials within an Archaic burial site indicated social differentiation based upon status.[58] There is a continuous record of occupation of S'܇lh Tmxw by Aboriginal people dating from the early Holocene period, 10,000ÿ9,000 years ago.[62] Archaeological sites at Stave Lake, Coquitlam Lake, Fort Langley and region uncovered early period artifacts. These early inhabitants were highly mobile hunter-gatherers, consisting of about 20 to 50 members of an extended family.[62][verification needed] The Na-Dene people occupied much of the land area of northwest and central North America starting around 8,000?BCE.[63] They were the earliest ancestors of the Athabaskan-speaking peoples, including the Navajo and Apache. They had villages with large multi-family dwellings, used seasonally during the summer, from which they hunted, fished and gathered food supplies for the winter.[64] The Wendat peoples settled into Southern Ontario along the Eramosa River around 8,000ÿ7,000?BCE (10,000ÿ9,000?years ago).[65] They were concentrated between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay. Wendat hunted caribou to survive on the glacier-covered land.[65] Many different First Nations cultures relied upon the buffalo starting by 6,000ÿ5,000?BCE (8,000ÿ7,000?years ago).[65] They hunted buffalo by herding migrating buffalo off cliffs. Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, near Lethbridge, Alberta, is a hunting grounds that was in use for about 5,000 years.[65]\\r\\nThe west coast of Canada by 7,000ÿ5000?BCE (9,000ÿ7,000?years ago) saw various cultures who organized themselves around salmon fishing.[65] The Nuu-chah-nulth of Vancouver Island began whaling with advanced long spears at about this time.[65] The Maritime Archaic is one group of North America's Archaic culture of sea-mammal hunters in the subarctic. They prospered from approximately 7,000?BCEÿ1,500?BCE (9,000ÿ3,500 years ago) along the Atlantic Coast of North America.[66] Their settlements included longhouses and boat-topped temporary or seasonal houses. They engaged in long-distance trade, using as currency white chert, a rock quarried from northern Labrador to Maine.[67] The Pre-Columbian culture, whose members were called Red Paint People, is indigenous to the New England and Atlantic Canada regions of North America. The culture flourished between 3,000?BCEÿ1,000?BCE (5,000ÿ3,000?years ago) and was named after their burial ceremonies, which used large quantities of red ochre to cover bodies and grave goods.[68]\\r\\nThe Arctic small tool tradition is a broad cultural entity that developed along the Alaska Peninsula, around Bristol Bay, and on the eastern shores of the Bering Strait around 2,500?BCE (4,500?years ago).[69] These Paleo-Arctic peoples had a highly distinctive toolkit of small blades (microblades) that were pointed at both ends and used as side- or end-barbs on arrows or spears made of other materials, such as bone or antler. Scrapers, engraving tools and adze blades were also included in their toolkits.[69] The Arctic small tool tradition branches off into two cultural variants, including the Pre-Dorset, and the Independence traditions. These two groups, ancestors of Thule people, were displaced by the Inuit by 1000?Common Era (CE).[69]:179ÿ81\\r\\nThe Old Copper Complex societies dating from 3,000?BCEÿ500?BCE (5,000ÿ2,500?years ago) are a manifestation of the Woodland Culture, and are pre-pottery in nature.[70] Evidence found in the northern Great Lakes regions indicates that they extracted copper from local glacial deposits and used it in its natural form to manufacture tools and implements.[70]\\r\\nThe Woodland cultural period dates from about 2,000?BCEÿ1,000?CE, and has locales in Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime regions.[71] The introduction of pottery distinguishes the Woodland culture from the earlier Archaic stage inhabitants. Laurentian people of southern Ontario manufactured the oldest pottery excavated to date in Canada.[60] They created pointed-bottom beakers decorated by a cord marking technique that involved impressing tooth implements into wet clay. Woodland technology included items such as beaver incisor knives, bangles, and chisels. The population practising sedentary agricultural life ways continued to increase on a diet of squash, corn, and bean crops.[60]\\r\\nThe Hopewell tradition is an Aboriginal culture that flourished along American rivers from 300?BCEÿ500?CE. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell Exchange System networked cultures and societies with the peoples on the Canadian shores of Lake Ontario. Canadian expression of the Hopewellian peoples encompasses the Point Peninsula, Saugeen, and Laurel complexes.[72][73][74]\\r\\nFirst Nations peoples had settled and established trade routes across what is now Canada by 500?BCEÿ1,000?CE. Communities developed each with its own culture, customs, and character.[75] In the northwest were the Athapaskan, Slavey, Dogrib, Tutchone, and Tlingit. Along the Pacific coast were the Tsimshian; Haida; Salish; Kwakiutl; Heiltsuk; Nootka; Nisga'a; Senakw and Gitxsan. In the plains were the Blackfoot; Kֳnawa; Sarcee and Peigan. In the northern woodlands were the Cree and Chipewyan. Around the Great Lakes were the Anishinaabe; Algonquin; Iroquois and Huron. Along the Atlantic coast were the Beothuk, Maliseet, Innu, Abenaki and Mi'kmaq.\\r\\nMany Aboriginal civilizations[76] established characteristics and hallmarks that included permanent urban settlements or cities,[77] agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, and complex societal hierarchies.[78] These cultures had evolved and changed by the time of the first permanent European arrivals (c. late 15thÿearly 16th centuries), and have been brought forward through archaeological investigations.[79]\\r\\nThere are indications of contact made before Christopher Columbus between the first peoples and those from other continents. Aboriginal people in Canada interacted with Europeans around 1000 CE, but prolonged contact came after Europeans established permanent settlements in the 17th and 18th centuries.[80] European written accounts generally recorded friendliness of the First Nations, who profited in trade with Europeans.[80] Such trade generally strengthened the more organized political entities such as the Iroquois Confederation.[81] Throughout the 16th century, European fleets made almost annual visits to the eastern shores of Canada to cultivate the fishing opportunities. A sideline industry emerged in the un-organized traffic of furs overseen by the Indian Department.[82]\\r\\nProminent First Nations people include Joe Capilano, who met with King of the United Kingdom, Edward VII, to speak of the need to settle land claims and Ovide Mercredi, a leader at both the Meech Lake Accord constitutional reform discussions and Oka Crisis.[83][84]\\r\\nThe Inuit are the descendants of what anthropologists call the Thule culture, which emerged from western Alaska around 1,000?CE and spread eastward across the Arctic, displacing the Dorset culture (in Inuktitut, the Tuniit). Inuit historically referred to the Tuniit as \\"giants\\", or \\"dwarfs\\", who were taller and stronger than the Inuit.[85] Researchers hypothesize that the Dorset culture lacked dogs, larger weapons and other technologies used by the expanding Inuit society.[86] By 1300, the Inuit had settled in west Greenland, and finally moved into east Greenland over the following century. The Inuit had trade routes with more southern cultures. Boundary disputes were common and led to aggressive actions.[15]\\r\\nWarfare was common among Inuit groups with sufficient population density. Inuit, such as the Nunatamiut (Uummarmiut) who inhabited the Mackenzie River delta area, often engaged in common warfare. The Central Arctic Inuit lacked the population density to engage in warfare. In the 13th century, the Thule culture began arriving in Greenland from what is now Canada. Norse accounts are scant. Norse-made items from Inuit campsites in Greenland were obtained by either trade or plunder.[87] One account, var Brearson, speaks of \\"small people\\" with whom the Norsemen fought.[88] 14th-century accounts that a western settlement, one of the two Norse settlements, was taken over by the Skr?ling.[89]\\r\\nAfter the disappearance of the Norse colonies in Greenland, the Inuit had no contact with Europeans for at least a century. By the mid-16th century, Basque fishers were already working the Labrador coast and had established whaling stations on land, such as been excavated at Red Bay.[90] The Inuit appear not to have interfered with their operations, but they did raid the stations in winter for tools, and particularly worked iron, which they adapted to native needs.[91]\\r\\nNotable among the Inuit are Abraham Ulrikab and family who became a zoo exhibit in Hamburg, Germany, and Tanya Tagaq, a traditional throat singer.[92] Abe Okpik was instrumental in helping Inuit obtain surnames rather than disc numbers and Kiviaq (David Ward) won the legal right to use his single-word Inuktituk name.[93][94]\\r\\nThe Mtis are people descended from marriages between Europeans (mainly French)[95] and Cree, Ojibway, Algonquin, Saulteaux, Menominee, Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, and other First Nations.[14] Their history dates to the mid-17th century.[3] When Europeans first arrived to Canada they relied on Aboriginal peoples for fur trading skills and survival. To ensure alliances, relationships between European fur traders and Aboriginal women were often consolidated through marriage.[96] The Mtis homeland consists of the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Ontario, as well as the Northwest Territories (NWT).[97]\\r\\nAmongst notable Mtis people are television actor Tom Jackson,[98] Commissioner of the Northwest Territories Tony Whitford, and Louis Riel who led two resistance movements: the Red River Rebellion of 1869ÿ1870 and the North-West Rebellion of 1885, which ended in his trial.[99][100][101]\\r\\nThe languages inherently Mtis are either Mtis French or a mixed language called Michif. Michif, Mechif or Mtchif is a phonetic spelling of Mtif, a variant of Mtis.[102] The Mtis today predominantly speak English, with French a strong second language, as well as numerous Aboriginal tongues. A 19th-century community of the Mtis people, the Anglo-Mtis, were referred to as Countryborn. They were children of Rupert's Land fur trade typically of Orcadian, Scottish, or English paternal descent and Aboriginal maternal descent.[103] Their first languages would have been Aboriginal (Cree, Saulteaux, Assiniboine, etc.) and English. Their fathers spoke Gaelic, thus leading to the development of an English dialect referred to as \\"Bungee\\".[104]\\r\\nS.35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 mentions the Mtis yet there has long been debate over legally defining the term Mtis,[105] but on September 23, 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Mtis are a distinct people with significant rights (Powley ruling).[106]\\r\\nUnlike First Nations people and Inuit, there has been no distinction between status and non-status,[107] and the Mtis, their heritage and Aboriginal ancestry have often been absorbed and assimilated into their surrounding populations.[108]\\r\\nFrom the late 18th century, European Canadians (and the Canadian government) encouraged assimilation of Aboriginal culture into what was referred to as \\"Canadian culture\\".[109][110] These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with a series of initiatives that aimed at complete assimilation and subjugation of the Aboriginal peoples. These policies, which were made possible by legislation such as the Gradual Civilization Act[111] and the Indian Act,[112] focused on European ideals of Christianity, sedentary living, agriculture, and education.\\r\\nThe attempt at Christianization of the Aboriginal people of Canada had been ongoing since the first missionaries arrived in the 1600s, however it became more systematic with the Indian Act in 1876, which would bring new sanctions for those who did not convert to Christianity. For example, the new laws would prevent non-Christian Aboriginal people from testifying or having their cases heard in court and ban alcohol consumption.[113] When the Indian Act was amended in 1884, traditional religious and social practices, such as the Potlatch, would be banned, and further amendments in 1920 would prevent \\"status Indians\\" (as defined in the Act) from wearing traditional dress or performing traditional dances in an attempt to stop all non-Christian practices.[113]\\r\\nAnother focus of the Canadian government was to make the Aboriginal groups of Canada sedentary, as they thought that this would make them easier to assimilate. In the 19th century, the government began to support the creation of model farming villages, which were meant to encourage non-sedentary Aboriginal groups to settle in an area and begin to cultivate agriculture.[114] When most of these model farming villages failed,[114] the government turned instead to the creation of Indian reserves with the Indian Act of 1876.[112] With the creation of these reserves came many restricting laws, such as further bans on all intoxicants, restrictions on eligibility to vote in band elections, decreased hunting and fishing areas, and inability for status Indians to visit other groups on their reservations.[112]\\r\\nThrough the Gradual Civilization Act in 1857, the government would encourage Indians (i.e., First Nations) to enfranchise ÿ to remove all legal distinctions between [Indians] and Her Majesty's other Canadian Subjects.[111] If an Aboriginal chose to enfranchise, it would strip them and their family of Aboriginal title, with the idea that they would become \\"less savage\\" and \\"more civilized\\", thus become assimilated into Canadian society.[115] However, they were often still defined as non-citizens by Europeans, and those few who did enfranchise were often met with disappointment.[115]\\r\\nThe final government strategy of assimilation, made possible by the Indian Act was the Canadian residential school system:\\r\\nOf all the initiatives that were undertaken in the first century of Confederation, none was more ambitious or central to the civilizing strategy of the Department, to its goal of assimilation, than the residential school system it was the residential school experience that would lead children most effectively out of their \\"savage\\" communities into \\"higher civilization\\" and \\"full citizenship.\\"[116]\\r\\nBeginning in 1847 and lasting until 1996, the Canadian government, in partnership with the Catholic Church, ran 130 residential boarding schools across Canada for Aboriginal children, who were forcibly taken from their homes.[117] While the schools were said to educate, they were plagued by under-funding, disease, and abuse.[118]\\r\\nBecause of laws and policies that encouraged or required Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a Eurocentric society, Canada violated the United Nations Genocide Convention that Canada signed in 1949 and passed through Parliament in 1952.[119] The residential school system that removed Aboriginal children from their homes has led scholars to believe that Canada can be tried in international court for genocide.[119] A legal case resulted in settlement of 2 billion C$ in 2006 and the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission which confirmed the injurious effect on children of this system and turmoil created between Aboriginal Canadians and Canadian Society.[120] In 2008 Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued an apology on behalf of the Canadian government and its citizens for the residential school system.[121]\\r\\nThe Canadian Crown and Aboriginal peoples began interactions during the European colonialization period. Numbered treaties, the Indian Act, the Constitution Act of 1982 and case laws were established. Aboriginal peoples construe these agreements as being between them and the Crown of Canada through the districts Indian Agent, and not the Cabinet of Canada.[122] The Mori interprets the Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand similarly.[123] A series of eleven treaties were signed between First Nations in Canada and the reigning Monarch of Canada from 1871 to 1921. The Government of Canada created the policy, commissioned the Treaty Commissioners and ratified the agreements. These Treaties are agreements with the Government of Canada administered by Canadian Aboriginal law and overseen by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.[124]\\r\\nAccording to the First Nationsÿ Federal Crown Political Accord \\"cooperation will be a cornerstone for partnership between Canada and First Nations, wherein Canada is the short-form reference to Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.[122] The Supreme Court argued that treaties \\"served to reconcile pre-existing Aboriginal sovereignty with assumed Crown sovereignty, and to define Aboriginal rights\\".[122] First Nations people interpreted agreements covered in treaty 8 to last \\"as long as the sun shines, grass grows and rivers flow.\\"[125]\\r\\nThe Indian Act is federal legislation that dates from 1876. There have been over 20 major changes made to the original Act since then, the last time being in 1951; amended in 1985 with Bill C-31. The Indian Act indicates how Reserves and Bands can operate and defines who is recognized as an \\"Indian\\".[126]\\r\\nIn 1985, the Canadian Parliament passed Bill C-31, \\"An Act to Amend the Indian Act\\". Because of a Constitutional requirement, the Bill took effect on April 17, 1985.[127]\\r\\nThose people accepted into band membership under band rules may not be status Indians. C-31 clarified that various sections of the Indian Act would apply to band members. The sections under debate concern community life and land holdings. Sections pertaining to Indians (First Nations peoples) as individuals (in this case, wills and taxation of personal property) were not included.[127]\\r\\nThe Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples was a Royal Commission undertaken by the Government of Canada in 1991 to address issues of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada.[128] It assessed past government policies toward Aboriginal people, such as residential schools, and provided policy recommendations to the government.[129] The Commission issued its final report in November 1996. The five-volume, 4,000-page report covered a vast range of issues; its 440 recommendations called for sweeping changes to the interaction between Aboriginal, non-Aboriginal people and the governments in Canada.[128] The report \\"set out a 20-year agenda for change.\\"[130]\\r\\nIn 1995, the federal government announced the Aboriginal Right to Self-Government Policy.[131] This policy recognizes that First Nations and Inuit have the constitutional right to shape their own forms of government to suit their particular historical, cultural, political and economic circumstances. The Indian Health Transfer Policy provided a framework for the assumption of control of health services by Aboriginal peoples, and set forth a developmental approach to transfer centred on self-determination in health.[132][133] Through this process, the decision to enter transfer discussions with Health Canada rests with each community. Once involved in transfer, communities can take control of health programme responsibilities at a pace determined by their individual circumstances and health management capabilities.[134] The National Aboriginal Health Organization (NAHO) incorporated in 2000, is an Aboriginal-designed and-controlled not-for-profit body in Canada that works to influence and advance the health and well-being of Aboriginal Peoples.[135]\\r\\nFirst Nations and Inuit organizations ranged in size from band societies of a few people to multi-nation confederacies like the Iroquois. First Nations leaders from across the country formed the Assembly of First Nations, which began as the National Indian Brotherhood in 1968.[136] The Mtis and the Inuit are represented nationally by the Mtis National Council and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami respectively.\\r\\nToday's political organizations have resulted from interaction with European-style methods of government through the Federal Interlocutor for Mtis and Non-Status Indians. Aboriginal political organizations throughout Canada vary in political standing, viewpoints, and reasons for forming.[137] First Nations, Mtis and Inuit negotiate with the Canadian Government through Indian and Northern Affairs Canada in all affairs concerning land, entitlement, and rights.[136] The First Nation groups that operate independently do not belong to these groups.[136]\\r\\nCountless North American Indigenous words, inventions and games have become an everyday part of Canadian language and use. The canoe, snowshoes, the toboggan, lacrosse, tug of war, maple syrup and tobacco are just a few of the products, inventions and games.[138] Some of the words include the barbecue, caribou, chipmunk, woodchuck, hammock, skunk, and moose.[139] Many places in Canada, both natural features and human habitations, use indigenous names. The word \\"Canada\\" itself derives from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word meaning \\"village\\" or \\"settlement\\".[140] The province of Saskatchewan derives its name from the Saskatchewan River, which in the Cree language is called \\"Kisiskatchewani Sipi\\", meaning \\"swift-flowing river.\\"[141] Canada's capital city Ottawa comes from the Algonquin language term \\"adawe\\" meaning \\"to trade.\\"[141] Modern youth groups such as Scouts Canada and the Girl Guides of Canada include programs based largely on Indigenous lore, arts and crafts, character building and outdoor camp craft and living.[142]\\r\\nAboriginal cultural areas depend upon their ancestors' primary lifeway, or occupation, at the time of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada.[143] The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. In both of these areas the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash.[16][143] While for the Inuit, hunting was the primary source of food with seals the primary component of their diet.[144] The caribou, fish, other marine mammals and to a lesser extent plants, berries and seaweed are part of the Inuit diet. One of the most noticeable symbols of Inuit culture, the inukshuk is the emblem of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. Inuksuit are rock sculptures made by stacking stones; in the shape of a human figure, they are called inunnguaq.[145]\\r\\nIndian reserves, established in Canadian law by treaties such as Treaty 7, are lands of First Nations recognized by non-indigenous governments.[146] Some reserves are within cities, such as the Opawikoscikan Reserve in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Wendake in Quebec City or Stony Plain 135 in the Edmonton Capital Region. There are more reserves in Canada than there are First Nations, which were ceded multiple reserves by treaty.[147] Aboriginal people currently work in a variety of occupations and may live outside their ancestral homes. The traditional cultures of their ancestors, shaped by nature, still exert a strong influence on them, from spirituality to political attitudes.[16][143] National Aboriginal Day is a day of recognition of the cultures and contributions of the First Nations, Inuit and Mtis peoples of Canada. The day was first celebrated in 1996, after it was proclaimed that year, by then Governor General of Canada Romo LeBlanc, to be celebrated on June 21 annually.[17] Most provincial jurisdictions do not recognize it as a statutory holiday.[17]\\r\\nThere are 13 Aboriginal language groups, 11 oral and 2 sign, in Canada, made up of more than 65 distinct dialects.[148] Of these, only Cree, Inuktitut and Ojibway have a large enough population of fluent speakers to be considered viable to survive in the long term.[149] Two of Canada's territories give official status to native languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government.[150] In the NWT, the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwichin, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and T??ch?.[151] Besides English and French, these languages are not vehicular in government; official status entitles citizens to receive services in them on request and to deal with the government in them.[149]\\r\\nIndigenous peoples were producing art for thousands of years before the arrival of European settler colonists and the eventual establishment of Canada as a nation state. Like the peoples who produced them, indigenous art traditions spanned territories across North America. Indigenous art traditions are organized by art historians according to cultural, linguistic or regional groups: Northwest Coast, Plateau, Plains, Eastern Woodlands, Subarctic, and Arctic.[152]\\r\\nArt traditions vary enormously amongst and within these diverse groups. Indigenous art with a focus on portability and the body is distinguished from European traditions and its focus on architecture. Indigenous visual art may be used conjunction with other arts. Shamans' masks and rattles are used ceremoniously in dance, storytelling and music.[152] Artworks preserved in museum collections date from the period after European contact and show evidence of the creative adoption and adaptation of European trade goods such as metal and glass beads.[153] The distinct Mtis cultures that have arisen from inter-cultural relationships with Europeans contribute culturally hybrid art forms.[154] During the 19th and the first half of the 20th century the Canadian government pursued an active policy of forced and cultural assimilation toward indigenous peoples. The Indian Act banned manifestations of the Sun Dance, the Potlatch, and works of art depicting them.[155]\\r\\nIt was not until the 1950s and 1960s that indigenous artists such as Mungo Martin, Bill Reid and Norval Morrisseau began to publicly renew and re-invent indigenous art traditions. Currently there are indigenous artists practising in all media in Canada and two indigenous artists, Edward Poitras and Rebecca Belmore, have represented Canada at the Venice Biennale in 1995 and 2005 respectively.[152]\\r\\nThe Aboriginal peoples of Canada encompass diverse ethnic groups with their individual musical traditions. Music is usually social (public) or ceremonial (private). Public, social music may be dance music accompanied by rattles and drums. Private, ceremonial music includes vocal songs with accompaniment on percussion, used to mark occasions like Midewivin ceremonies and Sun Dances.\\r\\nTraditionally, Aboriginal peoples used the materials at hand to make their instruments for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada.[156] First Nations people made gourds and animal horns into rattles, which were elaborately carved and brightly painted.[157] In woodland areas, they made horns of birch bark and drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Traditional percussion instruments such as drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs, and songs the background for dances. Traditional First Nations people consider song and dance to be sacred. For years after Europeans came to Canada, First Nations people were forbidden to practice their ceremonies.[155][156]\\r\\nThere are three (First Nations,[3] Inuit[4] and Mtis[5]) distinctive groups of North America indigenous peoples recognized in the Canadian Constitution Act, 1982, sections 25 and 35.[19] Under the Employment Equity Act, Aboriginal people are a designated group along with women, visible minorities, and persons with disabilities.[158] They are not a visible minority under the Employment Equity Act and in the view of Statistics Canada.[159]\\r\\nThe 2011 Canadian Census enumerated 1,400,685 Aboriginal people in Canada, 4.3% of the country's total population.[1] This total comprises 851,560 people of First Nations descent, 451,795 Mtis, and 59,445 Inuit. National representative bodies of Aboriginal people in Canada include the Assembly of First Nations, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Mtis National Council, the Native Women's Association of Canada, the National Association of Native Friendship Centres and the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples.[160]\\r\\nIn the 20th century the Aboriginal population of Canada increased tenfold.[161] Between 1900 and 1950 the population grew by 29%. After the 1960s the infant mortality level on reserves dropped dramatically and the population grew by 161%.[162][163] Since the 1980s the number of First Nations babies more than doubled and currently almost half of the First Nations population is under the age of 25.[161][163]\\r\\nIndigenous people assert that their sovereign rights are valid, and point to the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which is mentioned in the Canadian Constitution Act, 1982, Section 25, the British North America Acts and the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (to which Canada is a signatory) in support of this claim.[164][165]\\r\\nEthnographers commonly classify indigenous peoples of the Americas in the United States and Canada into ten geographical regions, cultural areas, with shared cultural traits.[167] The Canadian regions are:","input":"When did the first nations arrive in canada?"},{"output":"William Kitchiner","context":"A potato chip or crisp is a thin slice of potato that has been deep fried or baked until crunchy. Potato chips are commonly served as a snack, side dish, or appetizer. The basic chips are cooked and salted; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including herbs, spices, cheeses, other natural flavors, artificial flavors and additives.\\r\\nPotato chips are a predominant part of the snack food and convenience food market in Western countries. The global potato chip market generated total revenues of US$16.49 billion in 2005. This accounted for 35.5% of the total savory snacks market in that year ($46.1 billion).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known recipe for potato chips is in William Kitchiner's cookbook The Cook's Oracle, first published in 1817, which was a bestseller in England and the United States. The 1822 edition's version of recipe 104 is called \\"Potatoes fried in Slices or Shavings\\" and reads \\"peel large potatoes, slice them about a quarter of an inch thick, or cut them in shavings round and round, as you would peel a lemon; dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping\\".[2][3] Early recipes for potato chips in the United States are found in Mary Randolph's Virginia House-Wife (1824),[4] and in N.K.M. Lee's Cook's Own Book (1832),[5] both of which explicitly cite Kitchiner.[6]\\r\\nHowever, a legend associates the creation of potato chips with Saratoga Springs, New York, decades later.[7] By the late nineteenth century, a popular version of the story attributed the dish to George Crum, a half-black, half-Native American cook[8][9] at Moon's Lake House, who was trying to appease an unhappy customer on 24 August 1853.[10] The customer kept sending his French-fried potatoes back, complaining that they were too thick,[11] too \\"soggy,\\" and/or not salted well enough. Frustrated, Crum personally sliced several potatoes extremely thin, fried the potato slices to a crisp, and seasoned them with extra salt. To Crum's surprise, the customer loved them.[12] They soon came to be called \\"Saratoga Chips,\\"[13] a name that persisted into at least the mid-twentieth century. A version of this story popularized in a 1973 national advertising campaign by St. Regis Paper Company, which manufactured packaging for chips, said that Crum's customer was Cornelius Vanderbilt.[8] Crum was already renowned as a chef at the time, and by 1860, he owned his own lakeside restaurant, which he called Crum's House.[8]\\r\\nIn the 20th century, potato chips spread beyond chef-cooked restaurant fare and began to be mass-produced for home consumption. The Dayton, Ohio-based Mike-sell's Potato Chip Company, founded in 1910, identifies as the \\"oldest potato chip company in the United States\\".[14][15][16] New England-based Tri-Sum Potato Chips, founded in 1908 as the Leominster Potato Chip Company, in Leominster, Massachusetts claim to be America's first potato chip manufacturer.[17][18]\\r\\nIn an idea originated by the Smiths Potato Crisps Company Ltd, formed in 1920, Frank Smith packaged a twist of salt with his chips in greaseproof paper bags, which were sold around London.[19] The potato chip remained otherwise unseasoned until an innovation by Joe \\"Spud\\" Murphy, the owner of the Irish crisps company Tayto, who in the 1950s developed a technology to add seasoning during manufacture. After some trial and error, Murphy and his employee Seamus Burke produced the world's first seasoned chips: Cheese & Onion and Salt & Vinegar.[20] Companies worldwide sought to buy the rights to Tayto's technique.[21]\\r\\nThe first flavored chips in the United States, barbecue flavor, were being manufactured and sold by 1954.[22][23][24] In 1958, Herr's was the first company to introduce barbecue-flavored potato chips in Pennsylvania.[25]\\r\\nChips sold in markets were usually sold in tins or scooped out of storefront glass bins and delivered by horse and wagon. Early potato chip bags were wax paper with the ends ironed or stapled together. At first, potato chips were packaged in barrels or tins, which left chips at the bottom stale and crumbled.\\r\\nLaura Scudder,[26][27][28] an entrepreneur in Monterey Park, California, started having her workers take home sheets of wax paper to iron into the form of bags, which were filled with chips at her factory the next day. This pioneering method reduced crumbling and kept the chips fresh and crisp longer. This innovation, along with the invention of cellophane, allowed potato chips to become a mass-market product. Today, chips are packaged in plastic bags, with nitrogen gas blown in prior to sealing to lengthen shelf life, and provide protection against crushing.[29][30]\\r\\nTraditional chips were made by the \\"batch-style\\" process, where all chips are rinsed with cold water to release starch,[31] fried all at once at a low temperature (300?F)[32] and continuously raked to prevent them from sticking together.\\r\\nIndustrial advance resulted in a shift to production by a \\"continuous-style\\" process, running chips through a vat of hot oil and drying them in a conveyor process. Consumer desire for original style chips resulted in the introduction of traditionally made \\"kettle-style\\"[33] chips in the 2000s (known as hand-cooked in the UK/Europe). [34]\\r\\nThe Serious Eats Food Lab recommends: parboiling in vinegar-water for three minutes, then draining on a towel, then frying in oil until they stopped bubbling, for crispy non-kettle chips.[31]\\r\\nLittle consistency exists in the English-speaking world for names of fried potato slices, thick or thin. American and Canadian English use \\"chips\\" for the above-mentioned dish  this term is also used (but not universally) in other parts of world, and sometimes \\"crisps\\" for the same made from batter.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, \\"crisps\\" are potato chips which are eaten cold, whilst \\"chips\\" are similar to french fries (as in \\"fish and chips\\") and are served hot. In Australia, some parts of South Africa, New Zealand, India, the general West Indies especially in Barbados, both forms of potato product are simply known as \\"chips\\", as are the larger \\"home-style\\" potato crisps. In the north of New Zealand, they are known as \\"chippies\\", but are marketed as \\"chips\\" throughout the country. In Australia and New Zealand, sometimes the distinction is made between \\"hot chips\\" (fried potatoes) and \\"chips\\" or \\"potato chips\\". In Bangladesh, they are generally known as \\"chip\\" or \\"chips\\", and much less frequently as \\"crisps\\" (pronounced \\"kirisp\\") and locally, alu bhaja (for their similarity to the native potato bhajji).\\r\\nIn German-speaking countries (Austria, Germany: \\"Kartoffelchips\\"; Switzerland: \\"Pommes Chips\\") and in countries of the former SFR Yugoslavia, fried thin potato slices are known as \\"chips\\" (locally pronounced very similar to the actual English pronunciation), with a clear distinction from french fries. In Brazil, \\"home-style\\" potato chips are known as batatas portuguesas (\\"Portuguese potatoes\\") if their sides are relatively smooth and batatas prussianas (\\"Prussian potatoes\\") if their sides show a wafer biscuit-like pattern, whilst American-like industrial uniform potato chips made from a fried potato pure-based dough are known as \\"batata chips\\" (\\"potato chips\\"), or just \\"chips\\".\\r\\nMost potato chips contain high levels of sodium, from salt. This has been linked to health issues such as high blood pressure,[citation needed] but researchers at Queen Mary, University of London in 2004 have noted that a small \\"bag of ready-salted crisps\\" contains less salt than a serving of many breakfast cereals, including every brand of cornflakes on sale in the UK.\\"[35]\\r\\nSome potato chip companies have responded to the criticism by investing in research and development to modify existing recipes and create health-conscious products. Kettle Foods was founded in 1978 and currently sells only trans fatÿfree products, including potato chips. PepsiCo research shows that about 80% of salt on chips is not sensed by the tongue before being swallowed. Frito-Lay spent $414 million in 2009 on product development, including development of salt crystals that would reduce the salt content of Lay's potato chips without adversely affecting flavor.[36]\\r\\nUnsalted chips are available, e.g. the longstanding British brand Salt 'n' Shake, whose chips are not seasoned, but instead include a small salt sachet in the bag for seasoning to taste.\\r\\nIn Canada, seasonings include dill pickle,[37] jalape?o, ketchup,[37][38] barbecue, all dressed, sour cream and onion, and salt and vinegar. In 2006, Lay's introduced wasabi chips in Toronto and Vancouver,[39] but no longer offers them.[40] Loblaw, Canada's largest food retailer, offers several unusual flavors under its President's Choice brand, including poutine, maple bacon, Jamaican jerk chicken, Greek feta and olive, ballpark hot dog, and barbeque baby back ribs.[41]\\r\\nIn Hong Kong, the two prominent potato chips are the spicy \\"Ethnican\\" variety by Calbee,[42] and barbecue by Jack'n Jill. Lay's are also popular in Hong Kong.\\r\\nIn Ireland, the two main flavors are cheese and onion, and salt and vinegar. However in Ireland, the word \\"Tayto\\" is synonymous[citation needed] with potato chips after the Tayto brand and can be used to describe all varieties of chips, including those not produced by Tayto. Owing to the dominance of Tayto in the Irish market, the word has become a genericized trademark. Hunky Dorys and King crisps are other popular Irish brands.\\r\\nIn Germany, only two flavors were traditionally available, red paprika (paprika, sometimes also called ungarisch) and ready salted (gesalzen). These are still by far the most common and popular types, but some vendors started to offer a number of other flavors such as sour cream & onion, cheese, oriental, or more exotic seasonings like \\"chakalaka\\", \\"currywurst\\", \\"pommes\\" (french fries), \\"Rot-weiss\\" (red and white - french fries with tomato ketchup and mayonnaise). Potato chips made from ground potatoes are called Stapelchips rather than Kartoffelchips for legal reasons.\\r\\nIn Colombia, lemon, chicken, chorizo, and sirloin steak with mushroom sauce flavored potato chips are sold.[43]\\r\\nIn Japan, flavors include norishio (nori and salt), consomm, wasabi, soy sauce and butter, garlic, plum, barbecue, pizza, mayonnaise, and black pepper. Chili, scallop with butter, teriyaki, takoyaki, and yakitori chip flavors are also available. Major manufacturers are Calbee,[44] Koikeya[45] and Yamayoshi.\\r\\nThe market in the United Kingdom is dominated by Walkers, which held 56% of the British crisp market in 2013.[46] Walkers is known for its wide variety of potato chips. The three main flavors are ready salted, cheese and onion, and salt and vinegar; however, other examples are prawn cocktail (which were incorrectly described in the media as being subject to an EU directive banning them), Worcester sauce, roast chicken, steak and onion, smoky bacon, lamb and mint, ham and mustard, barbecue, BBQ rib, tomato ketchup, sausage and ketchup, pickled onion, Branston pickle, and Marmite.\\r\\nMore exotic flavors are Thai sweet chili, roast pork and creamy mustard sauce, lime and Thai spices, chicken with Italian herbs, sea salt and cracked black pepper, sea salt and chardonnay wine vinegar, sea salt and cider vinegar, spicy and aromatic curry, turkey and bacon, caramelized onion and sweet balsamic vinegar, Stilton and cranberry, mango chili, and special flavors, such as American cheeseburger and English roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.[47] Kettle Foods Ltd's range of thick-cut crunchy potato chips include gourmet flavors: Mexican limes with a hint of chilli, salsa with mesquite, buffalo mozzarella tomato and basil, mature cheddar with Adnams Broadside Beer, Soulmate cheeses, and onion. McCoys Crisps are also popular in the UK. In the north of England, Seabrook Potato Crisps are popular, but they are much less common in the south. Tayto is a popular brand in Northern Ireland. Since 2008, Walkers has launched its \\"Do Us a Flavour\\" campaign, challenging the UK public to think up unique flavours for their crisps. Six flavours were chosen from among the entries and released as special editions. Consumers could vote on their favourite, and the winner would become a permanent flavour.[48]\\r\\nIn the United States, popular potato chip flavorings include sour cream and onion and barbecue.[49] In the Gulf South, Zapp's Potato Chips of Gramercy, Louisiana, manufactures kettle-fried chips with regional flavors such as Crawtator, Cajun dill, Voodoo, and Creole onion.[50]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Of Pennsylvania leads the United States in potato-chip production, and it has been dubbed \\"the Potato Chip Capital\\" by several sources.[51] Pennsylvania-based companies that produce potato chips include Utz Quality Foods, Herr's Snacks, Snyder's of Hanover, Wise Foods, Middleswarth Potato Chips,[52] Dieffenbach's Potato Chips,[53] Hartley's Potato Chips,[54] Gibbles Foods,[55] Stehman's Potato Chips, and Charles Chips. These are all member companies of \\"The Snack Food Association Of The United States.\\"\\r\\nIn New Mexico, jerky shops offer locally made chips (often kettle-cooked) flavored with local red or green chile, or a combination of the two (known as \\"Christmas\\").\\r\\nAnother type of potato chip, notably the Pringles and Lay's Stax brands, is made by extruding or pressing a dough made from dehydrated potatoes into the desired shape before frying. This makes chips that are uniform in size and shape, which allows them to be stacked and packaged in rigid cardboard or plastic canisters. Pringles are officially branded as potato crisps, but they are rarely referred to as such by Americans. Conversely, Pringles may be termed potato chips in Britain, to distinguish them from traditional \\"crisps\\". Munchos, another brand that uses the term potato crisps, has deep air pockets in its chips that give it a curved shape, though the chips themselves resemble regular bagged chips.\\r\\nAn additional variant of potato chips exists in the form of \\"potato sticks\\", also called shoestring potatoes. These are made as extremely thin (2 to 3?mm) versions of the popular French fry but are fried in the manner of regular salted potato chips. A hickory-smoke-flavored version is popular in Canada, going by the vending machine name \\"Hickory Sticks\\". Potato sticks are typically packaged in rigid containers, although some manufacturers use flexible pouches, similar to potato chip bags. Potato sticks were originally packed in hermetically sealed steel cans. In the 1960s, manufacturers switched to the less expensive composite canister (similar to the Pringles container). Reckitt Benckiser was a market leader in this category[citation needed] under the Durkee Potato Stix and French's Potato Sticks names but exited the business in 2008. In 2014, French's reentered the market.\\r\\nA larger variant (about 1?cm thick) made with dehydrated potatoes is marketed as Andy Capp's Pub Fries, using the theme of a long-running British comic strip, which are baked and sold in a variety of flavors. Walkers make a similar product (using the Smiths brand) called \\"Chipsticks\\" which are sold in ready-salted and salt and vinegar flavors.\\r\\nSome companies have also marketed baked potato chips as an alternative with lower fat content. Additionally, some varieties of fat-free chips have been made using artificial, and indigestible, fat substitutes. These became well known in the media when an ingredient many contained, Olestra, was linked in some individuals to abdominal discomfort and loose stools.[56]\\r\\nAmericans' appetite for crispy snacks gave birth to the packaged, flavored corn chips, with such brands as Fritos, CC's, and Doritos dominating the market.[citation needed] \\"Swamp chips\\" are similarly made from a variety of root vegetables, such as parsnips, rutabagas, and carrots. Japanese-style variants include extruded chips, like products made from rice or cassava. In South Indian snack cuisine, an item called happla in Kannada/vadam in Tamil, is a chip made of an extruded rice-sago or multigrain base that has been around for many centuries.\\r\\nMany other products might be called \\"crisps\\" in Britain, but would not be classed as \\"potato chips\\" because they are not made with potato or are not chipped (for example, Wotsits, Quavers, Skips, Hula Hoops, and Monster Munch).\\r\\nKumara (sweet potato) chips are eaten in Korea, New Zealand, and Japan; parsnip, beetroot, and carrot crisps are available in the United Kingdom. India is famous[citation needed] for a large number of localized 'chips shops', selling not only potato chips, but also other varieties such as plantain chips, tapioca chips, yam chips, and even carrot chips. Plantain chips, also known as chifles or tostones, are also sold in the Western Hemisphere from Canada to Chile. In the Philippines, banana chips can be found sold at local stores. In Kenya, chips are made from arrowroot and casava. In the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, and Australia, a new variety of Pringles made from rice has been released and marketed as lower in fat than its potato counterparts.[citation needed]\\r\\nPotato is sliced by rotating the blade\\r\\nLong and narrow slices are produced\\r\\nThe potato slices are fried in hot oil\\r\\nFrying takes several minutes\\r\\nFinished product","input":"Who invented potato chips and when was it invented?"},{"output":"S15 million","context":"The Boscastle flood of 2004 (Cornish: An Lanwes Kastel Boterel 2004) occurred on Monday, 16 August 2004 in the two villages of Boscastle and Crackington Haven[1] in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The villages suffered extensive damage after flash floods caused by an exceptional amount of rain that fell over eight hours that afternoon. The flood in Boscastle was filmed and extensively reported but the floods in Crackington Haven and Rocky Valley were not mentioned beyond the local news. The floods were the worst in local memory. A study commissioned by the Environment Agency from hydraulics consulting firm HR Wallingford concluded that it was among the most extreme ever experienced in Britain. The peak flow was about 140 m3/s, between 5:00pm and 6:00pm BST. The annual chance of this (or a greater) flood in any one year is about 1 in 400.[2] The probability each year of the heaviest three-hour rainfall is about 1 in 1300 (although rainfall probability is not the same as flood probability). At midday on 16 August 2004, heavy thundery showers had developed across the South West due to a weak disturbance to the northeast of the United Kingdom.[3]\\r\\nThe last time Boscastle had suffered notable flooding was in 1996 as a result of Hurricane Lili, but floods are recorded in 1847, 1957, 3 June 1958 (one man drowned) and 1963. On 16 August 1952 the small town of Lynmouth, 50 miles (80?km) north-east along the north coast in Devon near Exmoor, suffered extensive damage in a catastrophic flood, in which 34 people lost their lives. Coincidentally, this was 52 years to the day before Boscastle's 2004 flood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 16th, warm air picking up moisture ÿ due to residual heat from the Atlantic Ocean ÿ travelled towards the South West Cornish coast as prevailing winds. Upon contact with the topographically vertical coast, these winds experienced a strong up-drafting force thus causing internal moisture to reach the atmosphere, and consequently cool as a string of storm clouds. With convergence and coalescence, enhanced moisture levels resulted in heavy rainfall on the afternoon of 16 August 2004. 185?mm (7?inches) of rain fell over the high ground just inland of Boscastle. At the peak of the downpour, at about 15:40 GMT, 24.1mm of rain (almost one inch) was recorded as falling in just 15 minutes at Lesnewth, 2.5 miles (4?km) up the valley from Boscastle. In Boscastle, 89?mm (3.5?inches) of rain was recorded in 60 minutes. The rain was very localised: Otterham and Lesnewth, both a few miles inland from Boscastle, recorded 24 hour totals of 200?mm and 185?mm respectively on the day,[4] whereas four of the nearest 10 rain gauges showed less than 3?mm of rain in the same period. The cause of the very heavy localised rain is thought to be an extreme example of what has become known as the Brown Willy effect.\\r\\nThe torrential rain led to a 2?m (7?ft) rise in river levels in one hour. A 3?m (10?ft) wave, believed to have been triggered by water pooling behind debris caught under a bridge and then being suddenly released as the bridge collapsed, surged down the main road. Water speed was over 4?m/s (10?mph), more than enough to cause structural damage. It is estimated that 20,000,000 cubic metres (5.3G109?US?gal) of water flowed through Boscastle that day alone. The steep valley sides, and the saturated surface ensured a high amount of surface run-off.\\r\\nChanges in farming practice in the area also possibly contributed, sewage could have been a cause as well, with a reduction of trees and hedges higher up the valley causing water to flow through more quickly than would have been the case in the past. Fortunately, no one died in the flood.\\r\\n75 cars, 5 caravans, 6 buildings and several boats were washed into the sea; approximately 100 homes and businesses were destroyed, and some had to be demolished; trees were uprooted and debris were scattered over a large area. In an operation lasting from mid-afternoon until 2:30?AM, a fleet of 7 Westland Sea King helicopters rescued about 150 people clinging to trees and the roofs of buildings and cars. No major injuries or loss of life were reported. The estimated cost of damage was S15 million.[5]\\r\\nMost work takes place in the winter season (OctoberÿMay), during the off-season. The carpark is reduced to half the space (120 spaces) in winter, for works to take place, and then back to 240 spaces in summer.\\r\\nThe main structure of the former lower bridge survived the flood, however the stone walls did not, and were washed away. On 1 May 2005, the official reopening of the village, wooden fences were used on the bridge to temporarily replace the stone walls. The bridge used to have a concrete plaque on it saying \\"This bridge is the private property of the lord of the manor, August 1887\\". This was lost during the flood, but then recovered from the harbour in good condition. This bridge has now been replaced with a new one.\\r\\nDuring the flood of 2004, 14 cars became lodged beneath it, this had caused a huge backlog of flood water and debris, adding to the damage caused in the surrounding area.\\r\\nThe original proposal was for a stone bridge, this was rejected. The second proposal is for a modern concrete bridge, with steel railings. Public consultations were held and villagers were asked to select their preference from four designs; most did not choose the one which has been proposed. This plan was rejected.\\r\\nThe new bridge is a few metres further down the river than the old bridge. The bridge was installed on 18 December 2007, and was made by Cornish Concrete, a company based near Truro. The main arch is made from reinforced concrete, with metal railings.\\r\\nThe old stone bridge, which was over 100 years old, was demolished in early April 2008.\\r\\nBoscastle flooded again, although not nearly as badly as the 2004 floods. After an afternoon of intense localised rainfall, and a week of steady rain everyday, a small flood happened on 21 June 2007. 30?mm fell on the area in one hour. Roads had become flooded in the area and in the village, most water came from the saturated fields around the village. Many drains had become blocked. Roads around the Tintagel, Camelford and Davidstow area were closed off to stop people visiting the village. River levels were alarmingly high, but the banks contained the water. However the many culverts of the River Jordan had overflowed onto the villages roads, adding to the amount of water on the roads. The new storm culvert joining the River Jordan to the River Valency was at full capacity, but did not flood. Services and organisations called in included:\\r\\nThe Environment Agency's flood defences installed after the 2004 flood worked and kept the water in the river channel. A few properties in the village were flooded by 3?ft (0.91?m) from water flowing down the streets, rather than from the river flooding, although the damage was not nearly as bad as the 2004 flood. The two main roads (B3266, B3263) were blocked with flood waste and debris, although this was cleared and the roads reopened the following morning. The Environment Agency looked at the culverts around the village and will change them all to modern drainage\\r\\nCoordinates: 504126N 44142W? / ?50.69044N 4.69505W? / 50.69044; -4.69505","input":"How much did it cost to repair boscastle after the flood?"},{"output":"14 September 1949","context":"Hindi (Devanagari: ??????, IAST: Hindؐ), or Modern Standard Hindi (Devanagari: ???? ??????, IAST: Mnak Hindؐ) is a standardised and Sanskritised register[6] of the Hindustani language. Along with the English language, Hindi written in the Devanagari script is the official language of the Government of India.[7]\\r\\nOn 14 September 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India adopted Hindi written in Devanagari script as the official language of the Republic of India. To this end, several stalwarts rallied and lobbied pan-India in favor of Hindi, most notably Beohar Rajendra Simha along with Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Kaka Kalelkar, Maithili Sharan Gupt and Seth Govind Das who even debated in Parliament on this issue. As such, on the 50th birthday of Beohar Rajendra Simha on 14 September 1949, the efforts came to fruition following adoption of Hindi as the official language.[8] It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Republic of India.[9] However, it is not the national language of India because no language was given such a status in the Indian constitution.[10][11]\\r\\nHindi is the lingua franca of the Hindi belt, and to a lesser extent the whole of India (usually in a simplified or pidginized variety such as Bazaar Hindustani or Haflong Hindi). Outside India, several other languages are recognized officially as \\"Hindi\\" but do not refer to the Standard Hindi language described here and instead descend from other dialects of Hindustani, such as Awadhi and Bhojpuri. Such languages include Fiji Hindi, which is official in Fiji, and Caribbean Hindustani, which is a recognized language in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname.[12][13][14][15] Apart from specialized vocabulary, Hindi is mutually intelligible with Standard Urdu, another recognized register of Hindustani.\\r\\nIndividually, as a linguistic variety, Hindi is the fourth most-spoken first language in the world, after Mandarin, Spanish and English.[16] Alongside Urdu as Hindustani, it is the third most-spoken language in the world, after Mandarin and English.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term Hindؐ originally was used to refer to inhabitants of the region east of the Indus. It was borrowed from Classical Persian Hindؐ (Iranian Persian Hendi), meaning \\"Indian\\", from the proper noun Hind \\"India\\".[18]\\r\\nThe name Hindavؐ was used by Amir Khusrow in his poetry.[19]\\r\\nLike other Indo-Aryan languages, Hindi is a direct descendant of an early form of Vedic Sanskrit, through Sauraseni Prakrit and ?auraseni Apabhra??a (from Sanskrit apabhra??a \\"corrupted\\"), which emerged in the 7th century A.D.[20]\\r\\nModern Standard Hindi is based on the Khariboli dialect,[20] the vernacular of Delhi and the surrounding region, which came to replace earlier prestige dialects such as Awadhi, Maithili (sometimes regarded as separate from the Hindi dialect continuum) and Braj. Urdu ÿ another form of Hindustani ÿ acquired linguistic prestige in the later Mughal period (1800s), and underwent significant Persian influence. Modern Hindi and its literary tradition evolved towards the end of the 18th century.[21] However, modern Hindi's earlier literary stages before standardization can be traced to the 16th century.[22] In the late 19th century, a movement to further develop Hindi as a standardised form of Hindustani separate from Urdu took form.[23] In 1881, Bihar accepted Hindi as its sole official language, replacing Urdu, and thus became the first state of India to adopt Hindi.[24] Modern Standard Hindi is one of the youngest Indian languages in this regard.\\r\\nAfter independence, the government of India instituted the following conventions:[original research?]\\r\\nThe Constituent Assembly adopted Hindi as an official language of India on 14 September 1949.[25] Now, it is celebrated as Hindi Day.\\r\\nIn Northeast India a pidgin known as Haflong Hindi has developed as a lingua franca for various tribes in Assam that speak other languages natively.[26] In Arunachal Pradesh, Hindi emerged as a lingua franca among locals who speak over 50 dialects natively.[27]\\r\\nPart XVII of the Indian Constitution deals with the official language of the Indian Commonwealth. Under Article 343, the official languages of the Union has been prescribed, which includes Hindi in Devanagari script and English:\\r\\n(1) The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari script. The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union shall be the international form of Indian numerals.[12]\\r\\n(2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (1), for a period of fifteen years from the commencement of this Constitution, the English language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement: Provided that the President may, during the said period, by order authorize the use of the Hindi language in addition to the English language and of the Devanagari form of numerals in addition to the international form of Indian numerals for any of the official purposes of the Union[28]\\r\\nArticle 351 of the Indian constitution states\\r\\nIt shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.\\r\\nIt was envisioned that Hindi would become the sole working language of the Union Government by 1965 (per directives in Article 344 (2) and Article 351),[29] with state governments being free to function in the language of their own choice. However, widespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, especially in South India (such as the those in Tamil Nadu) led to the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963, which provided for the continued use of English indefinitely for all official purposes, although the constitutional directive for the Union Government to encourage the spread of Hindi was retained and has strongly influenced its policies.[30]\\r\\nArticle 344 (2b) stipulates that official language commission shall be constituted every ten years to recommend steps for progressive use of Hindi language and imposing restrictions on the use of the English language by the union government. In practice, the official language commissions are constantly endeavouring to promote Hindi but not imposing restrictions on English in official use by the union government.\\r\\nAt the state level, Hindi is the official language of the following Indian states: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal.[31][32] Each may also designate a \\"co-official language\\"; in Uttar Pradesh, for instance, depending on the political formation in power, this language is generally Urdu. Similarly, Hindi is accorded the status of official language in the following Union Territories: Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu, National Capital Territory.\\r\\nNational language status for Hindi is a long-debated theme. In 2010, the Gujarat High Court clarified that Hindi is not the national language of India because the constitution does not mention it as such.[10][11][33]\\r\\nOutside Asia, the Awadhi language (A Hindi dialect)[34] is an official language in Fiji as per the 1997 Constitution of Fiji,[35] where it referred to it as \\"Hindustani\\", however in the 2013 Constitution of Fiji, it is simply called \\"Fiji Hindi\\".[36] It is spoken by 380,000 people in Fiji.[37]\\r\\nHindi is also spoken by a large population of Madheshis (people having roots in north-India but have migrated to Nepal over hundreds of years) of Nepal. Apart from specialized vocabulary, Hindi is mutually intelligible with Standard Urdu, another recognized register of Hindustani. Hindi is quite easy to understand for some Pakistanis, who speak Urdu, which, like Hindi, is part of Hindustani. Apart from this, Hindi is spoken by the large Indian diaspora which hails from, or has its origin from the \\"Hindi Belt\\" of India. A substantially large North Indian diaspora lives in countries like The United States of America, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, South Africa, Fiji and Mauritius, where it is natively spoken at home and among their own Hindustani-speaking communities. Outside India, Hindi speakers are 8 million in Nepal; 649,000 in United States of America;[38] 450,170 in Mauritius; 380,000 in Fiji;[37] 250,292 in South Africa; 150,000 in Suriname;[39] 100,000 in Uganda; 45,800 in United Kingdom;[40] 20,000 in New Zealand; 20,000 in Germany; 16,000 in Trinidad and Tobago;[39] 3,000 in Singapore.\\r\\nLinguistically, Hindi and Urdu are two registers of the same language and are mutually intelligble.[41] Hindi is written in the Devanagari script and uses more Sanskrit words, whereas Urdu is written in the Perso-Arabic script and uses more Arabic and Persian words. Hindi is the most commonly used official language in India. Urdu is the national language and lingua franca of Pakistan and is one of 22 official languages of India.\\r\\nThe splitting of Hindi and Urdu into separate languages is largely motivated by politics, namely the Indo-Pakistani rivalry.[42]\\r\\nHindi is written in the Devanagari script, an abugida. Devanagari consists of 11 vowels and 33 consonants and is written from left to right. Unlike for Sanskrit, Devanagari is not entirely phonetic for Hindi, especially failing to mark schwa dropping in spoken Standard Hindi.[43]\\r\\nThe Government of India uses Hunterian transliteration as its official system of writing Hindi in the Latin script. Various other systems also exist, such as IAST, ITRANS and ISO 15919.\\r\\nTraditionally, Hindi words are divided into five principal categories according to their etymology:\\r\\nHindi also makes extensive use of loan translation (calqueing) and occasionally phono-semantic matching of English.[47]\\r\\nHindi has naturally inherited a large portion of its vocabulary from ?aurasenؐ Prk?t, in the form of tadbhava words. This process usually involves compensatory lengthening of vowels preceding consonant clusters in Prakrit, e.g. Sanskrit tؐk??a > Prakrit tikkha > Hindi tؐkh.\\r\\nMuch of Modern Standard Hindi's vocabulary is borrowed from Sanskrit as tatsam borrowings, especially in technical and academic fields. The formal Hindi standard, from which much of the Persian, Arabic and English vocabulary has been replaced by neologisms compounding tatsam words, is called ?uddh Hindi (pure Hindi), and is viewed as a more prestigious dialect over other more colloquial forms of Hindi.\\r\\nExcessive use of tatsam words sometimes creates problems for native speakers. They may have Sanskrit consonant clusters which do not exist in native Hindi, causing difficulties in pronunciation.[48]\\r\\nAs a part of the process of Sanskritization, new words are coined using Sanskrit components to be used as replacements for supposedly foreign vocabulary. Usually these neologisms are calques of English words already adopted into spoken Hindi. Some terms such as drbh? \\"telephone\\", literally \\"far-speech\\" and drdar?an \\"television\\", literally \\"far-sight\\" have even gained some currency in formal Hindi in the place of the English borrowings (?eli)fon and ?ؐvؐ.[49]\\r\\nHindi literature is broadly divided into four prominent forms or styles, being Bhakti (devotional ÿ Kabir, Raskhan); ???gr (beauty ÿ Keshav, Bihari); Vؐgth (epic); and dhunik (modern).\\r\\nMedieval Hindi literature is marked by the influence of Bhakti movement and the composition of long, epic poems. It was primarily written in other varieties of Hindi, particularly Avadhi and Braj Bhasha, but to a degree also in Khariboli, the basis for Modern Standard Hindi. During the British Raj, Hindustani became the prestige dialect.\\r\\nChandrakanta, written by Devaki Nandan Khatri in 1888, is considered the first authentic work of prose in modern Hindi.[50] The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was Munshi Premchand, who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement. Literary, or Shityik, Hindi was popularised by the writings of Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Bhartendu Harishchandra and others. The rising numbers of newspapers and magazines made Hindustani popular with the educated people.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Dvivedؐ Yug (\\"Age of Dwivedi\\") in Hindi literature lasted from 1900 to 1918. It is named after Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, who played a major role in establishing Modern Standard Hindi in poetry and broadening the acceptable subjects of Hindi poetry from the traditional ones of religion and romantic love.\\r\\nIn the 20th century, Hindi literature saw a romantic upsurge. This is known as Chyvd (shadow-ism) and the literary figures belonging to this school are known as Chyvdؐ. Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala', Mahadevi Varma and Sumitranandan Pant, are the four major Chyvdؐ poets.\\r\\nUttar dhunik is the post-modernist period of Hindi literature, marked by a questioning of early trends that copied the West as well as the excessive ornamentation of the Chyvdؐ movement, and by a return to simple language and natural themes.\\r\\nThe Hindi Wikipedia was the first Indic-language wiki to reach 100,000 articles. Hindi literature, music, and film have all been disseminated via the internet.

The total fertility rate was rated at 1.59 in 2016[6] (the highest value since 1972[6]) and in 2011, was even estimated at 1.6 after accounting for the fact that older women contribute more to the number of births than in previous statistic models, and total fertility rates increased in younger generations.[7] In 2008, fertility was related to educational achievement (women with lower levels of education were having more children than women who had completed higher education).[8] In 2011, this was no longer true for Eastern Germany where higher educated women now had a somewhat higher fertility rate compared to the rest of the population.[9] Persons who said they had no religion tend to have fewer children than those who identify as Christians, and studies also found that amongst Christians; the more conservative ones had more children compared to the more liberal ones.[10][11] In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is legal in Germany, with an age limit set at forty years.[12] As of 2006, 55.7% of Germans age 18 and over were married. According to the 2008-2010 German Community Survey 3-Year Estimates, 51.5% of males and 47.7% of females over the age of 15 were married. The separation rate was 6 per 10 marriages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations Population Fund lists Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, behind the United States.[13] More than 16,000,000 people are descended from immigrants (first and second generation, including mixed heritage and ethnic German repatriates and their descendants). 96.1% of those reside in western Germany and Berlin.[14] About 7,000,000 of them are foreign residents, which is defined as those not having German citizenship. The largest ethnic group of non-German origin are the Turkish. Since the 1960s, West and later reunified Germany has been attracting immigrants primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Turkey, many of whom (or their children) acquired German citizenship over time. While most of these immigrants initially arrived as guest workers, Germany has also been a prime destination for refugees who have applied for asylum in Germany, in part because the German constitution long had a clause guaranteeing political asylum as a human right, but restrictions over the years have since limited the scope.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany has one of the world's highest levels of education, technological development, and economic productivity. Since the end of World War II, the number of students entering university has more than tripled, and the trade and technical schools are among the world's best. With a per capita PPP income of about $41,370 in 2012,[15] Germany is a broadly middle-class society. However, there has been a strong increase in the number of children living in poverty. Whereas in 1965, one in 75 children was on the welfare rolls. By 2007, one child in 6 was on the welfare rolls, although these children live in relative poverty, but not necessarily in absolute poverty.[16] Germans are typically very well-travelled people, with millions travelling overseas each year. The social welfare system provides for universal health care, unemployment compensation, child benefits and other social programmes. Due to Germany's ageing population and struggling economy, the welfare system came under a lot of strain in the 1990s. This led the government to adopt a wide-ranging programme of belt-tightening reforms, Agenda 2010, including the labour market reforms known as Hartz I - IV.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contemporary demographics of Germany are also measured by a series of full censuses, with the most recent held in 1987. Since reunification, German authorities rely on a micro census.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period.

During the partition of Germany, many Germans from East Germany fled to West Germany for political and also economic reasons. Since Germany's reunification, there are ongoing migrations from the eastern New L?nder to the western Old L?nder for economic reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe federal republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic followed different paths when it came to demographics. The politics of the German Democratic Republic was pronatalistic[25] while that of the Federal Republic was compensatory.\\r\\nFertility in the GDR was higher than that in the FRG. Demographic politics was only one of the reasons. Women in the GDR had fewer \\"biographic options\\", young motherhood was expected of them. State funded costfree childcare was available to all mothers.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Berlin is included into East Germany for the year 2002 and 2008. Source: Kreyenfeld (2002); Kreyenfeld et al. (2010); HFD Germany (2010)[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 1.7 million people have left the new federal states since the fall of the Berlin Wall, or 12% of the population,[28] a disproportionately high number of them were women under 35.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 1990, the total fertility rate (TFR) in the East dropped to 0.772 in 1994. This has been attributed to the fact that there was a \\"demographic shock\\" (people not only had fewer children, they also were less likely to marry or divorce after the end of the GDR) the biographic options of the citizens of the former GDR had increased. Young motherhood seemed to be less attractive and the age of the first birth rose sharply.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the following years, the TFR in the East Germany started rising again, surpassing 1.0 in 1997 and 1.3 in 2004, reaching the West's TFR in 2007 (1.37). In 2010, the East's fertility rate (1.459) clearly exceeded that of the West (1.385), while Germany's overall TFR has risen to 1.393, the highest value since 1990[6][30] - which was still far below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 and the birth rates seen under communism. In 2016, the TFR of East Germany was 1.64, while TFR in the West ÿ 1.60.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1989 and 2009, about 2,000 schools closed because of a scarcity of children.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some regions the number of women between the ages of 20 and 30 has dropped by more than 30%.[28] In 2004, in the age group 18-29 (statistically important for starting families) there were only 90 women for every 100 men in the new federal states (including Berlin).\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 2007 family politics in the federal republic was compensatory, which means that poor families received more family benefits (such as the Erziehungsgeld) than rich ones. In 2007 the so-called \\"Elterngeld\\" was introduced. According to Christoph Butterwegge the Elterngeld was meant to \\"motivate highly educated women to have more children\\", the poor on the other hand were disadvantaged by the Elterngeld, receiving now fewer child benefits than the middle classes.[32] The very well-off (who earn more than 250.000 Euro per annum) and those on welfare receive no Elterngeld payments.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 the following most recent developments were noticed:[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the new federal states the birth rate of college educated women is now higher than that of those without college degrees. Differences in value priorities and the better availability of childcare in the eastern states are discussed as a possible reason.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nDemographic statistics according to the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile most childbirths in Germany happen within marriage, a growing number of children are born out-of-wedlock. In 2010 the out-of-wedlock-rate was 33%, more than twice of what it was in 1990.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mikrozensus done in 2008 revealed that the number of children a German woman aged 40 to 75 had, was closely linked to her educational achievement.[8]\\r\\nIn Western Germany the most educated women were the most likely to be childless. 26% of those groups stated they were childless, while 16% of those having an intermediate education, and 11% of those having compulsory education, stated the same.\\r\\nIn Eastern Germany however, 9% of the most educated women of that age group and 7% of those who had an intermediary education were childless, while 12% of those having only compulsory education were childless.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for that east-western difference is that the GDR had an \\"educated mother scheme\\" and actively tried to encourage first births among the more educated. It did so by propagandizing the opinion that every educated woman should \\"present at least one child to socialism\\" and also by financially rewarding its more educated citizen to become parents. The government especially tried to persuade students to become parents while still in college and it was quite successful in doing so. In 1986 38% of all women, who were about to graduate from college, were mothers of at least one child and additional 14% were pregnant and 43% of all men, who were about to graduate from college, were fathers of at least one child. There was a sharp decline in the birth rate and especially in the birth rate of the educated after the fall of the Berlin wall. Nowadays,[when?] 5% of those about to graduate from college are parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more educated a Western German mother aged 40 to 75 was in 2008, the less likely she was to have a big family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same was true for a mother living in Eastern Germany in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nA study done in 2005 in the western German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen by the HDZ revealed that childlessness was especially widespread among scientists. It showed that 78% of the women scientists and 71% of the male scientists working in that state were childless.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Federal Statistical Office defines persons with a migrant background as all persons who migrated to the present area of the Federal Republic of Germany after 1949, plus all foreign nationals born in Germany and all persons born in Germany as German nationals with at least one parent who migrated to Germany or was born in Germany as a foreign national. The figures presented here are based on this definition only.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, 2.3 million families with children under 18 years were living in Germany, in which at least one parent had foreign roots. They represented 29% of the total of 8.1 million families with minor children. Compared with 2005?ÿ the year when the microcensus started to collect detailed information on the population with a migrant background?ÿ the proportion of migrant families has risen by 2 percentage points.[40] In 2015, 36% children under 5 years old had migrant background.[41](number includes ethnic German repatriates)\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the families with a migrant background live in the western part of Germany. In 2010, the proportion of migrant families in all families was 32% in the former territory of the Federal Republic. This figure was more than double that in the new L?nder (incl. Berlin) where it stood at 15%.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nFamilies with a migrant background more often have three or more minor children in the household than families without a migrant background. In 2010, about 15% of the families with a migrant background contained three or more minor children, as compared with just 9% of the families without a migrant background.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, 3.0 million of the persons of immigrant background had Turkish roots, 2.9 million had their roots in the successor states of the Soviet Union (including a large number of Russian-speaking ethnic Germans), 1.5 million had their roots in the successor states of Yugoslavia and 1.5 million had Polish roots.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, 18.4% of Germans of any age group and 30% of German children had at least one parent born abroad. Median age for Germans with at least one parent born abroad was 33.8 years, while that for Germans, who had two parents born in Germany was 44.6 years.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany is home to the third-highest number of international migrants worldwide after the United States and Saudi Arabia.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nPopulation of Germany in 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2017[update], the population by background was as follows:[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimone Hauswald has Migrationshintergrund due to one side of her parents being foreign-born\\r\\n\\r\\nMesut ?zil is classified as having a migrant background because both of his parents were born in Turkey\\r\\n\\r\\nHelene Fischer has a migrant background despite being ethnically German because she was born in the Soviet Union to parents of the German minority in Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour other sizable groups of people are referred to as \\"national minorities\\" (nationale Minderheiten) because they have lived in their respective regions for centuries: Danes, Frisians, Roma and Sinti, and Sorbs. There is a Danish minority (about 50,000, according to government sources) in the northern-most state of Schleswig-Holstein. Eastern and Northern Frisians live at Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony. They are part of a wider community (Frisia) stretching from Germany to the northern Netherlands. The Sorbs, a Slavic people with about 60,000 members (according to government sources), are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg. They are the last remnants of the Slavs that lived in central and eastern Germany since the 7th century to have kept their traditions and not been completely integrated into the wider German nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil World War II the Poles were recognized as one of the national minorities. In 1924 the Union of Poles in Germany had initiated cooperation between all national minorities in Germany under the umbrella organization Association of National Minorities in Germany. Some of the union members wanted the Polish communities in easternmost Germany (now Poland) to join the newly established Polish nation after World War I.[citation needed] Even before the German invasion of Poland, leading anti-Nazi members of the Polish minority were deported to concentration camps; some were executed at the Pia?nica murder site. Minority rights for Poles in Germany were revoked by Hermann G?ring's World War II decree of 27 February 1940, and their property was confiscated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war ended, the German government did not re-implement national minority rights for ethnic Poles.  The reason for this is that the areas of Germany which formerly had a native Polish minority were annexed to Poland and the Soviet Union, while almost all of the native German populations (formerly the ethnic majority) in these areas subsequently fled or were expelled by force.  With the mixed German-Polish territories now lost, the German government subsequently regarded ethnic Poles residing in what remained of Germany as immigrants, just like any other ethnic population with a recent history of arrival.  In contrast, Germans living in Poland are recognized as national minority and have granted seats in Polish Parliament. It must be said, however, that an overwhelming number of Germans in Poland have centuries-old historical ties to the lands they now inhabit, whether from living in territory that once belonged to the German state, or from centuries-old communities. In contrast, most Poles in present-day Germany are recent immigrants, though there are some communities which have been present since the 19th and perhaps even the 18th centuries.  Despite protests by some in the older Polish-German communities, and despite Germany being now a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Germany has so far refused to re-implement minority rights for ethnic Poles, based on the fact that almost all areas of historically mixed German-Polish heritage (where the minority rights formerly existed) are no longer part of Germany and because the vast majority of ethnic Poles now residing in Germany are recent immigrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoma people have been in Germany since the Middle Ages. They were persecuted by the Nazis, and thousands of Roma living in Germany were killed by the Nazi regime. Nowadays, they are spread all over Germany, mostly living in major cities. It is difficult to estimate their exact number, as the German government counts them as \\"persons without migrant background\\" in their statistics. There are also many assimilated Sinti and Roma. A vague figure given by the German Department of the Interior is about 70,000. In the late 1990s, many Roma moved to Germany from Kosovo. In contrast to the old-established Roma population, the majority of them do not have German citizenship, they are classified as immigrants or refugees.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter World War II, 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the eastern territories of Germany and homelands outside the former German Empire. The accommodation and integration of these Heimatvertriebene in the remaining part of Germany, in which many cities and millions of apartments had been destroyed, was a major effort in the post-war occupation zones and later states of Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1960s, ethnic Germans from the People's Republic of Poland and Soviet Union (especially from Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine), have come to Germany. During the time of Perestroika, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of immigrants increased heavily. Some of these immigrants are of mixed ancestry. During the 10-year period between 1987 and 2001, a total of 1,981,732 ethnic Germans from the FSU immigrated to Germany, along with more than a million of their non-German relatives. After 1997, however ethnic Slavs or those belonging to Slavic-Germanic mixed origins outnumbered these with only Germanic descent amongst the immigrants. The total number of people currently living in Germany having FSU connection is around 4 to 4.5 million (Including Germans, Slavs, Jews and those of mixed origins), out of that more than 50% is of German descent.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany now has Europe's third-largest Jewish population. In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total inflow to more than 100,000 since 1991.[49] Jews have a voice in German public life through the Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland). Some Jews from the former Soviet Union are of mixed heritage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000 there were also around 300,000ÿ500,000 Afro-Germans (those who have German citizenship)[50] and 150,000+ African nationals. Most of them live in Berlin and Hamburg. Numerous persons from Tunisia and Morocco live in Germany. While they are considered members of a minority group, for the most part, they do not considers themselves \\"Afro-Germans,\\" nor are most of them perceived as such by the German people. However, Germany does not keep any statistics regarding ethnicity or race. Hence, the exact number of Germans of African descent is unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany's biggest East Asian minority are the Vietnamese people in Germany. About 40,000 Vietnamese live in Berlin and surroundings. Also there are about 20,000 to 25,000 Japanese people residing in Germany. Some South Asian and Southeast Asian immigration has taken place. Nearly 50,000 Indians live in Germany. As of 2008, there were 68,000 Filipino residents and an unknown number of Indonesians residing in Germany.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous descendants of the so-called Gastarbeiter live in Germany. The Gastarbeiter mostly came from Chile, Greece, southern Italy, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey and the former Yugoslavia.\\r\\nAlso included were Vietnam, Mongolia, North Korea, Angola, Mozambique and Cuba when the former East Germany existed until reunification in 1990.[52] The (socialist) German Democratic Republic (East Germany) however had their guest-workers stay in single-sex dormitories.[53] Female guest workers had to sign contracts saying that they were not allowed to fall pregnant during their stay. If they fell pregnant nevertheless they faced forced abortion or deportation.[54] This is one of the reasons why the vast majority of ethnic minorities today lives in western Germany and also one of the reasons why minorities such as the Vietnamese have the most unusual population pyramid, with nearly all second-generation Vietnamese Germans born after 1989.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2016[update], the numbers of selected groups of resident foreign nationals (non-naturalized residents) in Germany were as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis list does not include foreigners with German nationality and foreign nationals without resident status.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common Y chromosome haplogroups among German males are Haplogroup R1b, followed by Haplogroup I1, and Haplogroup R1a.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an estimated more than 81.8?million inhabitants in late 2011,[59] Germany is the most populous country in the European Union and ranks as the 16th largest country in the world in terms of population. Its population density stands at 229.4 inhabitants per square kilometer.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany comprises sixteen states that are collectively referred to as L?nder.[60] Due to differences in size and population the subdivision of these states varies, especially between city-states (Stadtstaaten) and states with larger territories (Fl?chenl?nder). For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-Wrttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 Government Districts (Regierungsbezirke). As of 2009 Germany is divided into 403 districts (Kreise) on municipal level, these consist of 301 rural districts and 102 urban districts.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nBerlinHamburgMunich (Mnchen)\\r\\n\\r\\nCologne (K?ln)\\r\\nFrankfurt am MainStuttgart\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany officially has eleven metropolitan regions. In 2005, Germany had 82 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver ten million people living in Germany today were born outside of Germany; equivalent to 12% of the German population. Most immigrants come from other European countries, particularly from Turkey, Russia, Poland and Italy. Germany is the second-most popular destination for immigrants in the world after the United States.[36] The German Government has been keen to encourage immigration over the past fifty years.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany had signed special visa agreements with several countries in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within the country. During the 1960s and 1970s, agreements were signed with the governments of Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy and Spain to help Germany overcome its severe labour shortage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2012, the largest sources of net immigration to Germany are other European countries, most importantly Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and Greece; notably, in the case of Turkey, German Turks moving to Turkey slightly outnumber new immigrants.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, there were 476,649 asylum applications.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nResponsibility for educational oversight in Germany lies primarily with the individual federated states. Since the 1960s, a reform movement has attempted to unify secondary education into a Gesamtschule (comprehensive school); several West German states later simplified their school systems to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung (\\"dual education\\") allows pupils in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years. Primary education usually lasts for four years and public schools are not stratified at this stage.[66] In contrast, secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different levels of academic ability: the Gymnasium enrols the most academically promising children and prepares students for university studies; the Realschule for intermediate students lasts six years; the Hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition Germany has a comprehensive school known as the Gesamtschule. While some German schools such as the Gymnasium and the Realschule have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have such requirements. They offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well, general education classes for average students, and remedial courses for those who aren't doing that well. In most cases students attending a Gesamtschule may graduate with the Hauptschulabschluss, the Realschulabschluss or the Abitur depending on how well they did in school.\\r\\nThe percentage of students attending a Gesamtschule varies by Bundesland. In 2007 the State of Brandenburg more than 50% of all students attended a Gesamtschule,[68] while in the State of Bavaria less than 1% did.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general entrance requirement for university is Abitur, a qualification normally based on continuous assessment during the last few years at school and final examinations; however there are a number of exceptions, and precise requirements vary, depending on the state, the university and the subject. Germany's universities are recognised internationally; in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200.[69] Nearly all German universities are public institutions, tuition fees in the range of ?500 were introduced in some states after 2006, but quickly abolished again until 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of jobholders holding Hauptschulabschluss, Realschulabschluss or Abitur in Germany[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 99% of those of age 15 and above are estimated to be able to read and write. However, a growing number of inhabitants are functionally illiterate. The young are much more likely to be functionally illiterate than the old. According to a study done by the University of Bremen in coorporation with the \\"Bundesverband Alphabetisierung e.V.\\", 10% of youngsters living in Germany are functionally illiterate and one quarter are able to understand only basic level texts.[71] Illiteracy rates of youngsters vary by ethnic group and parents' socioeconomic class.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2009[update], the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 42%, followed by malignant tumours, at 25%.[72]\\r\\nAs of  2008[update], about 82,000 Germans had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 26,000 had died from the disease (cumulatively, since 1982).[73]\\r\\nAccording to a 2005 survey, 27% of German adults are smokers.[73]\\r\\nA 2009 study shows Germany is near the median in terms of overweight and obese people in Europe.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe national constitutions of 1919 and 1949 guarantee freedom of faith and religion; earlier, these freedoms were mentioned only in state constitutions. The modern constitution of 1949 also states that no one may be discriminated against due to their faith or religious opinions. A state church does not exist in Germany (see Freedom of religion in Germany).[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a 1990s poll by Der Spiegel, 45% of Germans believe in God, and a quarter in Jesus Christ.[79] According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2010, 44% of German citizens responded that \\"they believe there is a God\\", 25% responded that \\"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\\" and 27% responded that \\"they don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force\\". 4% gave no response.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nChristianity is the largest religion in Germany, comprising an estimated 57.9% of the country's population.[81][82]\\r\\n\\r\\nIslam is the second largest religion in Germany, with an estimated 6.1% of the population according to a 2017 Pew Research Survey. Germany has the second largest Muslim population in Europe, at nearly 5 million, and is expected to grow significantly in the coming decades.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmaller religious groups (less than 1%) include Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism.[83][84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two largest churches, the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), have lost significant number of adherents. In 2016 the Catholic Church accounted for 28.5%[81][82][85] and the Evangelical Church for 26.5%[81][82][86] of the population. Other Christian churches and groups summed up to 3.3%[83] with estimations for the Orthodox Church between 1.3%[84] and 1.9%.[83]\\r\\nSince the reunification of Germany, the number of non-religious people has grown and an estimated 36.2% of the country's population are not affiliated with any church or religion.[81][82][83][84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other religions make up to less than 1% of the population.[83] Buddhism has around 200,000 adherents (0.2%), Judaism has around 200.000 adherents (0.2%), Hinduism 90,000 (0.1%), Sikhism 75,000 (0.1%) and Yazidis religion (45,000-60,000).[87] All other religious communities in Germany have fewer than 50,000 (<0.1%) adherents.\\r\\n\\r\\nProtestantism is concentrated in the north and east and Roman Catholicism is concentrated in the south and west. According to the last nationwide census, Protestantism is more widespread among the population with German citizenship; there are slightly more Catholics total because of the Catholic immigrant population (including such groups as Poles and Italians).[88] The former Pope, Benedict XVI, was born in Bavaria. Non-religious people, including atheists and agnostics, might make up as many as 55% of the total population, and are especially numerous in the former East Germany and major metropolitan areas.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the roughly 4 million Muslims, most are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites and other denominations.[90][91] 1.3% of the country's overall population declare themselves Orthodox Christians,[84] with Serbs, Greeks, Montenegrins, Ukrainians and Russians being the most numerous.[92] Germany has Europe's third-largest Jewish population (after France and the United Kingdom).[93] In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total Jewish population to more than 200,000, compared to 30,000 prior to German reunification. Large cities with significant Jewish populations include Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich.[94] Around 250,000 active Buddhists live in Germany; 50% of them are Asian immigrants.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nCensus results were as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nReligion (2011 German Census)\\r\\n\\r\\nEvangelical population according to the 2011 Census\\r\\n\\r\\nCatholic population according to the 2011 Census\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-Christian population according to the 2011 Census (including other religions and not specified)\\r\\n\\r\\nPredominant religious group according to the 2011 Census - Catholics are dominant in the south and west, the non-religious (including other religions and not specified) dominate in the east and the large cities and Protestants dominate in north, east, and central parts of Germany\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman is the only official and most widely spoken language. Standard German is understood throughout the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nDanish, Low German, Low Rhenish, the Sorbian languages (Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian), and the two Frisian languages, Saterfrisian and North Frisian, are officially recognized and protected as minority languages by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in their respective regions. With speakers of Romany living in all parts of Germany, the federal government has promised to take action to protect the language. Until now, only Hesse has followed Berlin's announcement, and agreed on implementing concrete measures to support Romany speakers.\\r\\n\\r\\nImplementation of the Charter is poor. The monitoring reports on charter implementation in Germany show many provisions unfulfilled.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman dialects ÿ some quite distinct from the standard language ÿ are used in everyday speech, especially in rural regions. Many dialects, for example the Upper German varieties, are to some degree cultivated as symbols of regional identity and have their own literature, theaters and some TV programming. While speaking a dialect outside its native region might be frowned upon, in their native regions some dialects can be spoken by all social classes.[citation needed]. Nevertheless, partly due to the prevalence of Standard German in media, the use of dialects has declined over the past century, especially in the younger population.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe social status of different German dialects can vary greatly. The Alemannic and Bavarian dialects of the south are positively valued by their speakers and can be used in almost all social circumstances. The Saxonian and Thuringian dialects have less prestige and are subject to derision. While Bavarian and Alemannic have kept much of their distinctiveness, the Middle German dialects, which are closer to Standard German, have lost some of their distinctive lexical and grammatical features and tend to be only pronunciation variants of Standard German.\\r\\n\\r\\nLow Saxon is officially recognized as a language on its own, but despite this fact, there's little official action taken on fostering the language. Historically one third of Germany's territory and population was Low Saxon speaking. No data was ever collected on the actual number of speakers, but today the number of speakers ranges around 5 million persons. Despite this relatively high number of speakers there is very little coverage in the media (mostly on NDR TV, no regular programming) and very little education in or on the language. The language is not fixed as part of the school curriculum and Low Saxon is used as a medium of instruction in one school only in the whole Germany (as a \\"model project\\" in primary school sided by education in Standard German). As a consequence the younger generation refused to adopt the native language of their parents. Language prevalence dropped from more than 90% (depending on the exact region) in the 1930s to less than 5% today. This accounts for a massive intergenerational gap in language use. Older people regularly use the language and take private initiative to maintain the language, but the lack of innovative potential of the younger generation hinders language maintenance. The language too has an own literature (around 150 published books every year) and there are many theatres (mostly lay stages, but some professional ones, like for example Ohnsorg-Theater).\\r\\n\\r\\nUse of Low Saxon is mainly restricted to use among acquaintances, like family members, neighbours and friends. A meeting of a village council can be held almost completely in Low Saxon if all participants know each other (as long as written protocols are written in Standard German), but a single foreigner can make the whole switching to Standard German.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Low Saxon dialects are different in their status too. There's a north-south gradient in language maintenance. The Southern dialects of Westfalian, Eastfalian and Brandenburgish have had much stronger speaker losses, than the northern coastal dialects of Northern Low Saxon. While Eastfalian has lost speakers to Standard German, Westfalian has lost speakers to Standard German and Standard German based regiolect of the Rhine-Ruhr area. Brandenburgish speakers mostly switched to the Standard German-based regiolect of Berlin. Brandenburgish is almost completely replaced by the Berlin regiolect. Northern Low Saxon speakers switched mostly to pure Standard German.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish is the most common foreign language and almost universally taught by the secondary level; it is also taught at elementary level in some states. Other commonly-taught languages are French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian. Dutch is taught in states bordering the Netherlands, and Polish in the eastern states bordering Poland.[citation needed] Latin and Ancient Greek are part of the classical education syllabus offered in many secondary schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a 2004 survey, two-thirds of Germany's citizens have at least basic knowledge of English.[citation needed] About 20% consider themselves to be competent speakers of French, followed by speakers of Russian (7%), Italian (6.1%), and Spanish (5.6%). The relatively high number of Russian speakers is a result of massive immigration from the former Soviet Union to Germany for almost 10 consecutive years, plus its having been learned in school by many older former East Germans.[citation needed]","input":"What is the largest ethnic group in germany?"},{"output":"frogs","context":"Acanthopidae\\r\\nAmorphoscelididae\\r\\nChaeteessidae\\r\\nEmpusidae\\r\\nEremiaphilidae\\r\\nHymenopodidae\\r\\nIridopterygidae\\r\\nLiturgusidae\\r\\nMantidae\\r\\nMantoididae\\r\\nMetallyticidae\\r\\nSibyllidae\\r\\nTarachodidae\\r\\nThespidae\\r\\nToxoderidae\\r\\nMantises are an order (Mantodea) of insects that contains over 2,400 species in about 430 genera in 15 families. The largest family is the Mantidae (\\"mantids\\"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies may or may not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis.\\r\\nThe closest relatives of mantises are the termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), which are all within the superorder Dictyoptera. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other unrelated insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae). Mantises are mostly ambush predators, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die. The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring. Females sometimes practice sexual cannibalism, eating their mates after copulation.\\r\\nMantises were considered to have supernatural powers by early civilizations, including Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, and Assyria. A cultural trope popular in cartoons imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale. Mantises are among the insects most commonly kept as pets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 2,400 species of mantis in about 430 genera are recognized.[1] They are predominantly found in tropical regions, but some live in temperate areas.[2][3] The systematics of mantises have long been disputed. Mantises, along with stick insects (Phasmatodea), were once placed in the order Orthoptera with the cockroaches (now Blattodea) and rock crawlers (now Grylloblattodea). Kristensen (1991) combined the Mantodea with the cockroaches and termites into the order Dictyoptera, suborder Mantodea.[4][5] The name mantodea is formed from the Ancient Greek words ?? (mantis) meaning \\"prophet\\", and ?Ѵ? (eidos) meaning \\"form\\" or \\"type\\". It was coined in 1838 by the German entomologist Hermann Burmeister.[6][7] The order is occasionally called the mantes, using a Latinized plural of Greek mantis. The name mantid properly refers only to members of the family Mantidae, which was, historically, the only family in the order. The other common name, praying mantis, applied to any species in the order,[8] (though in Europe mainly to Mantis religiosa), comes from the typical \\"prayer-like\\" posture with folded fore limbs.[9][10] The vernacular plural \\"mantises\\" (used in this article) was confined largely to the USA, with \\"mantids\\" predominantly used as the plural in the UK and elsewhere, until the family Mantidae was further split in 2002.[11][12]\\r\\nOne of the earliest classifications splitting an all-inclusive Mantidae into multiple families was that proposed by Beier in 1968, recognizing eight families[13], though it was not until Ehrmann's reclassification into 15 families in 2002[12] that a multiple-family classification became universally adopted. Klass, in 1997, studied the external male genitalia and postulated that the families Chaeteessidae and Metallyticidae diverged from the other families at an early date.[14] However, the Mantidae and Thespidae are still both considered polyphyletic, so the Mantodea will have to be revised.[15]\\r\\nThe earliest mantis fossils are about 135 million years old, from Siberia.[15] Fossils of the group are rare: by 2007, only about 25 fossil species were known.[15] Fossil mantises, including one from Japan with spines on the front legs as in modern mantises, have been found in Cretaceous amber.[16] Most fossils in amber are nymphs; compression fossils (in rock) include adults. Fossil mantises from the Crato Formation in Brazil include the 10?mm (0.39?in) long Santanmantis axelrodi, described in 2003; as in modern mantises, the front legs were adapted for catching prey. Well-preserved specimens yield details as small as 5 m through X-ray computed tomography.[15]\\r\\nBecause of the superficially similar raptorial forelegs, mantidflies may be confused with mantises, though they are unrelated. Their similarity is an example of convergent evolution; mantidflies do not have tegmina (leathery forewings) like mantises, their antennae are shorter and less thread-like, and the raptorial tibia is more muscular than that of a similar-sized mantis and bends back further in preparation for shooting out to grasp prey.[17]\\r\\nMantises have large, triangular heads with a beak-like snout and mandibles. They have two bulbous compound eyes, three small simple eyes, and a pair of antennae. The articulation of the neck is also remarkably flexible; some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180.[10] The mantis thorax consists of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer than the other two thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing for a wide range of movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.[18][19]\\r\\nMantises have two spiked, grasping forelegs (\\"raptorial legs\\") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four legs of a mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment about as long as the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located at the base of the femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.[18][20]\\r\\nMantises can be loosely categorized as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a mantis has two sets of wings: the outer wings, or tegmina, are usually narrow and leathery. They function as camouflage and as a shield for the hind wings, which are clearer and more delicate.[18][21] The abdomen of all mantises consists of 10 tergites, with a corresponding set of nine sternites visible in males and seven visible in females. The abdomen tends to be slimmer in males than females, but ends in a pair of cerci in both sexes.[18]\\r\\nMantises have stereo vision.[22][23][24] They locate their prey by sight; their compound eyes contain up to 10,000 ommatidia. A small area at the front called the fovea has greater visual acuity than the rest of the eye, and can produce the high resolution necessary to examine potential prey. The peripheral ommatidia are concerned with perceiving motion; when a moving object is noticed, the head is rapidly rotated to bring the object into the visual field of the fovea. Further motions of the prey are then tracked by movements of the mantis's head so as to keep the image centered on the fovea.[20][25] The eyes are widely spaced and laterally situated, affording a wide binocular field of vision and precise stereoscopic vision at close range.[26] The dark spot on each eye that moves as it rotates its head is a pseudopupil. This occurs because the ommatidia that are viewed \\"head-on\\" absorb the incident light, while those to the side reflect it.[27]\\r\\nAs their hunting relies heavily on vision, mantises are primarily diurnal. Many species, however, fly at night, and then may be attracted to artificial lights. Mantises in the family Liturgusidae collected at night have been shown to be predominately males;[28] this is probably true for most mantises. Nocturnal flight is especially important to males in locating less-mobile females by detecting their pheromones. Flying at night exposes mantises to fewer bird predators than diurnal flight would. Many mantises also have an auditory thoracic organ that helps them avoid bats by detecting their echolocation calls and responding evasively.[29][30]\\r\\nMantises are generalist predators of arthropods.[2] The majority of mantises are ambush predators that only feed upon live prey within their reach. They either camouflage themselves and remain stationary, waiting for prey to approach, or stalk their prey with slow, stealthy movements.[31] Larger mantises sometimes eat smaller individuals of their own species,[32] as well as small vertebrates such as lizards, frogs, and small birds.[33][34]\\r\\nMost mantises stalk tempting prey if it strays close enough, and will go further when they are especially hungry.[35] Once within reach, mantises strike rapidly to grasp the prey with their spiked raptorial forelegs.[36] Some ground and bark species pursue their prey in a more active way. For example, members of a few genera such as the ground mantises, Entella, Ligaria, and Ligariella run over dry ground seeking prey, much as tiger beetles do.[18]\\r\\nThe fore gut of some species extends the whole length of the insect and can be used to store prey for digestion later. This may be advantageous in an insect that feeds intermittently.[37] Chinese mantises live longer, grow faster, and produce more young when they are able to eat pollen.[38]\\r\\nMantises are preyed on by vertebrates such as frogs, lizards, and birds, and by invertebrates such as spiders, large species of hornets, and ants.[39] Some hunting wasps, such as some species of Tachytes also paralyse some species of mantis to feed their young.[40] Generally, mantises protect themselves by camouflage, most species being cryptically colored to resemble foliage or other backgrounds, both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey.[41] Those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened so as to eliminate shadows that might reveal their presence.[42] The species from different families called flower mantises are aggressive mimics: they resemble flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar.[43][44][45] Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt towards the end of the dry season; at this time of year, bush fires occur and this coloration enables them to blend in with the fire-ravaged landscape (fire melanism).[42]\\r\\nWhen directly threatened, many mantis species stand tall and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem larger and more threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing (deimatic) threat display, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward the safety of the ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.[42][46][47]\\r\\nMantises, like stick insects, show rocking behavior in which the insect makes rhythmic, repetitive side-to-side movements. Functions proposed for this behavior include the enhancement of crypsis by means of the resemblance to vegetation moving in the wind. However, the repetitive swaying movements may be most important in allowing the insects to discriminate objects from the background by their relative movement, a visual mechanism typical of animals with simpler sight systems. Rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion of objects in the visual field.[48] As ants may be predators of mantises, genera such as Loxomantis, Orthodera, and Statilia, like many other arthropods, avoid attacking them. Exploiting this behavior, a variety of arthropods, including some early-instar mantises, mimic ants to evade their predators.[49]\\r\\nLeaf mimicry: Choeradodis has leaf-like fore wings and a widened green thorax.\\r\\nAdult female Iris oratoria performs a bluffing threat display, rearing back with the forelegs and wings spread and mouth opened.\\r\\nThe jeweled flower mantis, Creobroter gemmatus: the brightly colored wings are opened suddenly in a deimatic display to startle predators.\\r\\nSome mantis nymphs mimic ants to avoid predators.\\r\\nThe mating season in temperate climates typically takes place in autumn,[50][51] while in tropical areas, mating can occur at any time of the year.[51] To mate following courtship, the male usually leaps onto the female's back, clasping her thorax and wing bases with his forelegs. He then arches his abdomen to deposit and store sperm in a special chamber near the tip of the female's abdomen. The female lays between 10 and 400 eggs, depending on the species. Eggs are typically deposited in a froth mass-produced by glands in the abdomen. This froth hardens, creating a protective capsule, which together with the egg mass is called an ootheca. Depending on the species, the ootheca can be attached to a flat surface, wrapped around a plant, or even deposited in the ground. Despite the versatility and durability of the eggs, they are often preyed on, especially by several species of parasitoid wasps. In a few species, mostly ground and bark mantises in the family Tarachodidae, the mother guards the eggs.[50] The cryptic Tarachodes maurus positions herself on bark with her abdomen covering her egg capsule, ambushing passing prey and moving very little until the eggs hatch.[4] An unusual reproductive strategy is adopted by Brunner's stick mantis from the southern United States; no males have ever been found in this species, and the females breed parthenogenetically.[2] The ability to reproduce by parthenogenesis has been recorded in at least two other species, Sphodromantis viridis and Miomantis sp., although these species usually reproduce sexually.[52][53][54] In temperate climates, adults do not survive the winter and the eggs undergo a diapause, hatching in the spring.[5]\\r\\nAs in closely related insect groups in the superorder Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the hemimetabolous insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3ÿ4 weeks as opposed to 4ÿ6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous (\\"short-winged\\"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4ÿ8 weeks, while larger species may live 4ÿ6 months.[2][19]\\r\\nMantis religiosa mating (brown male, green female)\\r\\nStagmomantis carolina laying ootheca\\r\\nRecently laid M. religiosa ootheca\\r\\nHatching from the ootheca\\r\\nSexual cannibalism is common among most predatory species of mantises in captivity. It has sometimes been observed in natural populations, where about a quarter of male-female encounters result in the male being eaten by the female.[55][56][57] Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism.[58] Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage,[5] possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males.[59] In Tenodera sinensis, 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, the probability of a male's being eaten increases cumulatively.[56]\\r\\nThe female may begin feeding by biting off the male's head (as they do with regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's movements may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating.[60] Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.[61]\\r\\nThe reason for sexual cannibalism has been debated; experiments show that females on low quality diets have a higher chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets.[62] Some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring. This theory is supported by a quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed.[63] The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.[61]\\r\\nOne of the earliest mantis references is in the ancient Chinese dictionary Erya, which gives its attributes in poetry, where it represents courage and fearlessness, and a brief description. A later text, the Jingshi Zhenglei Daguan Bencao (\\"Great History of Medical Material Annotated and Arranged by Types, Based upon the Classics and Historical Works\\") from 1108, gives accurate details of the construction of the egg packages, the development cycle, anatomy, and the function of the antennae. Although mantises are rarely mentioned in Ancient Greek sources, a female mantis in threat posture is accurately illustrated on a series of fifth-century BC silver coins, including didrachms, from Metapontum in Sicily.[64] In the 10th century AD, Byzantine era Adages, Suidas describes an insect resembling a slow-moving green locust with long front legs.[65] He translates Zenobius 2.94 with the words seriphos (maybe a mantis) and graus, an old woman, implying a thin, dried-up stick of a body.[66]\\r\\nWestern descriptions of the biology and morphology of the mantises became more accurate in the 18th century. Roesel von Rosenhof illustrated and described mantises and their cannibalistic behavior in the Insekten-Belustigungen (Insect Entertainments).[67]\\r\\nAldous Huxley made philosophical observations about the nature of death while two mantises mated in the sight of two characters in his 1962 novel Island (the species was Gongylus gongylodes). The naturalist Gerald Durrell's humorously autobiographical 1956 book My Family and Other Animals includes a four-page account of an almost evenly matched battle between a mantis and a gecko. Shortly before the fatal dnouement, Durrell narrates:\\r\\nhe [Geronimo the gecko] crashed into the mantis and made her reel, and grabbed the underside of her thorax in his jaws. Cicely [the mantis] retaliated by snapping both her front legs shut on Geronimo's hindlegs. They rustled and staggered across the ceiling and down the wall, each seeking to gain some advantage.[68]\\r\\nM. C. Escher's woodcut Dream depicts a human-sized mantis standing on a sleeping bishop.[69] The 1957 film The Deadly Mantis features a mantis as a giant monster.\\r\\nA cultural trope imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale. The idea is propagated in cartoons by Cable, Guy and Rodd, LeLievre, T. McCracken, and Mark Parisi, among others.[70][71][72][73] It ends Isabella Rossellini's short film about the life of a praying mantis in her 2008 Green Porno season for the Sundance Channel.[74][75]\\r\\nTwo martial arts separately developed in China have movements and fighting strategies based on those of the mantis.[76][77] As one of these arts was developed in northern China, and the other in southern parts of the country, the arts are nowadays referred to (both in English and Chinese) as 'Northern Praying Mantis'[78] and 'Southern Praying Mantis'.[77] Both are very popular in China, and have also been exported to the West in recent decades.[77][78][79][80]\\r\\nThe mantis was revered by the southern African Khoi and San in whose cultures man and nature were intertwined; for its praying posture, the mantis was even named Hottentotsgot (\\"god of the Khoi\\") in the Afrikaans language that had developed among the first European settlers.[81] However, at least for the San, the mantis was only one of the manifestations of a trickster-deity who could assume many other forms, such as a snake, hare or vulture.[82] Several ancient civilizations did consider the insect to have supernatural powers; for the Greeks, it had the ability to show lost travelers the way home; in the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead the \\"bird-fly\\" is a minor god that leads the souls of the dead to the underworld; in a list of 9th-century BC Nineveh grasshoppers (buru), the mantis is named necromancer (buru-enmeli) and soothsayer (buru-enmeli-ashaga).[67][83]\\r\\nMantises are among the insects most widely kept as pets.[84][85] Because the lifespan of a mantis is only about a year, people who want to keep mantises often breed them. In 2013 at least 31 species were kept and bred in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States.[86] In 1996 at least 50 species were known to be kept in captivity by members of the Mantis Study Group.[87] The Independent described the \\"giant Asian praying mantis\\" as \\"part stick insect with a touch of Buddhist monk\\",[88] and stated that they needed a vivarium around 30?cm (12?in) on each side.[88] The Daily South argued that a pet insect was no weirder than a pet rat or ferret, and that while a pet mantis was unusual, it would not \\"bark, shed, [or] need shots or a litter box\\".[89]\\r\\nGardeners who prefer to avoid pesticides may encourage mantises in the hope of controlling insect pests.[90] However, mantises do not have key attributes of biological pest control agents; they do not specialize in a single pest insect, and do not multiply rapidly in response to an increase in such a prey species, but are general predators.[90] They eat whatever they can catch, including both harmful and beneficial insects.[89] They therefore have \\"negligible value\\" in biological control.[90]\\r\\nTwo species, the Chinese mantis and the European mantis, were deliberately introduced to North America in the hope that they would serve as pest controls for agriculture; they have spread widely in both the United States and Canada.[91]\\r\\nA prototype robot inspired by the forelegs of the praying mantis has front legs that allow the robot to walk, climb steps, and grasp objects. The multi-jointed leg provides dexterity via a rotatable joint. Future models may include a more spiked foreleg to improve the grip and ability to support more weight.[92]","input":"What are the enemies of the praying mantis?"},{"output":"Six series","context":"Downton Abbey is a British period drama television series created by Julian Fellowes and co-produced by Carnival Films and Masterpiece.[1] It first aired on ITV in the United Kingdom on 26 September 2010, and on PBS in the United States on 9 January 2011, as part of the Masterpiece Classic anthology.

The Southeast Asian network Animax Asia aired part of the series locally in English.[5]\\r\\nIn 2011, Funimation licensed the first season for an English-language release in North America. The Funimation-dubbed episodes aired on the Funimation Channel. The first DVD set, containing 12 episodes, was released on November 22, 2011.[6] Similarly sized sets followed, with 14 sets released as of December 2, 2014.

Reilly.\\r\\nAn Italian-led production with co-producers in France and the United Kingdom, the film is Garrone's first English-language film. It competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.[4][5]\\r\\nIt is a screen adaptation based on collections of tales by Italian poet and courtier Giambattista Basile: Pentamerone or Lo cunto de li cunti (Tale of Tales, or Entertainment for Little Ones), which contains the earliest versions of famous fables like Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baroque stories manage to mix real and surreal with many metaphorical usages. Pentamerone was a 17th-century collection of Italian fairytales.[7]\\r\\nThe three tales are La Cerva Fatata (The Enchanted Doe), La Pulce (The Flea), La Vecchia Scorticata (The Flayed Old Lady), that have been freely adapted with elements of other tales by Giambattista Basile, as well as a touch of artistic license.[7] All three stories are told in a mixed way, pieced in fragments through the whole film, with all three briefly joining for a royal funeral near the start and a royal coronation at the end.\\r\\nThe first tale begins in the kingdom of Longtrellis, where the King and Queen have tried everything to have a child, but are not successful. The King loves his Queen, but all she desires is a child. One night, a necromancer suggests a risky solution: if the Queen eats the heart of an aquatic dragon cooked by a virgin, she will instantly become with child. However, this will come at the cost of a life. The Queen accepts, not caring about the price. The King sets off to slay the aquatic dragon, and dies doing so. The Queen does not mourn the loss of her husband; she only cares for the dragon's heart. After eating the heart, the queen bears a son, Elias, in one day's time. The servant who cooked the heart for the Queen, who accidentally became pregnant by inhaling the steam from the heart, also gives birth to a boy, Jonah. The two boys are nearly identical and have hair as white as the dragon.\\r\\nAs a young man, Elias's affections are not for the Queen, but for his friend Jonah, whom he views as a brother. This greatly hurts the Queen, who eventually attempts to murder Jonah herself, after finding the boys are so close that Jonah can pretend to be Elias without her knowing. In response, Jonah leaves the kingdom, leaving his mother and Elias behind. Elias is heartbroken and tries to convince Jonah to stay, but Jonah says he must go. Jonah takes a knife and plunges it into the root of a tree, out of which a spring flows forth. Jonah tells Elias that as long as the tree continues to spout clear water, he will know that Jonah is alive and well.\\r\\nOne day, Elias comes to the tree to find the water clouded with blood. He immediately leaves to find Jonah. When Elias arrives in a distant village, Jonah's pregnant sweetheart and friends mistake him for Jonah. By claiming to have lost his memory, Elias discovers that Jonah has been missing since he went to the woods five days ago. Elias goes to search for him.\\r\\nThe Queen has all her subjects look for Elias to no avail. The following night, the necromancer comes again to the Queen and tells her it is her fault that Elias has disappeared ÿ that she has tried to separate what is inseparable. The Queen asks for her son to return. The necromancer says a violent desire such as hers can only be satisfied with violence. Without knowing the terms, the Queen follows the necromancer down the hall.\\r\\nThe next day, Elias finds Jonah wounded in a cave, having fallen through the cave's roof while he was in the woods. They are threatened by a large, bat-like monster. As the two struggle to escape, the bat manages to wound Jonah with its sharp talons. Elias puts himself between Jonah and the bat, and the monster hesitates to strike out again. Elias uses the moment to kill the monster to save Jonah. He returns Jonah to his sweetheart before departing. In the cave, the bat creature's corpse turns to dust, and it is revealed it was the queen, transformed by the necromancer.\\r\\nIn the second story, the lustful King of Strongcliff is intrigued by a mysterious womans heavenly singing. Determined to seduce her, he courts her outside her home, unaware that she is one of two elderly dyer sisters, Imma and Dora. Dora first offers the King the touch of one finger, but the King persists, so Dora agrees to spend the night with him as long as it is in complete darkness, to hide her appearance from him. However, once she is asleep, the King lights a candle to see Dora's face. When he sees her appearance, he is horrified at having slept with her. The King calls for his guards to throw Dora out of the bed chamber window to her apparent death. The bed sheet around Dora becomes entangled in the branches of a tree before she reaches the ground. A witch rescues her from the tree and nurses her from her breast. Dora awakens in the woods as a young, beautiful maiden. Later, the King comes upon her while hunting and decides to make her his Queen.\\r\\nEnjoying her new appearance, Dora sends Imma a gown and an invitation to the wedding festivities at the castle. Dora draws Imma aside at the castle and tells her to keep the secret, as no one would believe her. Dora promises to take care of Imma and tells her that she missed her very much. At the end of the night, Imma refuses to leave the castle and her sister. Dora tells Imma that they can't be together because she might lose everything and sends her away. However, she comes back and asks for the secret to her sister's youth and beauty so that they can be together, but Dora says she doesn't know how it happened, as she woke up that way. Imma doesn't believe her and badgers her for the truth. In annoyance, Dora says she flayed herself and grew new skin. With the King approaching, Dora hides Imma behind a screen and begins to consummate her marriage with the King. Imma is fascinated by the sight and reveals herself. The King sees her and thinks she is the \\"witch\\" he slept with. He calls for his guards to throw her out. Dora tells the King that Imma is her old neighbour and begs him not to hurt her. Outside the castle, Imma tries to find someone who will flay her. She eventually finds a knife sharpener willing to do the job in exchange for her fine jewelry. He takes Imma out into the woods and flays her skin and leaves Imma bloody and disfigured. The last we see of her is as she walks towards the castle, bloody and injured.\\r\\nThe third story arc is about the King of Highhills who lives with his daughter, Violet. Violet loves her father and plays him a song that she has written for him. During the performance, the King is distracted by a flea that can mysteriously move from one of his hands to the other. He captures the flea and hides it in his room as his pet, feeding it his own blood and, later, under-cooked steaks. The flea grows into a gigantic Kafkaesque domesticated creature. When the flea dies, the King is devastated and decides to skin it. He offers to give his daughter as a bride to whoever is able to guess the source of the tanned skin. An ogre solves the riddle and wins the princess as his bride. Violet, who has dreamed of marrying someone handsome and brave, attempts to commit suicide by plunging off the castle's tower to her death, but her father stops her, saying he had never intended for this to happen but can't go back on his word. In tears, Violet agrees to go through with the marriage, stating that her father never loved her at all.\\r\\nThe Ogre takes Violet to his cave near the top of a mountain, where she is raped and kept prisoner. One day while the Ogre is hunting, Violet spots a woman, who is an entertainer, on the other side of the cliff. She begs the woman for help. The woman tells her she will return tomorrow with her sons. The next day, the woman and her husband and sons try to save the Princess by tying a rope to the other side of the cliff, with one of the sons walking across it while carrying the Princess on his back. As the entertainers' son is walking across the tightrope, the Ogre notices the Princess's absence and is enraged that the Princess has been taken. However, they manage to cut the rope before the Ogre reaches them, and the Ogre falls to the depths below. However, the Ogre manages to survive, and finds the group, slaying the entertainers' entire family. He is about to kill the Princess, but she placates him with tender gestures. He relents and motions for the Princess to climb onto his back, so he can take her back to the cave. The Princess pretends to get on by placing an arm around him and slits his throat with a knife hidden in the hand of her other arm.\\r\\nDuring the time that Violet has been away, the King has grown ill. When Violet returns, the King breaks down in tears. Violet throws the Ogre's head at her father's feet and reminds him that this is the husband he chose for her, his daughter. After the King falls to his knees, the subjects follow suit, suggesting she is now Queen. Seeing her father in tears, Violet, too, begins to cry.\\r\\nIn the end, Elias, Dora, and her lustful King are among the guests present at Kingdom Highhills for Violet's official coronation as Queen. There, Elias nods to her, as well as the King of Strongcliff. As Violet's father walks her to the throne, everyone in the crowd looks up to the sky, where an entertainer is walking across a tightrope that is on fire. At this time, Dora's beauty begins to fade and she begins to return to her former state. Before anyone notices what is happening to her, she manages to flee the Highhills castle alone.\\r\\nDirector Garrone has said that although the three stories have distinct themes, they are all connected to the idea of desire that can lead to obsession. Although screenplays were written for other tales in the Basile collection, those filmed told the story of \\"a woman in three different stages of her life\\": youth, motherhood and advancing age.[8]\\r\\nIn all three tales, desire and obsession led to the characters' ultimate downfall. The Queen of Longtrellis's desire for a child consumed her, but she also wished for that love to be reciprocated by the child to her. When Elias did not reciprocate her love, she tried to murder Jonah, which was the person who made Elias happy. Rather than sacrificing her happiness knowing Elias had a soulmate friend, she tried to remove that relationship in hope it would further her relationship with her son. That desire ultimately led to her death by the hands of her own son, who was a product of her own desire.\\r\\nThe King of Highills was so fixated on the flea that he lost sight of being a father and sacrificed his daughter, who looked up to him and loved him. The flea was a gross creature and meant to symbolize a hobby or other small, unimportant matter that a parent may indulge rather than focusing on their children. In the end, this mistake stripped the King of both his royal and paternal title. Unlike all the other characters, the King seemed truly repentant for what he had done and was consumed by grief and illness until his daughter's return. However, his prior actions and fixation on the flea can never erase the trauma Violet had to undergo by being raped and held captive by the ogre. Further, the entertainer's entire family were killed by the ogre in an attempt to save the Princess when the King himself did nothing to rescue her and whose lack of regard and foolishness led to his daughter's plight. It was his daughter who ultimately had to save herself, disgracing the King not only as a King, but as a father as well.\\r\\nThe Lustful King of Strongcliff desired sexual gratification and used his subjects to that regard. However, this addiction led him to sleep with Dora, who was an old woman, based on the illusion of what is beautiful. The reality of the Lustful King having slept with Dora as an old maid disgusts the King so much that he attempts to throw Dora to her death, claiming that she is a witch. Yet, Dora protests that the Lustful King demanded her presence, which was true. Yet, he falls in love with Dora and makes her his Queen once she is transformed into a beautiful maiden. The moral of the story is that the eyes can be misleading and what you see or believe you see should not be substituted for the truth of what is. On the flip-side, Dora is no different than the Lustful King she eventually marries - she desires wealth, title and sexual passions. When she receives youth, Dora traded Imma, who had been with her forever, for the man who had cast her to her death days before. This leads to Dora's condemnation to live the rest of her days alone and without Imma. For the Lustful King, he will never stop searching for his Queen who appeared to be the cure for his lustful addiction, when in fact, Dora was merely a reflection of himself that he could not see.\\r\\nAccording to Matteo Garrone, he was drawn to Giambattista Basile's stories for their mix of the real and the unreal, and because he found the themes in many of them to still be highly relevant. Garrone had previously been best known for employing a naturalist style in films such as Gomorrah, but argued that all his previous films also have a fairytale aspect to their narratives.[1] An important source of inspiration was Francisco Goya's Los caprichos collection of etchings. For Garrone, they encapsulated the mood of Basile's tales.[9]\\r\\nTale of Tales had a budget corresponding to USD$14.5 million.[1] It was produced through Garrone's company Archimede Film, with co-production support from France's Le Pact and Britain's Recorded Picture Company. It received financing from Rai Cinema and additional support from MiBACT and Eurimages.[10]\\r\\nPrincipal photography commenced on 15 May 2014 and lasted four months.[10] The film was shot entirely on location in various parts of Italy, including Naples (Royal Palace, Palace of Capodimonte and its gardens); Apulia's Castel del Monte (octagonal castle appears in the poster near Vincent Cassel), Gioia del Colle (in particular the throne room), Laterza, Mottola, Statte; Sicily's Donnafugata Castle (gothic castle, stone labyrinth and gardens) and Gole dell'Alcantara in Alcantara (mainly scenes of sea dragon); Abruzzo's Castello di Roccascalegna (appears in the poster with Castel del Monte); Tuscany's Moorish castle of Sammezzano, the towns of Sorano and Sovana (tuff caves); and Lazio (Bosco del Sasseto in Viterbo).[11][12][13][14][15][16][17]\\r\\nThe team made an effort to find places that would remind the viewer of studio sets. Digital effects were artisanal integrations of something that had to look as believable as possible, in reference to images of heraldry or depictions of seventeenth-century landscapes.[1]\\r\\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 82% approval rating based on reviews from 94 critics, with an average rating of 7 out of 10.[18] On Metacritic, the film has received a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[19]","input":"What fairy tales are tale of tales based on?"},{"output":"Financial Services Authority","context":"A securities commission is a government department or agency responsible for financial regulation of securities products within a particular country. Its powers and responsibilities vary greatly from country to country, but generally cover the setting of rules as well as enforcing them for financial intermediaries and stock exchanges.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs long as there have been securities there have been regulations. However, in the early days this consisted primarily of self-regulated groups or societies. External government regulation has primarily been driven by financial crises or scandals.\\r\\nAs early as the 13th century the king Edward I of England decreed that brokers should be licensed after he was forced to go to local money brokers that give much less favorable terms then his Italian brokers after the start of the Anglo-French war.\\r\\nIn 1720 the British Parliament passed the Bubble Act which had specific regulations for securities. However the motive of this act was more to support the South Sea bubble than protect consumers. However this was the first time that prospectuses and disclosure in the modern sense were used. There was widespread distrust of brokers as the scams collapsed.\\r\\nIn the United States, although Massachusetts required the registration of railroad securities as early as 1852, and other states passed laws relating to securities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the real push for securities regulation came from the Midwestern and far western states. After common feeling that investors in these areas of the country were being victimized by capitalists in the east.\\r\\nHowever it was the failure of the Blue sky law and the 1930 financial crisis and Great Depression that led the United States government to pass legislation in 1934 to strengthen securities law and for the first time create a separate agency the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\r\\nIn the early 1980s as many countries deregulated their financial markets, they created specific government agencies to police the securities markets and stock exchanges so as to separate regulation from operation of financial markets. Some countries like the UK, created one large agency that covered all financial products. However, some countries use a different model where there are separate agencies for different financial products. Typically, securities, banking and insurance are split, but there may also be separate agencies for futures, options and commodities.\\r\\nWith the advent of derivatives and new financial products it has not always been easy to see who has jurisdiction and what their responsibilities are. A fact, that some unscrupulous financial companies have used to their advantage to skirt existing regulation.\\r\\nThe Financial crisis of 2007ÿ2010 has seen much criticism of the securities regulators for failing to stop abuses of markets and their slowness in responding to the crisis and having suffered regulatory capture.\\r\\nMost securities commissions are semi-independent government organisations that have a board of commissioners, usually appointed by the government of the country. They are often fully or partially funded by the organisations that are regulated through charges such as registration and licensing fees.\\r\\nThere is no common name for securities commission or financial regulatory agency in each country. Naming has become more complicated as some governments have consolidated or merged organisations and given them a wider remit. They sometimes contain the term securities and commission. Such as the Securities and Exchange Commission of the US or Securities and Futures Commission (Hong Kong). A number also have names based on Financial Authority, such as the Financial Services Authority of the UK or Financial Supervisory Authority (Sweden) or variations such as the Financial Services Agency (Japan).\\r\\nMost securities commissions have a mandate to protect consumers, make sure there is an orderly and stable financial market and that brokers and participants behave fairly with clients and each other. Often local stock exchanges as well as brokers are covered by the commission.\\r\\nMost financial regulators are members of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), an organisation that helps securities commissions cooperate. The main way that securities commission cooperate is through the IOSCO Memorandum of Understanding, or through bilateral agreements between securities commissions.\\r\\nWithin the European Union there is the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) which is advisory body for the European Commission [1] which attempts to coordinate rules between EU securities commissions.","input":"What is the uk equivalent of the sec?"},{"output":"eleven","context":"","input":"How many states made up the confederate states of america?"},{"output":"1775ÿ1783","context":"","input":"When was the american war of independence fought?"},{"output":"June 29, 2007","context":"In April 2003, at the \\"All Things Digital\\" executive conference, Jobs expressed his belief that tablet PCs and traditional PDAs were not good choices as high-demand markets for Apple to enter, despite receiving many requests for Apple to create another PDA. He believed that cell phones were going to become important devices for portable information access, and that mobile phones needed to have excellent synchronization software. At that time, instead of focusing on a follow-up to their Newton PDA, Jobs had Apple focus on the iPod. Jobs also had Apple develop the iTunes software, which can be used to synchronize content with iPod devices. iTunes was released in January 2001.[10][11][12][13] On September 7, 2005, Apple and Motorola released the ROKR E1, the first mobile phone to use iTunes. Jobs was unhappy with the ROKR, feeling that having to compromise with a non-Apple designer (Motorola) prevented Apple from designing the phone they wanted to make.[14] In September 2006, Apple discontinued support for the ROKR, and released a version of iTunes that included references to an as-yet unknown mobile phone that could display pictures and video.[15]\\r\\nOn January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs announced iPhone at the Macworld convention, receiving substantial media attention.[16] Jobs announced that the first iPhone would be released later that year. On June 29, 2007, the first iPhone[17] was released.\\r\\nOn June 11, 2007, Apple announced at the Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference that the iPhone would support third-party applications using the Safari engine. Third parties would be able to create Web 2.0 applications, which users could access via the internet.[18] Such applications appeared even before the release of the iPhone; the first of these, called OneTrip, was a program meant to keep track of users' shopping lists.[19] On June 29, 2007, Apple released version 7.3 of iTunes to coincide with the release of iPhone.[20] This release contains support for iPhone service activation and syncing.\\r\\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the iPhone is manufactured in the Shenzhen factory of the Taiwanese company Hon Hai (also known as Foxconn).[21] Also, according to recent news, Apple will shortly begin outsourcing the manufacturing of iPhones.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Apple released the iPhone on January 9, 2007,[23] it was sold only with AT&T (formerly Cingular) contracts in the United States.[14] After 18 months of negotiations, Steve Jobs reached an agreement with the wireless division of AT&T to be the iPhone's exclusive carrier. Consumers were unable to use any other carrier without unlocking their device.\\r\\nApple retained control of the design, manufacturing and marketing of the iPhone.[24] Since some customers were jailbreaking their iPhones to leave their network, AT&T began charging them a $175 early-termination fee for leaving before the end of their contract.[25]\\r\\nQuestions arose about the legality of Apple's arrangement after the iPhone was released.[26] Two class-action lawsuits were filed against the company in October 2007: one in Federal court and the other in state court.[27] According to the suits, Apple's exclusive agreement with AT&T violated antitrust law.[28]\\r\\nThe state-court suit, filed by the law office of Damian R. Fernandez on behalf of California resident Timothy P. Smith,[28] sought an injunction barring Apple from selling iPhones with a software lock and $200 million in damages.[29] In Smith v. Apple Inc., the plaintiffs said that Apple failed to disclose to purchasers its five-year agreement with AT&T when they bought iPhones with a two-year contract and cited the Sherman Act's prohibition of monopolies.[30]\\r\\nThe second case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiff, Paul Holman, filed a complaint against Apple and AT&T Mobility that he could not switch carriers or change SIM cards without losing iPhone improvements to which he was entitled. Holman also cited a Sherman Act violation by the defendants.[31] On July?8, 2010, the case was affirmed for class certification.[32] On December 9 the court ordered a stay on the case, awaiting the Supreme Court's decision in AT&T v. Concepcion (disputed whether the state's basic standards of fairness were met by a clause in AT&T's contract limiting complaint resolution to arbitration).[33] On April 27, 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that AT&T met the state's fairness standards.[34]\\r\\nThe first advertisement for iPhone, titled \\"Hello\\", aired during the 79th Academy Awards on February 25, 2007, on American Broadcasting Company (ABC).[35] On June 4, 2007, Apple released four advertisements announcing that iPhone would be released on June 29, 2007.\\r\\nOn July 1, 2007, it was reported that Apple paid at least US$1 million to Michael Kovatch for the iPhone.com domain name, previously owned by Kovatch since 1995.[36] The URL now redirects to Apple's iPhone page.\\r\\nOn June 28, 2007, during an address to Apple employees, Steve Jobs announced that all full-time Apple employees and those part-time employees who had been with the company for at least one year would receive a free iPhone. Employees received their phones in July after the initial demand for iPhones subsided.[37]\\r\\nInitially priced at US $499 and US $599 for the 4GB models and 8GB models respectively, the iPhone went on sale on June 29, 2007. Apple closed its stores at 2:00pm local time to prepare for the 6:00pm iPhone launch, while hundreds of customers lined up at stores nationwide.[38]\\r\\nIn the US and some other countries, iPhones could only be acquired with a credit card, preventing completely anonymous purchases of iPhones.[39][40][41] At the time, there was no way to opt out of the bundled AT&T data plan. At first, iPhones could not be added to an AT&T Business account, and any existing business account discounts could not be applied to an iPhone AT&T account. AT&T changed these restrictions in late January 2008.[42]\\r\\nThe Associated Press also reported in 2007 that some users were unable to activate their phones because, according to AT&T, \\"[a] high volume of activation requests [was] taxing the company's computer servers.\\"[43][44] On Oct 29, 2007, the Usenet newsgroup misc.phone.mobile.iphone was created.[relevant? ÿ discuss]\\r\\nEarly estimates by technology analysts estimated sales of between 250,000 and 700,000 iPhones in the first weekend alone, with strong sales continuing after the initial weekend.[45][46] As part of their quarterly earnings announcement, AT&T reported that 146,000 iPhones were activated in the first weekend. Though this figure does not include units that were purchased for resale on eBay or otherwise not activated until after the opening weekend, it is still less than most initial estimates.[47] It is also estimated that 95% of the units sold are the 8GB model.[48]\\r\\nStories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press a little more than a month after iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release.[49] The 300-page iPhone bill in a box received by iJustine on Saturday, August 11, 2007[50][51] became the subject of a viral video, posted by the following Monday, which quickly became an Internet meme.[52][53] This video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention of the mass media. Ten days later, after the video had been viewed more than 3 million times on the Internet,[54] and had received international news coverage, AT&T sent iPhone users a text message outlining changes in its billing practices.[55]\\r\\nOn September 5, 2007, the 4GB model was discontinued, and the 8GB model price was cut by a third, from US $599 to US $399.[56] Those who had purchased an iPhone in the 14-day period before the September 5, 2007 announcement were eligible for a US $200 \\"price protection\\" rebate from Apple or AT&T. However, it was widely reported that some who bought between the June 29, 2007 launch and the August 22, 2007 price protection kick-in date complained that this was a larger-than-normal price drop for such a relatively short period and accused Apple of unfair pricing.[57][58]\\r\\nIn response to customer complaints, on September 6, 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs wrote in an open letter to iPhone customers that everyone who purchased an iPhone at the higher price \\"and who is not receiving a rebate or other consideration\\", would receive a US$100 credit to be redeemed towards the purchase of any product sold in Apple's retail or online stores.[59]\\r\\nWith the July 11, 2008 release of the iPhone 3G, Apple and AT&T changed the US pricing model from the previous generation. Following the de facto model for mobile phone service in the United States, AT&T would subsidize a sizable portion of the upfront cost for the iPhone 3G, followed by charging moderately higher monthly fees over a minimum two-year contract.[60]\\r\\nOn January 11, 2011, Verizon announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a CDMA iPhone 4. The Verizon iPhone went on sale on February 10, 2011.[61][62][63]\\r\\nDuring Apple's official unveiling of iPhone 4S on October 4, 2011, it was announced that Sprint would begin carrying the reconfigured CDMA iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S in the US on October 14.[64][65] Cricket Wireless announced on May 31, 2012 that it would become the first prepaid carrier in the US to offer iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, beginning June 22, 2012.[66] A week later, Virgin Mobile USA became the second American prepaid carrier to offer iPhone 4 and 4S, announcing plans to release the phones on June 29, 2012.[67] Due to T-Mobile USA's inability to provide iPhone to customers raised its subscription churn rate, put the unit in an \\"unsustainable position\\", and contributed to parent Deutsche Telekom's decision to sell it to AT&T in March 2011;[clarify] T-Mobile began offering iPhone on April 12, 2013.[68]\\r\\nMedia reports emerged in early August 2013 that announced that Apple would be launching its next iPhone model on September 10, 2013, but further details were not available. Brian Barrett, Managing Editor of the Gizmodo publication, speculated that either an upgraded version of iPhone 5 or a budget version would be released.[69]\\r\\nOn November 9, 2007, the iPhone was officially launched in Europe, in the United Kingdom and Germany.[clarify] In the UK, sales go through the UK O2 unit of Telef܇nica, while in Germany, it is offered through Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile division.[clarify] As in the case of the previous launch in the US, customers lined up as much as a day in advance to obtain the much-anticipated phone.[70]\\r\\nApple occasionally produced a limited number of 4GB iPhones for German and UK markets, but they never reached end customers and were used as in-store demo units. Later[when?] most of the units were disposed of.[71]\\r\\nThe initial operating model of locking iPhone owners to one selected carrier has been controversial in Europe. In Germany, Vodafone, an operator competing with the operator that Apple had locked German iPhone sales to (Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile division), brought a legal case[clarify] claiming that the arrangement was against German law. On November 20, 2007, an interim court order resulted in sales of locked iPhones in Germany being temporarily stopped.

On July 3, 2007, Jon Lech Johansen reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked iPhone's other features with jailbreaking. He published the software and offsets for others to use.[117] On August 14, 2007, Gizmodo reported verification of a method to bypass iPhone's SIM lock, allowing the phone to work freely with carriers other than AT&T. This method requires usage of a Turbo SIM card, costing approximately US$80; the method essentially tricks iPhone into believing that it is operating on the AT&T network, even when it is connected natively (not in roaming mode) to another carrier.[118] Australian Personal Computer later published a ten-step guide to unlocking iPhone, using the Turbo SIM method.[119]\\r\\nIn mid-August, UniquePhones announced an unlocking service for iPhone, only to retract the service the following week after receiving a phone call from a lawyer representing AT&T. On August 24, 2007, George Hotz, a 17-year-old hacker from Glen Rock, New Jersey, broke the lock that ties iPhone to AT&T's wireless network. He confirmed that he unlocked the phone and was using it on T-Mobile's network. The hack opened up a realm of possibilities for overseas customers because iPhone was only sold in the United States at the time. By unlocking it, Hotz opened up the phone to phone networks across the world. Hotz posted the hack on his blog. The process is complicated and requires both disassembling iPhone and executing software commands on a personal computer. Hotz, along with four others across the world, reportedly spent about 500 hours unlocking the phone.[120][121]\\r\\nAlso on August 24, 2007, Engadget reported, by way of photos and a video clip, that they were called by the \\"iPhoneSimFree\\" team, who offered to show Engadget a demonstration of unlocking iPhone using a software-only method.[122] Unlike Hotz's hardware hack, the code in this hack was not made available to the general public. Sales of the unlock started on September 10. These sales occurred through several resellers who were able to order \\"keys\\" from iPhoneSimFree, then pass the \\"keys\\" to customers, allowing the customers to use the software. On September 11, after one day of sales, the iPhone Dev Team announced that they had created a working \\"software unlock\\", and released it to the public for free.[123] Utilizing the existing unlock[clarify] requires some technical knowledge, although a simpler, GUI-based version was under construction. AnySim and iUnlock Reloaded, two free, GUI-based unlocking programs, have since been made available.\\r\\nOn September 24, 2007 Apple issued a warning that future updates could render unlocked iPhones unusable.[124] On September 27, 2007, owners of unlocked iPhones who took advantage of the version 1.1.1 update through iTunes reported that the update rendered the device virtually inoperable.[125] There were also reports that the update even affected some iPhones that were not unlocked,[126] and Engadget found that the firmware update had \\"bricked\\" unhacked iPhones as well. The firmware update relocks iPhones, but on October 11 iPhoneSIMFree announced that they had hacked the 1.1.1 iPhone update, not only unlocking them but also unbricking those iPhones which were bricked by the update.[127]\\r\\nOn October 16, 2007, the iPhone Dev Team released AnySIM 1.1, the free utility that unlocks iPhones. The updated version works on firmware version 1.1.1, but doesn't fix baseband problems caused by updating an unlocked 1.0.2 phone up to 1.1.1.[128] On October 23, 2007, the iPhone Elite Dev-Team released Revirginizing Tool to rebuild the lock table in the seczone area to repair the damage done by the original anySIM 1.0x unlockers so unlocked 1.0.2 iPhones can upgrade to 1.1.1 without bricking iPhone. The tool is unbricking the previously bricked iPhones.[129]\\r\\nOn November 21, 2007, T-Mobile announced that due to litigation commenced against them by their competitor Vodafone, which resulted in a preliminary injunction preventing T-Mobile from locking the SIM card to T-Mobile in Germany, it will sell the phone \\"unlocked\\" and will offer iPhone without a T-Mobile contract for ?999 (US$1,478) at its shops to customers in Germany until the court renders a decision.[130] By the end of November, Apple released another version of iPhone firmware, 1.1.2. This version does not have many new features but breaks unlocks.[citation needed] During Macworld '08, on January 15, Apple released the fifth version of iPhone firmware, 1.1.3; this version repairs loopholes used by \\"iPhone Hackers.\\" The firmware, however, had been compromised prior to release and new security measures were quickly bypassed.[citation needed] On February 8, 2008, Geohot released the first full software unlock for the 1.1.2 & 1.1.3 OTB iPhones.","input":"When was iphone launched for the first time?"},{"output":"Villanova","context":"The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's Division I Basketball Championship, or NCAA Tournament, is a single-elimination tournament for men's college basketball teams in the United States.

The 2007 census found that the permanent population of Fiji was 837,000. The population density at the time was 45.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall life expectancy in Fiji was 72.1 years. Since the 1930s the population of Fiji has increased at a rate of 1.1% per year. Since the 1950s, Fiji's birth rate has continuously exceeded its death rate. The population is dominated by the 15ÿ64 age segment. The median age of the population was 27.9, and the gender ratio of the total population was 1.03 males per 1 female.\\r\\nIndigenous Fijians, the native inhabitants of Fiji, are a mixture of Polynesian and Melanesian, resulting from the original migrations to the South Pacific over time. The Indo-Fijian population increased rapidly from the 61,000 people brought from India between 1879 and 1916 to work in the sugarcane fields, many who later would lease/own the sugar cane plantations. Thousands more Indians migrated voluntarily in the 1920s and 1930s and formed the core of Fiji's business class.\\r\\nIn 1977 The Economist reported that ethnic Fijians were a minority of 255,000, in a total population of 600,000 of which fully half were of Indian descent, with the remainder Chinese, European and of mixed ancestry.[2] Fiji shares with Kazakhstan the distinction of its indigenous ethnic group having been a minority in its own country in recent history but having since regained its majority, in both cases due to large-scale emigration and lower birth rates of the non-indigenous ethnic population.\\r\\nThe native Fijians live throughout the country, while the Indo-Fijians reside primarily near the urban centres and in the cane-producing areas of the two main islands. Nearly all of the indigenous Fijians are Christian, with some two-thirds being Methodist.

The Japanese used the British Army's Selarang Barracks, near the prison, as a prisoner of war camp, holding some 50,000 Allied soldiers, predominantly British and Australian; and from 1943, Dutch civilians brought over by the Japanese from the islands in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).[1] POWs were in fact rarely, if ever, held in the civilian prison. Nevertheless, in the UK, Australia, The Netherlands and elsewhere, the name \\"Changi\\" became synonymous with the infamous POW camp nearby.\\r\\nAbout 850 POWs died during their internment in Changi during the Japanese occupation of Singapore,[2] a relatively low rate compared to the overall death rate of 27% for POWs in Japanese camps.[3] However, many more prisoners died after being transferred from Changi to various labour camps outside Singapore, including the Burma Railway and the Sandakan airfield.\\r\\nAllied POWs, mainly Australians, built a chapel at the prison in 1944 using simple tools and found materials. Stanley Warren of the 15th Regiment, Royal Regiment of Artillery painted a series of murals at the chapel. Another British POW, Sgt. Harry Stodgen built a Christian cross out of a used artillery shell. After the war, the chapel was dismantled and shipped to Australia, while the cross was sent to the UK. The chapel was reconstructed in 1988, and is now located at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Canberra.\\r\\nAfter the war, the prison was used to hold former Japanese staff officers, Kempeitai, police, and guards from concentration camps. Executions were conducted in the inner yard where three gallows were erected. British soldiers were stationed there as prison guards. On 17 October 1945, all 260 German seamen of the former U-Boats were moved from Pasir Panjang to the prison.

It consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red (top and bottom) alternating with white, with a blue rectangle in the canton (referred to specifically as the \\"union\\") bearing fifty small, white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows, where rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternate with rows of five stars. The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America, and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and became the first states in the U.S.[1] Nicknames for the flag include The Stars and Stripes,[2] Old Glory,[3] and The Star-Spangled Banner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current design of the U.S. flag is its 27th; the design of the flag has been modified officially 26 times since 1777. The 48-star flag was in effect for 47 years until the 49-star version became official on July 4, 1959. The 50-star flag was ordered by the then president Eisenhower on August 21, 1959, and was adopted in July 1960. It is the longest-used version of the U.S. flag and has been in use for over 57 years.[4]\\r\\nThe Continental Colors\\r\\n(aka the \\"Grand Union Flag\\")\\r\\nFlag of the British East India Company, 1707ÿ1801\\r\\nAt the time of the Declaration of Independence in July 1776, the Continental Congress would not legally adopt flags with \\"stars, white in a blue field\\" for another year. The flag contemporaneously known as \\"the Continental Colors\\" has historically been referred to as the first national flag.[5]\\r\\nThe Continental Navy raised the Colors as the ensign of the fledgling nation in the American War for Independencelikely with the expedient of transforming their previous British red ensigns by adding white stripesand would use this flag until 1777, when it would form the basis for the subsequent de jure designs.[5][6]\\r\\nThe name \\"Grand Union\\" was first applied to the Continental Colors by George Preble in his 1872 history of the U.S. flag.[6]\\r\\nThe flag closely resembles the British East India Company flag of the era, and Sir Charles Fawcett argued in 1937 that the company flag inspired the design.[7] Both flags could have been easily constructed by adding white stripes to a British Red Ensign, one of the three maritime flags used throughout the British Empire at the time. However, an East India Company flag could have from nine to 13 stripes, and was not allowed to be flown outside the Indian Ocean.[8]\\r\\nIn any case, both the stripes (barry) and the stars (mullets) have precedents in classical heraldry. Mullets were comparatively rare in early modern heraldry, but an example of mullets representing territorial divisions predating the U.S. flag are those in the coat of arms of Valais of 1618, where seven mullets stood for seven districts.\\r\\nOn June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress passed the Flag Resolution which stated: \\"Resolved, That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\\"[9] Flag Day is now observed on June 14 of each year. While scholars still argue about this, tradition holds that the new flag was first hoisted in June 1777 by the Continental Army at the Middlebrook encampment.[10]\\r\\nThe first official U.S. flag flown during battle was on August 3, 1777, at Fort Schuyler (Fort Stanwix) during the Siege of Fort Stanwix. Massachusetts reinforcements brought news of the adoption by Congress of the official flag to Fort Schuyler. Soldiers cut up their shirts to make the white stripes; scarlet material to form the red was secured from red flannel petticoats of officers' wives, while material for the blue union was secured from Capt. Abraham Swartwout's blue cloth coat. A voucher is extant that Capt. Swartwout of Dutchess County was paid by Congress for his coat for the flag.[11]\\r\\nThe 1777 resolution was most probably meant to define a naval ensign. In the late 18th century, the notion of a national flag did not yet exist, or was only nascent. The flag resolution appears between other resolutions from the Marine Committee. On May 10, 1779, Secretary of the Board of War Richard Peters expressed concern \\"it is not yet settled what is the Standard of the United States.\\"[12] However, the term, \\"Standard,\\" referred to a national standard for the Army of the United States. Each regiment was to carry the national standard in addition to its regimental standard. The national standard was not a reference to the national or naval flag.[13]\\r\\nThe Flag Resolution did not specify any particular arrangement, number of points, nor orientation for the stars and the arrangement or whether the flag had to have seven red stripes and six white ones or vice versa.[14] The appearance was up to the maker of the flag. Some flag makers arranged the stars into one big star, in a circle or in rows and some replaced a state's star with its initial.[15] One arrangement features 13 five-pointed stars arranged in a circle, with the stars arranged pointing outwards from the circle (as opposed to up), the so-called Betsy Ross flag. This flag, however, is more likely a flag used for celebrations of anniversaries of the nation's birthday. Experts have dated the earliest known example of this flag to be 1792 in a painting by John Trumbull.[16]\\r\\nDespite the 1777 resolution, the early years of American independence featured many different flags. Most were individually crafted rather than mass-produced. While there are many examples of 13-star arrangements, some of those flags included blue stripes as well as red and white. Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, in a letter dated October 3, 1778, to Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, described the American flag as consisting of \\"13 stripes, alternately red, white, and blue, a small square in the upper angle, next the flag staff, is a blue field, with 13 white stars, denoting a new Constellation.\\"[17] John Paul Jones used a variety of 13-star flags on his U.S. Navy ships including the well-documented 1779 flags of the Serapis and the Alliance. The Serapis flag had three rows of eight-pointed stars with stripes that were red, white, and blue. The flag for the Alliance, however, had five rows of eight-pointed stars with 13 red and white stripes, and the white stripes were on the outer edges.[18] Both flags were documented by the Dutch government in October 1779, making them two of the earliest known flags of 13 stars.[19]\\r\\nFrancis Hopkinson of New Jersey, a naval flag designer, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, designed the 1777 flag[20] while he was the Chairman of the Continental Navy Board's Middle Department, sometime between his appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the flag resolution was adopted in June 1777. The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee.[21] Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag, but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy. Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime, when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work. These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting's biography of Hopkinson. Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress, via the Continental Board of Admiralty, on May 25, 1780.[22] In this letter, he asked for a \\"Quarter Cask of the Public Wine\\" as payment for designing the U.S. flag, the seal for the Admiralty Board, the seal for the Treasury Board, Continental currency, the Great Seal of the United States, and other devices. However, in three subsequent bills to Congress, Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash, but he did not list his U.S. flag design. Instead, he asked to be paid for designing the \\"great Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the first bill; the \\"Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the second bill; and \\"the Naval Flag of the States\\" in the third, along with the other items. The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed, that is, a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones. The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea. By contrast, Hopkinson's flag for the United States had seven white stripes, and six red ones ÿ in reality, six red stripes laid on a white background.[23] Hopkinson's sketches have not been found, but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty (naval) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time. His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes;[24] whereas, his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones.[25] Hopkinson's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag. Remnants of Hopkinson's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President's seal.[23] When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board, his position was like that of today's Secretary of the Navy.[26] The payment was not made, however, because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress.[27][28] This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag, which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776.[29][30] Furthermore, a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10, 1779, documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army's use in battle.[31]\\r\\nThe origin of the stars and stripes design has been muddled by a story disseminated by the descendants of Betsy Ross. The apocryphal story credits Betsy Ross for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch handed to her by George Washington. No evidence for this exists either in the diaries of George Washington nor in the records of the Continental Congress. Indeed, nearly a century passed before Ross' grandson, William Canby, first publicly suggested the story in 1870.[32] By her family's own admission, Ross ran an upholstery business, and she had never made a flag as of the supposed visit in June 1776.[33] Furthermore, her grandson admitted that his own search through the Journals of Congress and other official records failed to find corroboration of his grandmother's story.[34]\\r\\nThe family of Rebecca Young claimed that she sewed the first flag.[35] Young's daughter was Mary Pickersgill, who made the Star Spangled Banner Flag.[36][37] According to rumor, the Washington family coat of arms, shown in a 15th-century window of Selby Abbey, was the origin of the stars and stripes.[38]\\r\\nIn 1795, the number of stars and stripes was increased from 13 to 15 (to reflect the entry of Vermont and Kentucky as states of the Union). For a time the flag was not changed when subsequent states were admitted, probably because it was thought that this would cause too much clutter. It was the 15-star, 15-stripe flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\", later known as \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", which is now the American national anthem. The flag is currently on display in the exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem\\" at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History in a two-story display chamber that protects the flag while it is on view.[39]\\r\\nOn April 4, 1818, a plan was passed by Congress at the suggestion of U.S. Naval Captain Samuel C. Reid[40] in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars, with a new star to be added when each new state was admitted, but the number of stripes would be reduced to 13 so as to honor the original colonies. The act specified that new flag designs should become official on the first July 4 (Independence Day) following admission of one or more new states. The most recent change, from 49 stars to 50, occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen, after Hawaii gained statehood in August 1959. Before that, the admission of Alaska in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short-lived 49-star flag.[41]\\r\\nPrior to the adoption of the 48-star flag in 1912, there was no official arrangement of the stars in the canton, although the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy used standardized designs. Throughout the 19th century there was an abundance of different star patterns, rectangular and circular.\\r\\nOn July 4, 2007, the 50-star flag became the version of the flag in longest use, surpassing the 48-star flag that was used from 1912 to 1959.\\r\\nThe U.S. flag was brought to the city of Canton (GuҊngzhu) in China in 1784 by the merchant ship Empress of China, which carried a cargo of ginseng.[42] There it gained the designation \\"Flower Flag\\" (Chinese: ; pinyin: huq; Cantonese Yale: fke).[43] According to a pseudonymous account first published in the Boston Courier and later retold by author and U.S. naval officer George H. Preble:\\r\\nWhen the thirteen stripes and stars first appeared at Canton, much curiosity was excited among the people. News was circulated that a strange ship had arrived from the further end of the world, bearing a flag \\"as beautiful as a flower.\\" Every body went to see the kwa kee chuen [; Fkesyhn], or \\"flower flagship.\\" This name at once established itself in the language, and America is now called the kwa kee kwoh [??; Fkegwok], the \\"flower flag country\\"and an American, kwa kee kwoh yin [??; Fkegwokyhn]\\"flower flag countryman\\"a more complimentary designation than that of \\"red headed barbarian\\"the name first bestowed upon the Dutch.[44][45]\\r\\nIn the above quote, the Chinese words are written phonetically based on spoken Cantonese. The names given were common usage in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[46] Other Asian nations have equivalent terms for America, for example Vietnamese: Hoa K? (\\"Flower Flag\\"). Chinese now refer to the United States as simplified Chinese: ˇ; traditional Chinese: ˇ??; pinyin: Migu܇. Mi is short for Miljin (simplified Chinese: ˇͫ; traditional Chinese: ˇͫ??, phono-semantic matching of \\"American\\") and \\"gu܇\\" means \\"country\\", so this name is unrelated to the flag. However, the \\"flower flag\\" terminology persists in some places today: for example, American Ginseng is called simplified Chinese: y; traditional Chinese: ??; literally: \\"flower flag ginseng\\" in Chinese, and Citibank, which opened a branch in China in 1902, is known as 跐k; \\"Flower Flag Bank\\".[46]\\r\\nThe U.S. flag took its first trip around the world in 1787ÿ90 on board the Columbia.[43] William Driver, who coined the phrase \\"Old Glory\\", took the U.S. flag around the world in 1831ÿ32.[43] The flag attracted the notice of Japanese when an oversized version was carried to Yokohama by the steamer Great Republic as part of a round-the-world journey in 1871.[47]\\r\\nIn the following table depicting the 28 various designs of the United States flag, the star patterns for the flags are merely the usual patterns, often associated with the United States Navy. Canton designs, prior to the proclamation of the 48-star flag, had no official arrangement of the stars. Furthermore, the exact colors of the flag were not standardized until 1934.[48]\\r\\nIn the November 2012 U.S. election, Puerto Rico voted to become a U.S. state. However, the legitimacy of the result of this election was disputed.[50] On June 11, 2017, another referendum was held, this time with the result that 97% of voters in Puerto Rico voted for statehood, but it had a turnout of only 23%.[51][52] Similarly in November 2016, a statehood referendum was held in the District of Columbia where 86% of voters approved the proposal. If a new U.S. state were to be admitted, it would require a new design on the flag to accommodate the additional star.[53]\\r\\nThe modern meaning of the flag was forged in December 1860, when Major Robert Anderson moved the U.S. garrison from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. Author Adam Goodheart argues this was the opening move of the American Civil War, and the flag was used throughout northern states to symbolize U.S. nationalism and rejection of secessionism.\\r\\nBefore that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory, flown from forts, embassies, and ships, and displayed on special occasions like American Independence day. But in the weeks after Major Anderson's surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flewas it does today, and especially as it did after the September 11 attacks in 2001from houses, from storefronts, from churches; above the village greens and college quads. For the first time American flags were mass-produced rather than individually stitched and even so, manufacturers could not keep up with demand. As the long winter of 1861 turned into spring, that old flag meant something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.\\r\\nÿ Adam Goodheart.[54]\\r\\nThe flag of the United States is one of the nation's most widely recognized symbols. Within the United States, flags are frequently displayed not only on public buildings but on private residences. The flag is a common motif on decals for car windows, and clothing ornaments such as badges and lapel pins. Throughout the world the flag has been used in public discourse to refer to the United States.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe flag has become a powerful symbol of Americanism, and is flown on many occasions, with giant outdoor flags used by retail outlets to draw customers. Desecration of the flag is considered a public outrage, but remains protected as freedom of speech. Scholars have noted the irony that \\"[t]he flag is so revered because it represents the land of the free, and that freedom includes the ability to use or abuse that flag in protest\\".[55] In worldwide comparison, Testi noted in 2010 that the United States was not unique in adoring its banner, for the flags of Scandinavian countries are also \\"beloved, domesticated, commercialized and sacralized objects\\".[56]\\r\\nThe man credited with designing the current 50 star American flag was Robert G. Heft. He was 17 years old at the time and created the flag design in 1958 as a high school class project while living with his grandparents in Ohio.[57] He received a B? on the project.[58] According to Heft, his history teacher honored their agreement to change his grade to an A after his design was selected.[59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic design of the current flag is specified by 4 U.S.C.??1; 4 U.S.C.??2 outlines the addition of new stars to represent new states. The specification gives the following values:\\r\\nThese specifications are contained in an executive order which, strictly speaking, governs only flags made for or by the U.S. federal government.[62] In practice, most U.S. national flags available for sale to the public have a different width-to-height ratio; common sizes are 2 G 3?ft. or 4 G 6?ft. (flag ratio 1.5), 2.5 G 4?ft. or 5 G 8?ft. (1.6), or 3 G 5?ft. or 6 G 10?ft. (1.667). Even flags flown over the U.S. Capitol for sale to the public through Representatives or Senators are provided in these sizes.[63] Flags that are made to the prescribed 1.9 ratio are often referred to as \\"G-spec\\" (for \\"government specification\\") flags.\\r\\nThe exact red, white, and blue colors to be used in the flag are specified with reference to the CAUS Standard Color Reference of America, 10th edition. Specifically, the colors are \\"White\\", \\"Old Glory Red\\", and \\"Old Glory Blue\\".[64] The CIE coordinates for the colors of the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card were formally specified in JOSA in 1946.[65] These colors form the standard for cloth, and there is no perfect way to convert them to RGB for display on screen or CMYK for printing. The \\"relative\\" coordinates in the following table were found by scaling the luminous reflectance relative to the flag's \\"white\\".\\r\\nAs with the design, the official colors are only officially required for flags produced for the U.S. federal government, and other colors are often used for mass-market flags, printed reproductions, and other products intended to evoke flag colors. The practice of using more saturated colors than the official cloth is not new. As Taylor, Knoche, and Granville wrote in 1950: \\"The color of the official wool bunting [of the blue field] is a very dark blue, but printed reproductions of the flag, as well as merchandise supposed to match the flag, present the color as a deep blue much brighter than the official wool.\\"[67]\\r\\nSometimes, Pantone Matching System (PMS) approximations to the flag colors are used. One set was given on the website of the U.S. embassy in London as early as 1998; the website of the U.S. embassy in Stockholm claimed in 2001 that those had been suggested by Pantone, and that the U.S. Government Printing Office preferred a different set. A third red was suggested by a California Military Department document in 2002.[68] In 2001, the Texas legislature specified that the colors of the Texas flag should be \\"(1) the same colors used in the United States flag; and (2) defined as numbers 193 (red) and 281 (dark blue) of the Pantone Matching System.\\"[69]\\r\\nWhen Alaska and Hawaii were being considered for statehood in the 1950s, more than 1,500 designs were submitted to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag.[71] At the time, credit was given by the executive department to the United States Army Institute of Heraldry for the design.\\r\\nOf these proposals, one created by 17-year-old Robert G. Heft in 1958 as a school project received the most publicity. His mother was a seamstress, but refused to do any of the work for him. He originally received a Bÿ for the project. After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered. Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the Union in 1959.[72] According to Heft, his teacher did keep to their agreement and changed his grade to an A for the project.[60] The 49- and 50-star flags were each flown for the first time at Fort McHenry on Independence Day, in 1959 and 1960 respectively.[60]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag may be decorated with golden fringe surrounding the perimeter of the flag as long as it does not deface the flag proper. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on indoor posts, often use fringe to enhance the appearance of the flag.\\r\\nThe first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the Army used it officially in 1895. No specific law governs the legality of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the attorney general addresses the use of fringe (and the number of stars) \\"...?is at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy?...\\" as quoted from footnote in previous volumes of Title 4 of the United States Code law books and is a source for claims that such a flag is a military ensign not civilian. However, according to the Army Institute of Heraldry, which has official custody of the flag designs and makes any change ordered, there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.[73] Several federal courts have upheld this conclusion,[74][75] most recently and forcefully in Colorado v. Drew, a Colorado Court of Appeals judgment that was released in May 2010.[76] Traditionally, the Army and Air Force use a fringed National Color for parade, color guard and indoor display, while the Sea Services (Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard) use a fringeless National Color for all occasions.\\r\\nThe flag is customarily flown year-round at most public buildings, and it is not unusual to find private houses flying full-size (3 by 5 feet (0.91 by 1.52?m)) flags. Some private use is year-round, but becomes widespread on civic holidays like Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Presidents' Day, Flag Day, and on Independence Day. On Memorial Day it is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves of U.S. war veterans. Also on Memorial Day it is common to fly the flag at half staff, until noon, in remembrance of those who lost their lives fighting in U.S. wars.\\r\\nThe United States Flag Code outlines certain guidelines for the use, display, and disposal of the flag. For example, the flag should never be dipped to any person or thing, unless it is the ensign responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. This tradition may come from the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, where countries were asked to dip their flag to King Edward VII: the American flag bearer did not. Team captain Martin Sheridan is famously quoted as saying \\"this flag dips to no earthly king\\", though the true provenance of this quotation is unclear.[77][78]\\r\\nThe flag should never be allowed to touch the ground and, if flown at night, must be illuminated. If the edges become tattered through wear, the flag should be repaired or replaced. When a flag is so tattered that it can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The American Legion and other organizations regularly conduct flag retirement ceremonies, often on Flag Day, June 14. (The Boy Scouts of America recommends that modern nylon or polyester flags be recycled instead of burned, due to hazardous gases being produced when such materials are burned.)[79]\\r\\nThe Flag Code prohibits using the flag \\"for any advertising purpose\\" and also states that the flag \\"should not be embroidered, printed, or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes, or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use\\".[80] Both of these codes are generally ignored, almost always without comment.\\r\\nSection 8, entitled Respect For Flag states in part: \\"The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery\\", and \\"No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform\\". Section 3 of the Flag Code[81] defines \\"the flag\\" as anything \\"by which the average person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the same to represent the flag of the United States of America\\".\\r\\nAn additional part of Section 8 Respect For Flag, that is frequently violated at sporting events is part (c) \\"The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.\\"\\r\\nAlthough the Flag Code is U.S. federal law, there is no penalty for a private citizen or group failing to comply with the Flag Code and it is not widely enforcedindeed, punitive enforcement would conflict with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.[82] Passage of the proposed Flag Desecration Amendment would overrule legal precedent that has been established.\\r\\nWhen the flag is affixed to the right side of a vehicle of any kind (e.g.: cars, boats, planes, any physical object that moves), it should be oriented so that the canton is towards the front of the vehicle, as if the flag were streaming backwards from its hoist as the vehicle moves forward. Therefore, U.S. flag decals on the right sides of vehicles may appear to be reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left as more commonly seen.\\r\\nThe flag has been displayed on every U.S. spacecraft designed for manned flight, including Mercury, Gemini, Apollo Command/Service Module, Apollo Lunar Module, and the Space Shuttle. The flag also appeared on the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle used for Apollo. But since Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were launched and landed vertically and were not capable of horizontal atmospheric flight as the Space Shuttle did on its landing approach, the \\"streaming\\" convention was not followed and these flags were oriented with the stripes running horizontally, perpendicular to the direction of flight.\\r\\nOn some U.S. military uniforms, flag patches are worn on the right shoulder, following the vehicle convention with the union toward the front. This rule dates back to the Army's early history, when both mounted cavalry and infantry units would designate a standard bearer, who carried the Colors into battle. As he charged, his forward motion caused the flag to stream back. Since the Stars and Stripes are mounted with the canton closest to the pole, that section stayed to the right, while the stripes flew to the left.[83] Several US military uniforms, such as flight suits worn by members of the United States Air Force and Navy, have the flag patch on the left shoulder.[84][85]\\r\\nOther organizations that wear flag patches on their uniforms can have the flag facing in either direction. The congressional charter of the Boy Scouts of America stipulates that the uniforms should not imitate U.S. military uniforms; consequently, the flags are displayed on the right shoulder with the stripes facing front, the reverse of the military style.[86] Law enforcement officers often wear a small flag patch, either on a shoulder, or above a shirt pocket.\\r\\nEvery U.S. astronaut since the crew of Gemini 4 has worn the flag on the left shoulder of his or her space suit, with the exception of the crew of Apollo 1, whose flags were worn on the right shoulder. In this case, the canton was on the left.\\r\\nThe flag did not appear on U.S. postal stamp issues until the Battle of White Plains Issue was released in 1926, depicting the flag with a circle of 13 stars. The 48-star flag first appeared on the General Casimir Pulaski issue of 1931, though in a small monochrome depiction. The first U.S. postage stamp to feature the flag as the sole subject was issued July 4, 1957, Scott catalog number 1094.[87] Since that time the flag has frequently appeared on U.S. stamps.\\r\\nIn 1907 Eben Appleton, New York stockbroker and grandson of Lieutenant Colonel George Armistead (the commander of Fort McHenry during the 1814 bombardment) loaned the Star Spangled Banner Flag to the Smithsonian Institution, and in 1912 he converted the loan to a gift. Appleton donated the flag with the wish that it would always be on view to the public. In 1994, the National Museum of American History determined that the Star Spangled Banner Flag required further conservation treatment to remain on public display. In 1998 teams of museum conservators, curators, and other specialists helped move the flag from its home in the Museum's Flag Hall into a new conservation laboratory. Following the reopening of the National Museum of American History on November 21, 2008, the flag is now on display in a special exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem,\\" where it rests at a 10 degree angle in dim light for conservation purposes.[39]\\r\\nBy presidential proclamation, acts of Congress, and custom, U.S. flags are displayed continuously at certain locations.\\r\\nThe flag should especially be displayed at full staff on the following days:[103]\\r\\nThe flag is displayed at half-staff (half-mast in naval usage) as a sign of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president; statewide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half-staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. However, many flag enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the meaning of the original intent of lowering the flag to honor those who held high positions in federal or state offices. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first proclamation on March 1, 1954, standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half-staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued. However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of private businesses and citizens.\\r\\nTo properly fly the flag at half-staff, one should first briefly hoist it top of the staff, then lower it to the half-staff position, halfway between the top and bottom of the staff. Similarly, when the flag is to be lowered from half-staff, it should be first briefly hoisted to the top of the staff.[107]\\r\\nFederal statutes provide that the flag should be flown at half-staff on the following dates:\\r\\nNational Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, on July 27, was formerly a day of half-staff observance until the law expired in 2003. In 2009, it became a day of full-staff observance.[104][113][104]\\r\\nThough not part of the official Flag Code, according to military custom, flags should be folded into a triangular shape when not in use. To properly fold the flag:\\r\\nThere is also no specific meaning for each fold of the flag. However, there are scripts read by non-government organizations and also by the Air Force that are used during the flag folding ceremony. These scripts range from historical timelines of the flag to religious themes.[114][115]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag of the United States plays a role in military funerals,[116] and occasionally in funerals of other civil servants (such as law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and U.S. presidents). A burial flag is draped over the deceased's casket as a pall during services. Just prior to the casket being lowered into the ground, the flag is ceremonially folded and presented to the deceased's next of kin as a token of respect.[117]\\r\\nFlag of Bikini Atoll\\r\\nFlag of Liberia\\r\\nFlag of Malaysia\\r\\nFlag of El Salvador 1875ÿ1912\\r\\nFlag of Brittany","input":"How many stars were on the original american flag?"},{"output":"average about 6' 2\\" (1.88 m)","context":"The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. Point guards are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in association football (soccer). While the guard must understand and accept the coach's gameplan, they must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing, and they also must control the pace of the game.\\r\\nA point guard, like other player positions in basketball, specializes in certain skills. A point guard's primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for his/her team, or sometimes for themselves. Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor, who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates. This involves setting up plays on the court, getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score, and controlling the tempo of the game. A point guard should know when and how to instigate a fast break and when and how to initiate the more deliberate sets. Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders. A point guard needs always to have in mind the times on the shot clock and the game clock, the score, the numbers of remaining timeouts for both teams, etc.\\r\\nAmong the taller players who have enjoyed success at the position is Magic Johnson, who at 6' 9\\" (2.06 m) won the National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award three times in his career. Other point guards who have been named NBA MVP include Russell Westbrook, Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Allen Iverson, Derrick Rose and two-time winners Steve Nash and Stephen Curry. In the NBA, point guards are usually about 6' 3\\" (1.93 m) or shorter, and average about 6' 2\\" (1.88 m) whereas in the WNBA, point guards are usually 5' 9\\" (1.75 m) or shorter. Having above-average size (height, muscle) is considered advantageous, although size is secondary to situational awareness, speed, quickness, and ball handling skills. Shorter players tend to be better dribblers since they are closer to the floor, and thus have better control of the ball while dribbling.\\r\\nAfter an opponent scores, it is typically the point guard who brings the ball down court to begin an offensive play. Passing skills, ball handling, and court vision are crucial. Speed is important; a speedy point guard is better able to create separation and space off the dribble, giving him/herself room to work. Point guards are often valued more for their assist totals than for their scoring. Another major evaluation factor is Assist-to-Turnover ratio, which reflects the decision-making skills of the player. Still, a first-rate point guard should also have a reasonably effective jump shot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe point guard is positioned on the perimeter of the play, so as to have the best view of the action. This is a necessity because of the point guard's many leadership obligations. Many times, the point guard is referred to by announcers as a \\"coach on the floor\\" or a \\"floor general\\". In the past, this was particularly true, as several point guards such as Lenny Wilkens served their teams as player-coaches. This is not so common anymore, as most coaches are now solely specialized in coaching and are non-players. Some point guards are still given a great deal of leeway in the offense. Even point guards who are not given this much freedom, however, are still extensions of their coach on the floor and must display good leadership skills.\\r\\nAlong with leadership and a general basketball acumen, ball-handling is a skill of great importance to a point guard. Generally speaking, the point guard is the player in possession of the ball for the most time during a game and is responsible for maintaining possession of the ball for his team in the face of any pressure from the opponents. Point guards must be able to maintain possession of the ball in crowded spaces and in traffic and be able to advance the ball quickly. A point guard that has enough ball-handling skill and quickness to be able to drive to the basket in a half-court set is also very valuable and considered by some to be a must for a successful offense.\\r\\nAfter ball-handling, passing and scoring are the most important areas of the game for a point guard. As the primary decision-maker for a team, a point guard's passing ability determines how well a point guard is able to put his decision into play. It is one thing to be able to recognize the player that is in a tactically advantageous position, but it is another thing entirely to be able to deliver the ball to that player. For this reason, a point guard is usually, but not always, more skilled and focused on passing than shooting. However, a good jump shot and the ability to score off a drive to the basket are still valuable skills. A point guard will often use his ability to score in order to augment his effectiveness as a decision maker and play maker.\\r\\nIn addition to the traditional role of the point guard, modern teams have found new ways to utilize the position. Notably, several modern point guards have used a successful style of post play, a tactic usually practiced by much larger centers and forwards. Working off of the fact that the opposing point guard is in all probability an undersized player with limited strength, several modern point guards have developed games close to the basket that include being able to utilize the drop step, spin move, and fade away jump shot.\\r\\nIn recent years, the sport's shift from a fundamental style of play to a more athletic, scoring-oriented game resulted in the proliferation of so-called combo guards at the point guard position. More explosive and athletic point guards focus on scoring as opposed to play-making, forgoing assists and ball-movement, and often defense, for higher scoring numbers. Young players who are relatively short are now developing the scoring aspects of their skill-sets, whereas previously these players would find it difficult to enter the NBA without true point guard skills. These combo point guards can surprise defenses. Instead of passing after bringing up the ball they quickly drive to the basket or step back for an outside shot. There are some disadvantages to this style of play. A point guard often controls the offense and he also controls who gets the ball and who doesn't, as this type of controlling style of play is necessary to control the tempo of a game. Scoring point guards typically look to score first, thus preventing teammates from getting the ball. This can cause other players to become dis-involved in the offense. Even so, combo guards still require above-average passing skill, but not as much as possessed by \\"pure\\" point guards (which is what those in the traditional mold of a point guard are referred to).\\r\\nA point guard primarily defends on the perimeter, just as he primarily plays on the perimeter on offense. On defense, the point guard is tasked with making the opposing point guard as ineffective as possible. A defensive point guard will try to accomplish this with constant pressure on the ball, making it difficult to maintain possession. A defensive point guard will also pressure opponents in passing lanes in an attempt to generate steals and scoring opportunities for his own team.","input":"How tall is an average point guard in the nba?"},{"output":"any attack based on information gained from the implementation of a computer system, rather than weaknesses in the implemented algorithm itself (e.g. cryptanalysis and software bugs)","context":"In computer security, a side-channel attack is any attack based on information gained from the implementation of a computer system, rather than weaknesses in the implemented algorithm itself (e.g. cryptanalysis and software bugs). Timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks or even sound can provide an extra source of information, which can be exploited.\\r\\nSome side-channel attacks require technical knowledge of the internal operation of the system, although others such as differential power analysis are effective as black-box attacks. The rise of Web 2.0 applications and software-as-a-service has also significantly raised the possibility of side-channel attacks on the web, even when transmissions between a web browser and server are encrypted (e.g., through HTTPS or WiFi encryption), according to researchers from Microsoft Research and Indiana University.[1] Many powerful side-channel attacks are based on statistical methods pioneered by Paul Kocher.[2]\\r\\nAttempts to break a cryptosystem by deceiving or coercing people with legitimate access are not typically considered side-channel attacks: see social engineering and rubber-hose cryptanalysis. For attacks on computer systems themselves (which are often used to perform cryptography and thus contain cryptographic keys or plaintexts), see computer security.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral classes of side channel attack include:\\r\\nIn all cases, the underlying principle is that physical effects caused by the operation of a cryptosystem (on the side) can provide useful extra information about secrets in the system, for example, the cryptographic key, partial state information, full or partial plaintexts and so forth. The term cryptophthora (secret degradation) is sometimes used to express the degradation of secret key material resulting from side-channel leakage.\\r\\nA cache side-channel attack works by monitoring security critical operations such as AES T-table entry[3][4][5] or modular exponentiation multiplicand accesses.[6] Attacker then is able to recover the secret key depending on the accesses made (or not made) by the victim, deducing the encryption key. Also, unlike some of the other side-channel attacks, this method does not create a fault in the ongoing cryptographic operation and is invisible to the victim.\\r\\nIn 2017, cache-based vulnerabilities have been discovered in CPUs (dubbed Meltdown and Spectre), which allow an attacker to leak memory contents of other processes and the operating system itself.\\r\\nA timing attack watches data movement into and out of the CPU or memory on the hardware running the cryptosystem or algorithm. Simply by observing variations in how long it takes to perform cryptographic operations, it might be possible to determine the entire secret key. Such attacks involve statistical analysis of timing measurements and have been demonstrated across networks.[7]\\r\\nA power-analysis attack can provide even more detailed information by observing the power consumption of a hardware device such as CPU or cryptographic circuit. These attacks are roughly categorized into simple power analysis (SPA) and differential power analysis (DPA).\\r\\nFluctuations in current also generate radio waves, enabling attacks that analyze measurements of electromagnetic emanations. These attacks typically involve similar statistical techniques as power-analysis attacks.\\r\\nHistorical analogues to modern side-channel attacks are known. A recently declassified NSA document reveals that as far back as 1943, an engineer with Bell telephone observed decipherable spikes on an oscilloscope associated with the decrypted output of a certain encrypting teletype.[8] According to former MI5 officer Peter Wright, the British Security Service analyzed emissions from French cipher equipment in the 1960s.[9] In the 1980s, Soviet eavesdroppers were suspected of having planted bugs inside IBM Selectric typewriters to monitor the electrical noise generated as the type ball rotated and pitched to strike the paper; the characteristics of those signals could determine which key was pressed.[10]\\r\\nPower consumption of devices causes heating, which is offset by cooling effects. Temperature changes create thermally induced mechanical stress. This stress can create low level acoustic (i.e. noise) emissions from operating CPUs (about 10?kHz in some cases). Recent research by Shamir et al. has suggested that information about the operation of cryptosystems and algorithms can be obtained in this way as well. This is an acoustic attack; if the surface of the CPU chip, or in some cases the CPU package, can be observed, infrared images can also provide information about the code being executed on the CPU, known as a thermal-imaging attack.[citation needed]\\r\\nOptical side-channel attack examples include gleaning information from the hard disk activity indicator[11] to reading a small number of photons emitted by transistors as they change state.[12]\\r\\nBecause side-channel attacks rely on the relationship between information emitted (leaked) through a side channel and the secret data, countermeasures fall into two main categories: (1) eliminate or reduce the release of such information and (2) eliminate the relationship between the leaked information and the secret data, that is, make the leaked information unrelated, or rather uncorrelated, to the secret data, typically through some form of randomization of the ciphertext that transforms the data in a way that can be undone after the cryptographic operation (e.g., decryption) is completed.\\r\\nUnder the first category, displays with special shielding to lessen electromagnetic emissions, reducing susceptibility to TEMPEST attacks, are now commercially available. Power line conditioning and filtering can help deter power-monitoring attacks, although such measures must be used cautiously, since even very small correlations can remain and compromise security. Physical enclosures can reduce the risk of surreptitious installation of microphones (to counter acoustic attacks) and other micro-monitoring devices (against CPU power-draw or thermal-imaging attacks).\\r\\nAnother countermeasure (still in the first category) is to jam the emitted channel with noise. For instance, a random delay can be added to deter timing attacks, although adversaries can compensate for these delays by averaging multiple measurements (or, more generally, using more measurements in the analysis). As the amount of noise in the side channel increases, the adversary needs to collect more measurements.\\r\\nAnother countermeasure under the first category is to use security analysis software to identify certain classes of side channel attacks that can be found during the design stages of the underlying hardware itself. Timing attacks and cache attacks are both identifiable through certain commercially available security analysis software platforms, which allow for testing to identify the attack vulnerability itself, as well as the effectiveness of the architectural change to circumvent the vulnerability. The most comprehensive method to employ this countermeasure is to create a Secure Development Lifecycle for hardware, which includes utilizing all available security analysis platforms at their respective stages of the hardware development lifecycle.[13]\\r\\nIn the case of timing attacks against targets whose computation times are quantized into discrete clock cycle counts, an effective countermeasure against is to design the software to be isochronous, that is to run in an exactly constant amount of time, independently of secret values. This makes timing attacks impossible.[14] Such countermeasures can be difficult to implement in practice, since even individual instructions can have variable timing on some CPUs.\\r\\nOne partial countermeasure against simple power attacks, but not differential power-analysis attacks, is to design the software so that it is \\"PC-secure\\" in the \\"program counter security model\\". In a PC-secure program, the execution path does not depend on secret values. In other words, all conditional branches depend only on public information. (This is a more restrictive condition than isochronous code, but a less restrictive condition than branch-free code.) Even though multiply operations draw more power than NOP on practically all CPUs, using a constant execution path prevents such operation-dependent power differences (differences in power from choosing one branch over another) from leaking any secret information.[14] On architectures where the instruction execution time is not data-dependent, a PC-secure program is also immune to timing attacks. [15][16]\\r\\nAnother way in which code can be non-isochronous is that modern CPUs have a memory cache: accessing infrequently used information incurs a large timing penalty, revealing some information about the frequency of use of memory blocks. Cryptographic code designed to resist cache attacks attempts to use memory in only a predictable fashion (such as accessing only the input, outputs and program data, and doing so according to a fixed pattern). For example, data-dependent look-up tables must be avoided because the cache could reveal which part of the look-up table was accessed.\\r\\nOther partial countermeasures attempt to reduce the amount of information leaked from data-dependent power differences. Some operations use power that is correlated to the number of 1 bits in a secret value. Using a constant-weight code (such as using Fredkin gates or dual-rail encoding) can reduce the leakage of information about the Hamming weight of the secret value, although exploitable correlations are likely to remain unless the balancing is perfect. This \\"balanced design\\" can be approximated in software by manipulating both the data and its complement together.[14]\\r\\nSeveral \\"secure CPUs\\" have been built as asynchronous CPUs; they have no global timing reference. While these CPUs were intended to make timing and power attacks more difficult,[14] subsequent research found that timing variations in asynchronous circuits are harder to remove[citation needed].\\r\\nA typical example of the second category (decorrelation) is a technique known as blinding. In the case of RSA decryption with secret exponent \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle d}\\r\\n\\r\\n and corresponding encryption exponent \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ne\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle e}\\r\\n\\r\\n and modulus \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle m}\\r\\n\\r\\n, the technique applies as follows (for simplicity, the modular reduction by m is omitted in the formulas): before decrypting, that is, before computing the result of \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ny\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle y^{d}}\\r\\n\\r\\n for a given ciphertext \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ny\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle y}\\r\\n\\r\\n, the system picks a random number \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle r}\\r\\n\\r\\n and encrypts it with public exponent \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ne\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle e}\\r\\n\\r\\n to obtain \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\ne\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle r^{e}}\\r\\n\\r\\n.

For attacks that require collecting side-channel information from operations with data controlled by the attacker, blinding is an effective countermeasure, since the actual operation is executed on a randomized version of the data, over which the attacker has no control or even knowledge.\\r\\nAnother more general countermeasure (in that it is effective against all side-channel attacks) is the masking countermeasure.

It was a mechanical device that was worked by hand to make the letter print on paper. The working model provided by Burt for his 1829 patent was destroyed in the 1836 Patent Office fire. The main purpose of the device was to speed up secretarial work, although that ultimately was not accomplished at first.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe typographer was patented on July 23, 1829, as U.S. patent No. 5581X.[3] United States Patent Office documents describe Burt's American machine as \\"the actual construction of a type writing machine for the first time in any country\\".[4] It was the first practical typewriting machine ever made in America,[5] although Pellegrino Turri had made one in Italy in 1808.[6] The patent gave Burt the full exclusive rights to his new typewriter machine for 14 years, including vending or selling to others any or all of these rights as he saw fit, signed by President Andrew Jackson.[1]\\r\\nAll \\"type writing\\" machines, those that used letters of typeface, were generally given the name \\"typographer\\" from Burt's 1829 patent until 1874 by subsequent inventors who improved on Burt's machine.[7] The concept ultimately came to be called \\"The Type-Writer\\" in 1874.[5][8] The word stayed hyphenated until the 1880s. William Ozmun Wyckoff, president of the New York State Shorthand Reporters' Association in 1886, and founder of the Remington Typewriter Company, publicized the unhyphenated name \\"typewriter\\". It became very well known, and the public finally accepted this as one word by 1919.[9] Eventually, Burt's typographer was called a typewriter.[10]\\r\\nAmerican typewriters have been recognized in all parts of the world as superior right from the beginning of the United States patents.[4] There has been a tendency in history records to give credit to English inventors for the typewriter invention.[4] This could be due to the Patent Office fire in 1830 that destroyed the patents and models,[11] or just due to enthusiastic British historians of inventions. French authors, Henri Dupont and C. Senechal in their book \\"Les machines a crire: historique, avantages, descriptions et trait complet de dactylographie ou art d'crire a la machine\\" in 1906 described the facts about Burt's typographer machine as has been described above.[12]\\r\\nIn 1714, the British patent office issued a patent to English engineer Henry Mill for a typewriter; however, he never built it.[13] This first record of an initial attempt gave Mills time (14 years) to develop a model or at least a description of his \\"artificial machine\\"; however, the secret of how to make such a machine, if there ever was one, died with him.[14] There is no record that it ever existed.[15] There hasn't even been found a trace of any drawings or specifications.[16] Its description is more like that of making embossing tape, which product output would be used for the blind.[16]\\r\\nChristopher Latham Sholes is given credit for inventing the first \\"practical\\" typewriter.[2] He was in fact the fifty-second person or possibly the 112th to reinvent a \\"type-writing\\" machine ÿ which he called a type-writer.[17][18] Some of the \\"type-writing\\" machines invented between Burt's 1829 patented machine and Sholes' 1867 type-writer are \\"The Projean Machine\\" (1833), \\"The Thurber Machine\\" (1843), \\"The Foucault Machine\\" (1843), \\"O.

Latham Sholes, Samuel W. Soule, Carlos Glidden).[2][19] Thomas Edison is even given credit for an electrified version in 1872.[2]\\r\\nThe Board of Electors at the National Shorthand Association of Detroit recognized Burt as:\\r\\nThe machine was a rectangular wooden box 12?inches wide, 12?inches high, and 18?inches long. It mechanically worked by depressing a rotating lever so that an inked letter made contact with paper. A gauge that was designed in a circular clock-wise fashion on the front of the box indicated the number of lines typed on the blank piece of paper that was up to 15?inches in length. The paper was attached to a velvet-like material belt. The belt rotated when the impression lever was depressed.[20]\\r\\nThe patent describes Burt's machine as having a set of typeface characters that were arranged on the under side of a set of parts that had a lever pivoted to swing vertically and horizontally. The desired typeface character is brought to the printing point by moving this lever horizontally to a position over the same character in the index, and the impression on the paper is made by then depressing the lever. Different styles of typeface characters could be used. They were arranged in two rows on a lever. The rows of typeface characters could be shifted on the lever to bring either one to the printing point. The paper was carried in an endless band that traveled crosswise of the machine and the band was moved for letter space by the impression lever every time the lever is depressed to print. The line space was made by shifting the frame carrying the printing mechanism toward the front or rear of the machine, with the paper remaining stationary. Ink-pads were located at each side of the impression point, and all the typeface characters, except the one in the printing position, were inked every time the impression lever was depressed. Upper and lower case typeface letters could be used. A dial was provided that indicated the length of paper (inches) which had passed the printing point in printing each line. The operator knew the width of the paper being used each time. There was a stop printing indicator for end of the line.[3][5]\\r\\nFour classes of typewriters had been recognized by the U. S. Patent Office. The first was an index-wheel machine, like that patented by Burt on July 23, 1829. The second was the bar-machine first patented by John B. Fairbanks on September 17, 1850. The third was the plate-machine first patented by Oliver T. Eddy on November 12, 1850. The fourth was the key-wheel machine first patented by John Pratt on August 11, 1868.[9]\\r\\nA complete working model of Burt's \\"typographer\\" was in the model room of the Patent Office from the time of the patent until the great Patent Office fire of December 15, 1836.[5][7] The fire destroyed all the patents and patent models issued from 1790.[21] A competent mechanic can build a working replica of Burt's typographer from his patent description and drawings.[9] In fact Austin Burt, the great grandson of Burt, built a working model in 1892 for the Columbian Exposition working from a parchment copy of the original patent (No. 5581X).[5][22]\\r\\nThe reason Burt built the machine was to speed up his work in official correspondence as a government surveyor. John P. Sheldon of the Detroit Gazette, Burt's newspaper editor friend, furnished the typeface letters from the newspaper company for Burt's first typographer to be able to type the first letter ever written on a typewriter. Sheldon also took Burt's first \\"moddle\\" to the Patent Office in Washington, D.C. sometime between March 9 and 12, 1830, as Burt writes about on March 13, 1830, on his second typographer typewriter he built. The typeface letters for this Patent Office model was obtained from a Mr. White of New York, a typeface founder. Even though a neat-looking letter could be typed on Burt's \\"typographer\\", the basic goal to speed up correspondence was not accomplished, as his machine was very slow in typing. Because of this, the machine could not get marketed. Burt lost interest in it and sold his rights to one Cyrus Spalding for $75 on March 17, 1830 with suggested improvements. Ultimately he didn't have any further luck in marketing the typewriter.[22][23] The typographer was so far ahead of its time it found no market.[5]\\r\\nTyped typographer letter by Burt in 1830 to his wife.[24]\\r\\nLetters Patent 1829 - signed by President Andrew Jackson","input":"When was the first lettered machine - like typewriter invented and by whom?"},{"output":"bankruptcy of the king, and hence the state","context":"The causes of the French Revolution can be attributed to several intertwining factors:\\r\\nAll these factors created a revolutionary atmosphere and a tricky situation for Louis XVI. In order to resolve the crisis, the king summoned the Estates-General in May 1789 and, as it came to an impasse, the representatives of the Third Estates formed a National Assembly, against the wishes of the king, signaling the outbreak of the French Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe essence of the revolutionary situation which existed in France in the 1780s was the bankruptcy of the king, and hence the state. This economic crisis was due to the rapidly increasing costs of government and to the overwhelming costs incurred by fighting two major wars: the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War.[4] These costs could not be met from the usual sources of state revenue. Since the 1770s, several attempts by different ministers to introduce financial stability had failed.[5] The taxation system was burdensome upon the middle class and the more prosperous peasants, given that the nobles were largely able to exempt themselves from it. As a result, there was \\"an insistent demand\\" for reform of these abuses of privilege, for an equitable means of taxation and for improved government processes.[6] David Thomson argued that the bourgeoisie and peasantry had \\"something to lose, not merely something to gain\\" in their demands for a fairer society and this fear too was a major factor in the revolutionary situation.[7]\\r\\nThe population of France in the 1780s was about 26 million, of whom 21 million lived in agriculture. Few of these owned enough land to support a family and most were forced to take on extra work as poorly paid labourers on larger farms. There were regional differences but, by and large, French peasants were generally better off than those in countries like Russia or Poland. Even so, hunger was a daily problem which became critical in years of poor harvest and the condition of most French peasants was poor.[8]\\r\\nThe fundamental issue of poverty was aggravated by social inequality as all peasants were liable to pay taxes, from which the nobility could claim immunity, and feudal dues payable to a local seigneur or lord. Similarly, the destination of tithes which the peasants were obliged to pay to their local churches was a cause of grievance as it was known that the majority of parish priests were poor and the contribution was being paid to an aristocratic, and usually absentee, abbot.[9] The clergy numbered about 100,000 and yet they owned 10% of the land. The Catholic Church maintained a rigid hierarchy as abbots and bishops were all members of the nobility and canons were all members of wealthy bourgeois families. As an institution, it was both rich and powerful. As with the nobility, it paid no taxes and merely contributed a grant to the state every five years, the amount of which was self-determined. The upper echelons of the clergy had considerable influence over government policy.[9]\\r\\nDislike of the nobility was especially intense. Successive French kings and their ministers had tried with limited success to suppress the power of the nobles but, in the last quarter of the 18th century, \\"the aristocracy were beginning once again to tighten their hold on the machinery of government\\".[10]\\r\\nA growing number of the French citizenry had absorbed the ideas of \\"equality\\" and \\"freedom of the individual\\" as presented by Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot and other philosophers and social theorists of the Age of Enlightenment.[11] The American Revolution demonstrated that it was plausible for Enlightenment ideas about how a government should be organized to actually be put into practice. Some American diplomats, like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, had lived in Paris, where they consorted freely with members of the French intellectual class. Furthermore, contact between American revolutionaries and the French troops who served in North America helped spread revolutionary ideas to the French people.[12]\\r\\nFrance in 1787, although it faced some difficulties, was one of the most economically capable nations of Europe. The French population exceeded 28 million; of Europe's 178 to 188 millions, only Imperial Russia had a greater population (37 to 41 million).[13] France was also among the most urbanized countries of Europe, the population of Paris was second only to that of London (approximately 500,000 vs. 800,000),[13] and six of Europe's 35 larger cities were French.[14][15]\\r\\nOther measures confirm France's inherent strength. France had 5.3 million of Europe's approximately 30 million male peasants.[16] Its area under cultivation,[16] productivity per unit area,[17] level of industrialization, and gross national product [18] (about 14% of the continental European product, excluding Russia, and 6% to 10% above the level elsewhere in Europe [19]) all placed France near the very top of the scale. In short, while it may have lagged slightly behind the Low Countries, and possibly Switzerland, in per capita wealth, the sheer size of the French economy made it the premier economic power of continental Europe.[20]\\r\\nHistorian John Shovlin states, \\"It is a truism that the French Revolution was touched off by the near bankruptcy of the state.\\"[21] It was the burden of the national debt that led this to the long-running financial crisis of the French government.[22] Before the revolution, the French debt had risen from 8 billion to 12 billion livres. Extravagant expenditures on luxuries by Louis XVI, whose rule began in 1774, were compounded by debts that were run up during the reign of his even-more-profligate predecessor, Louis XV (who reigned from 1715 to 1774). Heavy expenditures to conduct losing the Seven Years' War (1756ÿ1763), and France's backing of the Americans in their War of Independence, ran the tab up an even further 1.3 billion livres [23]\\r\\nLouis XV and his ministers were deeply unhappy about Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War and, in the years following the Treaty of Paris, they began drawing up a long-term plan that would involve constructing a larger navy and building an anti-British coalition of allies. In theory, this would eventually lead to a war of revenge and see France regain its colonies from Britain. In practice, it resulted in a mountain of debts.\\r\\nOn the advice of, what many believed was, his mistress, the Marquise de Pompadour, the king supported the policy of fiscal justice designed by d'Arnouville. In order to finance the budget deficit, which amounted to 100 million livres in 1745, Machault d'Arnouville created a tax of 5% on all revenues (the vingtime), a measure that affected the privileged classes as well as the rest of the population. Still, expenditures outpaced revenues.[24]\\r\\nUltimately, Louis XV failed to overcome these fiscal problems, mainly because he was incapable of harmonizing the conflicting parties at court and arriving at coherent economic policies. Worse, Louis seemed to be aware of the anti-monarchist forces that were threatening his family's rule, yet he failed to do anything to stop them.[25]\\r\\nUnder the new king, Louis XVI, radical financial reforms by his ministers, Turgot and Malesherbes, angered the nobles and were blocked by the parlements who insisted that the king did not have the legal right to levy new taxes. So, in 1776, Turgot was dismissed and Malesherbes resigned. They were replaced by Jacques Necker, who supported the American Revolution and proceeded with a policy of taking large international loans instead of raising taxes.\\r\\nFrance sent Rochambeau, Lafayette and de Grasse, along with large land and naval forces, to help the Americans. French aid proved decisive in forcing the main British army to surrender at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781.[26] The Americans gained their independence, and the war ministry rebuilt the French army. However, the British sank the main French fleet in 1782, and France gained little, except for the colonies of Tobago and Senegal, from the Treaty of Paris (1783) that concluded the war. The war cost 1.066 million French livres, a huge sum, that was financed by new loans at high interest rates, but no new taxes were imposed. Necker concealed the crisis from the public by explaining only that ordinary revenues exceeded ordinary expenses, and by not mentioning the loans at all.[27]\\r\\nWhen Necker's tax policy failed miserably, Louis dismissed him, and replaced him, in 1783, with Charles Alexandre de Calonne, who increased public spending in an attempt to \\"buy\\" the country's way out of debt. This policy also failed; therefore, Louis convened the Assembly of Notables in 1787 to discuss a revolutionary new fiscal reform proposed by Calonne. When the nobles were told the extent of the debt, they were shocked; however, the shock did not motivate them to rally behind the plan ÿ but to reject it. This negative turn of events signaled to Louis that he had lost the ability to rule as an absolute monarch, and he fell into depression.[28]\\r\\nBritain, too, was heavily indebted as a result of these conflicts; but Britain had far more advanced fiscal institutions in place to deal with it. France was a wealthier country than Britain, and its national debt was no greater than the British one. In each country, servicing the debt accounted for about one-half the government's annual expenditure; where they differed was in the effective rates of interest. In France, the debt was financed at almost twice the interest rate as the debt across the Channel. This demanded a much higher level of taxation and less flexibility in raising money to deal with unforeseen emergencies. (See also Eden Agreement.)\\r\\nEdmund Burke, no friend of the revolution, wrote in 1790: \\"the public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.\\" Because the nobles successfully defended their privileges, the king of France lacked the means to impose a \\"just and proportioned\\" tax. The desire to do so led directly to the decision in 1788 to call the Estates-General into session.[29]\\r\\nThe financial strain of servicing old debt and the excesses of the current royal court caused dissatisfaction with the monarchy, contributed to national unrest, and culminated in the French Revolution of 1789.\\r\\nLouis XVI, his ministers, and the widespread French nobility had become immensely unpopular. This was a consequence of the fact that peasants and, to a lesser extent, the poor and those aspiring to be bourgeoisie, were burdened with ruinously high taxes levied to support a wealthy monarchy, along with aristocrats and their sumptuous, often gluttonous lifestyles.[30]\\r\\nFrance raised most of its tax revenue internally, with a notable deficit regarding external customs tariffs.[31] Taxes on commerce consisted of internal tariffs among the regions of France. This set up an arbitrary tax-barrier (sometimes, as in Paris, in physical form) at every regional boundary, and these barriers prevented France from developing as a unified market. Collections of taxes, such as the extremely unpopular salt tax, the gabelle, were contracted to private collectors (\\"tax farmers\\"), who, like all farmers, preoccupied themselves with making their holdings grow. So, they collected, quite legitimately, far more than required, remitted the tax to the State, and pocketed the remainder. These unwieldy systems led to arbitrary and unequal collection of France's consumption taxes. (See also Wall of the Farmers-General, Jean Chouan, Octroi, Claude Nicolas Ledoux, and the Indian salt tax.)\\r\\nPeasants and nobles alike were required to pay one-tenth of their income or produce to the church (the tithe). Peasants paid a land tax to the state (the taille),[32] a 5% property tax (the vingtime). All paid a tax on the number of people in the family (capitation), depending on the status of the taxpayer (from poor to prince). Further royal and seigneurial obligations might be paid in several ways: in labor (the corve), in kind, or, rarely, in coin. Peasants were also obligated to their landlords for: rent in cash (the cens), a payment related to their amount of annual production (the champart), and taxes on the use of the nobles' mills, wine-presses, and bakeries (the banalits). In good times, the taxes were burdensome; in harsh times, they were devastating.[citation needed] After a less-than-fulsome harvest, people would starve to death during the winter.\\r\\nTax collection was farmed out (privatized) to \\"fermiers\\", through a system of public bidding.[33] Public officials bought their positions from the king, sometimes on an annual basis, sometimes in perpetuity. Often an additional tax, called \\"paulette\\" was paid by the holders of an office to upgrade their position to one that could be passed along as an inheritance. Naturally, holders of these offices tried to reimburse themselves by milking taxpayers as hard as possible. For instance, in a civil lawsuit, judges required that both parties pay for the costs of the trial (called the pices, the spices);[34] this, effectively, put justice out of the reach of all but the wealthy.\\r\\nThe system also exempted the nobles and the clergy from taxes (with the exception of a modest quit-rent, an ad valorem tax on land). The tax burden, therefore, devolved to the peasants, wage-earners, and the professional and business classes, also known as the third estate. Further, people from less-privileged walks of life were blocked from acquiring even petty positions of power in the regime. This caused further resentment.\\r\\nDuring the reigns of Louis XV (1715ÿ1774) and Louis XVI (1774ÿ1792), several ministers, most notably Turgot and Necker, proposed revisions to the French tax system so as to include the nobles as taxpayers, but these proposals were not adopted because of resistance from the parlements (provincial courts of appeal). Members of these courts bought their positions from the king, as well as the right to transfer their positions hereditarily through payment of an annual fee, the paulette. Membership in such courts, or appointment to other public positions, often led to elevation to the nobility (the so-called Nobles of the Robe, as distinguished from the nobility of ancestral military origin, the Nobles of the Sword.) While these two categories of nobles were often at odds, they both sought to retain their privileges.[35]\\r\\nThe need to raise taxes placed the king at odds with the nobles and the upper bourgeoisie, he appointed as his finance ministers, \\"rising men\\" (to use Fran?ois Mignet's insightful term), usually of non-noble origin. These commoners, Turgot, Chrtien de Malesherbes, and Jacques Necker lobbied for reforms in taxation and other moves toward moderation, such as Necker's attempts to reduce the lavishness of the king's court. Each one failed. Instead, the \\"Parkinson's law\\" of bureaucratic overextended waste prevailed, to the detriment of the gentry and other non-seigneurial classes. In contrast, Charles Alexandre de Calonne, appointed finance minister in 1783, restored lavish spending reminiscent of the age of Louis XIV. By the time Calonne brought together the Assembly of Notables on 22 February 1787 to address the financial situation, France had reached a state of virtual bankruptcy; no one would lend the king money sufficient to meet the expenses of the royal court and the government. According to Mignet, the loans amounted to 1.64 billion livres, and the annual deficit was 140 millions.[36]\\r\\nCalonne was succeeded by his chief critic, tienne Charles de Lomnie de Brienne, archbishop of Sens, but the fundamental situation was unchanged: the government had no credit. To address this, the Assembly of Notables sanctioned \\"the establishment of provincial assemblies, regulation of the corn trade, abolition of corves, and a new stamp tax\\", but the assembly dispersed on 25 May 1787 without actually installing a longer-term program with prospects for success.[37]\\r\\nIn Ancien Rgime France, bread was the main source of food for poor peasants and the king was required to ensure the food supply of his subjects, the king was affectionately nicknamed le premier boulanger du royaume (\\"prime baker of the kingdom\\").[38] During this period, the role of the royal police was far more involved than simply upholding the law. Police held responsibility over many systems in society, even street sweeping, it also exercised a strict control over food supply.[39] In order to maintain social order, the grain market was submitted to harsh rules to ensure the quality of the bread and its availability at all time and for the entire population. Grain merchants were viewed with suspicion, they were called \\"the most cruel enemies of the people\\" because they were suspected to mix flour with other products (such as chalk or crushed bones) or to hoard grains to raise artificially the prices of this vital commodity. The Ancien Rgime favoured a \\"moral economy\\" where cupidity was moderated by strict regulations. The police controlled the purity of the flour and made sure that no one would hide grains to drive up prices. Food scarcity was common in the 18th century, but the grain police would forbid exportations from regions facing bad harvests and would import grain from regions enjoying overproduction. It could also force a merchant to dump the price of his flour (he was later compensated for his loss in times of abundance).[40]\\r\\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, the physiocrat school of economy emerged. The physiocrats, or conomistes as they called themselves, had a great impact on Turgot, Louis XVI's Controller-General of Finances. Their opinion on what government economic policy should be was summarized in the term Vincent de Gournay laid claim to: \\"laissez faire, laissez passer\\", meaning leave it alone and let it pass, also known as the \\"invisible hand\\" notion. Turgot passionately defended Gournay's belief in \\"laissez-faire\\" economic principles in his writing \\"loge de Gournay\\". Accordingly, Turgot abolished police regulations and established free trade in grain on 13 September 1774.[41]\\r\\nDuring the period before the spring harvest of 1775, the cereal reserves were exhausted while new crops had not yet arrived. In spring 1775, famine arose in this new context: before Turgot's edict, every region faced its own shortages, so that some would have suffered a genuine famine while others would have been totally spared and supplied through stable prices; a royal intervention would have been requested, and without a doubt obtained, to assure the supply of the regions most affected. With liberalization, owners of grain started to speculate by storing grain. They also tend to buy en masse in areas of good harvests to sell in areas of bad harvests where profits could be greater, causing significant price increases and shortages all over and affecting more people more quickly. Changes to grain and bread supply had serious implications, and was met with disorder. This conflict was known as the Flour War of 1775. Reports from those that controlled the flow of grain stated there were problems with the grain harvest which caused shortages and less grain availability. The price of grain also increased, and became hard for some to afford. News of a grain shortage was met with skepticism and frustration rose from higher prices.[42] Those in opposition of the reform rioted, and seized grain that came in on shipments. They offered what they felt was the \\"just price\\" for it. This demonstrated a way in which the people took some power back into their own hands. This practice was known as \\"taxation populaire\\", or popular taxation.[42]\\r\\nWhile there were documented efforts to deal with the grain shortage problems, such as increasing shipments from foreign countries, beliefs that the famine was intentionally orchestrated by Louis XVI, through the \\"Pacte de Famine\\", emerged.[42] Turgot repressed the riots and restored controls over the grain market. The idea of free trade of grain was discredited and the economic experiment distanced the masses from the government in Versailles. The Flour War can be seen as a prelude to the French Revolution.[43]\\r\\nThe fear of famine became an ever-present dread for the lower strata of the Third Estate, and rumors of the \\"Pacte de Famine\\" to starve the poor were still rampant and readily believed.[44] Mere rumors of food shortage led to the Rveillon riots in April 1789. Rumors of a plot aiming to destroy wheat crops in order to starve the population provoked the Great Fear in the summer of 1789. The hunger and despair of the Parisian women was also the original impetus for the Women's March on Versailles in October 1789, they wanted not just one meal but the assurance that bread would once again be plentiful and cheap.[45]\\r\\nThe two years prior to the revolution (1788ÿ89) saw meager harvests and harsh winters, possibly because of a strong El Ni?o cycle [46] caused by the 1783 Laki eruption in Iceland.[47] The Little Ice Age also affected farmers' choices of crops to plant; in other parts of Europe, peasant farmers had adopted the potato as its staple crop. The potato had been introduced to France during the 16th century and despite resistance had largely supplanted the turnip and rutabaga in France.[48] Despite encouragement from individuals like Antoine Parmentier and Louis XVI, grain was still a much more popular staple crop in France. This was partially because potatoes were seen as more difficult to transport and store than grain.[49]\\r\\nH. F. Helmolt argued that the issue was not so much the debt per se, but the way the debt was refracted through the lens of Enlightenment principles and the increasing power of third-estate creditors, that is, commoners who held the government's paper.\\r\\nProperly speaking, the people ought to have been accustomed to the fact that the French government did not fulfill its financial obligations, for since the time of Henry IV, that is, within two centuries, it had failed to meet its obligations fifty-six times. In earlier days such catastrophes had not been announced and publicly discussed. Now all France, which for two generations had been worked upon by the party of rationalism, shared the outcry against the financial situation.[50]\\r\\nThe struggle with the parlements and nobles to enact reformist measures displayed the extent of the disintegration of the Ancien Rgime. In short order, Protestants regained their rights, and Louis XVI was pressured to produce an annual disclosure of the state of his finances. He also pledged to reconvene the Estates-General within five years. Despite the pretense that France operated under an absolute monarchy, it became clear that the royal government could not successfully implement the changes it desired without the consent of the nobility. The financial crisis had become a political crisis as well,[50] and the French Revolution loomed just beyond the horizon.","input":"What was an immediate cause of the french revolution?"},{"output":"34 sections","context":"Provincial and territorial executive councils\\r\\nConstitution\\r\\nThe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (French: La Charte canadienne des droits et liberts), in Canada often simply the Charter, is a bill of rights entrenched in the Constitution of Canada. It forms the first part of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Charter guarantees certain political rights to Canadian citizens and civil rights of everyone in Canada from the policies and actions of all areas and levels of the government. It is designed to unify Canadians around a set of principles that embody those rights. The Charter was signed into law by Queen Elizabeth II of Canada on April 17, 1982, along with the rest of the Act.\\r\\nThe Charter was preceded by the Canadian Bill of Rights, which was enacted in 1960. However, the Bill of Rights is only a federal statute, rather than a constitutional document. As a federal statute, it can be amended through the ordinary legislative process and has no application to provincial laws. The Supreme Court of Canada also narrowly interpreted the Bill of Rights and the Court was reluctant to declare laws inoperative.[1] The relative ineffectiveness of the Canadian Bill of Rights motivated many to improve rights protections in Canada. The movement for human rights and freedoms that emerged after World War?II also wanted to entrench the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[2] The British Parliament formally enacted the Charter as a part of the Canada Act 1982 at the request of the Parliament of Canada in 1982, the result of the efforts of the government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.\\r\\nOne of the most notable effects of the adoption of the Charter was to greatly expand the scope of judicial review, because the Charter is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the Bill of Rights. The courts, when confronted with violations of Charter rights, have struck down unconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and regulations or parts of statutes and regulations, as they did when Canadian case law was primarily concerned with resolving issues of federalism. The Charter, however, granted new powers to the courts to enforce remedies that are more creative and to exclude more evidence in trials. These powers are greater than what was typical under the common law and under a system of government that, influenced by Canada's parent country the United Kingdom, was based upon Parliamentary supremacy. As a result, the Charter has attracted both broad support from a majority of the Canadian electorate and criticisms by opponents of increased judicial power. The Charter only applies to government laws and actions (including the laws and actions of federal, provincial, and municipal governments and public school boards), and sometimes to the common law, not to private activity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Charter, people physically present in Canada have numerous civil and political rights. Most of the rights can be exercised by any legal person (the Charter does not define the corporation as a \\"legal person\\"),[3] but a few of the rights belong exclusively to natural persons, or (as in sections 3 and 6) only to citizens of Canada. The rights are enforceable by the courts through section 24 of the Charter, which allows courts discretion to award remedies to those whose rights have been denied. This section also allows courts to exclude evidence in trials if the evidence was acquired in a way that conflicts with the Charter and might damage the reputation of the justice system. Section 32 confirms that the Charter is binding on the federal government, the territories under its authority, and the provincial governments. The rights and freedoms enshrined in 34 sections of the Charter include:\\r\\nPrecluding all the freedoms and forming the basis of the Charter, the very first section, known as limitations clause, allows governments to justify certain infringements of Charter rights. Every case in which a court discovers a violation of the Charter would therefore require a section 1 analysis to determine if the law can still be upheld. Infringements are upheld if the purpose for the government action is to achieve what would be recognized as an urgent or important objective in a free society, and if the infringement can be \\"demonstrably justified.\\" Section 1 has thus been used to uphold laws against objectionable conduct such as hate speech (e.g., in R. v. Keegstra) and obscenity (e.g., in R. v. Butler). Section 1 also confirms that the rights listed in the Charter are guaranteed.\\r\\nIn addition, some of these rights are also subjected to the notwithstanding clause (section 33). The notwithstanding clause authorizes governments to temporarily override the rights and freedoms in sections 2 and 7ÿ15 for up to five years, subject to renewal. The Canadian federal government has never invoked it, and some have speculated that its use would be politically costly.[4] In the past, the notwithstanding clause was invoked routinely by the province of Quebec (which did not support the enactment of the Charter but is subject to it nonetheless). The provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta have also invoked the notwithstanding clause, to end a strike and to protect an exclusively heterosexual definition of marriage,[5] respectively. (Note that Alberta's use of the notwithstanding clause is of no force or effect, since the definition of marriage is federal not provincial jurisdiction.)[6] The territory of Yukon also passed legislation once that invoked the notwithstanding clause, but the legislation was never proclaimed in force.[7]\\r\\nGenerally, the right to participate in political activities and the right to a democratic form of government are protected:\\r\\nRights of people in dealing with the justice system and law enforcement are protected, namely:\\r\\nGenerally, people have the right to use either the English or French language in communications with Canada's federal government and certain provincial governments. Specifically, the language laws in the Charter include:\\r\\nVarious provisions help to clarify how the Charter works in practice. These include,\\r\\nFinally, Section 34: states that Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, containing the first 34 sections of the Act, may be collectively referred to as the \\"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\\".\\r\\nMany of the rights and freedoms that are protected under the Charter, including the rights to freedom of speech, habeas corpus and the presumption of innocence,[8] have their roots in a set of Canadian laws and legal precedents[9] sometimes known as the Implied Bill of Rights. Many of these rights were also included in the Canadian Bill of Rights, which the Canadian Parliament enacted in 1960. However, the Canadian Bill of Rights had a number of shortcomings. Unlike the Charter, it was an ordinary Act of Parliament, which could be amended by a simple majority of Parliament, and it was applicable only to the federal government. The courts also chose to interpret the Bill of Rights conservatively, only on rare occasions applying it to find a contrary law inoperative. The Bill of Rights did not contain all of the rights that are now included in the Charter, omitting, for instance, the right to vote[10] and freedom of movement within Canada.[11]\\r\\nThe centennial of Canadian Confederation in 1967 aroused greater interest within the government in constitutional reform. Said reforms would include improving safeguards of rights, as well as patriation of the Constitution, meaning the British Parliament would no longer have to approve constitutional amendments. Subsequently, Attorney General Pierre Trudeau appointed law professor Barry Strayer to research a potential bill of rights. While writing his report, Strayer consulted with a number of notable legal scholars, including Walter Tarnopolsky. Strayer's report advocated a number of ideas that were later incorporated into the Charter, including protection for language rights. Strayer also advocated excluding economic rights. Finally, he recommended allowing for limits on rights. Such limits are included in the Charter's limitation and notwithstanding clauses.[12] In 1968, Strayer was made the Director of the Constitutional Law Division of the Privy Council Office and in 1974 he became Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice. During those years, Strayer played a role in writing the bill that was ultimately adopted.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Trudeau, who had become Liberal leader and prime minister in 1968, still very much wanted a constitutional bill of rights. The federal government and the provinces discussed creating one during negotiations for patriation, which resulted in the Victoria Charter in 1971. This never came to be implemented. However, Trudeau continued with his efforts to patriate the Constitution, and promised constitutional change during the 1980 Quebec referendum. He would succeed in 1982 with the passage of the Canada Act 1982. This enacted the Constitution Act, 1982.\\r\\nThe inclusion of a charter of rights in the Constitution Act was a much-debated issue. Trudeau spoke on television in October 1980,[13] and announced his intention to constitutionalize a bill of rights that would include fundamental freedoms, democratic guarantees, freedom of movement, legal rights, equality and language rights.[14] He did not want a notwithstanding clause. While his proposal gained popular support,[15] provincial leaders opposed the potential limits on their powers. The federal Progressive Conservative opposition feared liberal bias among judges, should courts be called upon to enforce rights.[16] Additionally, the British Parliament cited their right to uphold Canada's old form of government.[17] At a suggestion of the Conservatives, Trudeau's government thus agreed to a committee of Senators and MPs to further examine the bill of rights as well as the patriation plan. During this time, 90 hours were spent on the bill of rights alone, all filmed for television,[15] while civil rights experts and advocacy groups put forward their perceptions on the Charter's flaws and omissions and how to remedy them.[15] As Canada had a parliamentary system of government, and as judges were perceived not to have enforced rights well in the past, it was questioned whether the courts should be named as the enforcers of the Charter, as Trudeau wanted. Conservatives argued that elected politicians should be trusted instead. It was eventually decided that the responsibility should go to the courts. At the urging of civil libertarians, judges could even now exclude evidence in trials if acquired in breach of Charter rights in certain circumstances, something the Charter was not originally going to provide for. As the process continued, more features were added to the Charter, including equality rights for people with disabilities, more sex equality guarantees and recognition of Canada's multiculturalism. The limitations clause was also reworded to focus less on the importance of parliamentary government and more on justifiability of limits in free societies; the latter logic was more in line with rights developments around the world after World War II.[18]\\r\\nIn its decision in the Patriation Reference (1981), the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled there was a tradition that some provincial approval should be sought for constitutional reform. As the provinces still had doubts about the Charter's merits, Trudeau was forced to accept the notwithstanding clause to allow governments to opt out of certain obligations. The notwithstanding clause was accepted as part of a deal called the Kitchen Accord, negotiated by the federal Attorney General Jean Chrtien, Ontario's justice minister Roy McMurtry and Saskatchewan's justice minister Roy Romanow. Pressure from provincial governments (which in Canada have jurisdiction over property) and from the country's left wing, especially the New Democratic Party, also prevented Trudeau from including any rights protecting private property.[19]\\r\\nNevertheless, Quebec did not support the Charter (or the Canada Act 1982), with \\"conflicting interpretations\\" as to why. The opposition could have owed to the Parti Qubcois leadership being allegedly uncooperative, because it was more committed to gaining sovereignty for Quebec. It could have owed to Quebec leaders being excluded from the negotiation of the Kitchen Accord, which they saw as being too centralist. It could have owed to provincial leaders' objections to the Accord's provisions relating to the process of future constitutional amendment.[20] They also opposed the inclusion of mobility rights and minority language education rights.[21] The Charter is still applicable in Quebec because all provinces are bound by the Constitution. However, Quebec's opposition to the 1982 patriation package has led to two failed attempts to amend the Constitution (the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord) which were designed primarily to obtain Quebec's political approval of the Canadian constitutional order.\\r\\nWhile the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was adopted in 1982, it was not until 1985 that the main provisions regarding equality rights (section 15) came into effect. The delay was meant to give the federal and provincial governments an opportunity to review pre-existing statutes and strike potentially unconstitutional inequalities.\\r\\nThe typography of the physical document pictured here, and still distributed today, was typeset by Ottawa's David Berman intentionally in Carl Dair's Cartier typeface: at the time the most prominent Canadian typeface, having been commissioned by the Governor-General as a celebration of Canada's centenary in 1967.\\r\\nThe Charter has been amended since its enactment. Section 25 was amended in 1983 to explicitly recognize more rights regarding Aboriginal land claims, and section 16.1 was added in 1993. There have also been a number of unsuccessful attempts to amend the Charter, including the failed Charlottetown Accord of 1992. The Charlottetown Accord would have specifically required the Charter to be interpreted in a manner respectful of Quebec's distinct society, and would have added further statements to the Constitution Act, 1867 regarding racial and sexual equality and collective rights, and about minority language communities. Though the Accord was negotiated among many interest groups, the resulting provisions were so vague that Trudeau, then out of office, feared they would actually conflict with and undermine the Charter's individual rights. He felt judicial review of the rights might be undermined if courts had to favour the policies of provincial governments, as governments would be given responsibility over linguistic minorities. Trudeau thus played a prominent role in leading the popular opposition to the Accord.[22]\\r\\nThe task of interpreting and enforcing the Charter falls to the courts, with the Supreme Court of Canada being the ultimate authority on the matter.\\r\\nWith the Charter's supremacy confirmed by section 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982, the courts continued their practice of striking down unconstitutional statutes or parts of statutes as they had with earlier case law regarding federalism. However, under section 24 of the Charter, courts also gained new powers to enforce creative remedies and exclude more evidence in trials. Courts have since made many important decisions, including R. v. Morgentaler (1988), which struck down Canada's abortion law, and Vriend v. Alberta (1998), in which the Supreme Court found the province's exclusion of homosexuals from protection against discrimination violated section 15. In the latter case, the Court then read the protection into the law.\\r\\nCourts may receive Charter questions in a number of ways. Rights claimants could be prosecuted under a criminal law that they argue is unconstitutional. Others may feel government services and policies are not being dispensed in accordance with the Charter, and apply to lower-level courts for injunctions against the government (as was the case in Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)). A government may also raise questions of rights by submitting reference questions to higher-level courts; for example, Prime Minister Paul Martin's government approached the Supreme Court with Charter questions as well as federalism concerns in the case Re Same-Sex Marriage (2004). Provinces may also do this with their superior courts. The government of Prince Edward Island initiated the Provincial Judges Reference by asking its provincial Supreme Court a question on judicial independence under section 11.\\r\\nIn several important cases, judges developed various tests and precedents for interpreting specific provisions of the Charter. These include the Oakes test for section 1, set out in the case R. v. Oakes (1986), and the (now defunct[23]) Law test for section 15, developed in Law v. Canada (1999). Since Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act (1985), various approaches to defining and expanding the scope of fundamental justice (the Canadian name for natural justice or due process) under section 7 have been adopted. (For more information, see the articles on each Charter section).\\r\\nIn general, courts have embraced a purposive interpretation of Charter rights.[24] This means that since early cases like Hunter v. Southam (1984) and R. v. Big M Drug Mart (1985), they have concentrated not on the traditional, limited understanding of what each right meant when the Charter was adopted in 1982, but rather on changing the scope of rights as appropriate to fit their broader purpose.[24] This is tied to the generous interpretation of rights, as the purpose of the Charter provisions is assumed to be to increase rights and freedoms of people in a variety of circumstances, at the expense of the government powers.[24] Constitutional scholar Peter Hogg has approved of the generous approach in some cases, although for others he argues the purpose of the provisions was not to achieve a set of rights as broad as courts have imagined.[24] Indeed, this approach has not been without its critics. Alberta politician Ted Morton and political scientist Rainer Knopff have been very critical of this phenomenon. Although they feel the basis for the approach, the living tree doctrine (the classical name for generous interpretations of the Canadian Constitution), is sound, they argue Charter case law has been more radical. When the living tree doctrine is applied right, the authors claim, \\"The elm remained an elm; it grew new branches but did not transform itself into an oak or a willow.\\" The doctrine can be used, for example, so a right is upheld even when a government threatens to violate it with new technology, as long as the essential right remains the same; but the authors claim that the courts have used the doctrine to \\"create new rights.\\" As an example, the authors note that the Charter right against self-incrimination has been extended to cover scenarios in the justice system that had previously been unregulated by self-incrimination rights in other Canadian laws.[25]\\r\\nAnother general approach to interpreting Charter rights is to consider international legal precedents with countries that have specific rights protections, such as the United States Bill of Rights (an influence on aspects of the Charter) and the Constitution of South Africa. However, international precedent is only of guiding value, and is not binding. For example, the Supreme Court has referred to the Charter and the American Bill of Rights as being \\"born to different countries in different ages and in different circumstances.\\"[26]\\r\\nPublic interest groups frequently intervene in cases to make arguments on how to interpret the Charter. Some examples are the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the Canadian Mental Health Association, the Canadian Labour Congress, the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), and REAL Women of Canada. The purpose of such interventions is to assist the court and to attempt to influence the court to render a decision favourable to the legal interests of the group.\\r\\nA further approach to the Charter, taken by the courts, is the dialogue principle, which involves greater participation by elected governments. This approach involves governments drafting legislation in response to court rulings and courts acknowledging the effort if the new legislation is challenged.\\r\\nSome Canadian Members of Parliament saw the movement to entrench a charter as contrary to the British model of Parliamentary supremacy. Others would say that the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) has now limited British parliamentary power to a greater degree than the Canadian Charter limited the power of the Canadian Parliament and provincial legislatures. Hogg has speculated that the British adopted the Human Rights Act 1998, which allows the ECHR to be enforced directly in domestic courts, partly because they were inspired by the similar Canadian Charter.[27]\\r\\nThe Canadian Charter bears a number of similarities to the European Convention, specifically in relation to the limitations clauses contained in the European document.[28] Because of this similarity with European human rights law, the Supreme Court of Canada turns not only to the Constitution of the United States case law in interpreting the Charter, but also to European Court of Human Rights cases.\\r\\nThe core distinction between the United States Bill of Rights and Canadian Charter is the existence of the limitations and notwithstanding clauses. Canadian courts have consequently interpreted each right more expansively.[29] However, due to the limitations clause, where a violation of a right exists, the law will not necessarily grant protection of that right.[29] In contrast, rights under the US Bill of Rights are absolute and so a violation will not be found until there has been sufficient encroachment on those rights. The sum effect is that both constitutions provide comparable protection of many rights.[29] Fundamental justice (in section 7 of the Canadian Charter) is therefore interpreted to include more legal protections than due process, which is its US equivalent. Freedom of expression in section 2 also has a more wide-ranging scope than the First Amendment to the United States Constitution's freedom of speech.[29] In RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd. (1986), the Canadian Supreme Court considered picketing of the kind the US First Amendment did not permit, as it was disruptive conduct (though there was some speech involved that the First Amendment might otherwise protect). The Supreme Court, however, ruled the picketing, including the disruptive conduct, were fully protected under section 2 of the Charter. The Court then relied on section 1 to find the injunction against the picketing was just.[30] The limitations clause has also allowed governments to enact laws that would be considered unconstitutional in the US. The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld some of Quebec's limits on the use of English on signs and has upheld publication bans that prohibit media from mentioning the names of juvenile criminals.\\r\\nSection 28 of the Charter performs a function similar to that of the unratified Equal Rights Amendment in the US. While that proposed amendment had many critics, there was no comparable opposition to the Charter's section 28.[31] Still, Canadian feminists had to stage large protests to demonstrate support for the inclusion of the section which had not been part of the original draft of the charter.[32][33]\\r\\nThe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has several parallels with the Canadian Charter, but in some cases the Covenant goes further with regard to rights in its text. For example, a right to legal aid has been read into section 10 of the Charter (the right to counsel), but the Covenant explicitly guarantees the accused need not pay \\"if he does not have sufficient means.\\"[34]\\r\\nThe Canadian Charter has little to say, explicitly at least, about economic and social rights. On this point, it stands in marked contrast with the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. There are some who feel economic rights ought to be read into section 7 rights to security of the person and section 15 equality rights to make the Charter similar to the Covenant.[32] The rationale is that economic rights can relate to a decent standard of living and can help the civil rights flourish in a livable environment.[32] Canadian courts, however, have been hesitant in this area, stating that economic rights are political questions and adding that as positive rights, economic rights are of questionable legitimacy.[32]\\r\\nThe Charter itself influenced the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of South Africa.[32] The limitations clause under section 36 of the South African law has been compared to section 1 of that Charter.[28]\\r\\nJamaica's Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms was also influenced, in part, by the Canadian charter.[35][36]\\r\\nThe Charter was intended to be a source for Canadian values and national unity. As Professor Alan Cairns noted, \\"The initial federal government premise was on developing a pan-Canadian identity.\\"[27] Trudeau himself later wrote in his Memoirs that \\"Canada itself\\" could now be defined as a \\"society where all people are equal and where they share some fundamental values based upon freedom\\", and that all Canadians could identify with the values of liberty and equality.[37]\\r\\nThe Charter's unifying purpose was particularly important to the mobility and language rights. According to author Rand Dyck, some scholars believe section 23, with its minority language education rights, \\"was the only part of the Charter with which Pierre Trudeau was truly concerned\\".[38] Through the mobility and language rights, French Canadians, who have been at the centre of unity debates, are able to travel throughout all Canada and receive government and educational services in their own language. Hence, they are not confined to Quebec (the only province where they form the majority and where most of their population is based), which would polarize the country along regional lines. The Charter was also supposed to standardize previously diverse laws throughout the country and gear them towards a single principle of liberty.[39]\\r\\nFormer premier of Ontario Bob Rae has stated that the Charter \\"functions as a symbol for all Canadians\\" in practice because it represents the core value of freedom.[27] Academic Peter Russell has been more skeptical of the Charter's value in this field. Cairns, who feels the Charter is the most important constitutional document to many Canadians, and that the Charter was meant to shape the Canadian identity, has also expressed concern that groups within society see certain provisions as belonging to them alone rather than to all Canadians.[27] It has also been noted that issues like abortion and pornography, raised by the Charter, tend to be controversial.[39] Still, opinion polls in 2002 showed Canadians felt the Charter significantly represented Canada, although many were unaware of the document's actual contents.[40]\\r\\nThe only values mentioned by the Charter's preamble are recognition for the supremacy of God and the rule of law, but these have been controversial and of minor legal consequence. In 1999, MP Svend Robinson brought forward a failed proposal before the Canadian House of Commons that would have amended the Charter by removing the mention of God, as he felt it did not reflect Canada's diversity.\\r\\nSection 27 also recognizes a value of multiculturalism. In 2002, polls found 86% of Canadians approved of this section.[41]\\r\\nWhile the Charter has enjoyed a great deal of popularity, with 82% of Canadians describing it as a good thing in opinion polls in 1987 and 1999,[27] the document has also been subject to published criticisms from both sides of the political spectrum. One left-wing critic is Professor Michael Mandel, who wrote that in comparison to politicians, judges do not have to be as sensitive to the will of the electorate, nor do they have to make sure their decisions are easily understandable to the average Canadian citizen. This, in Mandel's view, limits democracy.[42] Mandel has also asserted that the Charter makes Canada more like the United States, especially by serving corporate rights and individual rights rather than group rights and social rights.[42] He has argued that there are several things that should be included in the Charter, such as a right to health care and a basic right to free education. Hence, the perceived Americanization of Canadian politics is seen as coming at the expense of values more important for Canadians.[42] The union movement has been disappointed in the reluctance of the courts to use the Charter to support various forms of union activity, such as the \\"right to strike\\".\\r\\nRight-wing critics Morton and Knopff have raised several concerns about the Charter, notably by alleging that the federal government has used it to limit provincial powers by allying with various rights claimants and interest groups. In their book The Charter Revolution & the Court Party, Morton and Knopff express their suspicions of this alliance in detail, accusing the Trudeau and Chrtien governments of funding litigious groups. For example, these governments used the Court Challenges Program to support minority language educational rights claims. Morton and Knopff also assert that crown counsel has intentionally lost cases in which the government was taken to court for allegedly violating rights, particularly gay rights and women's rights.[43]\\r\\nPolitical scientist Rand Dyck, in observing these criticisms, notes that while judges have had their scope of review widened, they have still upheld most laws challenged on Charter grounds. With regard to litigious interest groups, Dyck points out that \\"the record is not as clear as Morton and Knopff imply. All such groups have experienced wins and losses.\\"[44]\\r\\nThe political philosopher Charles Blattberg has criticized the Charter for contributing to the fragmentation of the country, at both the individual and group levels. In encouraging discourse based upon rights, the Charter is said to inject an adversarial spirit into Canadian politics, making it difficult to realize the common good. Blattberg also claims that the Charter undercuts the Canadian political community since it is ultimately a cosmopolitan document. Finally, he argues that people would be more motivated to uphold individual liberties if they were expressed with terms that are much \\"thicker\\" (less abstract) than rights.[45]","input":"How long is the canadian charter of rights and freedoms?"},{"output":"Australia","context":"The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system[1][2] composed of over 2,900 individual reefs[3] and 900 islands stretching for over 2,300 kilometres (1,400?mi) over an area of approximately 344,400 square kilometres (133,000?sq?mi).[4][5] The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia.\\r\\nThe Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms.[6] This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps.[7] It supports a wide diversity of life and was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981.[1][2] CNN labelled it one of the seven natural wonders of the world.[8] The Queensland National Trust named it a state icon of Queensland.[9]\\r\\nA large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which helps to limit the impact of human use, such as fishing and tourism. Other environmental pressures on the reef and its ecosystem include runoff, climate change accompanied by mass coral bleaching, and cyclic population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish. According to a study published in October 2012 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the reef has lost more than half its coral cover since 1985.[10]\\r\\nThe Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and is an important part of local groups' cultures and spirituality. The reef is a very popular destination for tourists, especially in the Whitsunday Islands and Cairns regions. Tourism is an important economic activity for the region, generating over AUD$3?billion per year.[11] In November 2014, Google launched Google Underwater Street View in 3D of the Great Barrier Reef.[12]\\r\\nA March 2016 report stated that coral bleaching was more widespread than previously thought, seriously affecting the northern parts of the reef as a result of warming ocean temperatures.[13] In October 2016, Outside published an obituary for the reef;[14] the article was criticized for being premature and hindering efforts to bolster the resilience of the reef.[15] In March 2017, the journal Nature published a paper showing that huge sections of a 800-kilometre (500 mi) stretch in the northern part of the reef had died in the course of 2016 due to high water temperatures, an event that the authors put down to the effects of global climate change.[16]\\r\\nThe Great Barrier Reef is a distinct feature of the East Australian Cordillera division. It includes the smaller Murray Islands.[17] It reaches from Torres Strait (between Bramble Cay, its northernmost island, and the south coast of Papua New Guinea) in the north to the unnamed passage between Lady Elliot Island (its southernmost island) and Fraser Island in the south. Lady Elliot Island is located 1,915?km (1,190?mi) southeast of Bramble Cay as the crow flies.[18]\\r\\nThe Plate tectonic theory indicates Australia has moved northwards at a rate of 7?cm (2.8?in) per year, starting during the Cenozoic.[19][20] Eastern Australia experienced a period of tectonic uplift, which moved the drainage divide in Queensland 400?km (250?mi) inland. Also during this time, Queensland experienced volcanic eruptions leading to central and shield volcanoes and basalt flows.[21] Some of these became high islands.[22] After the Coral Sea Basin formed, coral reefs began to grow in the Basin, but until about 25 million years ago, northern Queensland was still in temperate waters south of the tropicstoo cool to support coral growth.[23] The Great Barrier Reef's development history is complex; after Queensland drifted into tropical waters, it was largely influenced by reef growth and decline as sea level changed.[24]\\r\\nReefs can increase in diameter by 1 to 3 centimetres (0.39 to 1.18?in) per year, and grow vertically anywhere from 1 to 25?cm (0.39 to 9.84?in) per year; however, they grow only above a depth of 150 metres (490?ft) due to their need for sunlight, and cannot grow above sea level.[25] When Queensland edged into tropical waters 24 million years ago, some coral grew,[26] but a sedimentation regime quickly developed with erosion of the Great Dividing Range; creating river deltas, oozes and turbidites, unsuitable conditions for coral growth. 10 million years ago, the sea level significantly lowered, which further enabled sedimentation. The reef's substrate may have needed to build up from the sediment until its edge was too far away for suspended sediments to inhibit coral growth. In addition, approximately 400,000 years ago there was a particularly warm interglacial period with higher sea levels and a 4?C (7?F) water temperature change.[27]\\r\\nThe land that formed the substrate of the current Great Barrier Reef was a coastal plain formed from the eroded sediments of the Great Dividing Range with some larger hills (most of which were themselves remnants of older reefs[28] or, in rare cases, volcanoes[22]).[20] The Reef Research Centre, a Cooperative Research Centre, has found coral 'skeleton' deposits that date back half a million years.[29] The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) considers the earliest evidence of complete reef structures to have been 600,000 years ago.[30] According to the GBRMPA, the current, living reef structure is believed to have begun growing on the older platform about 20,000 years ago.[30] The Australian Institute of Marine Science agrees, placing the beginning of the growth of the current reef at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum. At around that time, sea level was 120 metres (390?ft) lower than it is today.[28]\\r\\nFrom 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago, sea level rose steadily around the world. As it rose, the corals could then grow higher on the newly submerged maritime margins of the hills of the coastal plain. By around 13,000 years ago the sea level was only 60 metres (200?ft) lower than the present day, and corals began to surround the hills of the coastal plain, which were, by then, continental islands. As the sea level rose further still, most of the continental islands were submerged. The corals could then overgrow the submerged hills, to form the present cays and reefs. Sea level here has not risen significantly in the last 6,000 years.[28] The CRC Reef Research Centre estimates the age of the present, living reef structure at 6,000 to 8,000 years old.[29] The shallow water reefs that can be seen in air-photographs and satellite images cover an area of 20,679 km2, most (about 80%) of which[31] has grown on top of limestone platforms that are relics of past (Pleistocene) phases of reef growth.[32]\\r\\nThe remains of an ancient barrier reef similar to the Great Barrier Reef can be found in The Kimberley, Western Australia.[33]\\r\\nThe Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area has been divided into 70 bioregions,[34] of which 30 are reef bioregions.[35][36] In the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef, ribbon reefs and deltaic reefs have formed; these structures are not found in the rest of the reef system.[29] There are no atolls in the system,[37] and reefs attached to the mainland are rare.[20]\\r\\nFringing reefs are distributed widely, but are most common towards the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef, attached to high islands, for example, the Whitsunday Islands. Lagoonal reefs are found in the southern Great Barrier Reef, and further north, off the coast of Princess Charlotte Bay. Cresentic reefs are the most common shape of reef in the middle of the system, for example the reefs surrounding Lizard Island. Cresentic reefs are also found in the far north of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and in the Swain Reefs (20ÿ22 degrees south). Planar reefs are found in the northern and southern parts, near Cape York Peninsula, Princess Charlotte Bay, and Cairns. Most of the islands on the reef are found on planar reefs.[38]\\r\\nThe Great Barrier Reef supports a diversity of life, including many vulnerable or endangered species, some of which may be endemic to the reef system.[39][40]\\r\\nThirty species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises have been recorded in the Great Barrier Reef, including the dwarf minke whale, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, and the humpback whale. Large populations of dugongs live there.[40][41][42] More than 1,500 fish species live on the reef, including the clownfish, red bass, red-throat emperor, and several species of snapper and coral trout.[41] Forty-nine species mass spawn, while eighty-four other species spawn elsewhere in their range.[43] Seventeen species of sea snake live on the Great Barrier Reef in warm waters up to 50 metres (160?ft) deep and are more common in the southern than in the northern section. None found in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area are endemic, nor are any endangered.[44]\\r\\nSix species of sea turtles come to the reef to breed: the green sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, flatback turtle, and the Olive Ridley. The green sea turtles on the Great Barrier Reef have two genetically distinct populations, one in the northern part of the reef and the other in the southern part.[45] Fifteen species of seagrass in beds attract the dugongs and turtles,[41] and provide fish habitat.[46] The most common genera of seagrasses are Halophila and Halodule.[47]\\r\\nSaltwater crocodiles live in mangrove and salt marshes on the coast near the reef.[48] Nesting has not been reported, and the salt water crocodile population in the GBRWHA is wide-ranging but low density.[44] Around 125 species of shark, stingray, skates or chimaera live on the reef.[49][50] Close to 5,000 species of mollusc have been recorded on the reef, including the giant clam and various nudibranchs and cone snails.[41] Forty-nine species of pipefish and nine species of seahorse have been recorded.[44] At least seven species of frog inhabit the islands.[51]\\r\\n215 species of birds (including 22 species of seabirds and 32 species of shorebirds) visit the reef or nest or roost on the islands,[52] including the white-bellied sea eagle and roseate tern.[41] Most nesting sites are on islands in the northern and southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef, with 1.4 to 1.7?million birds using the sites to breed.[53][54] The islands of the Great Barrier Reef also support 2,195 known plant species; three of these are endemic. The northern islands have 300ÿ350 plant species which tend to be woody, whereas the southern islands have 200 which tend to be herbaceous; the Whitsunday region is the most diverse, supporting 1,141 species. The plants are propagated by birds.[51]\\r\\nThere are at least 330 species of ascidians on the reef system with the diameter of 1ÿ10?cm (0.4ÿ4?in). Between 300ÿ500 species of bryozoans live on the reef.[50] Four hundred coral species, both hard corals and soft corals inhabit the reef.[41] The majority of these spawn gametes, breeding in mass spawning events that are triggered by the rising sea temperatures of spring and summer, the lunar cycle, and the diurnal cycle. Reefs in the inner Great Barrier Reef spawn during the week after the full moon in October, while the outer reefs spawn in November and December.[55] Its common soft corals belong to 36 genera.[56] Five hundred species of marine algae or seaweed live on the reef,[41] including thirteen species of genus Halimeda, which deposit calcareous mounds up to 100 metres (110?yd) wide, creating mini-ecosystems on their surface which have been compared to rainforest cover.[57]\\r\\nClimate change, pollution, crown-of-thorns starfish and fishing are the primary threats to the health of this reef system. Other threats include shipping accidents, oil spills, and tropical cyclones.[58] Skeletal Eroding Band, a disease of bony corals caused by the protozoan Halofolliculina corallasia, affects 31 coral species.[59] According to a 2012 study by the National Academy of Science, since 1985, the Great Barrier Reef has lost more than half of its corals with two-thirds of the loss occurring from 1998 due to the factors listed before.[60]\\r\\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority considers the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef to be climate change, causing ocean warming which increases coral bleaching.[61][62] Mass coral bleaching events due to elevated ocean temperatures occurred in the summers of 1998, 2002 and 2006,[63] and coral bleaching is expected to become an annual occurrence.[64] As global warming continues, corals will not be able to keep up with increasing ocean temperatures. Coral bleaching events lead to increased disease susceptibility, which causes detrimental ecological effects for reef communities.[65]\\r\\nWorld Heritage Committee meeting will take place in Krak܇w, Poland, in July 2017. UNESCO, in a draft decision published in June 2017 as part of the agenda for the meeting, expressed serious concern about the impact of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. The draft decision also warned Australia that it will not meet the targets of the Reef 2050 report without considerable work to improve water quality. [66]\\r\\nClimate change has implications for other forms of reef lifesome fish's preferred temperature range leads them to seek new habitat, thus increasing chick mortality in predatory seabirds. Climate change will also affect the population and sea turtle's available habitat.[67]\\r\\nBleaching events in benthic coral communities (deeper than 20 metres or 66 feet) in the Great Barrier reef are not as well documented as those at shallower depths, but recent research has shown that benthic communities are just as negatively impacted in the face of rising ocean temperatures. Five Great Barrier Reef species of large benthic corals were found bleached under elevated temperatures, affirming that benthic corals are vulnerable to thermal stress.[68]\\r\\nAnother key threat faced by the Great Barrier Reef is pollution and declining water quality. The rivers of north eastern Australia pollute the Reef during tropical flood events. Over 90% of this pollution comes from farm runoff.[69] 80% of the land adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef is used for farming including intensive cropping of sugar cane, and major beef cattle grazing. Farming practices damage the reef due to overgrazing, increased run-off of agricultural sediments, nutrients and chemicals including fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides representing a major health risk for the coral and biodiversity of the reefs.[70] Sediments containing high levels of copper and other heavy metals sourced from the Ok Tedi Mine in Papua New Guinea are a potential pollution risk for the far northern Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait regions.[71]\\r\\nSome 67% of corals died in the reef's worst-hit northern section, the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies report said.[72]\\r\\nThe runoff problem is exacerbated by the loss of coastal wetlands which act as a natural filter for toxins and help deposit sediment.[73][74][75] It is thought that the poor water quality is due to increased light and oxygen competition from algae.[76]\\r\\nFarming fertiliser runoff release nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium into the oceanic ecosystem, these limiting nutrients cause massive algal growth which leads to depletion in oxygen available for other creatures which decreases the biodiversity in the affected areas, altering the species composition. A study by Katharina Fabricius and Glen Death of Australian Institute of Marine Science found that hard corals numbers were almost double on reefs that were far from agricultural areas.[70]\\r\\nFertilizers also increase the amount of phytoplankton available for the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae to consume. A study showed that a doubling of the chlorophyll in the water leads to a tenfold increase in the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae's survival rate.[70]\\r\\nSediment runoff from farming carries chemicals into the reef environment also reduces the amount of light available to the corals decreasing their ability to extract energy from their environment.[70]\\r\\nPesticides used in farming are made up of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxins are released into the wider environment due to erosion of farm soil, which has a detrimental effect on the coral.[70]\\r\\nMining company Queensland Nickel discharged nitrate-laden water into the Great Barrier Reef in 2009 and 2011 ÿ on the later occasion releasing 516 tonnes (508 long tons; 569 short tons) of waste water. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) stated \\"We have strongly encouraged the company to investigate options that do not entail releasing the material to the environment and to develop a management plan to eliminate this potential hazard; however, GBRMPA does not have legislative control over how the Yabulu tailings dam is managed\\".[77]\\r\\nThe crown-of-thorns starfish preys on coral polyps. Large outbreaks of these starfish can devastate reefs. In 2000, an outbreak contributed to a loss of 66% of live coral cover on sampled reefs in a study by the RRC (Reefs Research Centre.)[78] Outbreaks are believed to occur in natural cycles, worsened by poor water quality and overfishing of the starfish's predators.[78][79]\\r\\nThe unsustainable overfishing of keystone species, such as the Giant Triton, can disrupt food chains vital to reef life. Fishing also impacts the reef through increased water pollution from boats, by-catch of unwanted species (such as dolphins and turtles) and habitat destruction from trawling, anchors and nets.[80] As of the middle of 2004, approximately one-third of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission.[81]\\r\\nShipping accidents are a pressing concern, as several commercial shipping routes pass through the Great Barrier Reef.[82] Although the route through the Great Barrier Reef is not easy, reef pilots consider it safer than outside the reef in the event of mechanical failure, since a ship can sit safely while being repaired.[83] There have been over 1,600?known shipwrecks in the Great Barrier Reef region.[84] On 3 April 2010, bulk coal carrier Shen Neng?1 ran aground on Douglas Shoals,[85] spilling up to four tonnes of oil into the water and causing extensive damage to the reef.[86]\\r\\nThe Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Aboriginal Australians have been living in the area for at least 40,000 years,[87] and Torres Strait Islanders since about 10,000 years ago.[88] For these 70 or so clan groups, the reef is also an important cultural feature.[89]\\r\\nIn 1768 Louis de Bougainville found the reef during an exploratory mission, but did not claim the area for the French.[90] On 11 June 1770, the HM Bark Endeavour, captained by explorer James Cook, ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, sustaining considerable damage. Lightening the ship and re-floating it during an incoming tide eventually saved it.[91] One of the most famous wrecks was the HMS Pandora, which sank on 29 August 1791, killing 35 men. The Queensland Museum has led archaeological digs to the Pandora since 1983.[92] Because the reef had no atolls, it was largely unstudied in the 19th century.[37] During this time, some of the reef's islands were mined for deposits of guano, and lighthouses were built as beacons throughout the system.[93] as in Raine Island, the earliest example.[94] In 1922, the Great Barrier Reef Committee began carrying out much of the early research on the reef.[95]\\r\\nRoyal Commissions disallowed oil drilling in the Great Barrier Reef, in 1975 the Government of Australia created the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and prohibited various activities.[96] The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park does not include the entire Great Barrier Reef Province.[18] The park is managed, in partnership with the Government of Queensland, through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to ensure that it is used in a sustainable manner. A combination of zoning, management plans, permits, education and incentives (such as eco-tourism certification) are employed in the effort to conserve the reef.[58][97]\\r\\nIn 1999, the Australian Parliament passed the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which improved the operation of national environmental law by providing guidance about regional biodiversity conservation priorities. The marine bioregional planning process came from the implementation of this law. This process conserves marine biodiversity by considering the whole ecosystem a species is in and how different species interact in the marine environment.\\r\\nThere are two steps to this process. The first step is to identify regional conservation priorities in the five (currently) different marine regions. The second step is to identify marine reserves (protected areas or marine parks) to be added to Australia's National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. Like protected areas on land, marine reserves are created to protect biodiversity for generations to come. Marine reserves are identified based on criteria written in a document created by Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council called \\"Guidelines for establishing the national representative system of marine protected areas\\", also known as just \\"the Guidelines\\". These guidelines are nationally recognised and implemented at the local level based on the Australian policy for implementation outlined in the \\"Goals and Principles for the Establishment of the National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas in Commonwealth Waters\\". These policies are in place to make sure that a marine reserve is only added to the NRSMPA after careful evaluation of different data.\\r\\nThe priorities for each region are created based on human and environmental threats and the Marine Bioregional Plans are drafted to address these priorities. To assess different region's priorities, three steps are taken, first, a bioregional profile is created, second, a bioregional plan is drafted, and third, the plan is finalised. After the plan is finalised, activity in different bioregions may become limited based on particular threats an activity may pose.[98]\\r\\nIn 2001, the GBRMPA released a report about the declining water quality in the Great Barrier Reef and detailed the importance of this issue. In response to this report, in 2003, the Australian and Queensland governments launched a joint initiative to improve the quality of water entering the Great Barrier Reef.[99] The decline in the quality of water over the past 150 years (due to development) has contributed to coral bleaching, algal blooms, and pesticide pollution. These forms of pollution have made the reef less resilient to climate change.\\r\\nWhen the plan was introduced in October 2003, it originally contained 65 actions built on previous legislation. Their immediate goal was to halt and reverse the decline in water quality entering the reef by 2013. By 2020, they hope that the quality of the water entering in the reef improves enough so that it doesn't have a detrimental impact on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. To achieve these goals they decided to reduce pollutants in the water entering the reef and to rehabilitate and conserve areas of the reef that naturally help reduce water pollutants. To achieve the objectives described above, this plan focuses on non-point sources of pollution, which cannot be traced to a single source such as a waste outlet.\\r\\nThe plan specifically targets nutrients, pesticides and sediment that make their way into the reef as a result of agricultural activities. Other non-point sources of pollution that are attributed to urban areas are covered under different legislation. In 2009, the plan was updated. The updated version states that to date, none of the efforts undertaken to improve the quality of water entering the reef has been successful. The new plan attempts to address this issue by \\"targeting priority outcomes, integrating industry and community initiatives and incorporating new policy and regulatory frameworks (Reef Plan?5)\\". This updated version has improved the clarity of the previous plan and targets set by that plan, have improved accountability and further improved monitoring and assessment. The 2009 report found that 41 out of the 65 actions met their original goals, however, 18 were not progressing well according to evaluation criteria as well as 6 were rated as having unsatisfactory levels of progress.\\r\\nSome key achievements made since the plan's initial passing in 2003 were the establishment of the Reef Quality Partnership to set targets, report findings and monitor progress towards targets, improved land condition by landowners was rewarded with extended leases, Water Quality Improvement Plans were created to identify regional targets and identified management changes that needed to be made to reach those targets, Nutrient Management Zones have been created to combat sediment loss in particular areas, education programs have been started to help gather support for sustainable agriculture, changes to land management practices have taken place through the implementation of the Farm Management Systems and codes of practice, the creation of the Queensland Wetland program and other achievements were made to help improve the water quality flowing into the coral reefs.\\r\\nA taskforce of scientists was also created to assess the impact of different parts of the plan on the quality of water flowing into the coral reefs. They found that many of the goals have yet to be reached but found more evidence that states that improving the water quality of the Great Barrier Reef will improve its resilience to climate change. The Reefocus summit in 2008, which is also detailed in the report, came to similar conclusions. After this, a stakeholder working group was formed that worked between several groups as well as the Australian and Queensland governments to update reef goals and objectives. The updated version of the plan focuses on strategic priority areas and actions to achieve 2013 goals. Also quantitative targets have been made to critically assess whether targets are being met.\\r\\nSome examples of the water quality goals outlined by this plan are that by 2013, there will be a 50% reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus loads at the end of catchments and that by 2020, there will be a reduction in sediment load by 20%. The plan also outlines a number of steps that must be taken by landholders to help improve grazing, soil, nutrient, and chemical management practices. There are also a number of supporting initiatives to take place outlined in the plan to help create a framework to improve land use practices which will in turn improve water quality.\\r\\nThrough these means the governments of Australia and Queensland hope to improve water quality by 2013. The 2013 outlook report and revised water quality plan will assess what needs to be done in the future to improve water quality and the livelihoods of the wildlife that resides there.[100]\\r\\nIn July 2004, a new zoning plan took effect for the entire Marine Park, and has been widely acclaimed as a new global benchmark for marine ecosystem conservation.[101] The rezoning was based on the application of systematic conservation planning techniques, using marxan software.[102] While protection across the Marine Park was improved, the highly protected zones increased from 4.5% to over 33.3%.[103] At the time, it was the largest Marine Protected Area in the world, although in 2006, the new Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument became the largest.[104]\\r\\nIn 2006, a review of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act of 1975 recommended are that there should be no further zoning plan changes until 2013, and that every five years, a peer-reviewed outlook report should be published, examining the reef's health, management, and environmental pressures.[5][105] In each outlook report, several assessments are required. Each assessment has a set of assessment criteria that allows for better presentation of available evidence. Each assessment is judged by these criteria and given a grade. Every outlook report follows the same judging and grading process so that information can be tracked over time. No new research is done to produce the report. Only readily available information goes into the report so little of what is known about the Reef is actually featured in each outlook report.[106]\\r\\nIn December 2013, Greg Hunt, the Australian environment minister, approved a plan for dredging to create three shipping terminals as part of the construction of a coalport. According to corresponding approval documents, the process will create around 3?million cubic metres of dredged seabed that will be dumped within the Great Barrier Reef marine park area.[107]\\r\\nOn 31 January 2014, the GBRMPA issued a dumping permit that will allow three million cubic metres of sea bed from Abbot Point, north of Bowen, to be transported and unloaded in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Potential significant harms have been identified in relation to dredge spoil and the process of churning up the sea floor in the area and exposing it to air: firstly, new research shows the finer particles of dredge spoil can cloud the water and block sunlight, thereby starving sea grass and coral up to distances of 80?km away from the point of origin due to the actions of wind and currents. Furthermore, dredge spoil can literally smother reef or sea grass to death, while storms can repeatedly resuspend these particles so that the harm caused is ongoing; secondly, disturbed sea floor can release toxic substances into the surrounding environment.[108]\\r\\nThe dredge spoil from the Abbot Point port project is to be dumped 24 kilometres (15?mi) away, near Bowen in north Queensland, and the approval from the Authority will result in the production of an extra 70 million tonnes of coal annually, worth between A$1.4?billion and $2.8?billion.[108] Authority chairman, Dr Russell Reichelt, stated after the confirmation of the approval:\\r\\nThis approval is in line with the agencys view that port development along the Great Barrier Reef coastline should be limited to existing ports. As a deepwater port that has been in operation for nearly 30 years, Abbot Point is better placed than other ports along the Great Barrier Reef coastline to undertake expansion as the capital and maintenance dredging required will be significantly less than what would be required in other areas. Its important to note the seafloor of the approved disposal area consists of sand, silt and clay and does not contain coral reefs or seagrass beds.[108]\\r\\nThe approval was provided with a corresponding set of 47 new environmental conditions that include the following:\\r\\nThe Australian Federal Government announced on 13 November that there would now be a ban on the dumping of dredge spoil in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The World Heritage Committee asked Environment Minister Greg Hunt to investigate alternative options to dump on land instead. The Queensland government and the Commonwealth have now accepted the alternative option and advice from The World Heritage Committee and will now commence dumping on land. [110]\\r\\nDue to its vast biodiversity, warm clear waters and accessibility from the tourist boats called \\"live aboards\\", the reef is a very popular destination, especially for scuba divers. Tourism on the Great Barrier Reef is concentrated in Cairns and also The Whitsundays due to their accessibility. These areas make up 7%ÿ8% of the Park's area.[58] The Whitsundays and Cairns have their own Plans of Management.[111] Many cities along the Queensland coast offer daily boat trips. Several continental and coral cay islands are now resorts, including Green Island and Lady Elliot Island. As of 1996, 27 islands on the Great Barrier Reef supported resorts.[58]\\r\\nIn 1996, most of the tourism in the region was domestically generated and the most popular visiting times were during the Australian winter. At this time, it was estimated that tourists to the Great Barrier Reef contributed A$776?million per annum.[112] As the largest commercial activity in the region, it was estimated in 2003 that tourism generated over A$4?billion annually,[113] and the 2005 estimate increased to A$5.1?billion.[111] A Deloitte report published by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in March 2013 states that the Reef's 2,000 kilometres of coastline attracts tourism worth A$6.4?billion annually and employs more than 64,000 people.[114]\\r\\nApproximately two million people visit the Great Barrier Reef each year.[115] Although most of these visits are managed in partnership with the marine tourism industry, there is a concern among the general public that tourism is harmful to the Great Barrier Reef.[58]\\r\\nA variety of boat tours and cruises are offered, from single day trips, to longer voyages. Boat sizes range from dinghies to superyachts.[116] Glass-bottomed boats and underwater observatories are also popular, as are helicopter flights.[117][118] By far, the most popular tourist activities on the Great Barrier Reef are snorkelling and diving, for which pontoons are often used, and the area is often enclosed by nets. The outer part of the Great Barrier Reef is favoured for such activities, due to water quality.[citation needed]\\r\\nManagement of tourism in the Great Barrier Reef is geared towards making tourism ecologically sustainable. A daily fee is levied that goes towards research of the Great Barrier Reef.[111] This fee ends up being 20% of the GBRMPA's income.[119] Policies on cruise ships, bareboat charters, and anchorages limit the traffic on the Great Barrier Reef.[111]\\r\\nThe problems that surround ecotourism in the Great Barrier Reef revolve around permanent tourism platforms. Platforms are large, ship-like vessels that act as a base for tourists while scuba diving and snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef. Seabirds will land on the platforms and defecate which will eventually be washed into the sea. The feces carry nitrogen, phosphorus and often DDT and mercury, which cause aspergillosis, yellow-band disease, and black band disease. Areas without tourism platforms have 14 out of 9,468 (1.1%) diseased corals versus areas with tourism platforms that have 172 out of 7,043 (12%) diseased corals.[120] Tourism is a major economic activity for the region. Thus, while non-permanent platforms could be possible in some areas, overall, permanent platforms are likely a necessity. Solutions have been suggested to siphon bird waste into gutters connecting to tanks helping lower runoff that causes coral disease.[121]\\r\\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has also placed many permanent anchorage points around the general use areas. These act to reduce damage to the reef due to anchoring destroying soft coral, chipping hard coral, and disturbing sediment as it is dragged across the bottom. Tourism operators also must comply with speed limits when travelling to or from tourist destinations, to prevent excessive wake from the boats disturbing the reef ecosystem.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe fishing industry in the Great Barrier Reef, controlled by the Queensland Government, is worth A$1?billion annually.[11] It employs approximately 2000 people, and fishing in the Great Barrier Reef is pursued commercially, for recreation, and as a traditional means for feeding one's family.[89]\\r\\nUnder the Native Title Act 1993, native title holders retain the right to legally hunt dugongs and green turtles for \\"personal, domestic or non-commercial communal needs\\".[122][unreliable source?]\\r\\nFour traditional owners groups agreed to cease the hunting of dugongs in the area in 2011 due to their declining numbers, partially accelerated by seagrass damage from Cyclone Yasi.[123]\\r\\n Media related to Great Barrier Reef at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What country is home to the great barrier reef?"},{"output":"factory employee Josie Phillips","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSiobhan Margaret Finneran (born 27 April 1966) is an English television, film and theatre actress of Irish descent, whose catchphrase \\"Right.

She made her screen debut in the 1987 Independent film Rita, Sue and Bob Too, and subsequently worked consistently in television drama including roles in Coronation Street, (1989ÿ1990) Clocking Off (2000ÿ2002) and The Amazing Mrs Pritchard (2006). In 2005, Finneran originated the lead female  role in the stage play On the Shore of the Wide World and was awarded the Manchester Evening News Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Also a comedy performer, Finneran appeared as a leading character in the first seven series of popular ITV sitcom Benidorm (2007ÿ2015).\\r\\n\\r\\nLater television roles include portraying a lawyer in the mini-series Unforgiven (2009), an embittered servant in the first three series of the costume drama Downton Abbey (2010ÿ2012) and a recovering addict in Happy Valley (2014ÿpresent), for which she was nominated for the 2017 British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress. Later film credits include Mrs Swift in the 2013 film release, The Selfish Giant, which earned her a British Independent Film Award nomination.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinneran was born in Oldham, Lancashire on 27 April 1966 to Irish immigrant parents.[1][2] As a child Finneran was always drawn to the performing arts and was a fan of the celebrated English comedian Eric Morecambe, recalling that \\"as a little girl I wanted to be Eric Morecambe. Not to be like him but to actually be him\\".[2] After studying a theatre studies course, she was in cast in her first major role as Rita in the 1987 film Rita, Sue and Bob Too.[2] Kate Muir, chief film critic at UK newspaper The Times described the characters of Rita and Sue?two teenagers who both have a sexual affair with the older, married Bob (George Costigan) \\"as raunchy, cheeky, unstoppable schoolgirls played with relish by Siobhan Finneran and Michelle Holmes.[3] Between August 1989 and March 1990 Finneran appeared as factory employee Josie Phillips, in the long running ITV1 soap opera Coronation Street.[4][5] The character of Josie is best remembered for her on-off employment, and difficult relationship, with her boss, Mike Baldwin.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinneran continued to appear regularly on UK television, making guest appearances in numerous drama series including Heartbeat (1993, 1994, 2003),[8][9][10] Peak Practice (1995),[11] Out of the Blue (1996),[12] Where The Heart Is (1997),[13] Hetty Wainthrop Investigates (1998) and The Cops (1999).[14][15] Finneran also established herself in comedic roles including episodes of Josie (a 1991 comedy series starring Josie Lawrence),[16] Cannon and Balls Playhouse (1991)[17] and as a regularly appearing cast member in ITV1's production of The Russ Abbot Show (1995ÿ96).[18] Whilst having performed frequently in comedy, Finneran credits her performance as \\"a very damaged mother\\" in Out of the Blue in 1996 in triggering a shift towards more dramatic roles.[19] From the late 1990s Finneran began to consciously cut back her acting work to raise her two children as her husband, the actor Mark Jordon, (whom she married in August 1997)[20] was regularly away from home filming as a series regular in Heartbeat.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 2000 and 2002 Finneran appeared as Julie O'Neill in three series of the BBC1 drama series Clocking Off.[22][23] Subsequent roles in the early 21st century include the ITV1 Russell T Davies drama series Bob & Rose (2001), Sparkhouse (2002)?ÿa modern re-telling of Wuthering Heights scripted by Sally Wainwrightÿ and the two-part thriller Passer By (2004) starring James Nesbitt.[22] In 2005 Finneran appeared as the female lead, Alice Holmes, in the original stage production of On the Shore of the Wide World at the Royal Exchange, Manchester.[24] Finneran's performance earned her the Manchester Evening News Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.[25] In 2006 Finneran was cast as a series regular in The Amazing Mrs Pritchard (2006). Her character, Beverley Clarke is an established partner in a law firm who is inspired to launch a career in politics by her experience of the titular Ros Pritchard, and ultimately becomes an MP.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007 Finneran appeared as Kelly in the British Independent film Boy A.[26] Also In 2007 Finneran appeared as part of the original regular cast in the British sitcom Benidorm which details the experiences of holidaymakers and employees at the fictional Solana hotel in Benidorm, Spain. Finneran described her character Janice Garvey as \\"feisty, foul-mouthed and quite fantastic\\".[21] Over the course of the series, Janice struggles to keep her family unitcomprising Janice's mother Madge (Sheila Reid), her husband Mick (Steve Pemberton) and their own children and grandchildunder control.[21]  A television correspondent at the Sunday Mirror described the character as a \\"fiercely protective lioness, humorous, straight-talking, and saucy\\" inclined to \\"let-it-all-hang-out\\" with a wardrobe comprising \\"skimpy, mutton-dressed-as-lamb outfits\\".[20] Finneran found elements of the shoot embarrassing? including the requirement to be filmed in swimwear[20] and one scene which involved her character \\"snogging\\" a young barman played by an actor in his early twenties.[21] In spite of the outlandish elements of the sitcom, Finneran notes that the cast \\"tried to find the truth in each character, to make them a real person?ÿ not a stereotype.\\"[21] In 2008, Finneran explained that as the series was filmed on location in Benidorm, her parents stepped in to help with childcare back home, with the children visiting during half-term.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinneran would ultimately remain with the series, through to its 7th series, which aired in 2015.[23] Discussing the enduring appeal of the series in 2013, Finneran stated that the series' fan base had become firmly established by the fourth series and that viewers were attracted to the \\"banter\\" and recognisable family dynamics that take viewers \\"to the extremes\\".[27] She also felt that the contrasting summer setting and typical winter air date also provided a form of escapism for the UK audience.[27] After discussing their intent to leave Benidorm during filming of the sixth series (2014), Pemberton and Finneran announced their join departures ahead of the 7th series (2015).[28] Both actors wanted to spend less time filming abroad, and neither wanted to leave on their own.[28] Finneran found filming her last scenes \\"heartbreaking\\" noting she was in \\"a terrible state\\" upon bidding farewell to co-stars and crew with whom she had forged a close relationship.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlongside her role in Benidorm, Finneran continued to star in original drama series'. In 2008 she portrayed Sister Ruth, a Vatican nun drawn to investigate a priest who performs exorcisms, in five episodes of the supernatural thriller Apparitions.[29] In 2009 Finneran appeared as a main cast member in the three part ITV1 thriller Unforgiven as Izzie Ingram, a family lawyer who aids convicted murder Ruth Slater (Suranne Jones) track down her long lost sister.[30] George Costigan, who appears in Unforgiven and first worked with Finneran in 1987 cited the mini-series as an illustration of Finneran's versatility, and justification of his appraisal of her as an acting \\"hero\\" and personal inspiration, stating that \\"she has no background in it and she just goes there. Its extraordinary. Those are the actors that electrify you.\\"[31] Also in 2009, Finneran appeared in episodes of The Street,[32] and Blue Murder,[33]  and the straight-to-DVD soap opera spin-off Coronation Street: Romanian Holiday.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nSiobhan Finneran on her Downton Abbey character.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010 it was announced that Finneran had been cast in Downton Abbey, a period drama depicting the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and their domestic servants.[36] Upon its transmission, Downton Abbey received extensive critical acclaim, and strong viewing figures in both the UK and America.[37]\\r\\n[38][39][40][41][42] Finneran's character, lady's maid Sarah O'Brien serves as an archetypal villain in the series' narrative, whose schemes affect both her employers and her colleagues.[43][44][20] The role was Finneran's first in a costume drama.[20] To become O'Brien, Finneran was required to wear \\"frumpy black\\" servants attire, a wig which Finneran described as having \\"poodle curls\\" and \\"one bit [that is] proper bouffant\\"[20] and spend around an hour in make-up each day to look less attractive.[45] Though screenwriter Julian Fellowes did not give her a backstory to work with, Finneran imagined that O'Brien was both traumatised by past experiences and, had accumulated anger, frustration and resentment issues from having worked in service all her life.[35] In 2012 Finneran stated that she enjoyed the response to the character noting that viewers \\"love that shes a nasty piece of work\\" and \\"love to dislike her\\".[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring her time on the show, the Downton Abbey cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2012 (for series 2), and were nominated also in 2013 (for series 3).[46][47] Finneran announced her departure in March 2013, ahead of the fourth series,[48] explaining that she had been signed for only three series and did not wish to extend her contract, adding: \\"When I stop loving something, I stop doing it.\\"[49] Later that year, when asked by the Radio Times how her character's abrupt exit would be handled, Finneran retorted: \\"Im hoping shes flung off the roof of the Abbey\\".[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 Finneran starred in the second series of The Syndicate on BBC1, portraying Mandy, a hospital worker and domestic abuse victim who wins the national lottery with her colleagues.[50] Finneran was attracted to the role because of the suspense of her character's storyline, and the challenge of keeping the abuse scenes as true-to-life as possible.[50] Also in 2013, Finneran portrayed Mrs Swift in The Selfish Giant an independent film inspired by both Oscar Wilde's short story of the same name and screenwriter and director Clio Barnard's personal experiences of the socially fragmented northern English underclass.[51][52] Finneran's character is a troubled yet loving mother, who she describes as \\"not quite the full shilling\\".[51] In spite of the tough subject matter of the film Finneran enjoyed the filming process noting that she felt \\"safe and secure\\" in the hands of Barnard, who she felt to be a calmer director than any other she had worked with.[53] For her portrayal, Finneran was nominated for the 2013 British Independent Film Award for Best Supporting Actress.[54] In 2014, Finneran appeared in the French-Language film Un Illustre Inconnu (Nobody from Nowhere).[55] In her private life, 2014 saw Finneran obtain a divorce her husband, Mark Jordan.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in 2014, Finneran portrayed recovering heroin addict Clare in BBC One's Happy Valleya crime drama that centres on the personal and occupational struggles faced by Clare's co-habitant sister, sergeant Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire)to general acclaim. Whilst eulogising the series' feminist credentials Gerald O'Donovan of The Daily Telegraph praised Finneran's \\"quietly compelling performance\\" and the character's \\"gritty wisdom\\" and stated viewers were unlikely to witness \\"a more believably crafted female character\\" that year.[56] A second series aired in 2016, which gave more focus to Clare's backstory, interpersonal relationships and struggles with alcoholism.[57][58] Reviewing an episode of the second series, Jack Seale of The Guardian described Finneran as \\"brilliant\\" in her depiction of both Clare's \\"jittery vulnerability\\" and portrayal of \\"a snarling addict who has relapsed\\".[58] In spite of the series' subject matter, Finneran claimed that as an inept cook, she found having to peel carrots and act simultaneously the hardest part of filming.[59][60] She blamed being given a faulty vegetable peeler by the props team in having to \\"hack\\" at the vegetables and opined that the end result of filming \\"looks like I'm digging a hole in the road.\\"[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time of Happy Valley's second series, Finneran had known Lancashire for over 30 years.[57][60] Both their on-screen partnership and the depiction of middle-aged women in general in Happy Valley have been lauded as two of the series' most distinctive elements by television journalists and critics.[61][62][63][64][65] Reflecting on the series' popularity, Finneran stated she felt viewers had taken the show to their hearts because the cast \\"reflected them\\" and \\"looked like real human beings with authentic emotions and flaws\\".[2] Radio Times reviewer Alison Graham stated in 2016 that Finneran and Lancashire \\"should share every acting award going\\".[62] Happy Valley won the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series in Both 2015 and 2017.[66][67] Finneran was nominated in the Best Supporting Actress category in 2017.[67] Though correctly predicting that she would not win the award, Ben Lawrence of The Daily Telegraph identified her as who he felt to be the deserving winner praising the \\"subtle, unfurling power\\" of her depiction.[68] A third and final series of Happy Valley is expected to enter production, though not before Autumn 2018.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween December 2014 and February 2015, Finneran appeared in the stage drama 3 Winters at the Royal National Theatre in London.[70] In Autumn 2015 Finneran played a supporting role in the three part supernatural drama serial Midwinter of the Spirit.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017 she portrayed real-life Detective Constable Christine Freeman in two-part drama The Moorside, a depiction of the 2008 disappearance of Shannon Matthews told from the perspective of the local community.[72] Upon reading the script, Finneran felt that The Moorside told a necessary story that illuminated truths that had been distorted by media coverage.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinneran's next television role in 2017 was as Detective Chief Inspector Lauren Quigley, one of the protagonists in six-part ITV drama The Loch, a crime mystery set on the banks of Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. Quigley is an ambitious English career detective drafted in to investigate a serial killer and acts as a foil to the other protagonist, working mother and local woman DC Annie Redford (Laura Fraser).[2] Finneran was keen to star in the series after reading the first three scripts and finding both her character and the small community setting intriguing, in addition to the prospect of working with a former Downton Abbey director (Brian Kelly) and Laura Fraser, whose acting she had long admired.[74] Finneran based herself in Glasgow during the filming shoot and enjoyed \\"the buzz, the architecture, the social life\\",[2] describing the city as \\"one of my favourite places to ever work\\".[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, she played Nikki Kirkbright in ITV's Cold Feet.","input":"Who did siobhan finneran play in coronation street?"},{"output":"Myke Scavone","context":"Ram Jam was an American rock band formed in New York City in 1977, predominantly known for their hit single \\"Black Betty\\" in 1977.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band consisted of Bill Bartlett (guitar), Howie Arthur Blauvelt (bass), Pete Charles (drums), and Myke Scavone (lead vocals).  Jimmy Santoro, who toured with the band in support of their debut album, joined on guitar for the follow-up album. Bartlett was formerly lead guitarist for bubblegum group the Lemon Pipers, while Blauvelt played with Billy Joel in several bands: the Echoes (also renamed the Lost Souls and then the Commandos), the Hassles and El Primo. Maxx Mann, one-time singer with Trans-Siberian Orchestra and Kings of Christmas, was recruited by producers Kasenetz/Katz to front a version of the group in the 1990s. The band was originally known as 'Creekside Killshack'.\\r\\n\\r\\nBill Bartlett went on from the Lemon Pipers to form a group called Starstruck. Starstruck originally included Steve Walmsley (bass) and Bob Nave (organ) from the Lemon Pipers. Walmsley left the band and was replaced by David Goldflies (who later played for years with Dickey Betts and Great Southern, and the Allman Brothers). While in Starstruck, Bartlett took Lead Belly's 59 second long \\"Black Betty\\" and arranged, recorded and released it on the group's own TruckStar label. \\"Black Betty\\" became a regional hit, then was picked up by producers in New York who formed a group around Bartlett called Ram Jam. They re-released the song, and it became a hit nationally. The Ram Jam \\"recording\\" was actually the same one originally recorded by Starstruck, the band at that time composed of Bartlett (lead guitar and vocals), Tom Kurtz (rhythm guitar and vocals), David Goldflies (bass), and David Fleeman (drums). The rest of the tracks on the first studio album containing \\"Black Betty\\" were played by the Ram Jam lineup. Even though the song was credited to Huddie Ledbetter, the NAACP and Congress of Racial Equality called for a boycott due to the lyrics.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boycott failed, however, and \\"Black Betty\\" reached number 18 on the singles chart in 1977 in the U.S. and Top Ten in the United Kingdom and Australia, while the Ram Jam  album reached the U.S. Top 40. It was also a hit in the Netherlands, reaching number 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir subsequent album Portrait of the Artist as a Young Ram achieved little success, despite the addition of Long Island, New York, lead guitarist Jimmy Santoro.[citation needed] The Portrait album was re-issued on Rock Candy Records from England in 2006. It is listed in the Top 100 lists in Martin Popoffs book The Collectors Guide to Heavy Metal Volume 1: The Seventies. The album's heaviness was attributed to Santoros guitar and Scavones vocal power. Bartlett had left the group by then and did not play on the album.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s both studio releases by Ram Jam were packaged together as a German import record entitled The Very Best Of Ram Jam.[citation needed] However, the cover of the album features the same artwork as their self-titled debut, and The Very Best Of Ram Jam album starts with the ten titles from Ram Jam.[citation needed] This is followed by all ten titles from Portrait of the Artist as a Young Ram. The titles from Portrait of the Artist as a Young Ram are slightly re-ordered. The first two songs (\\"Gone Wild\\", \\"Pretty Poison\\") are moved to the end on The Very Best Of Ram Jam. The song \\"Black Betty\\" has been a Boston Bruins stadium staple for years.[citation needed] Local radio stations continue to use it as a background music when promoting the Bruins games.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA remix of \\"Black Betty\\" by Ben Liebrand reached number 13 in the UK Singles Chart in 1990.[4] Cover versions of the song also appear on the 2002 album Mr. Jones by Tom Jones and on the 2004 album Tonight Alright by Australian rock band Spiderbait.\\r\\n\\r\\nBill Bartlett still plays guitar, but in the early 1990s transformed himself into a boogie-woogie piano player. He also plays banjo, harmonica, slide guitar, and has written dozens of songs. Santoro still plays professionally in various bands in New York, and teaches music at an elementary school on Long Island. He is known for his prestigious rendition of EGBDF. Scavone, who now resides in New Jersey, after many years detached from the music industry, recorded a CD of 12 songs, both originals and cover versions with his former teenage garage rock band called the Doughboys. It was featured at the 40th Reunion of John Zacherle's Disc-O-Teen in 2004, which coincided with Zacherle's 84th birthday. The CD, entitled Is It Now, included liner notes by John Hawkins, the original keyboard and piano player for the Nashville Teens.\\r\\n\\r\\nRam Jam also released a third album entitled Thank You Mam in 1994, on Bud Music in Germany (Catalogue number: CHP 61508).

As of 2015[update], at $4.25 million per team,[3] it has the largest payout of all the non-College Football Playoff (CFP) bowls. In nearly every year since 1985, the game has featured two teams ranked in the Top 25.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game, which began play in 1947, is one of the oldest of the non-CFP bowls, along with the Gator Bowl and Sun Bowl. By 1952, the game was dubbed the \\"Little Bowl with the Big Heart\\", because all the proceeds from the game went to charity.\\r\\nBefore 1968, the game featured matchups between schools throughout the South, often featuring the Ohio Valley Conference champion or other small colleges, although a few major colleges did play in the bowl during this early era as well.\\r\\nFrom 1964 through 1967, it was one of the four regional finals in the College Division (which became Division II and Division III in 1973), along with the Pecan, Grantland Rice, and Camellia bowls.\\r\\nIn 1968, the Boardwalk Bowl in Atlantic City took over as a regional final, and the Tangerine Bowl became a major college bowl game, featuring teams from the University Division (which became Division I in 1973).\\r\\nIn 1986, it was one of the bowl games considered for the site of the \\"winner take all\\" national championship game between Penn State and Miami, before the Fiesta Bowl was eventually chosen.\\r\\nThe 1990 season game had national championship implications; Georgia Tech won the Florida Citrus Bowl, finished 11ÿ0ÿ1, and were voted the 1990 UPI national champion.\\r\\nThe 1997 season game, which featured nearby Florida beating Penn State, holds the game's attendance record at 72,940.\\r\\nIn 2004, the bowl bid to become the fifth BCS game, but was not chosen, primarily due to the stadium's aging condition. In July 2007, the Orange County Commissioners voted in favor of spending $1.1 billion to build the Amway Center for the Orlando Magic, the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, and to upgrade the Citrus Bowl stadium.\\r\\nFollowing the 2014 game, Capital One ceased its sponsorship of the bowl, and moved its sponsorship to the Orange Bowl.[4] Buffalo Wild Wings was announced as the new title sponsor of the bowl game in 2014. Buffalo Wild Wings had previously been the title sponsor of what is now the Cactus Bowl.[5] In the offseason of 2017, Buffalo Wild Wings ceased sponsoring the bowl as the search for a new sponsor is ongoing.\\r\\nThe 2016 season game was played on December 31, the first time in 30 years that the game was not played on January 1st or 2nd.\\r\\nFrom 1968 through 1975, the bowl featured the Mid-American Conference (MAC) champion against an opponent from the Southern Conference (1968ÿ1971), the Southeastern Conference (SEC) (1973ÿ1974), or an at-large opponent (1972, 1975). MAC teams were 6ÿ2 during those games.\\r\\nAs the major football conferences relaxed restrictions on post-season play in the mid-1970s, the bowl went to a matchup between two at-large teams from major conferences, with one school typically (but not always) from the South.\\r\\nFrom the 1987 season through the 1991 season, the bowl featured the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) champion against an at-large opponent. ACC teams were 3ÿ2 during those games.\\r\\nFrom the 1992 season through the 2015 season, the bowl featured an SEC vs. Big Ten matchup ÿ the SEC won 14 of those games, while the Big Ten won 10.\\r\\nDuring the 1990s, the second-place finisher in the SEC typically went to this bowl. Florida coach Steve Spurrier, speaking to the fact that Tennessee occupied that spot three of four years as Florida finished first, famously quipped \\"You can't spell 'Citrus' without U-T!\\"[6]\\r\\nCurrently, the bowl has tie-ins with the SEC and the Big Ten, holding the first selection after the CFP selection process for both conferences. Since the formation of the CFP, the Citrus Bowl has a chance to occasionally host an ACC team, replacing the Big Ten representative. This will happen the years in which the Orange Bowl is not a CFP semi-final game and selects a Big Ten team to match against their ACC team. This happened following the 2016 season, as the Orange Bowl was not a CFP semi-final and invited Michigan of the Big Ten to face Florida State of the ACC; the Citrus Bowl then invited Louisville of the ACC to face LSU of the SEC.[7] The next year, Wisconsin was invited to the Orange Bowl, so the SEC's LSU was pitted against Notre Dame, who received an invite in lieu of an ACC team.\\r\\nThe undefeated 1955 Hillsdale College football team refused an invitation to the game when bowl officials insisted that Hillsdale's four African-American players would not be allowed to play in the game.[8][9]\\r\\nThe University at Buffalo's first bowl bid was to the Tangerine Bowl in 1958. The Tangerine Bowl Commission hoped that the Orlando High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), which operated the stadium, would waive its rule that prohibited integrated sporting events. When it refused, the team unanimously voted to skip the bowl because its two black players (halfback Willie Evans and end Mike Wilson) would not have been allowed on the field.[10] Buffalo would not be bowl-eligible for another 50 years. During the 2008 season, when the Bulls were on the verge of bowl eligibility, the 1958 team was profiled on ESPN's Outside the Lines.[11][12] The 2008 team went on to win the Mid-American Conference title, and played in the International Bowl.\\r\\nBy 1966, the OHSAA's rule had been changed, and Morgan State of Baltimore, under head coach Earl Banks, became the first historically black college to play in (and win) the Tangerine Bowl.[13]\\r\\nIn early 1973, construction improvements were planned for the then 17,000-seat Tangerine Bowl stadium to expand to over 51,000 seats. In early summer 1973, however, construction was stalled due to legal concerns, and the improvements were delayed. Late in the 1973 season, Tangerine Bowl President Will Gieger and other officials planned to invite the Miami Redskins and the East Carolina Pirates to Orlando for the game. On November 19, 1973, East Carolina withdrew its interests, and the bowl was left with one at-large bid. In an unexpected and unprecedented move, game officials decided to invite the Florida Gators, and move the game to Florida Field in Gainesville, the Gators' home stadium. The larger stadium would be needed to accommodate the large crowd expected. The move required special permission from the NCAA, and special accommodations were made. Both teams would be headquartered in Orlando for the week, and spend most of their time there, including practices, and would be bused up to Gainesville.\\r\\nThe participants were greeted with an unexpected event, a near-record low temperature of 25 degrees Fahrenheit (-4 degrees Celsius). Despite the home-field advantage, in the game nicknamed the \\"Transplant Bowl\\",[14] Miami (OH), who found the cold much more to its liking, defeated the Gators 16ÿ7. One of the players on the victorious Redskins squad was future Gators coach Ron Zook.\\r\\nThe one-time moving of the game, and the fears of a permanent relocation, rejuvenated the stalled stadium renovations in Orlando. The game returned to Orlando for 1974, and within a couple of years, the expansion project was complete.\\r\\nThe \\"Capital One Mascot Challenge\\" (formerly known as the \\"Capital One National Mascot of the Year\\") was a contest where fans voted for their favorite college mascot. The contest began in 2002 with the winner being named during the halftime; the winning school was awarded $20,000 towards their mascot program. With the ending of Capital One's sponsorship of the Citrus Bowl, the challenge was moved in 2014 to the Orange Bowl with Capital One's sponsorship of that game.\\r\\nRankings are based on the AP Poll prior to the game being played.

Vitaphone was the last major analog sound-on-disc system and the only one which was widely used and commercially successful. The soundtrack was not printed on the film itself, but issued separately on phonograph records. The discs, recorded at ?33?1?3?rpm (a speed first used for this system) and typically 16 inches (41?cm) in diameter, would be played on a turntable physically coupled to the projector motor while the film was being projected, achieving a frequency response of 4300 Hz[1]. Many early talkies, such as The Jazz Singer (1927), used the Vitaphone system. The name \\"Vitaphone\\" derived from the Latin and Greek words, respectively, for \\"living\\" and \\"sound\\".\\r\\nThe \\"Vitaphone\\" trademark was later associated with cartoons and other short subjects that had optical soundtracks and did not use discs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1920s, Western Electric was developing both sound-on-film and sound-on-disc systems, aided by the purchase of Lee De Forest's Audion amplifier tube in 1913, consequent advances in public address systems, and the first practical condenser microphone, which Western Electric engineer E.C. Wente had created in 1916 and greatly improved in 1922. De Forest debuted his own Phonofilm sound-on-film system in New York City on April?15, 1923, but due to the relatively poor sound quality of Phonofilm and the impressive state-of-the-art sound heard in Western Electric's private demonstrations, the Warner Brothers decided to go forward with the industrial giant and the more familiar disc technology.\\r\\nThe business was established at Western Electric's Bell Laboratories in New York City and acquired by Warner Bros. in April 1925.[2] Warner Bros. introduced Vitaphone on August 6, 1926 with the release of their silent feature Don Juan, which had been retrofitted with a symphonic musical score and sound effects. There was no spoken dialog. The feature was preceded by a program of short subjects with live-recorded sound, nearly all featuring classical instrumentalists and opera stars. The only \\"pop music\\" artist was guitarist Roy Smeck and the only actual \\"talkie\\" was the short film that opened the program: four minutes of introductory remarks by motion picture industry spokesman Will Hays.\\r\\nDon Juan was able to draw huge sums of money at the box office,[2] but was not able to match the expensive budget Warner Bros. put into the film's production.[3] After its financial failure, Paramount head Adolph Zukor offered Sam Warner a deal as an executive producer for Paramount if he brought Vitaphone with him.[4] Sam, not wanting to take any more of Harry Warner's refusal to move forward with using sound in future Warner films, agreed to accept Zukor's offer,[4] but the deal died after Paramount lost money in the wake of Rudolph Valentino's death.[4] Harry eventually agreed to accept Sam's demands.[5] Sam then pushed ahead with a new Vitaphone feature starring Al Jolson, the Broadway dynamo who had already scored a big hit with early Vitaphone audiences in A Plantation Act, a musical short released on October?7, 1926. On October?6, 1927, The Jazz Singer premiered at the Warner Theater in New York City, broke box-office records, established Warner Bros. as a major player in Hollywood, and is traditionally credited with single-handedly launching the talkie revolution.\\r\\nAt first, the production of Vitaphone shorts and the recording of orchestral scores was strictly a New York phenomenon, taking advantage of the bountiful supply of stage and concert hall talent there, but the Warners soon migrated some of this activity to their more spacious facilities on the West Coast. Dance band leader Henry Halstead is given credit for starring in the first Vitaphone short subject filmed in Hollywood instead of New York. Carnival Night in Paris (1927) featured the Henry Halstead Orchestra and a cast of hundreds of costumed dancers in a Carnival atmosphere.\\r\\nFrom the perspective of the cast and crew on the sound stage, there was little difference between filming with Vitaphone and a sound-on-film system. In the early years of sound, the noisy cameras and their operators were enclosed in soundproofed booths with small windows made of thick glass. Cables suspended the microphones in fixed positions just above camera range, and sometimes they were hidden behind objects in the scene. The recording machines were usually located in a separate building to completely isolate them from sound stage floor vibrations and other undesirable influences. The audio signal was sent from an on-stage monitoring and control booth to the recording room over a heavy shielded cable. Synchronization was maintained by driving all the cameras and recorders with synchronous electric motors powered from a common source. When music and sound effects were being recorded to accompany existing film footage, the film was projected so that the conductor could synchronize the music with the visual cues and it was the projector, rather than a camera, that was electrically interlocked with the recording machine.\\r\\nExcept for the unusual disc size and speed, the physical record-making process was the same one employed by contemporary record companies to make smaller discs for home use. The recording lathe cut an audio-signal-modulated spiral groove into the polished surface of a thick round slab of wax-like material rotating on a turntable. The wax was much too soft to be played in the usual way, but a specially supported and guided pickup could be used to play it back immediately in order to detect any sound problems that might have gone unnoticed during the filming. If problems were found, the scene could then be re-shot while everything was still in place, minimizing additional expense. Even the lightest playback caused some damage to the wax master, so it was customary to employ two recorders and simultaneously record two waxes, one to play and the other to be sent for processing if that \\"take\\" of the scene was approved. At the processing plant, the surface of the wax was rendered electrically conductive and electroplated to produce a metal mold or \\"stamper\\" with a ridge instead of a groove, and this was used to press hard shellac discs from molten \\"biscuits\\" of the raw material.\\r\\nBecause of the universal desirability of an immediate playback capability, even studios using sound-on-film systems employed a wax disc \\"playback machine\\" in tandem with their film recorders, as it was impossible to play an optical recording until it had made the round trip to the film processing laboratory.\\r\\nA Vitaphone-equipped theater had normal projectors which had been furnished with special phonograph turntables and pickups; a fader; an amplifier; and a loudspeaker system. The projectors operated just as motorized silent projectors did, but at a fixed speed of 24 frames per second and mechanically interlocked with the attached turntables. When each projector was threaded, the projectionist would align a start mark on the film with the film gate, then cue up the corresponding soundtrack disc on the turntable, being careful to place the phonograph needle at a point indicated by an arrow scribed on the record's surface. When the projector was started, it rotated the linked turntable and (in theory) automatically kept the record \\"in sync\\" (correctly synchronized) with the projected image.\\r\\nThe Vitaphone process made several improvements over previous systems:\\r\\nThese innovations notwithstanding, the Vitaphone process lost the early format war with sound-on-film processes for many reasons:\\r\\nAfter the improvement of the competing sound-on-film systems, Vitaphone's disadvantages led to its retirement early in the sound era. Warner Bros. and First National stopped recording directly to disc and switched to Photophone sound-on-film recording. Warner Bros. had to publicly concede that Vitaphone was being retired, but put a positive spin on it by announcing that Warner films would now be available in both sound-on-film and sound-on-disc versions. Thus, instead of making a grudging admission that its technology had become obsolete, Warner Bros. purported to be doing the entire movie industry a favor.\\r\\nA significant number of theater owners, who had invested heavily in Vitaphone equipment only a short time before, were financially unable or unwilling to replace their sound-on-disc-only equipment. Their continuing need for discs compelled most Hollywood studios to prepare sets of soundtrack discs for their new films, made by dubbing from the optical soundtracks, and supply them as required. This practice continued, although on an ever-dwindling scale, into the mid-1930s.\\r\\nIn 1924ÿ1925, when Western Electric established the format of the system which would eventually be named Vitaphone, they settled on a 16-inch (41?cm) diameter disc rotating at ?33?1?3?rpm as a good practical compromise of disc size and speed. The slow speed permitted the 11-minute playing time needed to match the maximum running time of a then-standard 1000 foot (300 meter) reel of film projected at 24?fps, yet the increased diameter preserved the average effective groove velocity, and therefore the sound quality, of a smaller, shorter-playing record rotating at the then-standard speed of about 78?rpm.\\r\\nLike ordinary pre-vinyl records, Vitaphone discs were made of a shellac compound rendered lightly abrasive by its major constituent, finely pulverized rock. Such records were played with a very inexpensive, imprecisely mass-produced steel needle with a point that quickly wore to fit the contour of the groove, but then went on to wear out in the course of playing one disc side, after which it was meant to be discarded and replaced. Unlike ordinary records, Vitaphone discs were recorded inside out, so that the groove started near the synchronization arrow scribed in the blank area around the label and proceeded outward. During playback, the needle would therefore be fresh where the groove's undulations were most closely packed and needed the most accurate tracing, and suffering from wear only as the much more widely spaced and easily traced undulations toward the edge of the disc were encountered.\\r\\nInitially, Vitaphone discs had a recording on one side only, each reel of film having its own disc. As the sound-on-disc method was slowly relegated to second-class status, cost-cutting changes were instituted, first by making use of both sides of each disc for non-consecutive reels of film, then by reducing the discs to 14 or 12 inches (36 or 30?cm) in diameter. The use of RCA Victor's new \\"Victrolac\\", a lightweight, flexible and less abrasive vinyl-based compound, made it possible to downsize the discs while actually improving their sound quality.[8]\\r\\nThere were exceptions to the 16-inch (41?cm) standard size of 1920s Vitaphone discs. In the case of very short films, such as trailers and some of the earliest musical shorts, the recording, still cut at ?33?1?3?rpm and working outward from a minimum diameter of about 7?1?2 inches (19?cm), was pressed on a 12-or-10-inch (30 or 25?cm) disc when the smaller size sufficed.\\r\\nA coalition of hobbyists, collectors and professional archivists, founded in 1991 and known as \\"The Vitaphone Project\\", has been working to restore long-unseen Vitaphone productions. Its members track down mute picture elements and their corresponding Vitaphone discs, often found in widely separated locations, then use the latest image and sound transfer technology to produce new 35?mm sound-on-film prints that can be shown with ordinary modern projectors.\\r\\nIn the case of some titles that already existed as sound-on-film prints, those prints, many in the inferior 16?mm format, were made long ago using source elements that were incomplete or in poor condition, primitive transfer equipment, and often a minimum of care, so that new restorations have been warranted. When in good condition and played correctly, original Vitaphone discs commonly yield much better audio than the optical soundtracks of old transfers. In some instances superior picture elements are also now available.\\r\\nTo date, the Project has restored more than 50 Vitaphone shorts and films from the sound-on-disc era, featuring many stars of vaudeville, radio, and the concert stage.\\r\\nWarner Bros. kept the \\"Vitaphone\\" trademark alive in the name of its short subjects division, The Vitaphone Corporation (officially dissolved at the end of 1959), most famous for releasing the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. In the 1950s, the Warner Bros. record label boasted \\"Vitaphonic\\" high-fidelity recording. In the 1960s, the end titles of Merrie Melodies cartoons (beginning with From Hare to Heir (1960)) carried the legend \\"A Vitaphone Release\\". Looney Tunes of the same period (beginning with that same year's Hopalong Casualty) were credited as \\"A Vitagraph Release\\", making further use of the name of the venerable Vitagraph Studios in Brooklyn, which the Warners had bought in 1925, used as a facility for working out practical sound film production techniques and filming some early musical shorts, and from which a name for the previously nameless Western Electric sound-on-disc system had been derived.\\r\\nVitaphone was among the first 25 inductees into the TECnology Hall of Fame at its establishment in 2004, an honor given to \\"products and innovations that have had an enduring impact on the development of audio technology.\\" The award notes that Vitaphone, though short-lived, helped in popularizing theater sound and was critical in stimulating the development of the modern sound reinforcement system.[9]\\r\\nThough operating on principles so different as to make it unrecognizable to a Vitaphone engineer, DTS is a sound-on-disc system, the first to gain wide adoption since the abandonment of Vitaphone.\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nFurther reading","input":"What was the first feature-length film to use vitaphone technology?"},{"output":"Khumbu Glacier","context":"The Khumbu Glacier is located in the Khumbu region of northeastern Nepal between Mount Everest and the Lhotse-Nuptse ridge.

Businesses are defined as \\"small\\" in terms of being able to apply for government support and qualify for preferential tax policy varies depending on the country and industry. Small businesses range from fifteen employees under the Australian Fair Work Act 2009, fifty employees according to the definition used by the European Union, and fewer than five thousand employees, to qualify for many U.S. Small Business Administration programs. While small businesses can also be classified according to other methods, such as annual revenues, shipments, sales, assets, or by annual gross or net revenue or net profits, the number of employees is one of the most widely used measures.\\r\\nSmall businesses in many countries include service or retail operations such as convenience stores, small grocery stores, bakeries or delicatessens, hairdressers or tradespeople (e.g., carpenters, electricians), restaurants, guest houses, photographers, very small-scale manufacturing, and Internet-related businesses such as web design and computer programming. Some professionals operate as small businesses, such as lawyers, accountants, dentists and medical doctors (although these professionals can also work for large organizations or companies). Small businesses vary a great deal in terms of size, revenues and regulatory authorization, both within a country and from country to country. Some small businesses, such as a home accounting business, may only require a business license. On the other hand, other small businesses, such as day cares, retirement homes and restaurants serving liquor are more heavily regulated, and may require inspection and certification from various government authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers and analysts of small or owner-managed businesses generally behave as if nominal organizational forms (e.g., partnership, sole-trader, or corporation), and the consequent legal and accounting boundaries of owner-managed firms are consistently meaningful. However, owner-managers often do not delineate their behavior to accord with the implied separation between their personal and business interests. Lenders also often contract around organizational (corporate) boundaries by seeking personal guarantees or accepting privately held assets as collateral.[1] Because of this behavior, researchers and analysts may wish to be cautious in the way they assess the organizational types and implied boundaries in contexts relating to owner-managed firms. These include analyses that use traditional accounting disclosures, and studies that view the firm as defined by some formal organizational structure.\\r\\nThe term \\"entrepreneur\\" is often conflated with the term \\"small business\\" or used interchangeably with this term. While most entrepreneurial ventures start out as a small business, not all small businesses are entrepreneurial in the strict sense of the term. Many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner, or they have a small number of employees, and many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service, and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, entrepreneurial ventures offer an innovative product, process or service, and the entrepreneur typically aims to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales, and so on, a process which is financed by venture capital and angel investments. Successful entrepreneurs have the ability to lead a business in a positive direction by proper planning, to adapt to changing environments and understand their own strengths and weakness.[2] Spectacular success stories stem from small businesses that expanded in growth. Examples would be Microsoft, Genentech, and Federal Express which all embody the sense of new venture creation on small business.[3]\\r\\nThe legal definition of \\"small business\\" varies by country and by industry. In addition to number of employees, methods used to classify small companies include annual sales (turnover), value of assets and net profit (balance sheet), alone or as a combination of factors.\\r\\nSmall businesses are usually not dominant in their field of operation.[10]\\r\\nThe table below serves as a useful guide to business size nomenclature.\\r\\nBusiness size definitions (by number of employees)\\r\\nIn 2016 a surprising demographic of small business owners was published. The study showed that the median American small business owners were above the age of 50. The ages were distributed as: 51% over 50 years old, 33% between the ages 35-49, and 16% being under the age of 35. As for sex: 55% were owned by males, 36% by females, and 9% being equal ownership of both males and females. As for race: 72% were white/Caucasian, 13.5% were Latinos, 6.3% were African American, 6.2% were Asian, and 2% as other. As for educational background: 39% had obtained a bachelor's degree or higher, 33% had some college background, and 28% received at least a high school diploma.[11]\\r\\nThe United States census data for the years 2014 and 2015 shows the women's ownership share of small businesses by firm size. The data explains percentages owned by women along with the number of employees including the owner. The data shows that about 22% of the businesses owned by women have between 100-500 employees, 28% between 20-99 employees, 32% between 5-19 employees, 41% between 2-4 employees and about 51% have 1 employee. This shows that the majority of women that own businesses are self employed and run the business by themselves.[11]\\r\\nFranchising is a way for small business owners to benefit from the economies of scale of the big corporation (franchiser). McDonald's and Subway are examples of a franchise. The small business owner can leverage a strong brand name and purchasing power of the larger company while keeping their own investment affordable. However, some franchisees conclude that they suffer the \\"worst of both worlds\\" feeling they are too restricted by corporate mandates and lack true independence. It is an assumption that small business are just franchisees, but the truth is many franchisers are also small businesses, Although considered to be a successful way of doing business, literature has proved that there is a high failure rate in franchising as well, especially in UK, where research indicates that out of 1658 franchising companies operating in 1984, only 601 remained in 1998, a mere 36%.[12]\\r\\nA retailers' cooperative is a type of cooperative which employs economies of scale on behalf of its retailer members. Retailers' cooperatives use their purchasing power to acquire discounts from manufacturers and often share marketing expenses. They are often recognized as \\"local groups\\" because they own their own stores within the community.[13]It is common for locally owned grocery stores, hardware stores, and pharmacies to participate in retailers' cooperatives. Ace Hardware, True Value, and NAPA are examples of a retailers' cooperative. Retail cooperatives also allow consumers to supply their own earnings and gain bargaining power outside of the business sector.[13] Retail cooperatives mainly reside within small communities where local businesses are often shut down.[13]\\r\\nMany small businesses can be started at a low cost and on a part-time basis, while a person continues a regular job with an employer or provides care for family members in the home. In developing countries, many small businesses are sole-proprietor operations such as selling produce at a market stall or preparing hot food to sell on the street, that provide a small income. In the 2000s, a small business is also well suited to Internet marketing; because, it can easily serve specialized niches, something that would have been more difficult prior to the Internet revolution which began in the late 1990s. Internet marketing gives small businesses the ability to market with smaller budgets. Adapting to change is crucial in business and particularly small business; not being tied to the bureaucratic inertia associated with large corporations, small businesses can respond to changing marketplace demand more quickly. Small business proprietors tend to be in closer personal contact with their customers and clients than large corporations, as small business owners see their customers in person each week.\\r\\nOne study showed that small, local businesses are better for a local economy than the introduction of new chain stores. By opening up new national level chain stores, the profits of locally owned businesses greatly decrease and many businesses end up failing and having to close. This creates an exponential effect. When one store closes, people lose their jobs, other businesses lose business from the failed business, and so on. In many cases, large firms displace just as many jobs as they create.[14]\\r\\nIndependence is another advantage of owning a small business. A small business owner does not have to report to a supervisor or manager. In addition, many people desire to make their own decisions, take their own risks, and reap the rewards of their efforts. Small business owners possess the flexibility and freedom to making their own decisions within the constraints imposed by economic and other environmental factors.[15] However, entrepreneurs have to work for very long hours and understand that ultimately their customers are their bosses.\\r\\nSeveral organizations in the United States also provide help for the small business sector, such as the Internal Revenue Service's Small Business and Self-Employed One-Stop Resource.[16] Small businesses (often carried out by family members) adjust quicker to the changing conditions; however, they are closed to the absorption of new knowledge and employing new labor from outside.[17]\\r\\nSmall businesses often face a variety of problems, some of which are related to their size. A frequent cause of bankruptcy is under capitalization. This is often a result of poor planning rather than economic conditions. It is a common \\"rule of thumb\\" that the entrepreneur should have access to a sum of money at least equal to the projected revenue for the first year of business in addition to his or her anticipated expenses. For example, if the prospective owner thinks that he or she will generate $100,000 in revenues in the first year with $150,000 in start-up expenses, then he or she should have not less than $250,000 available. Start-up expenses are often grossly underestimated adding to the burden of the business. Failure to provide this level of funding for the company could leave the owner liable for all of the company's debt should he or she end up in bankruptcy court, under the theory of under capitalization.\\r\\nIn addition to ensuring that the business has enough capital, the small business owner must also be mindful of contribution margin (sales minus variable costs). To break even, the business must be able to reach a level of sales where the contribution margin equals fixed costs. When they first start out, many small business owners under price their products to a point where even at their maximum capacity, it would be impossible to break even. Cost controls or price increases often resolve this problem.\\r\\nIn the United States, some of the largest concerns of small business owners are insurance costs (such as liability and health), rising energy costs, taxes, and tax compliance.[18] In the United Kingdom and Australia, small business owners tend to be more concerned with excessive governmental red tape.[19]\\r\\nContracting fraud has been an ongoing problem for small businesses in the United States. Small businesses are legally obligated to receive a fair portion (23 percent) of the total value of all the government's prime contracts as mandated by the Small Business Act of 1953. Since 2002, a series of federal investigations have found fraud, abuse, loopholes, and a lack of oversight in federal small business contracting, which has led to the diversion of billions of dollars in small business contracts to large corporations.\\r\\nAnother problem for many small businesses is termed the 'Entrepreneurial Myth' or E-Myth. The mythic assumption is that an expert in a given technical field will also be expert at running that kind of business. Additional business management skills are needed to keep a business running smoothly. Some of this misunderstanding arises from the failure to distinguish between small business managers as entrepreneurs or capitalists. While nearly all owner-managers of small firms are obliged to assume the role of capitalist, only a minority will act as entrepreneur.[20] The line between an owner-manager and an entrepreneur can be defined by whether or not their business is growth oriented. In general, small business owners are primarily focused on surviving rather than growing; therefore, not experiencing the five stages of the corporate life cycle (birth, growth, maturity, revival, and decline) like an entrepreneur would.[21]\\r\\nAnother problem for many small businesses is the capacity of much larger businesses to influence or sometimes determine their chances for success. Business networking and social media has been used as a major tool by small businesses in the UK, but most of them just use a \\"scatter-gun\\" approach in a desperate attempt to exploit the market which is not that successful.[22] Over half of small firms lack a business plan, a tool that is considered one of the most important factors for a venture's success. Business planning is associated with improved growth prospects. Funders and investors usually require a business plan. A plan also serves as a strategic planning document for owners and CEOs, which can be used as a \\"bible\\" for decision-making [23]\\r\\nAn international trade survey indicated that the British share of businesses which are exporting rose from 32% in 2012 to 39% in 2013. Although this may seem positive, in reality the growth is slow, as small business owners shy away from exporting due to actual and perceived barriers. Learning the basics of a foreign language could be the solution to open doors to new trade markets, it is a reality that not all foreign business partners speak English. China is stated to grow by 7.6% in 2013 and still sadly 95% of business owners who want to export to China have no desire and no knowledge to learn their local language.[24]\\r\\nWhen small business fails, the owner may file for bankruptcy. In most cases, this can be handled through a personal bankruptcy filing.[citation needed] Corporations can file bankruptcy, but if it is out of business and valuable corporate assets are likely to be repossessed by secured creditors, there is little advantage to going to the expense of a corporate bankruptcy.[citation needed] Many states offer exemptions for small business assets so they can continue to operate during and after personal bankruptcy.[citation needed] However, corporate assets are normally not exempt; hence, it may be more difficult to continue operating an incorporated business if the owner files bankruptcy.[citation needed] Researchers have examined small business failures in some depth, with attempts to model the predictability of failure.[25][26]\\r\\nSmall businesses can encounter several problems related to engaging in corporate social responsibility, due to characteristics inherent in their size. Owners of small businesses often participate heavily in the day-to-day operations of their companies. This results in a lack of time for the owner to coordinate socially responsible efforts, such as supporting local charities or not-for-profit activities.[27] Additionally, a small business owner's expertise often falls outside the realm of socially responsible practices, which contributing to a lack of participation. Small businesses also face a form of peer pressure from larger forces in their respective industries, making it difficult to oppose and work against industry expectations.[27] Furthermore, small businesses undergo stress from shareholder expectations. Because small businesses have more personal relationships with their patrons and local shareholders, they must also be prepared to withstand closer scrutiny if they want to share in the benefits of committing to socially responsible practices or not. [27]\\r\\nWhile small businesses employ over half the workforce in the US [28] and have been established as a main driving force behind job creation,[29] the quality of the jobs these businesses create has been called into question. Small businesses generally employ individuals from the Secondary labour market. As a result, in the U.S., wages are 49% higher for employees of large firms.[29] Additionally, many small businesses struggle or are unable to provide employees with benefits they would be given at larger firms. Research from the U.S. Small Business Administration indicates that employees of large firms are 17% more likely to receive benefits including salary, paid leave, paid holidays, bonuses, insurance, and retirement plans.[30] Both lower wages and fewer benefits combine to create a job turnover rate among U.S. small businesses that is three times higher than large firms.[29] Employees of small businesses also must adapt to the higher failure rate of small firms, which means that they are more likely to lose their job due to the firm going under. In the U.S. 69% of small businesses last at least two years, but this percentage drops to 51% for firms reaching five years in operation.[28] The U.S. Small Business Administration counts companies with as much as $35.5 million in sales and 1,500 employees as \\"small businesses\\", depending on the industry. Outside government, companies with less than $7 million in sales and fewer than five hundred employees are widely considered small businesses.\\r\\nCyber crime in the business world can be broken down into 4 main categories. They include loss of reputation and consumer confidence, cost of fixing the issue, loss of capital and assets, and legal difficulties that can come from these problems. Loss of reputation and consumer confidence can be impacted greatly after one attack. Many small businesses will struggle to gain confidence and trust in their customers after being known for having problems prior. Cost of fixing the cyber attack would require experts outside of their field to further the investigation and find the problem. Being down for a business means losing money at the same time. This could halt the online operations and mean the business could potentially be down for a long period of time. Loss of capital and assets ties well in with the cost of fixing the issue. During a cyber attack, a business may lose their funds for that business. Worst case scenario, a business may actually lose all their working capital and funds. The legal difficulties involved with cyber crime can become pricy and hurt the business itself for not having standard security measures and standards. Security not only for the business but more importantly the customer should be number one priority when dealing with security protocol.[31]\\r\\nThe monetary dollar damage caused by cyber crime in 2016 equalled out to be over 1.33 billion dollars in the United States alone. In 2016, California alone had over 255 million dollars reported to the IC3. The average company this year in the United States amounted to 17.36 million dollars in cyber crime attacks. Certain cyber attacks can vary on how long it takes to solve a problem. It can take upwards to 69 days for an average everyday attack on a business. The types of attacks include viruses and malware issues. Employee activities within the workspace can also render a cyber attack. Employees using mobile devices or remote work access off the job makes it easier for a cyber attack to occur.[32]\\r\\nAlthough small businesses have close relationships with their existing customers, finding new customers and reaching new markets is a major challenge for small business owners. Small businesses typically find themselves strapped for time to do marketing, as they have to run the day-to-day aspects of the business. To create a continual stream of new business and find new clients and customers, they must work on marketing their business continuously. Low sales (result of poor marketing) is one of the major reasons of small business failure. [33] Common marketing techniques for small business include business networking (e.g., attending Chamber of Commerce events or trade fairs), \\"word of mouth\\" promotion by existing customers, customer referrals, Yellow pages directories, television, radio, and outdoor ads (e.g., roadside billboards), print ads, and Internet marketing. TV ads can be quite expensive, so they are normally intended to create awareness of a product or service. Another means by which small businesses can advertise is through the use of \\"deal of the day\\" websites such as Groupon and Living Social. These Internet deals encourage customers to patronize small businesses.\\r\\nMany small business owners find internet marketing more affordable. Google AdWords and Yahoo! Search Marketing are two popular options of getting small business products or services in front of motivated web searchers. Social media has also become an affordable route of marketing for small business. It is a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing and small businesses are able to do it themselves or find small social marketing agencies that they can hire out for a small fee. Statistically, social media marketing has a higher lead-to-close rate than traditional media.[citation needed] Successful online small business marketers are also adept at utilizing the most relevant keywords in their website content. Advertising on niche websites that are frequented by potential customers can also be effective, but with the long tail of the Internet, it can be time intensive to advertise on enough websites to garner an effective reach.\\r\\nCreating a business website has become increasingly affordable with many do-it-yourself programs now available for beginners. A website can provide significant marketing exposure for small businesses when marketed through the Internet and other channels. Some popular services are WordPress, Joomla Squarespace, Wix and EXAI . Social media has proven to be very useful in gaining additional exposure for many small businesses. Many small business owners use Facebook and Twitter as a way to reach out to their loyal customers to give them news about specials of the day or special coupons, generate repeat business and reach out to new potential clients. The relational nature of social media, along with its immediacy and twenty-four-hour presence lend intimacy to the relationships small businesses can have with their customers, while making it more efficient for them to communicate with greater numbers. Facebook ads are also a very cost-effective way for small businesses owners to reach a targeted audience with a very specific message. In addition to the social networking sites, blogs have become a highly effective way for small businesses to position themselves as experts on issues that are important to their customers. This can be done with a proprietary blog and/or by using a back-link strategy wherein the marketer comments on other blogs and leaves a link to the small business' own website. Posting to a blog about the company's business or service area regularly can increase web traffic to a company website.\\r\\nMarketing plan\\r\\nIn the US, small businesses (fewer than five hundred employees) account for more than half the non-farm, private GDP and around half the private sector employment.[28] Regarding small business, the top job provider is those with fewer than ten employees, and those with ten or more but fewer than twenty employees comes in as the second, and those with twenty or more but fewer than one hundred employees comes in as the third (interpolation of data from the following references).[36] The most recent data shows firms with fewer than twenty employees account for slightly more than 18% of the employment.[37]\\r\\nAccording to \\"The Family Business Review,\\" \\"There are approximately seventeen million sole-proprietorship in the US. It can be argued that a sole-proprietorship (an unincorporated business owned by a single person) is a type of family business\\" and \\"there are twenty-two million small businesses (fewer than five hundred employees) in the US and approximately 14,000 big businesses.\\" Also, it has been found that small businesses created the newest jobs in communities, \\"In 1979, David Birch published the first empirical evidence that small firms (fewer than 100 employees) created the most new jobs\\", and Edmiston claimed that \\"perhaps the greatest generator of interest in entrepreneurship and small business is the widely held belief that small businesses in the United States create most new jobs. The evidence suggests that small businesses indeed create a substantial majority of net new jobs in an average year.\\" Local businesses provide competition to each other and also challenge corporate giants. Of the 5,369,068 employer firms in 1995, 78.8 percent had fewer than ten employees, and 99.7 percent had fewer than five hundred employees.[38]\\r\\nSmall businesses use various sources available for start-up capital:\\r\\nSome small businesses are further financed through credit card debtusually a poor choice, given that the interest rate on credit cards is often several times the rate that would be paid on a line of credit at a bank or a bank loan. Recent research suggests that the use of credit scores in small business lending by community banks is surprisingly widespread. Moreover, the scores employed tend to be the consumer credit scores of the small business owners rather than the more encompassing small business credit scores that include data on the firms as well as on the owners.[39] Many owners seek a bank loan in the name of their business; however, banks will usually insist on a personal guarantee by the business owner.\\r\\nIn the United States, the Small Business Administration (SBA) runs several loan programs that may help a small business secure loans. In these programs, the SBA guarantees a portion of the loan to the issuing bank, and thus, relieves the bank of some of the risk of extending the loan to a small business. The SBA also requires business owners to pledge personal assets and sign as a personal guarantee for the loan. The 8(a) Business Development Program assists in the development of small businesses owned and operated by African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians.[40] Canadian small businesses can take advantage of federally funded programs and services. See Federal financing for small businesses in Canada (grants and loans).\\r\\nOn October 2010, Alejandro Cremades and Tanya Prive founded the first equity crowdfunding platform[41] for small businesses in history as an alternative source of financing. The platform operates under the name of Rock The Post.[42]\\r\\nSmall businesses often join or come together to form organizations to advocate for their causes or to achieve economies of scale that larger businesses benefit from, such as the opportunity to buy cheaper health insurance in bulk. These organizations include local or regional groups such as Chambers of Commerce and independent business alliances, as well as national or international industry-specific organizations. Such groups often serve a dual purpose, as business networks to provide marketing and connect members to potential sales leads and suppliers, and also as advocacy groups, bringing together many small businesses to provide a stronger voice in regional or national politics. In the case of independent business alliances, promoting the value of locally owned, independent business (not necessarily small) through public education campaigns is integral to their work.\\r\\nThe largest regional small business group in the United States is the Council of Smaller Enterprises, located in Greater Cleveland.[43] United Kingdom trade and Investment (www.ukti.gov.in) gives out research in different markets around the world, also research in program planning and promotional activities to exporters. The BEXA (British Exporters Association) role is to connect new exporters to expert services, it can provide details about regional export contacts, who could be made informally to discuss issues. Trade associations and all major banks could often provide links to international groups in foreign markets, some could also help set up joint venture, trade fairs etc.[44]\\r\\nA number of youth organizations, including 4-H, Junior Achievement, and Scouting have special interactive programs and training to help young people run their own small business under adult supervision.[45]","input":"What is a small business in the us?"},{"output":"lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nCreedence Clearwater Revival (often referred to as Creedence or CCR) was an American rock band active in the late 1960s and early 1970s which consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty, his brother rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford. These members had played together since 1959, first as The Blue Velvets, then as The Golliwogs.[1] Their musical style encompassed the roots rock,[2] swamp rock,[3] and blues rock.[4] They played in a Southern rock style, despite their San Francisco Bay Area origin, with lyrics about bayous, catfish, the Mississippi River, and other popular elements of Southern United States iconography, as well as political and socially conscious lyrics about topics including the Vietnam War.[5] The band performed at the 1969 Woodstock Festival in Upstate New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 after four years of chart-topping success. Tom Fogerty had officially left the previous year, and his brother John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control, all of which resulted in subsequent lawsuits among the former bandmates. Fogerty's ongoing disagreements with Fantasy Records owner Saul Zaentz created further protracted court battles, and John Fogerty refused to perform with the two other surviving members at CCR's 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nCreedence Clearwater Revival's music is still a staple of US radio airplay;[8] the band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone.[9] Rolling Stone ranked them 82nd on its Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Fogerty, Doug Clifford, and Stu Cook met at Portola Junior High School in El Cerrito, California. Calling themselves the Blue Velvets, the trio began playing instrumentals and \\"juke box standards\\",[11] as well as backing Fogerty's older brother Tom at live gigs and in the recording studio. Tom soon joined the band, and in 1964 they signed with Fantasy Records, an independent jazz label in San Francisco that had released Cast Your Fate To The Wind, a national hit for jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi. The record's success was the subject of a National Educational Television special, which prompted budding songwriter John Fogerty to contact the label.[12] For the band's first release, Fantasy co-owner Max Weiss renamed the group the Golliwogs (after the children's literary character, Golliwogg).\\r\\n\\r\\nBandmembers' roles and the instruments they played changed during this period. Stu Cook switched from piano to bass guitar and Tom Fogerty from lead vocals to rhythm guitar; John became the band's lead vocalist and primary songwriter. In Tom Fogerty's words: \\"I could sing, but John had a sound!\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966, the group suffered a setback when John Fogerty and Doug Clifford received draft notices and chose to enlist in the military instead to avoid conscription. Fogerty joined the Army Reserve while Clifford joined the Coast Guard Reserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1967, Saul Zaentz bought Fantasy Records and offered the band a chance to record a full-length album on the condition that they change their name. He had never liked \\"the Golliwogs\\", in part because of the racial charge of the name, and the four readily agreed. Zaentz and the band agreed to come up with 10 suggestions each, but he enthusiastically agreed to their very first: Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), which they took in January 1968.[14] According to interviews with band members 20 years later, the name's elements come from three sources:\\r\\n\\r\\nRejected contenders for the band's name included Muddy Rabbit, Gossamer Wump, and Creedence Nuball and the Ruby, but the last was the start that led to their finalized name. Cook described the name as \\"weirder than Buffalo Springfield or Jefferson Airplane\\". [15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1968, Fogerty and Clifford had been discharged from military service, and all four members had quit their jobs to begin an intense schedule of rehearsing and playing full-time at clubs.[citation needed] AM radio programmers around the US took note when their cover of the 1956 rockabilly song[14] \\"Susie Q\\" received substantial airplay in the San Francisco Bay Area and on Chicago's WLS.[citation needed] It was the band's second single, its first to reach the Top 40 (No. 11), and its only Top 40 hit not written by John Fogerty. Two other singles were released from the debut: a cover of Screamin' Jay Hawkins's \\"I Put A Spell On You\\" (No. 58) and \\"Porterville\\" (released on the Scorpio label with writing credited to \\"T. Spicebush Swallowtail\\"), written during Fogerty's time in the Army Reserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter their breakthrough, CCR began touring and started work on their second album, Bayou Country (1969), at RCA Studios in Los Angeles. A No.?7 platinum hit, the record was their first in a string of hit albums and singles that continued uninterrupted for three years. The single \\"Proud Mary\\", backed with \\"Born On The Bayou\\", reached No.?2 on the national Billboard chart. The former would eventually become the group's most-covered song, with some 100 versions by other artists to date, including a 1971 hit by Ike & Tina Turner. John Fogerty cites this song as being the result of high spirits on gaining his discharge from the Army Reserve.[14] The album also featured a remake of the rock & roll classic \\"Good Golly, Miss Molly\\"[14] and the band's nine-minute live-show closer, \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nWeeks later, during March 1969, \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" backed with \\"Lodi\\" was released and peaked at No.?2. In the United Kingdom, \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" spent three weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart during September and October 1969, becoming the band's only number one single in the UK.[citation needed] The band's third album, Green River, followed in August 1969 and went gold along with the single \\"Green River\\", which again reached No.?2 on the Billboard charts. The B-side of \\"Green River\\", \\"Commotion\\", peaked at No.?30 and the band's emphasis on remakes of their old favorites continued with \\"Night Time Is The Right Time\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nCCR continued to tour incessantly with performances in July 1969 at the Atlanta Pop Festival and in August 1969 at the Woodstock Festival. Their set was not included in the Woodstock film or soundtrack because John Fogerty felt the band's performance was subpar. Four tracks from the event (out of a total of eleven) were eventually included in the 1994 commemorative box set Woodstock: Three Days of Peace and Music. Stu Cook, however, held an opposing view, saying \\"The performances are classic CCR and I'm still amazed by the number of people who don't even know we were one of the headliners at Woodstock '69.\\"[16] John Fogerty later complained the previous band, the Grateful Dead, put the audience to sleep; as John scanned the audience he saw a \\"Dante scene, just bodies from hell, all intertwined and asleep, covered with mud.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Woodstock, CCR was busy honing material for a fourth album, Willy and the Poor Boys, released in November 1969. \\"Down on the Corner\\" and \\"Fortunate Son\\" climbed to No.?3 and No.?14, respectively, by year's end. The album was CCR in its standard form, featuring Fogerty originals and two reworked Lead Belly covers, \\"Cotton Fields\\" and \\"Midnight Special\\". Both of the latter songs had also been performed by actor Harry Dean Stanton in the movie Cool Hand Luke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 1969 had been a remarkable chart year for the band: three Top Ten albums, four hit singles (charting at No.?2, No.?2, No.?2, and No.?3) with three additional charting B-sides. On November 16, 1969, they performed \\"Fortunate Son\\" and \\"Down On The Corner\\" on The Ed Sullivan Show.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nCCR released another two-sided hit, \\"Travelin' Band\\"/\\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\" in January 1970. Except for Elvis Presley and The Beatles, Creedence had more success with two sided hit singles than any band up to that point in time.  John Fogerty has said that the flip side was inspired by the band's experience at Woodstock.[citation needed] The speedy \\"Travelin' Band\\", with a strong Little Richard sound, however, bore enough similarities to \\"Good Golly, Miss Molly\\" to warrant a lawsuit by the song's publisher; it was eventually settled out of court.[18] The song ultimately topped out at No.?2. The band also recorded its January 31, 1970, live performance at the Oakland Coliseum Arena, which would later be marketed as a live album and television special. In February, CCR was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone, although only John Fogerty was interviewed in the accompanying article.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1970, CCR was set to begin its first European tour. To support the upcoming live dates, Fogerty wrote \\"Up Around the Bend\\" and \\"Run Through the Jungle\\"; the single reached No.?4 that spring. The band returned to Wally Heider's San Francisco studio in June to record Cosmo's Factory. The title was an in-joke about their various rehearsal facilities and factory work ethic over the years.[citation needed] (Drummer Doug Clifford's longtime nickname is \\"Cosmo\\", due to his keen interest in nature and all things cosmic.)[citation needed] The album contained the earlier Top 10 hits \\"Travelin' Band\\" and \\"Up Around The Bend\\" plus popular album tracks such as the opener \\"Ramble Tamble\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nCosmo's Factory was released in July 1970, along with the band's fifth and final No.?2 national hit, \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\"/\\"Long as I Can See the Light\\".  Although they topped some international charts and local radio countdowns, CCR has the odd distinction of having five No.?2 singles, without ever having had a No.?1, on the Hot 100, the most of any group.[20]  Their five No.?2 singles were exceeded only by Elvis Presley and Madonna with six each and tied with The Carpenters.  Curiously, on WLS, the band had three No.?1, four No.?3, two No.?4, but no No.?2, singles, with \\"Down On The Corner\\" the only top ten CCR single registering the same peak position (No.?3) on the Hot 100 and WLS.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther cuts on the \\"Cosmo's Factory\\" album included an eleven-minute jam of the 1968 Marvin Gaye \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" (a minor hit when an edited version was released as a single in 1976), and a nearly note-for-note homage to Roy Orbison's \\"Ooby Dooby\\". The album was CCR's best seller and went to No.?1 on the Billboard 200 album charts and No.?11 on Billboard's Soul Albums chart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cosmo's Factory sessions had seen the stirrings of tensions within the foursome as the incessant touring and heavy recording schedules took their toll.[citation needed] John Fogerty had taken complete control of the group in matters of both business and artistic output, to the chagrin of Tom Fogerty, Cook, and Clifford. Fogerty resisted, feeling that a \\"democratic\\" process would threaten their success.[citation needed] Other issues included Fogerty's decision at a 1970 Nebraska gig that the band would no longer give encores at its live shows.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nPendulum, released in December 1970, was another top seller, spawning a Top 10 hit with \\"Have You Ever Seen The Rain?\\". John Fogerty included Hammond B3 Organ on many of the Pendulum tracks, notably \\"Have You Ever Seen The Rain?\\", in recognition of the deep respect and influence of Booker T. & the M.G.'s, with whom the members of the band had jammed. The single's flip side, \\"Hey Tonight\\", was also a hit.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Fogerty decided he had had enough of his younger brother and resigned from CCR in late 1970 after the recording of Pendulum; his departure was made public the following February. At first, the remaining members considered replacing him but ultimately continued as a trio. He later stated on an Australian television broadcast that no new member could endure being in CCR.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spring 1971, John Fogerty did an about-face and informed Cook and Clifford that CCR would continue only by adopting a \\"democratic\\" approach: each member would now write and perform his own material. Fogerty also would contribute only rhythm guitar to his bandmates' songs. Cook and Clifford, who had wanted more input in CCR's artistic and business decisions, resisted this arrangement. Fogerty insisted they accept it or he would quit the band. Despite the dissension, the trio put its new work ethic to the test in the studio, releasing the Top 10 single \\"Sweet Hitch-Hiker\\" in July 1971, backed with Stu Cook's \\"Door To Door\\". The band toured both the U.S. and Europe that summer and autumn, with Cook's song a part of the live set. In spite of their continuing commercial success, however, relations among the three had become increasingly strained.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band's final album, Mardi Gras, was released in April 1972, featuring songs written by Fogerty, Cook, and Clifford and a cover of \\"Hello Mary Lou\\" (a song Gene Pitney had originally written for Ricky Nelson). The album was a critical failure, with Rolling Stone reviewer Jon Landau deeming it \\"the worst album I have ever heard from a major rock band.\\"[22] The sales of Mardi Gras were weaker than previous albums, ultimately peaking at No.?12, though still became the band's 7th consecutive studio album to be certified Gold. Fogerty's \\"Someday Never Comes\\", backed with Clifford's \\"Tearin' Up The Country\\", also cracked the U.S. Top 40.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this point, Fogerty was not only at direct odds with his bandmates, but he had also come to see the group's relationship with Fantasy Records as onerous, feeling that label owner Saul Zaentz had reneged on his promise to give the band a better contract. Cookwho held a degree in businessclaimed that because of poor judgment on Fogerty's part, CCR had to abide by the worst record deal of any major US recording artist. Despite the relatively poor reception of Mardi Gras and deteriorated relationships among the remaining band members, CCR embarked upon a two-month, 20-date U.S. tour. However, on October 16, 1972less than six months after the tour endedFantasy Records and the band officially announced its disbanding.[23] CCR never formally reunited after the break-up, although Cook and Clifford eventually started the band Creedence Clearwater Revisited.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Fogerty later commented on the demise of CCR in a 1997 Swedish magazine:\\r\\n\\r\\nI was alone when I made that [Creedence] music. I was alone when I made the arrangements, I was alone when I added background vocals, guitars and some other stuff. I was alone when I produced and mixed the albums. The other guys showed up only for rehearsals and the days we made the actual recordings. For me Creedence was like sitting on a time bomb. We'd had decent successes with our cover of 'Susie Q' and with the first album. When we went into the studio to cut 'Proud Mary,' it was the first time we were in a real Hollywood studio, RCA's Los Angeles studio, and the problems started immediately. The other guys in the band insisted on writing songs for the new album, they had opinions on the arrangements, they wanted to sing. They went as far as adding background vocals to 'Proud Mary,' and it sounded awful. They used tambourines, and it sounded no better.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat's when I understood I had a choice to make. At that point in time we were just a one hit wonder, and 'Susie Q' hadn't really been that big a hit. Either this [the new album] would be a success, something really big, or we might as well start working at the car wash again. There was a big row. We went to an Italian restaurant and I remember that I very clearly told the others that I for one didn't want to go back to the car wash again. Now we had to make the best possible album and it wasn't important who did what, as long as the result was the very best we could achieve. And of course I was the one who should do it. I don't think the others really understood what I meant, but at least I could manage the situation the way I wanted. The result was eight million-selling double-sided singles in a row and six albums, all of which went platinum. And Melody Maker had us as the best band in the world. That was after the Beatles split, but still. ... And I was the one who had created all this. Despite that, I don't think they understood what I was talking about. ... They were obsessed with the idea of more control and more influence. So finally the bomb exploded and we never worked together again.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1973, Fogerty began his solo career with The Blue Ridge Rangers, his one-man band collection of country and gospel songs. Under his old CCR contract, however, Fogerty owed Fantasy eight more records. In the end, he  refused to work for the label. The impasse was resolved only when Asylum Records' David Geffen bought Fogerty's contract for $1,000,000. In 1975 he then released his only Asylum album, the self-titled John Fogerty. His next major hit was Centerfield, a chart-topping success in 1985. On tour in 1986, however, Fogerty suffered complaints over his steadfast refusal to perform CCR songs and suffered with recurring vocal problems which he blamed on having to testify in court. Fogerty's explanation for not playing CCR material songs was that he would have had to pay performance royalties to copyright holder Saul Zaentz, and that it was \\"too painful\\" to revisit the music of his past.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Centerfield album, Fogerty also found himself entangled in new, tit-for-tat lawsuits with Zaentz over the song \\"The Old Man Down The Road\\" which was, according to Zaentz, a blatant re-write of Fogerty's own 1970 CCR hit \\"Run Through the Jungle\\". Since Fogerty had traded his rights to CCR's songs in 1980 to cancel his remaining contractual obligations, Fantasy now owned the rights to \\"Run Through the Jungle\\" and sued Fogerty essentially for plagiarizing himself. While a jury ruled in Fogerty's favor, he did settle a defamation suit filed by Zaentz over the songs \\"Mr. Greed\\" and \\"Zanz Kant Danz\\". Fogerty was forced to edit the recording, changing the \\"Zanz\\" reference to \\"Vanz.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 19, 1987, at the  Palomino Club (North Hollywood) in Los Angeles, Fogerty broke his self-imposed 1972 ban on performing CCR hits. Bob Dylan and George Harrison had joined him onstage, admonishing \\"if you don't, the whole world's gonna think 'Proud Mary' is Tina Turner's song.\\" At a 1987 Independence Day benefit concert for the Vietnam War veterans, Fogerty finally ran through the list of CCR hits, beginning with \\"Born on the Bayou\\" and ending with \\"Proud Mary\\". In 1986 he also released his second Warner Bros. album Eye of the Zombie. He retreated from music again in the late 1980s but returned in 1997 with the Grammy-winning Blue Moon Swamp. Fogerty still tours frequently and performs CCR classics alongside solo material.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Fogerty released several solo albums, though none reached the success of CCR. Fogerty's 1974 solo album Zephyr National was the last to feature the four original CCR band members. Several tracks sound very much like the CCR style, particularly the aptly titled \\"Joyful Resurrection\\" on which all four members played, even though John Fogerty recorded his part separately.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Fogerty died at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona in September 1990 of an AIDS complication, which he contracted via a tainted blood transfusion he received while undergoing back surgery. Tom and John barely reconciled before Tom's death, and in the eulogy that he delivered at Tom's funeral, John said, \\"We wanted to grow up and be musicians. I guess we achieved half of that, becoming rock 'n roll stars. We didn't necessarily grow up.\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nJunior high school friends Doug Clifford and Stu Cook continued to work together following the demise of CCR both as session players and members of the Don Harrison Band. They also founded Factory Productions, a mobile recording service in the Bay Area. Clifford released a solo record, Cosmo, in 1972. Cook produced artist Roky Erickson's The Evil One and was a bassist with the popular country act Southern Pacific in the 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoug Clifford also produced Groovers Paradise for former Sir Douglas Quintet and Texas Tornados frontman Doug Sahm. Both Clifford and Stu Cook played on the album which was released on Warner Bros. in 1974. Clifford continued to perform and record with Doug Sahm through the 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing a relatively long period of musical inactivity, Cook and Clifford formed Creedence Clearwater Revisited in 1995 with several well-known musicians. Revisited continues to tour globally performing the original band's classics. John Fogerty's 1997 injunction forced Creedence Clearwater Revisited to temporarily change its name to \\"Cosmo's Factory,\\" but the courts later ruled in Cook's and Clifford's favor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter CCR, Fantasy Records released several greatest-hits packages such as 1972's Creedence Gold, 1973's More Creedence Gold and 1975's Pre-Creedence, a compilation album of The Golliwogs' early recordings. Fantasy also released the highly successful double album Chronicle, Vol. 1, a collection of Creedence's twenty hit singles, in 1976. Several years later, the label released a live recording entitled The Royal Albert Hall Concert. Contrary to its title, the 1970 performance was recorded in Oakland, California, not at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England. Subsequent issues of the original 1981 album have been retitled simply The Concert. Another double album of their best material was issued in 1986 as Chronicle, Vol. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe success of CCR made Fantasy and Saul Zaentz a great deal of money. Indeed, Fantasy built a new headquarters building in 1971 at 2600 Tenth Street in Berkeley, California.[26] Zaentz also used his wealth to produce a number of successful films including Best Picture Oscar winners One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus, and The English Patient. In 2004, he sold Fantasy to Concord Records. As a goodwill gesture, Concord honored the unfulfilled contractual promises Fantasy made nearly forty years earlier, finally paying the band a higher royalty rate on their sales and restoring John Fogerty's ownership of his songs back to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne decision made by John Fogerty rankled his bandmates and would leave all without most of their hard-earned money and facing legal and financial problems for years. Without the other three band members' knowledge, Fogerty agreed to a tax shelter scheme proposed by Saul Zaentz and his lawyers in which most of the bandmembers' assets were transferred to Castle Bank & Trust of Nassau, Bahamas. Zaentz and his associates withdrew their assets before the bank eventually dissolved? along with the savings of the four CCR band members. A series of lawsuits began in 1978 and eventually ended with a California court awarding $8.6 million to the band members in April 1983. Despite this legal victory, very little money was recovered.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Fogerty, seeing that Zaentz was no longer involved with the company, also signed a new contract with Concord/Fantasy. In 2005, the label released The Long Road Home, a collection of Creedence and Fogerty solo classics. After Revival came out on the Fantasy label in October 2007 but before his following album Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again was issued in 2009, Fogerty switched from Fantasy to Verve Forecast Records.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original CCR lineup rarely reunited after their breakup. All four members jammed together at Tom Fogerty's wedding on October 19, 1980. John Fogerty, Cook, and Clifford played at their 20th El Cerrito High School reunion in 1983, but as their original incarnation, The Blue Velvets. In the 1980s and 1990s, new rounds of lawsuits between the band members, as well as against their former management, deepened their animosities. By the time CCR was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, John Fogerty refused to perform with Cook and Clifford. The pair were barred from the stage, while Fogerty played with an all-star band that included Bruce Springsteen and Robbie Robertson. Tom Fogerty's widow Tricia had expected a Creedence reunion and even brought the urn containing her husband's ashes to the ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a July 2011 interview with the Calgary Herald, John Fogerty admitted that he would at least be willing to consider reuniting with Cook and Clifford:\\r\\n\\r\\nYears ago, I looked at people and I was so full of some sort of emotion and I'd say, 'Absolutely not!' ... But I have to admit, people have asked me more recently, and even though I have no idea how such a series of events would come to pass, I can tell that there isn't the bombast in my voice, in the denial, in the refusal. It's more like, 'Well, I dunno.' Never say never is I guess is what people tell you. In this life, all kinds of strange things come to pass. Realizing that it doesn't really kick up a big firestorm of emotion, it kind of suggests that at least if someone started talking I'd sit still long enough to listen.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen asked again in October 2011 about the prospect of a reunion, Fogerty said: \\"I'm saying it's possible, yeah. I think the call [laughs] would maybe have to come from outside the realm. Somebody would have to get me to look at things in a fresh way.\\"[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Cook and Clifford both stated in the February 2012 edition of Uncut Magazine that they are not interested in a CCR reunion. \\"Leopards don't change their spots. This is just an image-polishing exercise by John. My phone certainly hasn't rung,\\" Cook said. Added Clifford: \\"It might have been a nice idea 20 years ago, but it's too late.\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2013, Fogerty once again said he would be open to a reunion, but he does not see Cook and Clifford being willing to change their stance. He told Charlie Rose on CBS This Morning: \\"From time to time, I'll say something and it'll get in print that maybe that will happen, and then immediately I'll hear back stuff that doesn't sound like it's possible. ... I think it's a possibility in the future, you know. It's not something I'm actively seeking, but I'm not totally against the idea either.\\" [30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2017 Clifford ruled out any chance of Cook and himself reuniting with Fogerty, stating \\"It would have been great 20, 25 years ago. Its way too late now.\\"[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nCCR's catalogue of songs has frequently been used or referenced in popular culture, partly because John Fogerty \\"long ago signed away legal control of his old recordings to Creedence's record label, Fantasy Records.\\"[32][33] In an NPR interview, Fogerty objected to what he regarded as a misuse of his music:\\r\\n\\r\\nFolks will remember Forrest Gump and that was a great movie, but they don't remember all the really poor movies that Fantasy Records stuck Creedence music into: car commercials, tire commercials. I'm remembering a paint thinner ad at one point, the song \\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\". Oh, boy. That's clever, isn't it?[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf particular interest was the use of his protest song \\"Fortunate Son\\" in a blue jean commercial.[32] In this case, the advertiser eventually stopped using the song, as Fogerty related in a later interview:\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, the people that owned Fantasy Records also owned all my early songs, and they would do all kinds of stuff I really hated in a commercial way with my songs. ... Then one day somebody from the L.A. Times actually bothered to call me up and ask me how I felt, and I finally had a chance to talk about it. And I said I'm very much against my song being used to sell pants. ... So my position got stated very well in the newspaper, and lo and behold, Wrangler to their credit said, 'Wow, even though we made our agreement with the publisher, the owner of the song, we can see now that John Fogerty really hates the idea,' so they stopped doing it.[35]","input":"Who were the members of creedence clearwater revival?"},{"output":"Capulet","context":"Rosaline (/?r?z?l?n, -i?n/) is an unseen character and niece of Lord Capulet in William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet (1597). Although silent, her role is important. Romeo is at first deeply in love with Rosaline and expresses his dismay at her not loving him back. Romeo first spots Juliet while trying to catch a glimpse of Rosaline at a gathering hosted by the Capulet family.\\r\\nScholars generally compare Romeo's short-lived love of Rosaline with his later love of Juliet. The poetry Shakespeare writes for Rosaline is much weaker than that for Juliet. Scholars believe Romeo's early experience with Rosaline prepares him for his relationship with Juliet. Later performances of Romeo and Juliet have painted different pictures of Romeo and Rosaline's relationship, as filmmakers have experimented with making Rosaline a more visible character.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Romeo meets Juliet, he loves Rosaline, Capulet's niece and Juliet's cousin. He describes her as wonderfully beautiful: \\"The all-seeing sun / ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.\\"[1] Rosaline, however, chooses to remain chaste; Romeo says: \\"She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow / Do I live dead that live to tell it now.\\"[2] This is the source of his depression, and he makes his friends unhappy; Mercutio comments: \\"That same pale, hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so that he will sure run mad.\\"[3] Benvolio urges Romeo to sneak into a Capulet gathering where, he claims, Rosaline will look like \\"a crow\\" alongside the other beautiful women.[4] Romeo agrees, but doubts Benvolio's assessment. After Romeo sees Juliet his feelings suddenly change: \\"Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight / For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.\\"[5] Because their relationship is sudden and secret, Romeo's friends and Friar Laurence continue to speak of his affection for Rosaline throughout much of the play.\\r\\nJonathan Goldberg[6]\\r\\nRosaline is a variant of Rosalind,[7] a name of Old French origin: (hros = \\"horse\\", lind = \\"soft, tender\\"). When it was imported into English it was thought to be from the Latin rosa linda (\\"lovely rose\\").[8] Romeo sees Rosaline as the embodiment of the rose because of her name and her apparent perfections.[9][10] The name Rosaline commonly appears in Petrarchan sonnets, a form of poetry Romeo uses to woo Juliet and to describe both Rosaline and Juliet. Since Rosaline is unattainable, she is a perfect subject for this style; but Romeo's attempt at it is forced and weak. By the time he meets Juliet his poetic ability has improved considerably.[9]\\r\\nGender studies critics have argued that Rosaline's name suggests that Romeo never really forgets her but rather replaces her with Juliet. Thus, when Juliet cries \\"What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet,\\" she is ironically expressing Romeo's own view of her as a substitute for Rosaline. That is to say, Rosaline, replaced in name only by Juliet, is just as sweet to Romeo.[6] Gender critics also note that the arguments used to dissuade Romeo from pursuing Rosaline are similar to the themes of Shakespeare's procreation sonnets. In these sonnets Shakespeare urges the man (who can be equated with Romeo) to find a woman with whom to procreatea duty he owes to society. Rosaline, it seems, is distant and unavailable except in the mind, similarly bringing no hope of offspring. As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. Rosaline reveals similarities to the subject of the sonnets when she refuses to break her vow of chastity. Her name may be referred to in the first sonnet when the young man is described as \\"beauties Rose.\\" This line ties the young man to both Rosaline and Romeo in Juliet's \\"What's in a name?\\" soliloquy. When Juliet says \\"...that which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet\\",[11] she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman.[6]\\r\\nRosaline is used as a name for only one other Shakespearean characterthe one of the main female figures in Love's Labours Lost (1598), although Rosalind is the name of the main female character in As You Like It. Scholars have found similarities between them: both are described as beautiful, and both have a way of avoiding men's romantic advances. Rosaline in Love's Labours Lost constantly rebuffs her suitor's advances and Romeo's Rosaline remains distant and chaste in his brief descriptions of her. These similarities have led some to wonder whether they are based on a woman Shakespeare actually knew, possibly the Dark Lady described in his sonnets, but there is no strong evidence of this connection.[12]\\r\\nAnalysts note that Rosaline acts as a plot device, by motivating Romeo to sneak into the Capulet party where he will meet Juliet. Without her, their meeting would be unlikely.[13] Rosaline thus acts as the impetus to bring the \\"star-cross'd lovers\\" to their deathsshe is crucial in shaping their fate (a common theme of the play). Ironically, she remains oblivious of her role.[14]\\r\\nRuth Nevo, on the Rosaline-Juliet, Paris-Romeo comparison[15]\\r\\nLiterary critics often compare Romeo's love for Rosaline with his feelings for Juliet. Some see Romeo's supposed love for Rosaline as childish as compared with his true love for Juliet. Others argue that the apparent difference in Romeo's feelings shows Shakespeare's improving skill. Since Shakespeare is thought to have written early drafts of the play in 1591, and then picked them up again in 1597 to create the final copy, the change in Romeo's language for Rosaline and Juliet may mirror Shakespeare's increased skill as a playwright: the younger Shakespeare describing Rosaline, and the more experienced describing Juliet. In this view, a careful look at the play reveals that Romeo's love for Rosaline is not as petty as usually imagined.[13]\\r\\nCritics also note the ways in which Romeo's relationship with Rosaline prepares him for meeting Juliet. Before meeting Rosaline, Romeo despises all Capulets, but afterwards looks upon them more favourably. He experiences the dual feelings of hate and love in the one relationship. This prepares him for the more mature relationship with Julietone fraught by the feud between Montagues and Capulets. Romeo expresses the conflict of love and hate in Act 1, Scene 1, comparing his love for Rosaline with the feud between the two houses:[16]\\r\\nHere's much to do with hate, but more with love.\\r\\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\\r\\nO any thing, of nothing first create!\\r\\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\\r\\nMis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\\r\\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\\r\\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\\r\\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\\r\\nDost thou not laugh?\\r\\nPsychoanalytic critics see signs of repressed childhood trauma in Romeo's love for Rosaline. She is of a rival house and is sworn to chastity. Thus he is in an impossible situation, one which will continue his trauma if he remains in it. Although he acknowledges its ridiculous nature, he refuses to stop loving her. Psychoanalysts view this as a re-enactment of his failed relationship with his mother. Rosaline's absence is symbolic of his mother's absence and lack of affection for him. Romeo's love for Juliet is similarly hopeless, for she is a Capulet and Romeo pursues his relationship with her; the difference being that Juliet reciprocates.[17] This does not seem likely seeing as his mother died of grief after his banishment, indicating that she probably loved him deeply.\\r\\nRosaline has been portrayed in various ways over the centuries. Theophilus Cibber's 1748 version of Romeo and Juliet replaced references to Rosaline with references to Juliet. This, according to critics, took out the \\"love at first sight\\" moment at the Capulet feast.[18] In the 1750s, actor and theatre director David Garrick also eliminated references to Rosaline from his performances, as many saw Romeo's quick replacement of her as immoral.[19][20] However, in Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film version of Romeo and Juliet, Romeo sees Rosaline (played by Paola Tedesco)[21] first at the Capulet feast and then Juliet, of whom he becomes immediately enamoured. This scene suggests that love is short and superficial. Rosaline also appears in Renato Castellani's 1954 film version. In a brief non-Shakespearean scene, Rosaline (Dagmar Josipovitch) gives Romeo a mask at Capulet's celebration, and urges him to leave disguised before harm comes to him. Other filmmakers keep Rosaline off-camera in stricter accordance with Shakespeare's script.[22] Rosaline also appears in the 2013 film adaptation of Romeo & Juliet.\\r\\nRobert Nathan's 1966 romantic comedy, Juliet in Mantua, presents Rosaline as a fully developed character. In this sequel, in which Romeo and Juliet did not die, the pair live ten years later in exile in Mantua. After they are forgiven and return to Verona, they learn that Rosaline is now married to County Paris, and both couples must confront their disillusionment with their marriages. Another play, After Juliet, written by Scottish playwright Sharman Macdonald, tells the story of Rosaline after Romeo dies. A main character in this play, she struggles with her loss and turns away the advances of Benvolio, who has fallen in love with her. Macdonald's daughter, Keira Knightley, played Rosaline in the play's 1999 premiere.[23][24] The 2012 young adult novel \\"When You Were Mine\\" by Rebecca Serle sets Rosaline's story in a contemporary high school. Rosaline and Romeo (renamed Rob) have been best friends since childhood and are just beginning to fall in love when Rosaline's cousin, Juliet, moves back into town and sets her sights on Rob.[25] Important character in sequel named \\"Plague on both your houses!\\" (1994) by Grigori Gorin.\\r\\nStill Star-Crossed (2017) ÿ period drama television series created by Heather Mitchell and based on the book with same name by Melinda Taub. It follows Rosaline (played by Lashana Lynch). She and Benvolio of Montague are betrothed against their will by Prince Escalus, to end the feud between the two families. Both resolve to find a way to end the violence without having the union.","input":"What family is rosaline from in romeo and juliet?"},{"output":"Carnatic music","context":"Carnatic music, Karn?aka sa?gؐta or Karn?aka sa?gؐtam is a system of music commonly associated with southern India, including the modern Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, as well as Sri Lanka.[1][2] It is one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Hindu traditions, the other subgenre being Hindustani music, which emerged as a distinct form because of Persian or Islamic influences from Northern India. The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in gyaki (singing) style.\\r\\nAlthough there are stylistic differences, the basic elements of ?ruti (the relative musical pitch), swara (the musical sound of a single note), rga (the mode or melodic formul?), and tala (the rhythmic cycles) form the foundation of improvisation and composition in both Carnatic and Hindustani music. Although improvisation plays an important role, Carnatic music is mainly sung through compositions, especially the kriti (or kirtanam) ÿ a form developed between the 14th and 20th centuries by composers such as Purandara Dasa and the Trinity of Carnatic music. Carnatic music is also usually taught and learned through compositions.\\r\\nCarnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians, consisting of a principal performer (usually a vocalist), a melodic accompaniment (usually a violin), a rhythm accompaniment (usually a mridangam), and a tambura, which acts as a drone throughout the performance. Other typical instruments used in performances may include the ghatam, kanjira, morsing, venu flute, veena, and chitraveena. The most outstanding performances, and the greatest concentration of Carnatic musicians, are to be found in the city of Chennai.[3] Various festivals are held throughout India and abroad which mainly consist of Carnatic music performances, such as the Madras Music Season, which has been considered to be one of the world's largest cultural events.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all art forms in Indian culture, Indian classical music is believed to be a divine art form which originated from the Devas and Devis (Hindu Gods and Goddesses),[6][7] and is venerated as symbolic of nda brhman.[8] Ancient treatises also describe the connection of the origin of the swaras, or notes, to the sounds of animals and birds and man's effort to simulate these sounds through a keen sense of observation and perception. The Sama Veda, which is believed to have laid the foundation for Indian classical music, consists of hymns from the Rigveda, set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during Vedic yajnas.[7] The Yajur-Veda, which mainly consists of sacrificial formulae, mentions the veena as an accompaniment to vocal recitations.[9] References to Indian classical music are made in many ancient texts, including epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The Yajnavalkya Smriti mentions vؐ?vdana tattvaj?a? ?rutijtivi?rada? tlaj?a?cpraysena mok?amrga? niyacchati (\\"The one who is well versed in veena, one who has the knowledge of srutis and one who is adept in tala, attains salvation without doubt\\").[10] Carnatic music is based as it is today on musical concepts (including swara, raga, and tala) that were described in detail in several ancient works, particularly the Bharata's Natya Shastra and Silappadhikaram by Ilango Adigal.[11]\\r\\nOwing to Persian and Islamic influences in North India from the 12th century onwards, Indian classical music began to diverge into two distinct stylesHindustani music and Carnatic music.[3] Commentaries and other works, such as Sharngadeva's Sangita Ratnakara, further elaborated on the musical concepts found in Indian classical music.[12] By the 16th and 17th centuries, there was a clear demarcation between Carnatic and Hindustani music;[13] Carnatic music remained relatively unaffected by Persian and Arabic influences. It was at this time that Carnatic music flourished in Vijayanagara, while the Vijayanagar Empire reached its greatest extent.[14] Purandara Dasa, who is known as the father (Pitamaha) of Carnatic Music, formulated the system that is commonly used for the teaching of Carnatic music.[7][15] Venkatamakhin invented and authored the formula for the melakarta system of raga classification in his Sanskrit work, the Chaturdandi Prakasika (1660 AD).[13] Govindacharya is known for expanding the melakarta system into the sampoorna raga scheme ÿ the system that is in common use today.\\r\\nCarnatic music was mainly patronized by the local kings of the Kingdom of Mysore and Kingdom of Travancore in the 18th through 20th centuries. Some of the royalty of the kingdoms of Mysore and Travancore were themselves noted composers and proficient in playing musical instruments, such as the veena, rudra veena, violin, ghatam, flute, mridangam, nagaswara and swarabhat.[16] Some famous court-musicians proficient in music were Veene Sheshanna (1852ÿ1926)[17] and Veene Subbanna (1861ÿ1939),[18] among others.\\r\\nWith the dissolution of the erstwhile princely states and the Indian independence movement reaching its conclusion in 1947, Carnatic music went through a radical shift in patronage into an art of the masses with ticketed performances organized by private institutions called sabhs. During the 19th century, the city of Chennai (then known as Madras) emerged as the locus for Carnatic music.[19]\\r\\nThe main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in a singing style (known as gyaki).[20] Like Hindustani music, Carnatic music rests on two main elements: rga, the modes or melodic formul?, and t?a, the rhythmic cycles.[20]\\r\\nToday, Carnatic music is presented by musicians in concerts or recordings, either vocally or through instruments. Carnatic music itself developed around musical works or compositions of phenomenal composers (see below).\\r\\n?ruti commonly refers to musical pitch.[21] It is the approximate equivalent of a tonic (or less precisely a key) in Western music; it is the note from which all the others are derived. It is also used in the sense of graded pitches in an octave. While there are an infinite number of sounds falling within a scale (or raga) in Carnatic music, the number that can be distinguished by auditory perception is twenty-two (although over the years, several of them have converged). In this sense, while sruti is determined by auditory perception, it is also an expression in the listener's mind.[22]\\r\\nSwara refers to a type of musical sound that is a single note, which defines a relative (higher or lower) position of a note, rather than a defined frequency.[21] Swaras also refer to the solfege of Carnatic music, which consist of seven notes, \\"sa-ri-ga-ma-pa-da-ni\\" (compare with the Hindustani sargam: sa-re-ga-ma-pa-dha-ni or Western do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti). These names are abbreviations of the longer names shadja, rishabha, gandhara, madhyama, panchama, dhaivata and nishada. Unlike other music systems, every member of the solfege (called a swara) has three variants. The exceptions are the drone notes, shadja and panchama (also known as the tonic and the dominant), which have only one form; and madhyama (the subdominant), which has two forms. A 7th century stone inscription in Kudumiyan Malai[23] in Tamil Nadu shows vowel changes to solfege symbols with ra, ri, ru etc. to denote the higher quarter-tones. In one scale, or raga, there is usually only one variant of each note present. The exceptions exist in \\"light\\" ragas, in which, for artistic effect, there may be two, one ascending (in the arohanam) and another descending (in the avarohanam).\\r\\nA raga in Carnatic music prescribes a set of rules for building a melody ÿ very similar to the Western concept of mode.[24] It specifies rules for movements up (aarohanam) and down (avarohanam), the scale of which notes should figure more and which notes should be used more sparingly, which notes may be sung with gamaka (ornamentation), which phrases should be used or avoided, and so on. In effect, it is a series of obligatory musical events which must be observed, either absolutely or with a particular frequency.[25]\\r\\nIn Carnatic music, the sampoorna ragas (those with all seven notes in their scales) are classified into a system called the melakarta, which groups them according to the kinds of notes that they have. There are seventy-two melakarta ragas, thirty six of whose madhyama (subdominant) is shuddha (perfect fourth from the tonic), the remaining thirty-six of whose madhyama (subdominant) is prati (an augmented fourth from the tonic). The ragas are grouped into sets of six, called chakras (\\"wheels\\", though actually segments in the conventional representation) grouped according to the supertonic and mediant scale degrees. There is a system known as the katapayadi sankhya to determine the names of melakarta ragas.\\r\\nRagas may be divided into two classes: janaka ragas (i.e. melakarta or parent ragas) and janya ragas (descendant ragas of a particular janaka raga). Janya ragas are themselves subclassified into various categories.\\r\\nTala refers to a fixed time cycle or metre, set for a particular composition, which is built from groupings of beats.[citation needed] Talas have cycles of a defined number of beats and rarely change within a song. They have specific components, which in combinations can give rise to the variety to exist (over 108), allowing different compositions to have different rhythms.[26]\\r\\nCarnatic music singers usually keep the beat by moving their hands up and down in specified patterns, and using their fingers simultaneously to keep time. Tala is formed with three basic parts (called angas) which are laghu, dhrtam, and anudhrtam, though complex talas may have other parts like plutam, guru, and kaakapaadam. There are seven basic tala groups which can be formed from the laghu, dhrtam, and anudhrtam:\\r\\nA laghu has five variants (called jaathis) based on the counting pattern. Five jaathis times seven tala groups gives thirty-five basic talas, although use of other angas results in a total of 108 talas.\\r\\nImprovisation in raga is the soul of Indian classical music[27] ÿ an essential aspect.[28] \\"Manodharma Sangeetam\\" or \\"kalpana Sangeetam\\" (\\"music of imagination\\") as it is known in Carnatic music, embraces several varieties of improvisation.[28][29]\\r\\nThe main traditional forms of improvisation in Carnatic music consist of the following:[30][31]\\r\\nAn alapana, sometimes also called ragam,[32] is the exposition of a raga or tone ÿ a slow improvisation with no rhythm,[33] where the raga acts as the basis of embellishment.[25] In performing alapana, performers consider each raga as an object that has beginnings and endings and consists somehow of sequences of thought.[25]\\r\\nThe performer will explore the ragam and touch on its various nuances,[32] singing in the lower octaves first, then gradually moving up to higher octaves, while giving a hint of the song to be performed.[33]\\r\\nTheoretically, this ought to be the easiest type of improvisation, since the rules are so few, but in fact, it takes much skill to sing a pleasing, comprehensive (in the sense of giving a \\"feel for the ragam\\") and, most importantly, original raga alapana.\\r\\nNiraval, usually performed by the more advanced performers, consists of singing one or two lines of text of a song repeatedly, but with a series of melodic improvised elaborations.[34] Although niraval consists of extempore melodic variations, generally, the original patterns of duration are maintained;[35] each word in the lines of text stay set within their original place (idam) in the tala cycle.[36] The lines are then also played at different levels of speed which can include double speed, triple speed, quadruple speed and even sextuple speed.[37] The improvised elaborations are made with a view of outlining the raga, the tempo, and the theme of the composition.[citation needed]\\r\\nKalpanaswaram, also known as swarakalpana, consists of improvising melodic and rhythmic passages using swaras (solfa syllables).[38] Like niraval,[39] kalpanaswaras are sung to end on a particular swara in the raga of the melody and at a specific place (idam) in the tala cycle.[40]\\r\\nKalpanaswaras have a somewhat predictable rhythmical structure;[41] the swaras are sung to end on the samam (the first beat of the rhythmical cycle).[37] The swaras can also be sung at the same speed or double the speed of the melody that is being sung, though some artists sing triple-speed phrases too.[37]\\r\\nKalpanaswaram is the most elementary type of improvisation, usually taught before any other form of improvisation.\\r\\nTanam is one of the most important forms of improvisation, and is integral to Ragam Tanam Pallavi.[42] Originally developed for the veena, it consists of expanding the raga with syllables like tha, nam, thom, aa, nom, na, etc.\\r\\nRagam, Tanam, and Pallavi are the principal long form in concerts,[42] and is a composite form of improvisation. As the name suggests, it consists of raga alapana, tanam, and a pallavi line. Set to a slow-paced tala, the pallavi line is often composed by the performer. Through niraval, the performer manipulates the pallavi line in complex melodic and rhythmic ways.[32] The niraval is followed by kalpanaswarams.\\r\\nTani Avartanam refers to the extended solo that is played by the percussionists in a concert,[43] and is usually played after the main composition in a concert.[36] The percussionist displays the full range of his skills and rhythmic imagination during the solo, which may take from two to twenty minutes.[43]\\r\\nIn contrast to Hindustani music of the northern part of India, Carnatic music is taught and learned through compositions, which encode many intricate musical details, also providing scope for free improvisation. Nearly every rendition of a Carnatic music composition is different and unique as it embodies elements of the composer's vision, as well as the musician's interpretation.\\r\\nA Carnatic composition really has two elements, one being the musical element, the other being what is conveyed in the composition. It is probably because of this fact that most Carnatic music compositions are composed for singing. In addition to the rich musical experience, each composition brings out the knowledge and personality of the composer, and hence the words are as important as the musical element itself. This poses a special challenge for the musicians because rendering this music does not involve just playing or singing the correct musical notes; the musicians are expected to understand what was conveyed by the composer in various languages, and sing musical phrases that act to create the effect that was intended by the composer in his/her composition.\\r\\nThere are many types/forms of compositions.\\r\\nGeethams and swarajatis (which have their own peculiar composition structures) are principally meant to serve as basic learning exercises.\\r\\nCompositions more commonly associated with Indian classical dance and Indian devotional music have also been increasingly used in the Carnatic music repertoire. The performance of the Sanskrit sloka, Tamil viruttam and Telugu padyamu or sisapadya forms are particularly unique. Though these forms consist of lyric-based verses, musicians improvise raga phrases in free rhythm, like an alapana,[34] so both the sound value, and the meaning of the text, guide the musician through elaborate melodic improvisations.[44] Forms such as the divya prabandham, thevaram and ugabhoga are often performed similarly, however, these forms can also have a set melody and rhythm like the devaranama, javali, padam, thillana and thiruppugazh forms.\\r\\nThe most common and significant forms in Carnatic music are the varnam and the kriti (or kirtanam).\\r\\nVarnams are short metric pieces which encapsulate the main features and requirements of a raga.[45] The features and rules of the raga (also known as the sanchaaraas of a raga) include how each note of the raga should be stressed, the scale of the raga, and so on.[46] All varnams consist of lyrics,[47] as well as swara passages, including a pallavi, an anupallavi, muktayi swaras, a charanam, and chittaswaras.[46]\\r\\nKnown for their complex structure, varnams are a fundamental form in Carnatic music.[47] Varnams are practised as vocal exercises in multiple speeds by performers of Carnatic music, to help develop voice culture, and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm. In Carnatic music concerts, varnams are often performed by musicians as the opening item ÿ acting as a warm up for the musicians,[48] and as a means of grabbing the attention of the audience.[46]\\r\\nCarnatic songs (kritis) are varied in structure and style, but generally consist of three units:\\r\\nThis kind of song is called a keerthanam or a kriti. There are other possible structures for a kriti, which may in addition include swara passages named chittaswara. A chittaswara consists only of notes, and has no words. Still others have a verse at the end of the charana, called the madhyamakla. It is sung immediately after the charana, but at double speed.\\r\\nThere are many composers in Carnatic music. Purandara Dasa (1480ÿ1564) is referred to as the Pitamaha (the father or grandfather) of Carnatic music as he formulated the basic lessons in teaching Carnatic music, and in honour of his significant contribution to Carnatic music. He structured graded exercises known as Swaravalis and Alankaras, and at the same time, introduced the Raga Mayamalavagowla as the first scale to be learnt by beginners. He also composed Gitas (simple songs) for novice students.\\r\\nThe contemporaries Tyagaraja (1759? ÿ 1847), Muthuswami Dikshitar, (1776ÿ1827) and Syama Sastri, (1762ÿ1827) are regarded as the Trinity of Carnatic music because of the quality of Syama Sastri's compositions, the varieties of compositions of Muthuswami Dikshitar, and Tyagaraja's prolific output in composing kritis.[49]\\r\\nProminent composers prior to the Trinity of Carnatic music include Arunachala Kavi, Annamacharya, Narayana Theertha, Vijaya Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Gopala Dasa, Bhadrachala Ramadas, Sadasiva Brahmendra and Oottukkadu Venkata Kavi. Other composers are Swathi Thirunal, Gopalakrishna Bharathi, Neelakanta Sivan, Patnam Subramania Iyer, Mysore Vasudevachar, Koteeswara Iyer, Muthiah Bhagavathar, Subramania Bharathiyar and Papanasam Sivan. The compositions of these composers are rendered frequently by artists of today.\\r\\nComposers of Carnatic music were often inspired by religious devotion and were usually scholars proficient in one or more of the languages Kannada, Malayalam, Sanskrit, Tamil, or Telugu. They usually included a signature, called a mudra, in their compositions. For example, all songs by Tyagaraja (who composed in Telugu) have the word Tyagaraja in them, all songs by Muthuswami Dikshitar (who composed in Sanskrit) have the words Guruguha in them; songs by Syama Sastri (who composed in Telugu) have the words Syama Krishna in them; all songs by Purandaradasa (who composed in Kannada) have the words Purandara Vittala; while Gopalakrishna Bharathi (who composed in Tamil) used the signature Gopalakrishnan in his compositions. Papanasam Sivan, who has been hailed as the Tamil Tyagaraja of Carnatic music,[50] composed in Tamil and Sanskrit,[50] and used the signature Ramadasan in his compositions.\\r\\nCarnatic music is traditionally taught according to the system formulated by Purandara Dasa. This involves varisais (graded exercises), alankaras (exercises based on the seven talas), geetams or simple songs, and Swarajatis. After the student has reached a certain standard, varnams are taught and later, the student learns kritis. It typically takes several years of learning before a student is adept enough to perform at a concert.\\r\\nThe learning texts and exercises are more or less uniform across all the South Indian states. The learning structure is arranged in increasing order of complexity. The lessons start with the learning of the sarali varisai (solfege set to a particular raga).\\r\\nCarnatic music was traditionally taught in the gurukula system, where the student lived with and learnt the art from his guru (perceptor). From the late 20th century onwards, with changes in lifestyles and need for young music aspirants to simultaneously pursue a parallel academic career, this system has found few takers.\\r\\nMusicians often take great pride in letting people know about their Guru Parampara, or the hierarchy of disciples from some prominent ancient musician or composer, to which they belong. People whose disciple-hierarchies are often referred to are Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, Syama Sastri, Swathi Thirunal and Papanasam Sivan, among others.\\r\\nIn modern times, it is common for students to visit their gurus daily or weekly to learn music. Though new technology has made learning easier with the availability of quick-learn media such as learning exercises recorded on audio cassettes and CDs, these are discouraged by most gurus who emphasize that face-to-face learning is best for students.\\r\\nNotation is not a new concept in Indian music. However, Carnatic music continued to be transmitted orally for centuries without being written down. The disadvantage with this system was that if one wanted to learn about a kriti composed, for example, by Purandara Dasa, it involved the difficult task of finding a person from Purandara Dasa's lineage of students.\\r\\nWritten notation of Carnatic music was revived in the late 17th century and early 18th century, which coincided with rule of Shahaji II in Tanjore. Copies of Shahaji's musical manuscripts are still available at the Saraswati Mahal Library in Tanjore and they give us an idea of the music and its form. They contain snippets of solfege to be used when performing the mentioned ragas.\\r\\nUnlike classical Western music, Carnatic music is notated almost exclusively in tonic sol-fa notation using either a Roman or Indic script to represent the solfa names. Past attempts to use the staff notation have mostly failed. Indian music makes use of hundreds of ragas, many more than the church modes in Western music. It becomes difficult to write Carnatic music using the staff notation without the use of too many accidentals. Furthermore, the staff notation requires that the song be played in a certain key. The notions of key and absolute pitch are deeply rooted in Western music, whereas the Carnatic notation does not specify the key and prefers to use scale degrees (relative pitch) to denote notes. The singer is free to choose the actual pitch of the tonic note. In the more precise forms of Carnatic notation, there are symbols placed above the notes indicating how the notes should be played or sung; however, informally this practice is not followed.\\r\\nTo show the length of a note, several devices are used. If the duration of note is to be doubled, the letter is either capitalized (if using Roman script) or lengthened by a diacritic (in Indian languages). For a duration of three, the letter is capitalized (or diacriticized) and followed by a comma. For a length of four, the letter is capitalized (or diacriticized) and then followed by a semicolon. In this way any duration can be indicated using a series of semicolons and commas.\\r\\nHowever, a simpler notation has evolved which does not use semicolons and capitalization, but rather indicates all extensions of notes using a corresponding number of commas. Thus, S quadrupled in length would be denoted as \\"S,,,\\".\\r\\nThe notation is divided into columns, depending on the structure of the t?a?. The division between a laghu and a dhrutam is indicated by a?, called a ?a??, and so is the division between two dhrutams or a dhrutam and an anudhrutam. The end of a cycle is marked by a?, called a double ?a??, and looks like a caesura.\\r\\nCarnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians, who sit on an elevated stage. This usually consists of, at least, a principal performer, a melodic accompaniment, a rhythm accompaniment, and a drone.[51]\\r\\nPerformances can be musical or musical-dramatic. Musical recitals are either vocal, or purely instrumental in nature, while musical-dramatic recitals refer to Harikatha.[51] But irrespective of what type of recital it is, what is featured are compositions which form the core of this genre of music.\\r\\nThe tambura is the traditional drone instrument used in concerts. However, tamburas are increasingly being replaced by ?ruti boxes, and now more commonly, the electronic tambura. The drone itself is an integral part of performances and furnishes stability ÿ the equivalent of harmony in Western music.[52]\\r\\nIn a vocal recital, a concert team may have one or more vocalists as the principal performer(s). Instruments, such as the Saraswati veena and/or venu flute, can be occasionally found as a rhythmic accompaniment, but usually, a vocalist is supported by a violin player (who sits on his/her left). The rhythm accompanist is usually a mridangam player (who sits on the other side, facing the violin player). However, other percussion instruments such as the ghatam, kanjira and morsing frequently also accompany the main percussion instrument and play in an almost contrapuntal fashion along with the beats.\\r\\nThe objective of the accompanying instruments is far more than following the melody and keeping the beats. The accompaniments form an integral part of every composition presented, and they closely follow and augment the melodic phrases outlined by the lead singer. The vocalist and the violinist take turns while elaborating or while exhibiting creativity in sections like raga, niraval and kalpanaswaram.\\r\\nUnlike Hindustani music concerts, where an accompanying tabla player can keep beats without following the musical phrases at times, in Carnatic music, the accompanists have to follow the intricacies of the composition since there are percussion elements such as eduppu in several compositions.\\r\\nSome concerts feature a good bit of interaction with the lead musicians and accompanists exchanging notes, and accompanying musicians predicting the lead musician's musical phrases.\\r\\nA contemporary Carnatic music concert (called a kutcheri) usually lasts about three hours, and comprises a number of varied compositions. Carnatic songs are composed in a particular raga, which means that they do not deviate from the notes in the raga. Each composition is set with specific notes and beats, but performers improvise extensively. Improvisation occurs in the melody of the composition as well as in using the notes to expound the beauty of the raga.\\r\\nConcerts usually begin with a varnam or an invocatory item which will act as the opening piece. The varnam is composed with an emphasis on swaras of the raga, but will also have lyrics, the saahityam. It is lively and fast to get the audience's attention. An invocatory item may usually follow the varnam.\\r\\nAfter the varnam and/or invocatory item, the artist sings longer compositions called kirtanas (commonly referred to as kritis). Each kriti sticks to one specific raga, although some are composed with more than one raga; these are known as ragamalika (a garland of ragas).\\r\\nAfter singing the opening kriti, usually, the performer sings the kalpanaswaram of the raga to the beat. The performer must improvise a string of swaras in any octave according to the rules of the raga and return to beginning of the cycle of beats smoothly, joining the swaras with a phrase selected from the kriti. The violin performs these alternately with the main performer. In very long strings of swara, the performers must calculate their notes accurately to ensure that they stick to the raga, have no awkward pauses or lapses in the beat of the song, and create a complex pattern of notes that a knowledgeable audience can follow.\\r\\nPerformers then begin the main compositions with a section called raga alapana exploring the raga. In this, they use the sounds aa, ri, na, ta, etc. instead of swaras to slowly elaborate the notes and flow of the raga. This begins slowly and builds to a crescendo, and finally establishes a complicated exposition of the raga that shows the performer's skill. All of this is done without any rhythmic accompaniment, or beat. Then the melodic accompaniment (violin or veena), expounds the raga. Experienced listeners can identify many ragas after they hear just a few notes. With the raga thus established, the song begins, usually with lyrics. In this, the accompaniment (usually violin, sometimes veena) performs along with the main performer and the percussion (such as a mridangam). In the next stage of the song, they may sing niraval or kalpanaswaram again.\\r\\nIn most concerts, the main item will at least have a section at the end of the item, for the percussion to perform solo (called the tani avartanam). The percussion artists perform complex patterns of rhythm and display their skill. If multiple percussion instruments are employed, they engage in a rhythmic dialogue until the main performer picks up the melody once again. Some experienced artists may follow the main piece with a ragam thanam pallavi mid-concert, if they do not use it as the main item.\\r\\nFollowing the main composition, the concert continues with shorter and lighter songs. Some of the types of songs performed towards the end of the concerts are tillanas and thukkadas ÿ bits of popular kritis or compositions requested by the audience. Every concert that is the last of the day ends with a mangalam, a thankful prayer and conclusion to the musical event.\\r\\nThe audience of a typical concert will have some understanding of Carnatic music. It is also typical to see the audience tapping out the tala in sync with the artist's performance. As and when the artist exhibits creativity, the audience acknowledge it by clapping their hands. With experienced artists, towards the middle of the concert, requests start flowing in. The artist usually sings the requests, and it helps in exhibiting the artist's broad knowledge of the several thousand kritis that are in existence.\\r\\nVarious music festivals featuring Carnatic music performances are held in India, and throughout the world.\\r\\nWith the city of Chennai (then known as Madras) emerging as the locus for Carnatic music during the 19th century,[19] its musicians founded the Tyagaraja Aradhana festival in 1846. The Aradhana festival is an annual death-anniversary celebration of the prolific Carnatic music composer, Tyagaraja. Held in the city of Thiruvayaru, thousands of musicians attend the festival to perform his compositions. Since its inception, other festivals were started in a similar manner throughout India and abroad, such as the Chembai Sangeetholsavam in the Indian city of Guruvayur, and the Aradhana in the US city of Cleveland.\\r\\nThe city of Chennai also holds a six-week-long grand \\"Music Season\\", which has been described as the world's largest cultural event.[53] The Music Season was started in 1927, to mark the opening of the Madras Music Academy. It used to be a traditional month-long Carnatic music festival, but since then it has also diversified into dance and drama, as well as non-Carnatic art forms. Some concert organisers also feature their own Carnatic music festivals during the season. Thousands of performances are held by hundreds of musicians across various venues in the city.\\r\\nCarnatic music artists often have to have had several years of intense training and practice before being qualified as musicians who can perform on stage.\\r\\nResearch shows that children receiving Carnatic classical musical training were in advantage for phonological awareness (PA) and verbal working memory (VWM) along with enhanced pitch perception abilities. It was also found that the children who had undergone longer duration of training showed better performance in these areas.[54][citation needed] Post-operative patients can ease their pain and reduce their dependence on pain-killers by listening to one of the famous Ragas of Carnatic music, Anandha Bhairavi.[55][citation needed]","input":"What is the classical music of south india called?"},{"output":"beef, mechanically separated chicken, lactic acid starter culture, dextrose, salt, sodium nitrite and hydrolyzed soy","context":"Slim Jim is an American brand of jerky snacks or dried sausage sold globally and manufactured by ConAgra Foods.

Some evidence suggests similar hepatotoxicity in other populations.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can also affect the central nervous system, causing psychotic reactions, nightmares and night sweats.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may also alter the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills because of its effect on the gut flora. Erythromycin is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 system, which means it can have a rapid effect on levels of other drugs metabolised by this system, e.g., warfarin.\\r\\n\\r\\nErythromycin is metabolized by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, in particular, by isozymes of the CYP3A superfamily, CYP3A.[21] The activity of the CYP3A enzymes can be induced or inhibited by certain drugs (e.g. dexamethasone) which can cause it to affect the metabolism of many different drugs, e.g. erythromycin. If other CYP3A substrates  drugs that are broken down by CYP3A  such as simvastatin (Zocor), lovastatin (Mevacor), or atorvastatin (Lipitor)are taken concomitantly with erythromycin, levels of the substrates increase, often causing adverse effects. A noted drug interaction involves erythromycin and simvastatin, resulting in increased simvastatin levels and the potential for rhabdomyolysis. Another group of CYP3A4 substrates are drugs used for migraine such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine; their adverse effects may be more pronounced if erythromycin is associated.[20]\\r\\nEarlier case reports on sudden death prompted a study on a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like verapamil or diltiazem) by interfering with CYP3A4.[22] Hence, erythromycin should not be administered to people using these drugs, or drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Other examples include terfenadine (Seldane, Seldane-D), astemizole (Hismanal), cisapride (Propulsid, withdrawn in many countries for prolonging the QT time) and pimozide (Orap). Theophylline, which is used mostly in asthma, is also contraindicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nErythromycin and doxycycline can have a synergistic effect when combined and kill bacteria (E. coli) with a higher potency than the sum of the two drugs together. This synergistic relationship is only temporary. After approximately 72 hours, the relationship shifts to become antagonistic, whereby a 50/50 combination of the two drugs kills less bacteria than if the two drugs were administered separately.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nErythromycin displays bacteriostatic activity or inhibits growth of bacteria, especially at higher concentrations,[24] but the mechanism is not fully understood. By binding to the 50s subunit of the bacterial  rRNA complex, protein synthesis and subsequent structure and function processes critical for life or replication are inhibited.[24] Erythromycin interferes with aminoacyl translocation, preventing the transfer of the tRNA bound at the A site of the rRNA complex to the P site of the rRNA complex. Without this translocation, the A site remains occupied, thus the addition of an incoming tRNA and its attached amino acid to the nascent polypeptide chain is inhibited. This interferes with the production of functionally useful proteins, which is the basis of this antimicrobial action.\\r\\n\\r\\nErythromycin increases gut motility by binding to Motillin, thus it is a Motillin receptor agonist in addition to its antimicrobial properties.\\r\\n\\r\\nErythromycin is easily inactivated by gastric acid; therefore, all orally administered formulations are given as either enteric-coated or more-stable salts or esters, such as erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Erythromycin is very rapidly absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, erythromycin is actively transported to the site of infection, where, during active phagocytosis, large concentrations of erythromycin are released.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of erythromycin is metabolised by demethylation in the liver by the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4. Its main elimination route is in the bile with little renal excretion, 2%-15% unchanged drug. Erythromycin's elimination half-life ranges between 1.5 and 2.0 hours and is between 5 and 6 hours in patients with end-stage renal disease.  Erythromycin levels peak in the serum 4 hours after dosing; ethylsuccinate peaks 0.5-2.5 hours after dosing, but can be delayed if digested with food.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nErythromycin crosses the placenta and enters breast milk.  The American Association of Pediatrics determined erythromycin is safe to take while breastfeeding.[26] Absorption in pregnant patients has been shown to be variable, frequently resulting in levels lower than in nonpregnant patients.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard-grade erythromycin is primarily composed of four related compounds known as erythromycins A, B, C, and D. Each of these compounds can be present in varying amounts and can differ by lot. Erythromycin A has been found to have the most antibacterial activity, followed by erythromycin B. Erythromycins C and D are about half as active as erythromycin A.[11][27] Some of these related compounds have been purified and can be studied and researched individually.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the three decades after the discovery of erythromycin A and its activity as an antimicrobial, many attempts were  made to synthesize it in the laboratory. The presence of 10 stereospecific carbons and several points of distinct substitution has made the total synthesis of erythromycin A a formidable task.[28] Complete syntheses of erythromycins related structures and precursors such as 6-deoxyerythronolide B have been accomplished, giving way to possible syntheses of different erythromycins and other macrolide antimicrobials.[29] Woodward successfully completed the synthesis of erythromycin A.[30][31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nErythromycin was discovered by Abelardo Aguilar when working for the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company as a researcher.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1949 Abelardo B. Aguilar, a Filipino scientist, sent some soil samples to his employer Eli Lilly . Eli Lillys research team, led by J. M. McGuire, managed to isolate erythromycin from the metabolic products of a strain of Streptomyces erythreus (designation changed to \\"Saccharopolyspora erythraea\\") found in the samples.\\r\\n\\r\\nLilly filed for patent protection of the compound and U.S. patent 2,653,899 was granted in 1953. The product was launched commercially in 1952 under the brand name Ilosone (after the Philippine region of Iloilo where it was originally collected). Erythromycin was formerly also called Ilotycin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1981, Nobel laureate (1965 in chemistry) and professor of chemistry at Harvard University Robert B. Woodward (posthumously), along with a large number of members from his research group, reported the first stereocontrolled asymmetric chemical synthesis of erythromycin A.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe antibiotic clarithromycin was invented by scientists at the Japanese drug company Taisho Pharmaceutical in the 1970s as a result of their efforts to overcome the acid instability of erythromycin.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists at Chugai Pharmaceuticals discovered an erythromycin-derived motilin agonist called mitemcinal that is believed to have strong prokinetic properties (similar to erythromycin) but lacking antibiotic properties. Erythromycin is commonly used off-label for gastric motility indications such as gastroparesis. If mitemcinal can be shown to be an effective prokinetic agent, it would represent a significant advance in the gastrointestinal field, as treatment with this drug would not carry the risk of unintentional selection for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is available as a generic medication and was inexpensive for many years.[5] The wholesale price was between 0.03 and 0.06 USD per pill.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States in 2014 the price increased to seven dollars per tablet.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe price of Erythromycin rose three times between 2010 and 2015, from 24 cents per tablet in 2010 to $8.96 in 2015.[35] In 2017, a Kaiser Health News study found that the per-unit cost of dozens of generics doubled or even tripled from 2015 to 2016, increasing spending by the Medicaid program. Due to price increases by drug manufacturers, Medicaid paid on average $2,685,330 more for Erythromycin in 2016 compared to 2015 (not including rebates).[36] By 2018, generic drug prices had climbed another 5% on average.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrand names include Robimycin, E-Mycin, E.E.S.

It burned approximately 281,893 acres (440?sq?mi; 114,078?ha), becoming the largest wildfire in modern California history, before it was fully contained on January 12, 2018.[12][13][3][6][14][a] The Thomas Fire destroyed at least 1,063 structures, while damaging 280 others;[3][4][15][6] becoming the seventh-most destructive wildfire in state history.[16][17]\\r\\nBy December 22, the Thomas Fire had cost over $177 million to fight,[1] and forced over 104,607 residents to evacuate.[18][19][20][21] At its height, the Thomas Fire saw over 8,500 firefighters mobilized to fight it, which was the largest mobilization of firefighters for combating any wildfire in California history.[22]\\r\\nThe fire began on December 4, north of Santa Paula, near Steckel Park[23] and south of Thomas Aquinas College. Fast-moving, it quickly reached the city of Ventura, where over five hundred residences were destroyed that night.[24] The fire destroyed almost as many residences in several rural communities amidst the rugged mountain terrain of Ventura County. The fire threatened the Ojai Valley, and on December 13, the fire completely surrounded the area, including Lake Casitas.[25][26] The fire began burning through the rugged Santa Ynez Mountains as it threatened several small communities along the Rincon Coast north of Ventura, expanded into the Los Padres National Forest, and reached Santa Barbara County. Firefighters concentrated on protecting the communities of Carpinteria and Montecito in the southern portion of the county as the fire burned in the foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains where access was difficult.[27]\\r\\nThe unusually strong and persistent Santa Ana winds were the largest factor in the spread of the fire.[28] Much of Southern California experienced \\"the strongest and longest duration Santa Ana wind event we have seen so far this season\\", according to the National Weather Service.[19] The region experienced an on-and-off Santa Ana wind event for a little over two weeks, which contributed to the Thomas Fire's persistent growths in size.[29] At its height, the wildfire was powerful enough to generate its own weather, qualifying it as a firestorm.[30] There were periods of time when the fire was advancing at a rate of an acre (0.4 ha) per second.[31] The winds also dried out the air, resulting in extremely low humidity.[28] The area, along with most of Southern California, experienced the driest March-through-December period on record.[32]\\r\\nWhile November is the typical beginning of the rainy season in California, the first measurable rain for the area fell on January 8, 2018, more than a month into the fire. With the natural vegetation burnt, flash floods and mudflows damaged homes in Montecito when the rains arrived.[33] Evacuations were ordered or anticipated for neighborhoods that sit below areas recently burned by this and other wildfires.[34] As of 5 AM PST on January 10, at least 20 people had been killed by the sudden flooding and debris flows that followed the heavy rains, which also destroyed over 100 homes.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 4, 2017, the Thomas Fire was reported at 6:26 p.m. PST,[36] to the north of Santa Paula, near Steckel Park and Thomas Aquinas College,[3][24] after which the fire is named.[37] That night, the small brush fire exploded in size and raced through the rugged mountain terrain that lies west of Santa Paula, between Ventura and Ojai.[19][38] Officials blamed strong Santa Ana winds that gusted up to 60 miles per hour (97?km/h) for the sudden expansion.[28][39] Soon after the fire had started, a second blaze was ignited nearly 30 minutes later, about 4 miles (6.4?km) to the north in Upper Ojai at the top of Koenigstein Road.[40] According to eyewitnesses, this second fire was sparked by an explosion in the power line over the area. The second fire was rapidly expanded by the strong Santa Ana winds, and soon merged into the Thomas Fire later that night.[40]\\r\\nLate on the night of December 4, the Thomas Fire reached the hillside neighborhoods of Clearpoint,[41] Ondulando,[42] and Skyline[43] in the city of Ventura and destroyed many single-family detached homes. Many people fled with little or no warning when evacuation orders were issued, as the fire had traveled 12 miles (19?km) in just a few hours.[44] Tuesday morning, on December 5, saw 1,000 firefighters battling the blaze, with no containment of the fire. At 7 a.m. PST, one helicopter began dropping water, while fixed-wing aircraft waited to be deployed after the winds died down.[9] The firefighters tried to save Ventura homes in the midst of a red-flag wind advisory with ridgeline winds of 35 to 45 miles per hour (56 to 72?km/h) and gusts up to 70 miles per hour (110?km/h).[9] The fire continued jumping across the valleys along the steep slopes of the foothills that abut the northern portion of the city. As the fire traveled along the interface between the foothill rangeland and the area developed with homes, it reached the hills above downtown where several apartment buildings and other homes above downtown Ventura were damaged or completely destroyed.[9] The fire burned over Grant Park above City Hall, and burned along the ridge above the western portion of the city, which stretches north along the narrow Ventura River valley, and is characterized by steeply-sloped sides.\\r\\nThe fire continued moving north up the valley throughout the day. The entire community of Casitas Springs, which lies northwest of Ventura, had a mandatory evacuation issued as the fire approached.[19] The fire reached Black Mountain[45] overlooking Ojai. The entire Ojai Valley was given mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders. The Ojai pumping system was damaged by the fire and the entire water system stopped working for a time so water was not available from the hydrants for use by the firefighters.[46] The western flank of the fire jumped over Highway 33 and burned through the Taylor Ranch oil fields[47] on the other side of the valley. The fast-moving, wind-driven wildfire continued past the area that had burned in the 2015 Christmas Day Solimar Fire, before crossing the 101 Freeway to the Solimar Beach area, on Pacific Coast Highway, along the Pacific Ocean. The fire continued its northwesterly march along the Rincon Coast to Rincon Point, at the Santa Barbara County/Ventura County line.[19]\\r\\nOn Tuesday, December 5, additional National Guard helicopters were brought in to fight the six largest wildfires burning in Southern California. Officials said they also obtained \\"every last plane we could find in the nation.\\" C-130 airplanes were obtained from the U.S. military, and more than 290 fire engines came from Montana, Utah, New Mexico, Idaho, Arizona, Oregon, and Nevada.[48]\\r\\nOn December 7, the Thomas Fire grew further to 115,000 acres (46,539?ha), with containment of the fire at 5%.[3][31] On December 8, the Thomas Fire grew to 143,000 acres (58,000?ha) with containment of the wildfire increasing to 10%, after the Santa Ana winds died down.[49][50]\\r\\nOn December 9, as the Santa Ana winds returned, the Thomas Fire expanded to 155,000 acres (63,000?ha), while containment of the fire increased to 15%. By the afternoon of the same day, the fire entered Santa Barbara County near Divide Peak.[51][52][53][54]\\r\\nEarly on December 10, the Thomas fire expanded to 173,000 acres (70,000?ha), but containment of the blaze stayed the same as the previous date, at 15% total containment. The evacuation orders were expanded further north into Santa Barbara County into the communities of Carpinteria and Montecito.[55][56] Only the southern and southeastern flanks of the wildfire had been contained.[55] However, by the evening of the same day, the powerful Santa Ana winds had caused the Thomas Fire to undergo another period of explosive growth, expanding to 230,000 acres (93,000?ha) in size, with containment dropping to 10% overall, indicating no new progress in fire containment.[57][58] Another firefighter was injured, when he fractured his leg, and he returned home to recover.[10]\\r\\nOn the same day, fire analysts stated that the Thomas Fire had been generating its own weather for the past two days, a behavior only observed in very massive wildfires and indicative of a firestorm.[30] The Thomas Fire was generating massive pyrocumulus clouds, which were gathering heat from the flames below, although the unstable column of air could collapse at any time, which would generate sudden wind shifts near the fire and pose a major hazard to firefighters. This behavior had been previously observed during the massive 2009 Station Fire in Los Angeles.[30] At this point, the Thomas Fire had become the fifth-largest wildfire in modern California history[20] and the largest wildfire recorded in California in December.[59] The Thomas Fire was also estimated to be at least the 10th most destructive wildfire on record in California.[17]\\r\\nOn the morning of December 11, the Thomas Fire had grown to 230,500 acres (93,300?ha), while containment of the fire had increased to 15%.[36] After this expansion in size, the Thomas Fire's northwestern flank almost linked up with its southwestern flank, to the east of Carpinteria, cutting across parts of Route 150, and threatening to envelop Ojai and Lake Casitas.[60][25][61] By this time, the Thomas Fire had grossly surpassed the size of the previous largest fire in December, which was extremely unusual.[59] Fire officials noted that many areas had been \\"Moonscaped\\", an event in which the brush has been so completely burned that it was left looking like a barren and blackened landscape, resembling the surface of the Moon, which is indicative of extreme fire behavior.[10] During the evening of December 11, the Thomas Fire expanded further to 231,700 acres (93,800?ha), while firefighters increased containment of the fire to 20%.[62]\\r\\nOn December 13, the Thomas Fire's expansion slowed on its west flank, as it reached the burn area of the 240,000-acre Zaca Fire (97,000?ha) from 2007. However, the Thomas Fire's northwestern and southwestern flanks merged on the western shore of Lake Casitas, completely encircling the Lake Casitas and Ojai area.[26] Firefighters have expected the fire's growth to be disrupted if it reaches the burn scars of other previous fires to the west within the last 10 years: the Tea, Jesusita, Gap, and Rey Fires.[11]\\r\\nOn December 14, the Thomas Fire expanded further to 242,500 acres (98,100?ha), surpassing the Zaca Fire to become the fourth-largest wildfire in modern California history. Later on the same day, the Thomas Fire expanded further to 249,500 acres (101,000?ha). On the same day, a firefighter died, while working northwest of Fillmore, on a flareup near the eastern flank of the fire.[7]\\r\\nOn the morning of December 15, containment lines in the Santa Barbara and Montecito areas and protecting nearby homes was the priority, in addition to the threatened Carpinteria and Summerland areas. Officials feared the sundowner winds could push the fire into those communities as they blow south from the mountains down to the coast, and because they also dry out the air.[63][27] Although they prevented the fire from reaching the community, it still grew to 259,000 acres (105,000?ha) with 40% containment on the morning of December 16, surpassing the Rim Fire in size, and becoming the third-largest wildfire in the modern history of California.[27] Around this time, officials and experts feared that the Thomas Fire could surpass the Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889, which had burned over 300,000 acres (120,000?ha), and is believed to be California's all-time largest wildfire on record.[64]\\r\\nOn December 17, the Thomas Fire expanded to 270,000 acres (110,000?ha), with 45% containment, reaching the burn scar of the 2008 Tea Fire and the 2009 Jesusita Fire.[65][66] However, the weakening of Santa Ana winds in the evening allowed firefighters to make progress on containing the fire, with firefighters able to keep the Thomas Fire from burning southward into the majority of nearby homes, and they also attacked the western front of the fire.[65]\\r\\nOn December 18, firefighters began a large firing operation north of the Thomas Fire, south of Route 33, in order to clear away excess brush, and to attempt to control the Thomas Fire's northward expansion.[67][68] Firefighters hoped that the winds would push the control fires southward, away from the highway and towards the main body of the Thomas Fire. Fire officials stated that the control burns could scorch up to 20,000 acres (8,100?ha), before they connect with the main portion of the Thomas Fire.[68]\\r\\nOn December 19, the Thomas Fire grew to 272,000 acres (110,000?ha), with 55% containment, surpassing the burn area of the Rush Fire in California to become the second-largest wildfire in modern California history.[69] On December 21, all evacuation orders for Santa Barbara County were lifted, as firefighters continued to make progress on containing the wildfire.[68] By this point, the Thomas Fire had become the 7th most destructive wildfire in California history.[16]\\r\\nDuring the evening of December 22, the Thomas Fire expanded to 273,400 acres (110,600?ha), with containment remaining at 65% for the second day, surpassing the Cedar Fire of 2003 to become California's largest wildfire in modern history.[14] By this point, however, fire officials stated that any further growths in the fire's size would likely be due to control burns from firing operations, due to more favorable weather conditions for firefighting.[14] Due to the cooler temperatures and increase in humidity, the control fires were not spreading as intended, so firefighters used flamethrowers to spread the control flames manually.[29]\\r\\nOn December 23, fire growth paused, and containment of the wildfire was brought up to 70%.[70] By the evening of the same day, firefighters had completed firing operations near the northwestern flank of the Thomas Fire, with no more planned for the time being.[71][72] However, on December 24, the Thomas Fire grew to 281,620 acres (113,970?ha), after the fires from the back-burning operations completely merged into the Thomas Fire,[73][74] though containment of the wildfire also increased to 86%.[75] The Thomas Fire had ignited about 30 oil seep fires within the fire perimeter, at the Upper Ojai area. Fire officials had ordered a foam product to help extinguish the oil seep fires, though officials warned that the products may cause more smoke upon application.[73] Favorable weather conditions continued, with a few snow flurries precipitating over the Thomas Fire on the same day.[72]\\r\\nOn December 26, the Thomas Fire remained at 281,620 acres (113,970?ha); no further growth in the fire's size was anticipated at this point.[76][77] The number of firefighters deployed decreased to about 900, and containment of the Thomas Fire increased to 88%.[76] That same day, CAL FIRE released a chart with the top 20 largest wildfires in California history, adding the Thomas Fire as the new largest fire.[78]\\r\\nOn December 27, the Thomas Fire experienced another small expansion in size on its northeastern flank, to 281,893 acres (114,078?ha), while containment of the wildfire increased to 91%.[79] Early on December 29, the Thomas Fire was 92% contained, with no further increases in size.[80] On the same day, a smoldering area within the western edge of the Thomas Fire's perimeter, near Gibraltar Road, flared up, sending smoke over Santa Barbara. However, firefighters were able to extinguish the new flames by 1 p.m. PST on the same day.[81]\\r\\nOn December 30, incident command was transferred to a local team headed by the Los Padres National Forest staff, and the Thomas Fire remained at 92% containment.[82][83] At that time, fire officials decided to let the remaining flames within the Thomas Fire's perimeter burn out; afterward, full containment of the wildfire was not expected until January 21, 2018.[82][6]\\r\\nOn January 12, 2018, the U.S. Forest Service declared the fire 100 percent contained at 281,893 acres.[84][85]\\r\\nAt least 1,063 structures have been destroyed in the fire.[86] Numerous single-family homes were destroyed along with the Hawaiian Village Apartments in the hills above downtown Ventura and 12 houses for guest workers of Limoneira Co. near Santa Paula. The downtown Harbor View Apartments and the Vista del Mar hospital (a psychiatric facility) on the west side of Ventura were among the complexes that were heavily damaged.[9][87] The Ojai Valley School, near the city of Ojai, was heavily damaged with two buildings being destroyed.[88] The Thomas Fire destroyed multiple expensive homes in the Montecito area. On December 23, the Thomas Fire was estimated to have caused over $120 million in property losses, in Santa Barbara County.[2]\\r\\nOne firefighter died of thermal injuries and smoke inhalation on December 14, in an active area of the fire near Fillmore,[89] and one firefighter was injured after being struck by a car on December 5. His injuries were not considered to be life-threatening.[9][90] One person, a 70-year-old woman, died in a car accident while fleeing the fire on Wednesday night, December 6.[8][91]\\r\\nOver a quarter million Southern California Edison customers lost power as a result of damage from the fire.[92][93] The transmission system which runs from Ventura County to Goleta had to be shut down to prevent further problems until Edison employees could safely access the area for inspections.[94][19]\\r\\nAir quality warnings were issued for many areas due to the fire, because of dangerous levels of smoke and particulates. During the alerts, authorities have recommended that people stay indoors, avoid driving in affected areas and drink plenty of fluids.[95] The east winds that have powered the fire have pushed much of the smoke out to sea or into areas somewhat distant from the fire. When the winds ease, the smoke has hung in the air in many communities. The typical moist, cool daily onshore winds in the evening have also been bringing smoke inland.\\r\\nDozens of school districts implemented closures during the fire.[19][96] On December 10, University of California, Santa Barbara cancelled classes, due to power outages and air quality concerns. The university also delayed its scheduled finals by a month.[97] The expansion of the Thomas Fire also prompted more evacuation orders near Santa Barbara, with mandatory evacuation zones extending into Carpinteria and into the eastern outskirts of Santa Barbara.[55][56]\\r\\nAmtrak passenger rail service between Oxnard and San Luis Obispo on the Pacific Surfliner was suspended indefinitely when the fire reached the route along the Rincon north of Ventura.[95] Highways 150, 101, and 33 were partially shut down at various times due to the fire.[98] Officials began closing State Highway 154 for several hours each morning in order to mobilize fire equipment on December 13.[99]\\r\\nOn Tuesday, December 5, the city of Ventura issued a precautionary boil-water advisory, because of the loss of pressure in the water system from power outages related to the fire. A similar warning was issued by the Casitas Municipal Water District which serves portions of the Ojai Valley and communities along the Rincon Coast from Ventura to the Santa Barbara County line.[19] The city of Ventura also issued a curfew as a result of the fire on Tuesday, which would be effective from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m. on the next morning, until further notice.[100] The boil alert was lifted on December 12.[101]\\r\\nAn amateur radio site on Reeves Road in Ojai was heavily damaged by the fire. The site is part of a repeater network run by amateur radio operators. These volunteers plan to replace lost equipment and enhance the shared station with additional cameras, solar panels, batteries, a weather station, and other hardware.[102]\\r\\nOn January 9, 2018, 3:30 AM, PST, 0.54 inch (13.7 mm) of rain in 5 minutes was reported at Montecito [103]. Heavy rain on burned hill slopes above the city resulted in rapid erosion, mud flow and debris flow (mass wasting) of soil and stream channels, causing catastrophic damage in Montecito Creek and San Ysidro Creek.\\r\\nAs of January 21, 2018, 21 fatalities, 2 missing persons, 129 destroyed residences and 307 damaged residences, attributed to debris flows, were reported by the inter-agency, storm-response team [104] in Santa Barbara County [105].\\r\\nWriter T.C. Boyle, whose Montecito home was within the proximity of both the fire and mudslides, documented the collective trauma in The New Yorker magazine.[106].\\r\\nDebris flows are generated in the following general sequence of events: Fire reduces the organic soil layer to ash and char. Water-repellent, organic hydrocarbons condense in shallow, mineral soil, enhancing runoff. Locally heavy rain, exceeding the infiltration rate of the soil, generates surface runoff. Eroded unconsolidated sediment and ash is suspended and dissolved, increasing the density of the flow. Pore water pressure developed in unconsolidated soil and sediment causes liquefaction. Erosion increases as gravity drives mud flow through the drainage basin in confined channels. Mud flows mobilize woody debris and larger sedimentary particles as debris flow, which continues to accumulate as smaller channels combine with larger channels. As the size of the debris flow increases, larger particles are entrained, channel erosion occurs, landslides and vegetation are incorporated. Multiple debris flows may be generated in the eroding, mountainous portion of the drainage basin. Debris flows typically surge, as precipitation rate and sediment supply vary, hydraulic jumps occur, landslide dams in the channel form and collapse. Upon exiting the steeper mountain canyon, as the stream gradient is reduced, the debris flow spreads laterally and begins to deposit larger particles on the alluvial fan. Where the stream channel is plugged with debris, lateral channel migration occurs, building upon the existing alluvial fan deposits. Deposition also occurs down-stream of the alluvial fan, where stream gradient decreases, on the floodplain, alluvial plain, coastal plain and river delta. As precipitation, subsurface flow, runoff, stream flow and supply of sediment and debris decreases, the stream reverts to low-flow characteristics. It takes years for disturbed channels to achieve relative stability as bed load sediment adjusts and vegetation is reestablished.\\r\\nNative chaparral burned extensively to charred stems and ash. Chaparral is a fire-adapted biome that burns frequently, catastrophically in Santa Ana wind. Coastal chaparral plant species readily re-sprout or regenerate from serotinous seed in the Mediterranean climate of coastal, southern California.\\r\\nThe Inter-agency Thomas Fire Command mapped at least 50 chaparral fires of various sizes that burned in the Thomas Fire area since 1950 [107][108]. The 1985 Wheeler Fire burned the central portion of the Thomas Fire.\\r\\nSoon after the Thomas Fire started, officials began to investigate the cause of the wildfire. The Thomas Fire originated as two separate fires, with the first fire igniting on December 4 at 6:26 p.m. PST, in Santa Paula Canyon, near Thomas Aquinas College, while the second fire started about 30 minutes later, nearly 4 miles north in Upper Ojai, at the top of Koenigstein Road. The newer fire quickly merged into the Thomas Fire later that night.[40] The causes of both blazes are currently being investigated. The cause of the original fire is currently unknown; locals reported seeing a steel power pylon explode near 7 p.m. on December 4, at the origin point of the second fire. However, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which owns the power lines in the area, has denied that there had been any breaks in the power line.[40][109]\\r\\nIn a radio interview, Neal Andrews explained how he was elected by the city council to serve as the new mayor, at the regular Monday night city council meeting in Ventura City Hall, about three hours after the fire broke out some 15 miles (24?km) away.\\r\\n\\"I got sworn in. As I walked out of City Hall, all the lights of the city went out. And that was the first indication that we had a real crisis happening.\\"\\r\\nOn Tuesday, December 5, 2017, at 10:45 p.m. PST, Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in Ventura County, due to the Thomas Fire.[111] On his visit to Ventura on Saturday to survey the damage, Brown called the fires a \\"terrible tragedy for so many people.\\"\\r\\n\\"This is the new normal. We're about ready to have firefighting at Christmas. This is very odd and unusual.\\"\\r\\nThe Santa Paula Airport became a helibase for CAL FIRE by the morning after the fire started. The airport was outfitted as a base of operations for the water-dropping helicopters, and closed to all of the regular general aviation operations. About 23 helicopters began operating out of the airport, along with the necessary support crews, tanker trucks, and other equipment. In addition to water, brightly colored fire retardant was dropped on the fire from the air.[112] During the first couple of weeks, there had been limited ability to use fixed-wing air tankers and VLAT (very large air tankers) to drop fire retardant, due to the smoky skies.[11] After having been in the air all day, the helicopters undergo maintenance at night. Other activities included a daily briefing each morning, lunches, and distributing maps.[112]\\r\\nMany aircraft and their operations moved to other airports, such as Camarillo, which remained open to normal activities, while being involved in firefighting efforts. Amid all this, the Santa Paula airport was able to make one of its hangars available for cats after one of the local animal shelters was filled to capacity, and for one local family with its dogs for three nights, on its premises as well.[112]\\r\\nA total of ten strike teams from across the state of Oregon deployed to help California firefighters battle multiple massive blazes north of Los Angeles, including the Thomas Fire. On December 6th, 2017, The Oregon Fire Marshal announced the dispatching of heavy equipment (around 75 fire engines) to help.[113][114]\\r\\nStrike teams from Oregon arrived from Clackamas, Klamath, Lane, Linn, Marion, Multnomah, Washington and Yamhill Counties; in addition, a combined team from Benton, Linn, and Polk Counties, and a team from the Rogue Valley area were also assisting. State fire officials announced that five additional strike teams would be deployed on the evening of Wednesday, December 6.[113][115]\\r\\nFirefighters from Arizona,[116] Washington,[117] Idaho,[118] Montana,[119] New Mexico,[120] Nevada,[121] Colorado,[122] and Utah[123] were also assisting in the fire suppression efforts.[124]","input":"What is the current state of the thomas fire?"},{"output":"St. Ignatius College Prep","context":"Gina Alexis Rodriguez[1] (born July 30, 1984)[2][3] is an American actress, model, writer, producer, and director.

Membership of Rajya Sabha is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of 250 members, and current laws have provision for 245 members. Most of the members of the House are indirectly elected by state and territorial legislatures using single transferable votes, while the President can appoint 12 members for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services. Members sit for staggered six-year terms, with one third of the members retiring every two years.[5]\\r\\nThe Rajya Sabha meets in continuous sessions, and unlike the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, is not subject to dissolution. However, the Rajya Sabha, like the Lok Sabha can be prorogued by the President. The Rajya Sabha has equal footing in all areas of legislation with Lok Sabha, except in the area of supply, where the Lok Sabha has overriding powers. In the case of conflicting legislation, a joint sitting of the two houses can be held. However, since the Lok Sabha has twice as many members as the Rajya Sabha, the former would normally hold the greater power. Joint sittings of the Houses of Parliament of India are rare, and in the history of the Republic, only three such joint-sessions have been held; the latest one for the passage of the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act.\\r\\nThe Vice-President of India (currently, Venkaiah Naidu) is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, who presides over its sessions. The Deputy Chairman, who is elected from amongst the house's members, takes care of the day-to-day matters of the house in the absence of the Chairman. The Rajya Sabha held its first sitting on 13 May 1952.[6] The salary and other benefits for a member of Rajya Sabha are same as for a member of Lok Sabha.\\r\\nRajya Sabha members are elected by state legislatures rather than directly through the electorate by single transferable vote method.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle 84 of the Constitution lays down the qualifications for membership of Parliament. A member of the Rajya Sabha must:[7]\\r\\nIn addition, twelve members are nominated by the President of India having special knowledge in various areas like arts and science. However, they are not entitled to vote in Presidential elections as per Article 55 of the Constitution.\\r\\nThe Constitution of India places some restrictions on Rajya Sabha which makes Lok Sabha more powerful in certain areas in comparison.\\r\\nMoney bills, as defined in the Constitution of India Act 110, can only be introduced in Lok Sabha. When Lok Sabha passes a money bill, and transmits it to Rajya Sabha, Rajya Sabha has only fourteen days to return the bill (with or without amendments) to Lok Sabha. If Rajya Sabha fails to return the bill in fourteen days, that bill is deemed to have passed by both the Houses. Also, if Lok Sabha rejects any (or all) of the amendments proposed by Rajya Sabha, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of Parliament in the form Lok Sabha finally passes it. Hence, Rajya Sabha cannot stall, or amend, a money bill without Lok Sabha's concurrence on the same.[9]\\r\\nArticle 108 provides for a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament in certain cases. A joint sitting can be convened by the President of India when one house has either rejected a bill passed by the other house, has not taken any action on a bill transmitted to it by the other house for six months, or has disagreed to the amendments proposed by the Lok Sabha on a bill passed by it. Considering that the numerical strength of Lok Sabha is more than twice that of Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha tends to have a greater influence in a joint sitting of Parliament. A joint session is chaired by the Speaker of Lok Sabha. Also, because the joint session is convened by the President on advice of the government, which already has a majority in Lok Sabha, the joint session is usually convened to get bills passed through a Rajya Sabha in which the government has a minority.\\r\\nJoint sessions of Parliament are a rarity, and have been convened three times in last 69 years, for the purpose of passage of a specific legislative act, the latest time being in 2002:\\r\\nUnlike the Lok Sabha, a member of the Rajya Sabha cannot bring to the house a no-confidence motion against the government.\\r\\nIn Indian federal structure, Rajya Sabha is a representative of the States in the Union legislature (Hence the name, Council of States). Hence, Rajya Sabha is granted powers that protect the rights of States against the Union.\\r\\nThe Constitution empowers Parliament of India to make laws on the matters reserved for States (States List). However, this can only be done if Rajya Sabha first passes a resolution by two-thirds special majority granting such a power to the Union Parliament. The union government cannot make a law on a matter reserved for states without any authorisation from Rajya Sabha.\\r\\nRajya Sabha, by a two-thirds super majority can pass a resolution empowering the Government of India to create more All-India Services common to both Union and States, including a judicial service.\\r\\nSeats are allotted in proportion to the population of people of each state or union territory in such a manner that smaller states have slight advantage over more populous states.[10] In addition, smaller Union Territories, which are not States and which do not have legislatures, do not have representation in Rajya Sabha. Hence, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Chandigarh, Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli do not send any representatives to Rajya Sabha. 12 members are nominated by the President.[11][12]\\r\\nAs per the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution of India on 26 January 1950, the Rajya Sabha was to consist of 216 members of which 12 members were to be nominated by the President and the remaining 204 elected to represent the States.[12] The present strength, however, is 245 members of whom 233 are representatives of the states and union territories and 12 are nominated by the President.[12] The twelve nominated members of the Rajya Sabha are persons who are eminent in particular fields, and are well known contributors in the particular field. A few examples of such nominated persons are cricketing icon Sachin Tendulkar, former RBI Governor Bimal Jalan and famous lyricist and poet Javed Akhtar.

This is a cabinet minister - the prime minister if he is a member of the House, or another nominated minister. The Leader has a seat next to the Chairman, in the front row.\\r\\nBesides the Leader of the House, who is leading the majority, there is also a Leader of the Opposition (LOP) ÿ leading the minority parties. The function was only recognized in the Salary and Allowances of Leaders of the Opposition in Parliament Act 1977. This is commonly the leader of the largest minority party, and is recognized as such by the Chairman.\\r\\nThe following people have been the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha:\\r\\nThe Secretariat of Rajya Sabha was set up pursuant to the provisions contained in Article 98 of the Constitution. The said Article, which provides for a separate secretarial staff for each House of Parliament, reads as follows:- 98. Secretariat of Parliament - Each House of Parliament shall have a separate secretarial staff: Provided that nothing in this clause shall be construed as preventing the creation of posts common to both Houses of Parliament. (2) Parliament may by law regulate the recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to the secretarial staff of either House of Parliament.\\r\\nThe Rajya Sabha Secretariat functions under the overall guidance and control of the Chairman. The main activities of the Secretariat inter alia include the following?:\\r\\n(i) providing secretarial assistance and support to the effective functioning of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) possible to Members of Rajya Sabha; (iv) servicing the various Parliamentary Committees; (v) preparing research and reference material and bringing out various publications; (vi) recruitment of manpower in the Sabha Secretariat and attending to personnel matters; and (vii) preparing and publishing a record of the day-to-day proceedings of the Rajya Sabha and bringing out such other publications, as may be required concerning the functioning of the Rajya Sabha and its Committees. In the discharge of his constitutional and statutory responsibilities, the Chairman, Rajya Sabha is assisted by the Secretary-General, who holds the rank equivalent[16] to the Cabinet Secretary to the Government of India. The Secretary-General, in turn, is assisted by senior functionaries at the level of Secretary, Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary and other officers and staff of the Secretariat.\\r\\nRajya Sabha Television (RSTV) is a 24 hour a day, seven day a week parliamentary TV channel fully owned and operated by the Rajya Sabha. The channel is aimed at providing in-depth coverage and analysis of parliamentary affairs especially the functioning of and developments related to Rajya Sabha.

Chelsea reached the final with a 4ÿ2 win with two goals from Willian and a goal each from Eden Hazard and Nemanja Mati?.[19]\\r\\nArsenal were appearing in the final of the FA Cup for the 20th time, the club's third in four years. They had won the cup twelve times previously (in 1930, 1936, 1950, 1971, 1979, 1993, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2014 and 2015) and were beaten in the final seven times, most recently in 2001. By comparison, Chelsea were making their 12th appearance in a FA Cup final.[20] The club won the cup seven times (1970, 1997, 2000, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2012) and lost four finals. Arsenal and Chelsea had previously met 13 times in the FA Cup. Arsenal held an advantage in those meetings, winning seven of the last eight. Chelsea, however, won the last FA Cup tie, a 2ÿ1 victory in April 2009.[21] This was the second FA Cup final to feature both sides; the first was won by Arsenal in 2002.[22]\\r\\nThe most recent meeting between the two teams was a league encounter in February 2017. Chelsea beat Arsenal by three goals to one, a result which moved them 12 points clear in first position.[23] The win was significant given Chelsea lost the reverse fixture 3ÿ0 in September 2016, a \\"watershed moment\\" in their season according to BBC journalist Phil McNulty.[24] While Arsenal struggled to build momentum throughout autumn and winter, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte's tactical switch from 4ÿ3ÿ3 to 3ÿ4ÿ3 thereafter resulted in a 13-match winning run.[25][26] They won the Premier League with two matches to spare,[26] and later set a new divisional record for the most wins (30).[27] Arsenal ended the season in fifth place, their lowest placing under manager Arsne Wenger, and missed out on UEFA Champions League football for the first time in 20 years.[28] Wenger's future had been cast into doubt following a bad run of form in February and March, which saw the team lose 10ÿ2 on aggregate against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, and four of their five league matches.[29] To arrest the decline, Wenger adopted a similar tactical change to Conte, playing three defenders at the back.[30] Arsenal went on to win eight of their last nine fixtures, but Wenger admitted his team were outsiders for the final: \\"This time we are not favourites, its quite even or maybe Chelsea are ahead, so its a bit similar to what happened in the semi-final against Manchester City. Thats part of what makes it all exciting as well.\\"[31] Of his future he said, \\"It will not be my last match anyway, because I will stay, no matter what happens, in football.\\"[32]\\r\\nPaul Merson's pre-match assessment[33]\\r\\nConte described Wenger as one of the greats in football, and felt he would remain as Arsenal manager come the season's end.[34] \\"He has done a fantastic job. Sometimes in England I think you undervalue the achievement of qualifying for the Champions League. Only this season they haven't qualified for the Champions League,\\" he continued.[34] Conte reiterated the importance of his players keeping their focus and wanted Chelsea to \\"pay great attention and focus\\" to their opponents.[35] Hazard, who was playing in his first FA Cup final, was eager to win the competition: \\"For Chelsea, for such a big club like this, you need to win one, two, three trophies every season if you can. Now we have the possibility to win another trophy so all the players are ready for that. It's such a great competition for the fans.\\"[34]\\r\\nChelsea and Arsenal were expected to line up in a 3ÿ4ÿ3 formation.[36] Whereas the former club had no injury or suspension worries, Arsenal had doubts over the fitness of Petr ?ech and Shkodran Mustafi, and were already without defenders Laurent Koscielny (suspension) and Gabriel (ankle injury).[36] Per Mertesacker was expected to start; the Germany international only featured once for Arsenal's first team during the season.[37] The day before the final The Guardian reported that Wenger chose David Ospina to start in goal ahead of ?ech.[38]\\r\\nBoth clubs received an allocation of approximately 28,000 tickets.[39] For adults, these were priced S45, S65, S85 and S115, with concessions in place.[39] Chelsea supporters were situated in the west side of the ground, while Arsenal's were allocated in the east.[40] The remaining 14,000 tickets were distributed to volunteers involved in the FA's work.[39] Finalists stood to receive S900,000 minimum, the winners earned S1.8 million.[41] Security at Wembley Stadium was tightened in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing; as a security measure Arsenal cancelled a screening of the game at their ground.[42] Both clubs cancelled plans for open top bus victory parades.[43]\\r\\nSol Campbell and Eddie Newton came onto the pitch to greet the supporters and place the trophy on a plinth.[44] As they departed, the traditional Cup Final hymn, \\"Abide with Me\\" was sung by representatives of eight clubs, including Lincoln City, Guernsey, Millwall and Sutton United.[45] The teams emerged moments later led by their managers, and players were greeted by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. Soprano Emily Haig sang the national anthem and a minute's silence was then held to honour the victims of the Manchester attack.[44][45] Prince William, Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester and FA chairman Greg Clarke lay wreaths on the pitch in tribute.[44]\\r\\nDespite what was expected to be a tight affair, Arsenal dominated the early proceedings and opened the scoring with a goal from Alexis Snchez in the 4th minute, shooting past the advancing goalkeeper from six yards out with his right foot. The goal was initially flagged as offside due to Aaron Ramsey being in an offside position. After discussing with his linesman, referee Anthony Taylor overrode the decision and awarded Arsenal the goal due to Ramsey not attempting to play the ball.[46] Snchez also handled the ball in the lead up to the goal but this was not seen by the referee.[47] Arsenal then hit the post twice from close range in the first half through Aaron Ramsey and Danny Welbeck.\\r\\nIn the second half, Victor Moses received a second yellow card for diving in the penalty box in the 68th minute, leaving Chelsea with ten men. Chelsea equalised through Diego Costa in the 76th minute when he controlled the ball on his chest in the penalty area before shooting low to the left with his right foot. Three minutes later Aaron Ramsey scored for Arsenal by heading in an Olivier Giroud cross from the left from six yards out.[48]\\r\\nMan of the Match:\\r\\nAlexis Snchez (Arsenal)\\r\\nAssistant referees:[1]\\r\\nGary Beswick (Durham)\\r\\nMarc Perry (Birmingham)\\r\\nFourth official:[1]\\r\\nBobby Madley (West Yorkshire)\\r\\nFifth official:[1]\\r\\nAdam Nunn (Wiltshire)\\r\\nMatch rules[49]","input":"Who won last year's emirate fa cup?"},{"output":"Benjamin Grierson","context":" United States Army\\r\\n9th Cavalry Regiment\\r\\n10th Cavalry Regiment\\r\\n24th Infantry Regiment\\r\\nBuffalo Soldiers originally were members of the 10th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army, formed on September 21, 1866, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. This nickname was given to the Negro Cavalry by Native American tribes who fought in the Indian Wars. The term eventually became synonymous with all of the African American regiments formed in 1866:\\r\\nAlthough several African American regiments were raised during the Civil War as part of the Union Army (including the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry and the many United States Colored Troops Regiments), the \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" were established by Congress as the first peacetime all-black regiments in the regular U.S. Army.[1] On September 6, 2005, Mark Matthews, the last survivng Buffalo Soldier, died at the age of 111. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSources disagree on how the nickname \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" began. According to the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum, the name originated with the Cheyenne warriors in the winter of 1877, the actual Cheyenne translation being \\"Wild Buffalo.\\" However, writer Walter Hill documented the account of Colonel Benjamin Grierson, who founded the 10th Cavalry regiment, recalling an 1871 campaign against Comanches. Hill attributed the origin of the name to the Comanche due to Grierson's assertions. The Apache used the same term (\\"We called them 'buffalo soldiers,' because they had curly, kinky hair ... like bisons\\") a claim supported by other sources.[3][4] Some sources assert that the nickname was given out of respect for the fierce fighting ability of the 10th Cavalry.[5] Still other sources point to a combination of both legends.[6] The term Buffalo Soldiers became a generic term for all black soldiers. It is now used for U.S. Army units that trace their direct lineage back to the 9th and 10th Cavalry units, whose service earned them an honored place in U.S. history. According to activist Russell Means, they were called Buffalo Soldiers because the U.S. military created special regiments specifically used to exterminate herds of buffalo. The U.S. military, as part of their campaign in enacting genocidal strategies against American Indians throughout the plains of the continent, removed buffalo in order to cut off American Indian food supply and force them into reservations.[7]\\r\\nDuring the Civil War, the U.S. government formed regiments known as the United States Colored Troops, composed of black soldiers and Native Americans. After the war, Congress reorganized the Army and authorized the formation of two regiments of black cavalry with the designations 9th and 10th U.S. Cavalry, and four regiments of black infantry, designated the 38th, 39th, 40th, and 41st Infantry Regiments (Colored). The 38th and 41st were reorganized as the 25th Infantry Regiment, with headquarters in Jackson Barracks in New Orleans, Louisiana, in November 1869. The 39th and 40th were reorganized as the 24th Infantry Regiment, with headquarters at Fort Clark, Texas, in April 1869. All of these units were composed of black enlisted men commanded by both white and black officers. These included the first commander of the 10th Cavalry Benjamin Grierson, the first commander of the 9th Cavalry Edward Hatch, Medal of Honor recipient Louis H. Carpenter, Nicholas M. Nolan, and the first black graduate of West Point, Henry O. Flipper.\\r\\nFrom 1866 to the early 1890s, these regiments served at a variety of posts in the Southwestern United States and the Great Plains regions. They participated in most of the military campaigns in these areas and earned a distinguished record. Thirteen enlisted men and six officers from these four regiments earned the Medal of Honor during the Indian Wars. In addition to the military campaigns, the Buffalo Soldiers served a variety of roles along the frontier, from building roads to escorting the U.S. mail. On April 17, 1875, regimental headquarters for the 9th and 10th Cavalries were transferred to Fort Concho, Texas. Companies actually arrived at Fort Concho in May 1873. At various times from 1873 through 1885, Fort Concho housed 9th Cavalry companies AÿF, K, and M, 10th Cavalry companies A, DÿG, I, L, and M, 24th Infantry companies DÿG, and K, and 25th Infantry companies G and K.[8]\\r\\nIn total, 23 Buffalo Soldiers received the Medal of Honor during the Indian Wars.[9]\\r\\nA lesser known action was the 9th Cavalry's participation in the fabled Johnson County War, an 1892 land war in Johnson County, Wyoming, between small farmers and large, wealthy ranchers. It culminated in a lengthy shootout between local farmers, a band of hired killers, and a sheriff's posse. The 6th Cavalry was ordered in by President Benjamin Harrison to quell the violence and capture the band of hired killers. Soon afterward, however, the 9th Cavalry was specifically called on to replace the 6th. The 6th Cavalry was swaying under the local political and social pressures and was unable to keep the peace in the tense environment.\\r\\nThe Buffalo Soldiers responded within about two weeks from Nebraska, and moved the men to the rail town of Suggs, Wyoming, creating \\"Camp Bettens\\" despite a hostile local population. One soldier was killed and two wounded in gun battles with locals. Nevertheless, the 9th Cavalry remained in Wyoming for nearly a year to quell tensions in the area.[10][11]\\r\\nAfter most of the Indian Wars ended in the 1890s, the regiments continued to serve and participated in the 1898 SpanishÿAmerican War (including the Battle of San Juan Hill) in Cuba, where five more Medals of Honor were earned.[12][13]\\r\\nThe men of the Buffalo Soldiers were the only African Americans that fought during the war. Up to 5,000 \\"Black men\\" enlisted in volunteer regiments in the SpanishÿAmerican War.[14] Several African-American regiments of United States Volunteers were formed and nicknamed \\"Immune Regiments\\", but none of these volunteer regiments served overseas in that war.[15]\\r\\nThe Buffalo Soldiers regiments also took part in the PhilippineÿAmerican War from 1899 to 1903 and the 1916 Mexican Expedition.[12][13] In 1918, the 10th Cavalry fought at the Battle of Ambos Nogales during the First World War, where they assisted in forcing the surrender of the federal Mexican and Mexican militia forces.[12][13][16]\\r\\nBuffalo soldiers fought in the last engagement of the Indian Wars, the small Battle of Bear Valley in southern Arizona which occurred in 1918 between U.S. cavalry and Yaqui natives.[12][13]\\r\\nAnother little-known contribution of the Buffalo Soldiers involved eight troops of the 9th Cavalry Regiment and one company of the 24th Infantry Regiment who served in California's Sierra Nevada as some of the first national park rangers. In 1899, Buffalo Soldiers from Company H, 24th Infantry Regiment briefly served in Yosemite National Park, Sequoia National Park, and General Grant (Kings Canyon) National Parks.[17]\\r\\nU.S. Army regiments had been serving in these national parks since 1891, but until 1899, the soldiers serving were white. Beginning in 1899, and continuing in 1903 and 1904, African American regiments served during the summer in the second- and third-oldest national parks in the United States (Sequoia and Yosemite). Because these soldiers served before the National Park Service was created (1916), they were \\"park rangers\\" before the term was coined.\\r\\nA lasting legacy of the soldiers as park rangers is the Ranger hat (popularly known as the Smokey Bear hat). Although not officially adopted by the Army until 1911, the distinctive hat crease, called a Montana peak, (or pinch) can be seen being worn by several of the Buffalo Soldiers in park photographs dating back to 1899. Soldiers serving in the SpanishÿAmerican War began to recrease the Stetson hat with a Montana \\"pinch\\" to better shed water from the torrential tropical rains. Many retained that distinctive crease upon their return to the U.S. The park photographs, in all likelihood, show Buffalo Soldiers who were veterans from that 1898 war.\\r\\nOne particular Buffalo Soldier stands out in history: Captain Charles Young, who served with Troop \\"I\\", 9th Cavalry Regiment in Sequoia National Park during the summer of 1903. Charles Young was the third African American to graduate from the United States Military Academy. At the time of his death, he was the highest-ranking African American in the U.S. military. He made history in Sequoia National Park in 1903 by becoming Acting Military Superintendent of Sequoia and General Grant National Parks. Charles Young was also the first African American superintendent of a national park. During Young's tenure in the park, he named a giant sequoia for Booker T. Washington. Recently, another giant sequoia in Giant Forest was named in Captain Young's honor. Some of Young's descendants were in attendance at the ceremony.[18]\\r\\nIn 1903, 9th Cavalrymen in Sequoia built the first trail to the top of Mount Whitney, the highest mountain in the contiguous United States. They also built the first wagon road into Sequoia's Giant Forest, the most famous grove of giant sequoia trees in Sequoia National Park.\\r\\nIn 1904, 9th Cavalrymen in Yosemite built an arboretum on the South Fork of the Merced River in the southern section of the park. This arboretum had pathways and benches, and some plants were identified in both English and Latin. Yosemite's arboretum is considered to be the first museum in the National Park System. The NPS cites a 1904 report, where Yosemite superintentent (Lt. Col.) John Bigelow, Jr. declared the arboretum \\"To provide a great museum of nature for the general public free of cost ...\\" Unfortunately, the forces of developers, miners, and greed cut the boundaries of Yosemite in 1905 and the arboretum was nearly destroyed.[19]\\r\\nIn the Sierra Nevada, the Buffalo Soldiers regularly endured long days in the saddle, slim rations, racism, and separation from family and friends. As military stewards, the African American cavalry and infantry regiments protected the national parks from illegal grazing, poaching, timber thieves, and forest fires. Yosemite Park Ranger Shelton Johnson researched and interpreted the history in an attempt to recover and celebrate the contributions of the Buffalo Soldiers of the Sierra Nevada.[20]\\r\\nOn March 23, 1907, the United States Military Academy Detachment of Cavalry was changed to a \\"colored\\" unit. This had been a long time coming. It had been proposed in 1897 at the \\"Cavalry and Light Artillery School\\" at Fort Riley, Kansas that West Point cadets learn their riding skills from the black noncommissioned officers who were considered the best. The 100-man detachment from the 9th Cavalry served to teach future officers at West Point riding instruction, mounted drill, and tactics until 1947.[21]\\r\\nThe Buffalo Soldiers were often confronted with racial prejudice from other members of the U.S. Army. Civilians in the areas where the soldiers were stationed occasionally reacted to them with violence. Buffalo Soldiers were attacked during racial disturbances in Rio Grande City, Texas, in 1899,[22] Brownsville, Texas, in 1906,[23] and Houston, Texas, in 1917.[24][25]\\r\\nGeneral of the Armies John J. Pershing is a controversial figure regarding the Buffalo Soldiers. He served with the 10th Cavalry Regiment from October 1895 to May 1897. He served again with them for under six months in Cuba. Because he saw them as real soldiers, he was looked down upon and called \\"Nigger Jack\\" by white cadets and officers at West Point. Only later during the SpanishÿAmerican War did the press change that insulting term to \\"Black Jack.\\"[26] During World War I, he bowed to the racial policies of President Woodrow Wilson, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, and the southern Democratic Party with its \\"separate but equal\\" philosophy. For the first time in American history, Pershing allowed American soldiers (African-Americans) to be under the command of a foreign power.\\r\\nPershing started as a first lieutenant when he took command of a troop of the 10th Cavalry in October 1895.[27]\\r\\nIn 1897, Pershing became an instructor at West Point, where he joined the tactical staff. While there, cadets upset over Pershing's harsh treatment and high standards took to calling him \\"Nigger Jack,\\" in reference to his service with the 10th Cavalry Regiment.[27]\\r\\nThis was softened (or sanitized) to the more euphonic \\"Black Jack\\" by reporters covering Pershing during World War I.[28] At the start of the SpanishÿAmerican War, First Lieutenant Pershing was offered a brevet rank and commissioned a major of volunteers on August 26, 1898. He fought with the 10th Cavalry (Buffalo Soldiers) on Kettle and San Juan Hills in Cuba and was cited for gallantry.[27]\\r\\nDuring World War I, Pershing was the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) on the Western Front. He had a full delegation of authority from President Wilson and Secretary of War Baker. Baker, cognizant of the endless problems of domestic and allied political involvement in military decision-making in wartime, gave Pershing unmatched authority to run his command as he saw fit. In turn, Pershing exercised his prerogative carefully, not engaging in issues that might distract or diminish his command. While earlier a champion of the African-American soldier, he did not defend their full participation on the battlefield, bowing to widespread racial attitudes among white Americans, plus Wilson's reactionary racial views and the political debts he owed to southern \\"separate but equal\\" Democratic lawmakers.[26]\\r\\nThe outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 against the long-time rule of President Porfirio Daz initiated a decade-long period of high-intensity military conflict along the U.S.ÿMexico border as different political/military factions in Mexico fought for power. The access to arms and customs duties from Mexican communities along the U.S.ÿMexico boundary made border towns like Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Ojinaga, Chihuahua, and Nogales, Sonora, important strategic assets. As the various belligerents in Mexico vied for power, the U.S. Army, including the Buffalo Soldier units, was dispatched to the border to maintain security. The Buffalo Soldiers played a key role in U.S.ÿMexico relations as the maelstrom that followed the ouster of Daz and the assassination of his successor Francisco Madero intensified.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy late 1915, the political faction led by Venustiano Carranza received diplomatic recognition from the U.S. government as the legitimate ruling force in Mexico. Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa, who had previously courted U.S. recognition and thus felt betrayed, then attacked the rural community of Columbus, New Mexico, directly leading to further border tensions as U.S. President Woodrow Wilson unilaterally dispatched the Punitive Expedition into Chihuahua, Mexico, under General John Pershing to apprehend or kill Villa. The 9th and 10th cavalries were deployed to Mexico along with the rest of Pershing's units. Although the manhunt against Villa was unsuccessful, small-scale confrontations in the communities of Parral and Carrizal nearly brought about a war between Mexico and the United States in the summer of 1916. Tensions cooled through diplomacy as the captured Buffalo Soldiers from Carrizal were released. Despite the public outrage over Villa's Columbus raid, Wilson and his cabinet felt that the U.S.'s attention ought to be centered on Germany and World War I, not the apprehension of the \\"Centauro del Norte.\\" The Punitive Expedition exited Mexico in early 1917, just before the U.S. declaration of war against Germany in April 1917.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Buffalo Soldiers did not participate with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) during World War I, but experienced noncommissioned officers were provided to other segregated Black units for combat servicesuch as the 317th Engineer Battalion. The soldiers of the 92nd and the 93rd infantry divisions were the first Americans to fight in France. The four regiments of the 93rd fought under French command for the duration of the war.\\r\\nOn August 27, 1918, the 10th Cavalry supported the 35th Infantry Regiment in a border skirmish in the border towns of Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, between U.S. military forces, Mexican Federal troops, and armed Mexican civilians (militia) in the Battle of Ambos Nogales. This was the only incident in which German military advisers allegedly fought along with Mexican soldiers against United States soldiers on North America soil during World War I.[13][16]\\r\\nThe 35th Infantry Regiment was stationed at Nogales, Arizona, on August 27, 1918, when at about 4:10?pm, a gun battle erupted unintentionally when a Mexican civilian attempted to pass through the border, back to Mexico, without being interrogated at the U.S. Customs house. After the initial shooting, reinforcements from both sides rushed to the border. On the Mexican side, the majority of the belligerents were angry civilians upset with the killings of Mexican border crossers by the U.S. Army along the vaguely defined border between the two cities during the previous year (the U.S. Border Patrol did not exist until 1924). For the Americans, the reinforcements were the 10th Cavalry, off-duty 35th Regimental soldiers, and militia. Hostilities quickly escalated, and several soldiers were killed, and others wounded on both sides, including the mayor of Nogales, Sonora, Felix B. Pe?aloza (killed when waving a white truce flag/handkerchief with his cane). A cease-fire was arranged later after the US forces took the heights south of Nogales, Arizona.[13][16][29]\\r\\nDue in part to the heightened hysteria caused by World War I, allegations surfaced that German agents fomented this violence and died fighting alongside the Mexican troops they led. U.S. newspaper reports in Nogales before the August 27, 1918, battle documented the departure of part of the Mexican garrison in Nogales, Sonora, to points south that August in an attempt to quell armed political rebels.[30][31][32]\\r\\nDespite the Battle of Ambos Nogales controversy, the presence of the Buffalo Soldiers in the community left a significant impact on the border town. The famed jazz musician Charles Mingus was born in the Camp Stephen Little military base in Nogales in 1922, son of a Buffalo Soldier.[33] The African American population, centered on the stationing of Buffalo Soldiers such as the 25th Infantry in Nogales, was a significant factor in the community, though they often faced racial discrimination in the binational border community in addition to racial segregation at the elementary-school level in Nogales's Grand Avenue/Frank Reed School (a school reserved for Black children).[34] The redeployment of the Buffalo Soldiers to other areas and the closure of Camp Little in 1933 initiated the decline of the African American community in Nogales.\\r\\nBefore World War II, the black 25th Infantry Regiment was based at Ft Huachuca. During the war, Ft Huachuca served as the home base of the Black 92nd and 93rd Infantry Divisions. The 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments were mostly disbanded, and the soldiers were moved into service-oriented units, along with the entire 2nd Cavalry Division. The 92nd Infantry Division, the \\"Buffalo Division,\\" served in combat during the Italian campaign. The 93rd Infantry Divisionincluding the 25th Infantry Regimentserved in the Pacific theater.[35] Separately, independent Black artillery, tank, and tank destroyer battalions, as well as quartermaster and support battalions served in World War II. All of these units to a degree carried out the traditions of the Buffalo Soldiers.\\r\\nDespite some official resistance and administrative barriers, Black airmen were trained and played a part in the air war in Europe, gaining a reputation for skill and bravery (see Tuskegee Airmen). In early 1945, after the Battle of the Bulge, American forces in Europe experienced a shortage of combat troops, so the embargo on using black soldiers in combat units was relaxed. The American Military History says:\\r\\nFaced with a shortage of infantry replacements during the enemy's counteroffensive, General Eisenhower offered black soldiers in service units an opportunity to volunteer for duty with the infantry. More than 4,500 responded, many taking reductions in grade to meet specified requirements. The 6th Army Group formed these men into provisional companies, while the 12th Army Group employed them as an additional platoon in existing rifle companies. The excellent record established by these volunteers, particularly those serving as platoons, presaged major postwar changes in the traditional approach to employing Negro troops.\\r\\nThe 24th Infantry Regiment saw combat during the Korean War and was the last segregated regiment to engage in combat. The 24th was deactivated in 1951, and its soldiers were integrated into other units in Korea. On December 12, 1951, the last Buffalo Soldier units, the 27th Cavalry and the 28th (Horse) Cavalry, were disbanded. The 28th Cavalry was inactivated at Assi-Okba, Algeria, in April 1944 in North Africa, and marked the end of the regiment.[36]\\r\\nMonuments to the Buffalo Soldiers are in Kansas at Fort Leavenworth and Junction City.[37] Then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, who initiated the project to get a statue to honor the Buffalo Soldiers when he was posted as a brigadier general to Fort Leavenworth, was guest speaker for the unveiling of the Fort Leavenworth monument in July 1992.\\r\\nIn the last decade, the employment of the Buffalo Soldiers by the United States Army in the Indian Wars has led some to call for the critical reappraisal of the African American regiments. In this viewpoint[38] the Buffalo Soldiers were used as mere shock troops or accessories to the forcefully expansionist goals of the U.S. government at the expense of the Native Americans and other minorities.[38][39]\\r\\nFort Concho\\r\\nFort Clark\\r\\nFort McKavett\\r\\nFort Davis National Historic Site\\r\\nBuffalo Soldiers serving at Fort Davis\\r\\nThis list is of the officers and men who received the Medal of Honor due to service with the original units called \\"Buffalo Soldiers.\\"\\r\\nThis list is of other notable African Americans who served in the original units as \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" from 1866 to 1918.","input":"Who led an all black american cavalry unit?"},{"output":"Ikebana","context":"Ikebana (, \\"living flowers\\") is the Japanese art of flower arrangement.[1][2] It is also known as Kad (?A, \\"way of flowers\\"). The tradition dates back to the 7th?century when floral offerings were made at altars. Later, they were placed in the tokonoma (alcove) of a home. Ikebana reached its first zenith in the 16th?century under the influence of Buddhist teamasters and has grown over the centuries, with over 1,000 different schools in Japan and abroad.\\r\\nKad is counted as one of the three classical Japanese arts of refinement, along with kd for incense appreciation and chad for tea and the tea ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Ikebana\\" is from the Japanese ikeru (, \\"keep alive, arrange flowers, living\\") and hana (, \\"flower\\"). Possible translations include \\"giving life to flowers\\" and \\"arranging flowers\\".[3]\\r\\nPlants play an important role in the native Shinto religion. Yorishiro are objects that divine spirits are summoned to. Evergreen plants such as kadomatsu are a traditional decoration of the New Year placed in pairs in front of homes to welcome ancestral spirits or kami of the harvest.[4]\\r\\nThe pastime of viewing plants and appreciating flowers throughout the four seasons was established in Japan early on through the aristocracy. Waka poetry anthologies such as the Man'ysh and Kokin Wakash from the Heian period (794ÿ1185) included many poems on the topic of flowers.[4] During this time, Buddhism was introduced to Japan starting in the 6th?century through China and Korea. Offering flowers at Buddhist altars became common. Although the lotus is widely used in India where Buddhism originated, in Japan other native flowers for each season were selected for this purpose.[4] While in China the Buddhist priests were the first instructors of flower arrangement, in Japan they only introduced its crudest elements. For a long time the art had no meaning and was merely the placing in vases, without system, of the flowers to be used as temple offerings and before ancestral shrines. The first flower arrangements worked out with a system were known as shin-no-hana, meaning \\"central flower arrangement\\". A huge branch of pine or cryptomeria stood in the middle, and around the tree were placed three or five seasonable flowers. These branches and stems were put in vases in upright positions without attempt at artificial curves. Generally symmetrical in form, the arrangements appeared in Japanese religious pictures of the 14th?century. It was the first attempt to represent natural scenery. The large tree in the center represented distant scenery, plum or cherry blossoms middle distance, and little flowering plants the foreground. The lines of these arrangements were known as centre and sub-centre.[5] Later on, among other types of Buddhist offering, placing mitsu-gusoku became popular in the Kamakura (1185ÿ1333) and Nanboku-ch periods (1336ÿ1392).[4] Various Buddhist scriptures have been named after flowers such as the Kegon-kyo (Flower Garland Sutra) and Hokke-kyo (Lotus Sutra). The Chj-jinbutsu-giga (Scroll of Frolicking Animals and Humans) depicts lotus being offered by a monk(ey) in front of a frog mimicking the Buddha.[4][6]\\r\\nWith the development of the shoin-zukuri architectural style starting in the Muromachi period (1336ÿ1573), kakemono (scroll pictures) and containers could be suitable displayed as art objects in the oshiita, a precursor to the tokonoma alcove, and the chigaidana, two-leveled shelves. Also displayed in these spaces were flower arrangements in vases that influenced the interior decorations, which became simpler and more exquisite.[5] This style of decoration was called zashiki kazari (K?).[7] The set of three ceremonial objects at the Buddhist altar called mitsugusoku consisted of candles lit in holders, a censer, and flowers in a vase. The flowers in the vase were arranged in the earliest style called tatebana or tatehana (ٺ, \\"standing flowers\\"), and were composed of shin (motoki) and shitakusa.[8] Recent historical research now indicates that the practice of tatebana[9] derived from a combination of belief systems, including Buddhist, and the Shinto yorishiro belief is most likely the origin of the Japanese practice of ikebana that we know today. Together they form the basis for the original purely Japanese derivation of the practice of ikebana.\\r\\nThe art developed very slowly, and the many schools did not come into existence until the end of the 15th?century following the period of the civil war. The eighth shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa (1436ÿ1490), was a patron of the arts and the greatest promoter of cha-no-yu, the ceremonial tea, and ikebana flower arrangement. Yoshimasa finally abdicated the office in order to devote his time to the fine arts. It was he who said that flowers offered on all ceremonial occasions and placed as offerings before the gods should not be offered loosely, but should represent time and thought. Rules then commenced to be formulated.[5]\\r\\nIt is to the celebrated painter Sami, a contemporary and friend of Yoshimasa, who conceived the idea of representing the three elements of heaven, human, and earth, from which have grown the principles of the arrangements used today. It was at Yoshimasa's Silver Pavilion in Kyoto, where the art of cha-no-yu, the tea ceremony, and ko-awase, the incense ceremony, may be said to have been evolved that the art of ikebana received its great development.[5]\\r\\nArtists of the Kan school such as Sessh Ty (1420ÿ1506), Sesson, Kan Masanobu, Kan Motonobu (1476ÿ1559), and Shugetsu of the 16th?century were lovers of nature, so that ikebana advanced in this period a step further than temple and room decoration and commenced in a rudimentary way to consider natural beauty in floral arrangement. At this time ikebana was known as rikka.[5]\\r\\nThis same age conceived another form called nageirebana. Rikka and nageirebana are the two branches into which ikebana has been divided. Popularity of the two styles vacillated between these two for centuries. In the beginning, rikka was stiff, formal, and more decorative while nageirebana was simpler and more natural.[5]\\r\\nAlthough nageirebana began to come into favour in the Higashiyama period, rikka was still preferred, and nageirebana did not truly gain popularity until the Momoyama period, about a hundred years after Ashikaga Yoshimasa. It was at this period that cha-no-yu reached its highest development and strongly influenced the flower art. A practitioner of tea was most probably also a follower of ikebana.[5]\\r\\nAfter a long, hard struggle for existence as a dependent of rikka, nageirebana branched off and became independent and very popular. It was welcomed by the people of the 16th?century for its freedom of line and natural beauty. So, while these two branches both started in the Higashiyama period, rikka better represents the taste of that time, and nageirebana more reflects the taste of the Momoyama period. Rikka lost some of its popularity in the Momoyama period, but in the first part of the Edo period (1603ÿ1668) it was revived and became more popular than ever before.[5] In the Higashiyama period rikka had been used only as room decorations on ceremonial occasions, but now was followed as a fine art and looked upon as an accomplishment and pastime of the upper classes.[5]\\r\\nIkebana has always been considered a dignified accomplishment. All of Japan's most celebrated generals have been masters of this art, finding that it calmed their minds and made clear their decisions for the field of action. That warriors like Hideyoshi and Yoshimasa, two of Japan's most famous generals, found benefit in the practise of ikebana shows that it is valuable training, even for the masculine mind. Rikka reached its greatest popularity during the Genroku era.[5]\\r\\nMany works on ikebana were published in the centuries from the Ken'ei (1206ÿ1207) to the Genroku (1668ÿ1704) eras, all founded on Sami's idea of the three elements. The first of these works, published in the early part of the Ken'ei era, was a book called Sendensh, and there were many others, but none of much value to the student of flower arrangement. They gave few rules and their chief object seemed to be to withhold all information. Although of little instructional value, these books were fully illustrated, thus documenting the gradual progress of the art. During the early Edo period (17th century) publications in Japan's developed rapidly. Books about ikebana were published in succession. During this time the Sendensh (?m?) was published and is the oldest published manual. The Kawari Kaden Hisho (???) came out in Kanbun 1 (1661). This was carefully written and very instructive, with rules and principles freely given.[5] In the Edo period, it was the second publication after the Sendensh. Although the text is similar to the contents of commentaries of the Muromachi period, the illustrations showed how to enjoy Tachibana. Tachibana had spread from monks to warriors and further on to townspeople. The Kokon Rikka-shu (̤ٺĦ) was the oldest published works on rikka in Kanbun 12 (1672). The Kokon Rikka-taizen (̤ٺ??), published in Tenna 3 (1683), was the most famous rikka manual. The Rikka Imay Sugata (?A?r?q?) came out Jky 5 (1688).\\r\\nIn the Ken'ei era, rikka was simple and natural, with no extreme curves in the arrangement, but in the Genroku era, the lines became complicated and the forms pattern-like. This was an age of utmost elegance. All the fine arts were highly developed, above all pattern-printing for fabrics and decoration. In the latter part of the 17th?century, Korin, the famous lacquer artist and essentially a creator of exquisite designs, strongly influenced ikebana. In this period, the combination of a pattern or design with lines that followed the natural growth of the plant produced the most pleasing and graceful results.[5]\\r\\nIt was in the latter part of the 17th?century that ikebana was most practised and reached its highest degree of perfection as an art. Still, there were occasional departures into unnatural curves and artificialities that caused a shift, and nageirebana again revived. Until then only one branch of ikebana had been taught at a time, following the taste of the day, but now rival teachers in both rikka and nageirebana existed.[5]\\r\\nRikka reached its greatest popularity in the Genroku era, and then commenced its decline. From the decline of rikka, nageirebana, the origin of the present ikebana, grew in power and popularity. From this time on, it ceased to be called nageirebana and took the name of ikebana. In the Tenmei era (1781ÿ1789) nageirebana, or ikebana, advanced rapidly in favour and developed great beauty of line. The exponents of the art not only studied nature freely, but combined this knowledge with that of rikka, the result bringing ikebana to a very perfect state of development. After the Tenmei era, the purest and best taste in ikebana began to diminish, and a formal and artificial form of arrangement came into existence. This is the present form, which has a fixed rule or model known as heaven, human, and earth.[5]\\r\\nThe most popular schools of today, including Ikenob, Ensh-ry, Mish-ry, among others, adhere to these principles, but there are in Tokyo and Kyoto many masters of ikebana who teach the simpler forms of Ko-ry, and Ko-Shin-ry of the Genroku and Tenmei eras.[5]\\r\\nThe oldest international organization, Ikebana International, was founded in 1956.[10] Her Imperial Highness Princess Takamado is the honourary president.[11]\\r\\nFollowers and practitioners of kad, from pupil to teacher, are known as kadka (?Aģ). A kad teacher is called sensei (). The term comes from sen or saki (before) and sei (life)?ÿ i.e. one who has preceded you. Noted Japanese who practiced it include Junichi Kakizaki, Mokichi Okada, and Yuki Tsuji. Tsuji was at a March 2015 TEDx in Shimizu, Shizuoka, where he elaborated on the relationship of ikebana to beauty.[12]\\r\\nAnother practitioner is the Hollywood actress Marcia Gay Harden, who started when she was living in Japan as a child.[13] She has published a book about it with her works.[14]\\r\\nThere are over a 1,000 different types of schools of ikebana throughout the world today. A school is normally headed by an iemoto, oftentimes passed down within a family from one generation to the next. Some of the most historic and well-known schools are:[15]\\r\\nIkenob goes back to the 700s CE of the Heian period and is considered the oldest school. This school marks its beginnings from the construction of the Rokkaku-d in Kyoto, the second oldest Buddhist temple in Japan. It was built in 587 by Prince Shtoku, who had camped near a pond in what is now central Kyoto, and enshrined a small statue of her. During the 13th?century, Ono-no-Imoko, an official state emissary, brought the practice of placing Buddhist flowers on an altar from China. He became a priest at the temple and spent the rest of his days practicing flower arranging. The original priests of the temple lived by the side of the pond, for which the Japanese word is 'Ike' \\"\\", and the word 'B' \\"\\", meaning priest, connected by the possessive particle 'no' 켰 gives the word 'Ikenob' \\"\\", \\"priest of the lake\\". The name Ikenob, granted by the emperor, became attached to the priests there who specialized in altar arrangements.\\r\\nIkenob is the only school that does not have the ending -ry in its name, as it is considered the original school. The first systematized classical styles, including rikka, started in the middle of the 15th?century. The first students and teachers were Ikenob Buddhist priests and members of the Buddhist community. As time passed, other schools emerged, styles changed, and ikebana became a custom among the whole of Japanese society.[16]\\r\\nand many others.\\r\\nOther schools include Banmi Shofu-ry, founded in 1962 by Bessie \\"Yoneko Banmi\\" Fooks, and Kaden-ry, founded by Kikuto Sakagawa in 1987 based on the Ikenobo school.\\r\\nSince flower arrangement entered Japan from China with Buddhism, it naturally was imbued with Chinese and Buddhist philosophy. The Buddhist desire to preserve life lies at the root of the whole subject and has created most of the rules of flower arrangement, controlling also the shapes of the flower vases, which are so formed as to help to prolong the life of the flowers. So much thought and time would never have been given to preservatives had not this desire predominated in all their floral offerings.[17]\\r\\nThe idea of good and evil fortune governs both the selection of material and the form of arrangement. The concept of hanakotoba (?~) is the Japanese form of the language of flowers. In this practice, plants are given codes and passwords. Physiological effects and action under the color of the flowers, put into words from the impressions of nature and the presence of thorns with the height of tall plants, flowers and garlands of flowers through the various types. These are meant to convey emotion and communicate directly to the recipient or viewer without needing the use of words. The colours of some flowers are considered unlucky. Red flowers, which are used at funerals, are undesirable not only for that reason but also because red is supposed to suggest the red flames of a fire. An odd number of flowers is lucky, while even numbers are unlucky and therefore undesirable, and never used in flower arrangements. With the odd numbers one avoids symmetry and equal balance, which are actually seldom found in nature, and which from the Japanese standpoint are never attractive in art of any description.\\r\\nMore than simply putting flowers in a container, ikebana is a disciplined art form in which nature and humanity are brought together. Contrary to the idea of a particolored or multicolored arrangement of blossoms, ikebana often emphasizes other areas of the plant, such as its stems and leaves, and puts emphasis on shape, line, and form. Though ikebana is an expression of creativity, certain rules govern its form. The artist's intention behind each arrangement is shown through a piece's color combinations, natural shapes, graceful lines, and the implied meaning of the arrangement.\\r\\nAnother common but not exclusive aspect present in ikebana is its employment of minimalism. Some arrangements may consist of only a minimal number of blooms interspersed among stalks and leaves. The structure of some Japanese flower arrangements is based on a scalene triangle delineated by three main points, usually twigs, considered in some schools to symbolize heaven, human, and earth, or sun, moon, and earth.[17] Use of these terms is limited to certain schools and is not customary in more traditional schools. A notable exception is the traditional rikka form, which follows other precepts. The container can be a key element of the composition, and various styles of pottery may be used in their construction. In some schools the container is only regarded as a vessel to hold water and should be subordinate to the arrangement.\\r\\nConsideration of the vase as being something more than a mere holder of the flowers is purely Japanese. They think of the surface of the water, which they always expose, as the surface of earth from which the group springs. This aids in creating the effect of representing a complete plant growing as nearly as possible in its natural conditions.[17]\\r\\nThe Japanese give an expression of the seasons in their floral arrangements, grouping the flowers differently according to the time of the year. For example, in the month of March, when high winds prevail, the unusual curves of the branches convey at once the impression of strong winds. In summer the Japanese rejoice in the low, broad receptacles, where the visually predominating water produces a cooler and more refreshing arrangement than those in upright vases.[17]\\r\\nThere is no occasion which cannot be suggested by the manner in which the flowers are arranged.[17] It might seem strange to us to have our departure from home announced by an unusual arrangement of flowers. Yet hundreds of ordinary occurrences are heralded by charming flower compositions. So many Japanese poets have sung of the willow, comparing its very long branches with long life, happy married life, etc., that it is frequently used for many celebrations and is a great favorite for an arrangement made at parting, the length of branch insuring a safe return from the longest journey, especially if one branch is made to form a complete circle.[17]\\r\\nFor a house-warming, white flowers are used, as they suggest water to quench a fire, fire being their constant dread, as in the construction of many houses everything but the roof is flammable. Red flowers suggest fire, so are avoided on such occasions. To celebrate an inheritance all kinds of evergreens or chrysanthemums may be used, or any flowers which are long-lived, to convey the idea that the wealth or possessions may remain forever.[17]\\r\\nThere are appropriate arrangements for all felicitous occasions, as well as for sad ones. An offering at death should be of white flowers, with some dead leaves and branches, so arranged as to express peace. All gifts of flowers must be in bud, so that the person to whom they are sent may have the pleasure of seeing them open?ÿ quite a contrast to the present Western idea of everything being forced to perfection before leaving the florist.[17]\\r\\nThe spiritual aspect of kad is considered very important to its practitioners. Some practitioners feel silence is needed while making ikebana while others feel this is not necessary. It is a time to appreciate things in nature that people often overlook because of their busy lives. It is believed that one becomes more patient and tolerant of differences, not only in nature, but also in general. Kad can inspire one to identify with beauty in all art forms. This is also a time when one feels close to nature, which provides relaxation for the mind, body, and soul.\\r\\nPatterns and styles evolved, and by the late 15th?century arrangements were common enough to be appreciated by ordinary people and not only by the imperial family and its retainers.\\r\\nIkebana in the beginning was very simple, constructed from only a very few stems of flowers and evergreen branches. This first form of ikebana is called kuge (?A).\\r\\nStyles of ikebana changed in the late 15th?century and transformed into an art form with fixed instructions. Books were written about it, \\"Sedensho\\" being the oldest one, covering the years 1443 to 1536. Ikebana became a major part of traditional festivals, and exhibitions were occasionally held.\\r\\nThe first styles were characterized by a tall, upright central stem accompanied by two shorter stems. During the Momoyama period, 1560ÿ1600, splendid castles were constructed. Noblemen and royal retainers made large decorative rikka floral arrangements that were considered appropriate decoration for castles.\\r\\nWhen the tea ceremony emerged, another style was introduced for tea ceremony rooms called chabana. This style is the opposite of the Momoyama style and emphasizes rustic simplicity. Chabana is not considered a style of ikebana but is separate. The simplicity of chabana in turn helped create the nageirebana or \\"thrown-in\\" style.\\r\\nTraditional Shka\\r\\nNageire of the Banmi Shofu-ry school\\r\\nMoribana kseitai (hidarigatte) of the Saga Gory school\\r\\nJiyka freestyle arrangement\\r\\nThe receptacles used in flower arranging come in a large variety. They are traditionally considered not only beautiful in form, material, and design but are made to suit the use to which they will be put, so that a flower can always be placed in an appropriate receptacle, and probably in one especially designed for that particular sort of flower.[23]\\r\\nThe thing the Japanese most seek in a vase's shape is what will best prolong the life of flowers. For this reason, vases are wide open at the mouth, for, unlike in Western flower arranging, they do not depend upon the vase itself to hold flowers in position, believing that the oxygen entering through the neck opening is as necessary to the plant as the oxygen it receives directly from the water; thus, the water remains sweet much longer than in small-necked vases.[23]\\r\\nThere are many ideas connected with these receptacles. For instance, hanging vases came into use through the idea that flowers presented by an esteemed friend should not be placed where they could be looked down upon, so they were raised and hung. In hanging bamboo vases, the large, round surface on top is supposed to represent the moon, and the hole for the nail a star. The cut, or opening, below the top is called fukumuki, the \\"wind drawing through a place\\".[23]\\r\\nBesides offering variety in the form of receptacles, the low, flat vases, more used in summer than winter, make it possible to arrange plants of bulbous and water growth in natural positions.[23]\\r\\nAs for the color of the vases, the soft pastel shades are common, and bronze vases are especially popular. To the Japanese, the color bronze seems most like mother earth, and therefore best suited to enhance the beauty of flowers.[23]\\r\\nBamboo, in its simplicity of line and neutral color, makes a charming vase, but one of solid bamboo is not practical in some countries outside of Japan, where the dryness of the weather causes it to split. Baskets made from bamboo reeds, with their soft brown shades, provide a pleasing contrast to the varied tints of the flowers, and are practical in any climate.[23]\\r\\nNot to be overlooked is the tiny hanging vase found in the simple peasant home?ÿ some curious root picked up at no cost and fashioned into a shape suitable to hold a single flower or vine. Such vases can be made with little effort by anyone and can find place nearly anywhere.[23]\\r\\nHanging Moon and Hooked Vase\\r\\nIncoming or Boat of Good Fortune and Standard Arrangement\\r\\nIkebana is shown on television and taught in schools. An example of a television show that involves ikebana is Seikei Bijin (Artificial Beauty). The story incorporates the importance of natural beauty. It was also mentioned in We Love Katamari for PS2.\\r\\nIn 1957 the film director and grand master of the Sgetsu-ry Hiroshi Teshigahara made the movie titled Ikebana, which describes his school.[24] Flower and Sword, released in 2017, tells the story of the development of ikebana during the Sengoku period under the rule of the regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the 16th?century. It was directed by Tetsuo Shinohara, and was based on a novel by Tadashi Onitsuka. It stars Kamejiro Ichikawa as Lord Hideyoshi, Mansai Nomura as the monk Senko Ikenobo, and Koichi Sato as Sen no Rikyu.[25] Masters and their assistants of the Ikenobo school were involved in creating the various rikka, shoka, and suna-no-mono arrangements for the movie.[26] Of particular note is a very large suna-no-mono arrangement that was recreated based on a historic piece arranged in the Maeda clan residence in Bunroku 3 (1594)[27] that took 14 people ten days to make and measured 3.5?m (11?ft) in height and 7.2?m (24?ft) in length.[26][28][29][30]","input":"What is the art of japanese flower arrangement called?"},{"output":"Millicent Patrick","context":"Creature from the Black Lagoon is a 1954 American black-and-white 3D monster horror film from Universal-International, produced by William Alland, directed by Jack Arnold, that stars Richard Carlson, Julia Adams, Richard Denning, Antonio Moreno, and Whit Bissell. The Creature was played by Ben Chapman on land and by Ricou Browning underwater. The film premiered in Detroit on February 12 and was released on a regional basis, opening on various dates.[1]\\r\\nCreature from the Black Lagoon was filmed in 3D and originally projected by the polarized light method. The audience wore viewers with gray polarizing filters, similar to the viewers most commonly used today. Because the brief 1950s 3D film fad had peaked in mid-1953 and was fading fast in early 1954, many audiences actually saw the film \\"flat\\", in 2D. Typically, the film was shown in 3D in large downtown theaters and flat in smaller neighborhood theaters. In 1975 Creature from the Black Lagoon was re-released to theaters in the inferior red-and-blue-glasses anaglyph 3D format, which was also used for a 1980 home video release on Beta and VHS videocassettes.[1]\\r\\nFor marketing reasons, a comedic short TV special was aired prior to the film's release titled Abbott and Costello Meet the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Ben Chapman reprised his role as the Gill-Man for the program.[citation needed]\\r\\nCreature from the Black Lagoon generated two sequels: Revenge of the Creature (1955), which was also filmed and released in 3D in hopes of reviving the format, and The Creature Walks Among Us (1956), filmed in 2D. The creature, also known as the Gill-man, is usually counted among the classic Universal Monsters.[citation needed]\\r\\nA geology expedition in the Amazon uncovers fossilized evidence (a skeletal hand with webbed fingers) from the Devonian period that provides a direct link between land and sea animals. Expedition leader Dr. Carl Maia (Antonio Moreno) orders his two assistants to stay in camp while he visits his friend and former student, ichthyologist Dr. David Reed (Richard Carlson).\\r\\nSoon after Dr. Maia leaves camp, a piscine amphibious humanoid, a living member of the same species from which the fossil originated, becomes curious about the expedition's camp. When its sudden appearance frightens the assistants, they panic and attack, and in response the enraged creature kills them both.\\r\\nDr. Reed works at an aquarium in California, but more recently he has been a guest at Maia's marine biology institute in Brazil. Reed persuades his boss, the financially minded Dr. Mark Williams (Richard Denning), to fund a return expedition to the Amazon to look for the remainder of the skeleton.\\r\\nThe group goes aboard the tramp steamer Rita, captained by crusty Lucas (Nestor Paiva). The expedition consists of David, Carl, and Mark, as well as Reed's girlfriend and colleague, Kay Lawrence (Julie Adams), and another scientist, Dr. Edwin Thompson (Whit Bissell). When they arrive at the camp, they discover that Maia's assistants have been killed while he was away. Lucas suggests it was likely done by a jaguar, but the others are unsure.\\r\\nA further excavation of the area where Carl found the fossil turns up nothing. Mark is ready to give up the search, but David suggests that perhaps thousands of years ago the part of the embankment containing the rest of the skeleton fell into the water and was washed downriver, broken up by the current. Lucas says that the tributary empties into a lagoon. Lucas calls it the \\"Black Lagoon\\", a paradise from which no one has ever returned. The scientists decide to risk it, unaware that the amphibious \\"Gill-man\\" that killed Carl's assistants has been watching them. Taking notice of the beautiful Kay, the creature follows the Rita all the way downriver to the Black Lagoon. Once the expedition arrives, David and Mark go diving to collect fossils from the lagoon floor. After they return, Kay goes swimming and is stalked underwater by the Gill-man, who then gets briefly caught in one of the ship's drag lines. Although it escapes, the creature leaves a claw behind in the net, revealing its existence.\\r\\nSubsequent encounters with the Gill-man claim the lives of Lucas's crew members, before the creature is captured and locked in a cage aboard the Rita. It escapes during the night, attacking Edwin, who was guarding it. Edwin smashes the creature with a lantern, driving it off. Following this incident, David decides they should return to civilization, but as the Rita tries to leave, they find the lagoon's entrance blocked by fallen logs, courtesy of the Gill-man. While the others attempt to remove the logs, Mark is mauled to death while trying to capture the creature single-handedly, underwater. It then abducts Kay and takes her to its cavern lair. David, Lucas, and Carl give chase, and Kay is rescued. The creature is riddled with bullets before retreating to the lagoon, where its body sinks into the watery depths.\\r\\nProducer William Alland was attending a 1941 dinner party during the filming of Citizen Kane (in which he played the reporter Thompson) when Mexican cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa told him about the myth of a race of half-fish, half-human creatures in the Amazon River. Alland wrote story notes titled \\"The Sea Monster\\" 10 years later. His inspiration was Beauty and the Beast. In December 1952 Maurice Zimm expanded this into a treatment, which Harry Essex and Arthur Ross rewrote as The Black Lagoon. Following the success of the 3D film House of Wax in 1953, Jack Arnold was hired to direct the film in the same format.[3]\\r\\nThe designer of the approved Gill-man was Disney animator Millicent Patrick, though her role was deliberately downplayed by make-up artist Bud Westmore, who for half a century would receive sole credit for the creature's conception.[4] Jack Kevan, who worked on The Wizard of Oz (1939) and made prosthetics for amputees during World War II, created the bodysuit, while Chris Mueller, Jr. sculpted the head.\\r\\nBen Chapman portrayed the Gill-man for the majority of the scenes shot at Universal City, California. Many of the on-top of the water scenes were filmed at Rice Creek near Palatka, Florida. The costume made it impossible for Chapman to sit for the 14 hours of each day that he wore it, and it overheated easily, so he stayed in the back lot's lake, often requesting to be hosed down. He also could not see very well while wearing the headpiece, which caused him to scrape Julie Adams' head against the wall when carrying her in the grotto scenes. Ricou Browning played the Gill-Man in the underwater shots, which were filmed by the second unit in Wakulla Springs, Florida.[3]\\r\\nCreature from the Black Lagoon received positive reviews from critics upon its release and is now considered a classic.[citation needed] Leonard Maltin awarded the film three out of a possible four stars, writing, \\"Archetypal '50s monster movie has been copied so often that some of the edge is gone, but ... is still entertaining, with juicy atmosphere and luminous underwater photography sequences.\\"[5] Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 84%, based on 32 reviews, with a overall rating average of 6.9/10.[6] The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\\r\\nCreature from the Black Lagoon was novelized in 1954 by John Russell Fearn under the pseudonym of \\"Vargo Statten\\", then later, in 1977, in mass market paperback under the pseudonym of \\"Carl Dreadstone\\". This was part of a short-lived series of books based on the classic Universal horror films. The 1977 book was introduced by Ramsey Campbell, but was written by Walter Harris. The 1977 novel offers a completely different Gill-man, who in this version of the story is gigantic, almost as big as the Rita herself, weighing in at 30 tons. It is both coldblooded and warmblooded, is a hermaphrodite, and also possesses a long whip-like tail. The gigantic creature is dubbed \\"AA\\", for \\"Advanced Amphibian\\", by the expedition team members. After slaying most of the team members, destroying a Sikorsky helicopter, and kidnapping Kay more than once, the creature is killed by the crew of a United States Navy torpedo boat.\\r\\nThe 1977 novel also differs greatly with respect to the human characters. Only David Reed and Kay Lawrence remain the same. Mark Williams is a German named \\"Bruno Gebhardt\\" and dies not as a result from drowning, but by the monster falling on him. Lucas is named \\"Jose Goncalves Fonseca de Souza\\" and is a mostly sympathetic character, until his suggestion of throwing the wounded and unconscious Reed to the monster makes an enraged Gebhardt/Williams throw \\"him\\" to the beast instead. Dr. Thompson and Dr. Maia both die grisly deaths, whereas in the movie they survive; Maia is eaten by the monster, and Thompson is impaled on a long tree branch flung at him by the creature like a spear (in an apparent nod to a deleted scene from Revenge of the Creature wherein the Gill-man killed a guard in this fashion).\\r\\nIn 1980 Universal released Creature from the Black Lagoon on video cassette in an anaglyph 3D version, using the Deep Vision anaglyph 3D release as its source. Subsequent releases on VHS, Beta and DVD were the 2D version. On October 2, 2012, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray as a 2D / Blu-ray 3D dual format disc as part of the \\"Universal Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection\\" box set. On June 4, 2013, the Creature from the Black Lagoon Blu-ray disc was released as a stand-alone title.\\r\\nIn 1982 John Landis wanted Jack Arnold to direct a remake of the film, and Nigel Kneale was commissioned to write the screenplay. Kneale completed the script, which involved a pair of creatures, one destructive and the other calm and sensitive, being persecuted by the United States Navy.[9] A decision to make the film in 3D led to the remake being canceled by producers at Universal, both for budgetary concerns and to avoid a clash with Jaws 3-D.[9] In 1992, John Carpenter was developing the remake at Universal.[10] He originally hired Bill Phillips to write the script while Rick Baker was hired to create the 3D model of the Creature, but the project never got green-lit. Herschel Weingrod and Timothy Harris wrote a new script,[11] and Universal offered Peter Jackson the director's position in 1995, but he chose to work on King Kong instead.[12] In February 1996 Ivan Reitman was planning to direct the remake, but the outing never materialized.[11] With the financial success of The Mummy remake in May 1999, development of the Creature from the Black Lagoon remake was revived.[13]\\r\\nIn December 2001 Gary Ross signed on to write and produce the remake with his father, Arthur A. Ross, one of the original's writers. He told The Hollywood Reporter, \\"The story my father wrote embodies the clash between primitive men and civilized men, and that obviously makes it a fertile area for re-examination.\\"[14] In August 2002, Guillermo del Toro, a fan of the original, was attached as director.[15] Because of his commitments to numerous other projects, Universal was forced to go without del Toro and hired Tedi Sarafian (credited on Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines) to write a script in March 2003.[16]\\r\\nIn October 2005 Breck Eisner signed on as director. \\"As a kid, I remember loving Jack Arnold's original version of this film\\", he explained. \\"What I really want to do is update an iconic image from the '50s and bring in more of the sci-fi sensibility of Alien or John Carpenter's The Thing (1982).\\"[17] Ross said in March 2007 the Gill-man's origin would be reinvented, with him being the result of a pharmaceutical corporation polluting the Amazon. \\"It's about the rainforest being exploited for profit\\", he said.[18]\\r\\nThe production was delayed, however, by the 2007ÿ2008 Writers Guild of America strike; as a result, Eisner made The Crazies (2010) the number one on his priority list instead. His new goal was to finish filming The Crazies and then begin filming Creature from the Black Lagoon in Manaus, Brazil and on the Amazon River in Peru. Eisner was inspired to shoot on location by the film Fitzcarraldo, and the boat set had been built. Eisner continued to rewrite the script, which was to be a summer blockbuster full of \\"action and excitement, but [still] scary\\". Eisner spent six months designing the new incarnation of the Gill-man with Mark McCreery (Jurassic Park, and Davy Jones' designer). The director said the design was \\"very faithful to the original, but updated\\" and that the Gill-man would still be sympathetic.[19]\\r\\nIn 2009 it was reported that Carl Erik Rinsch might direct a 2010 remake that would be produced by Marc Abraham, Eric Newman and Gary Ross;[20][21] however, a project featuring this ensemble had been abandoned by 2011.\\r\\nIn March 2012 Universal announced that a remake was in production, and would simply be titled The Black Lagoon rather than Creature from the Black Lagoon, in order to distinguish the two versions. In October 2012, the studio hired Dave Kajganich to write the film.[22] The film was expected to hit theaters by May 2014, but was ultimately cancelled.\\r\\nUniversal Pictures is developing a shared universe of rebooted modern-day versions of their classic Universal Monsters, with various films in different stages of development. The series begins with The Mummy (2017) and will continue with Bride of Frankenstein (2019). The Creature from the Black Lagoon has a story written by Jeff Pinkner and a script written by Will Beall. In June of 2017, Kurtzman revealed that the Gill-man will be from the Amazon.[23]","input":"Who designed the creature from the black lagoon?"},{"output":"Colin Male","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack-and-white (1960ÿ65) Color (1965ÿ68)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Andy Griffith Show  is an American situation comedy which aired on CBS from October 3, 1960, to April 1, 1968, with a total of 249 half-hour episodes spanning over eight seasons159 in black and white and 90 in color. The series partially originated from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show originally starred Andy Griffith in the role of Andy Taylor, the widowed sheriff of the fictional small community of Mayberry, North Carolina. Other major characters include Andy's inept but well-meaning deputy, Barney Fife (Don Knotts); Andy's spinster aunt and housekeeper, Bee Taylor (Frances Bavier), and Andy's precocious young son, Opie (Ron Howard). Eccentric townspeople and temperamental girlfriends complete the cast.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding the tone of the show, Griffith said that despite a contemporary setting, the show evoked nostalgia, saying in a Today Show interview: \\"Well, though we never said it, and though it was shot in the '60s, it had a feeling of the '30s. It was, when we were doing it, of a time gone by.\\"[1]  The show also avoided unfavorable cultural aspects of this period, such as racism and segregation, by simply avoiding these topics with the all-white cast never encountering such situations. Black actors and actresses were only seen as background characters, and only one (Rockne Tarkington) ever had a speaking role on the show.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series never placed lower than seventh in the Nielsen ratings and ended its final season at number one. On separate occasions, it has been ranked by TV Guide as the 9th-best and 13th-best show in American television history.[3][4] Though neither Griffith nor the show won awards during its 8-season run, co-stars Knotts and Bavier accumulated a combined total of six Emmy Awards. The series spawned its own spin-off, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. (1964) and a reunion telemovie, Return to Mayberry (1986). After the eighth season, when Andy Griffith became one of the original cast members to leave the show, it was retitled Mayberry, R.F.D., with Ken Berry and Buddy Foster replacing Andy Griffith and Ron Howard in new roles. In the new format, it ran an additional three seasons and 78 episodes, ending in 1971. Reruns of the show are often aired to TV Land, MeTV and SundanceTV, while the complete series is available on DVD. The sitcom has also been made available on streaming video services such as Netflix. An annual festival celebrating the sitcom, Mayberry Days, is held each year in Griffith's hometown of Mount Airy, North Carolina.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSheldon Leonard, producer of The Danny Thomas Show, and Danny Thomas hired veteran comedy writer Arthur Stander (who had written many of the \\"Danny Thomas\\" episodes) to create a pilot show for Andy Griffith, featuring him as justice of the peace and newspaper editor in a small town.[6]  At the time, Broadway, film, and radio star Griffith was interested in attempting a television role, and the William Morris Agency told Leonard that Griffith's rural background and previous rustic characterizations were suited to the part.[6] After conferences between Leonard and Griffith in New York, Griffith flew to Los Angeles and filmed the episode.[6] On February 15, 1960, The Danny Thomas Show episode \\"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\\" aired.[6] In the episode Griffith played fictional Sheriff Andy Taylor of Mayberry, North Carolina, who arrests Danny Williams (Thomas's character) for running a stop sign. Future players in The Andy Griffith Show, Frances Bavier and Ron Howard, appeared in the episode as townspeople Henrietta Perkins and Opie Taylor (the sheriff's son).[6] General Foods, sponsor of The Danny Thomas Show, had first access to the spin-off and committed to it immediately.[6] On October 3, 1960, at 9:30 pm, The Andy Griffith Show made its debut.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sitcom's production team included producers Aaron Ruben (1960ÿ65) and Bob Ross (1965ÿ68).[6] First-season writers (many of whom worked in pairs) included Jack Elinson, Charles Stewart, Arthur Stander and Frank Tarloff (as \\"David Adler\\"), Benedict Freedman and John Fenton Murray, Leo Solomon and Ben Gershman, and Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum.[6] During season six, Greenbaum and Fritzell left the show and Ruben departed for Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., a show which he owned in part.[6] Writer Harvey Bullock left after season six. Bob Sweeney directed the first three seasons save the premiere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show was filmed at Desilu Studios,[6] with exteriors filmed at Forty Acres in Culver City, California.[6] Woodsy locales were filmed north of Beverly Hills at Franklin Canyon.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDon Knotts, who knew Griffith professionally and had seen The Danny Thomas Show episode, called Griffith during the developmental stages of the show and suggested the Sheriff character needed a deputy. Griffith agreed. Knotts auditioned for the show's creator and executive producer, Sheldon Leonard, and was offered a five-year contract playing Barney Fife.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show's theme music, \\"The Fishin' Hole\\", was composed by Earle Hagen and Herbert Spencer, with lyrics written by Everett Sloane, who also guest starred as Jubal Foster in the episode \\"The Keeper of the Flame\\" (1962). Whistling in the opening sequence, as well as the closing credits sequence, was performed by Earle Hagen.[6]  One of the show's tunes, \\"The Mayberry March\\", was reworked a number of times in different tempo, styles and orchestrations as background music.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show's sole sponsor was General Foods,[6] with promotional consideration paid for (in the form of cars) by Ford Motor Company (mentioned in the credits).\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, Griffith played Taylor as a heavy-handed country bumpkin, grinning from ear to ear and speaking in a hesitant, frantic manner. The style recalled that used in the delivery of his popular  monologues such as \\"What It Was, Was Football\\". He gradually abandoned the \\"rustic Taylor\\" and developed a serious and thoughtful characterization. Producer Aaron Ruben recalled: \\r\\n\\r\\nHe was being that marvelously funny character from No Time for Sergeants, Will Stockdale [a role Griffith played on stage and in film]?... One day he said, \\"My God, I just realized that I'm the straight man. I'm playing straight to all these kooks around me.\\" He didn't like himself [in first year reruns]?... and in the next season he changed, becoming this Lincolnesque character.[6]\\r\\nAs Griffith stopped portraying some of the sheriff's more unsophisticated character traits and mannerisms, it was impossible for him to create his own problems and troubles in the manner of other central sitcom characters such as Lucy in I Love Lucy or Archie Bunker in All in the Family, whose problems were the result of their temperaments, philosophies and attitudes. Consequently, the characters around Taylor were employed to create the problems and troubles, with rock-solid Taylor stepping in as problem solver, mediator, advisor, disciplinarian and counselor.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series plot revolves around Sheriff Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith) and his life in sleepy, slow-paced fictional Mayberry, North Carolina. Sheriff Taylor's level-headed approach to law enforcement makes him the scourge of local moonshiners and out-of-town criminals, while his abilities to settle community problems with common-sense advice, mediation, and conciliation make him popular with his fellow citizens. His professional life, however, is complicated by the repeated gaffes of his inept deputy, Barney Fife (Don Knotts). Barney is Andy's cousin, but that is only mentioned in a few early episodes. Andy socializes with male friends in the Main Street barber shop and dates various ladies until a schoolteacher becomes his steady interest in season three. At home, Andy enjoys fishing trips with his son, Opie (Ronny Howard), and quiet evenings on the front porch with his maiden aunt and housekeeper, Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier). Opie tests his father's parenting skills season after season, and Aunt Bee's ill-considered romances and adventures cause her nephew concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndy's friends and neighbors include, at various times, barber Floyd Lawson (Howard McNear ÿ but played by Walter Baldwin in the 1960 episode \\"Stranger in Town\\"), service station attendants and cousins Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors) and Goober Pyle (George Lindsey), and local drunkard Otis Campbell (Hal Smith). There were two mayors: Mayor Pike, who was more relaxed, and Mayor Stoner, who had a more assertive personality. On the distaff side, townswoman Clara Edwards (Hope Summers), Barney's sweetheart Thelma Lou (Betty Lynn) and Andy's  schoolteacher sweetheart Helen Crump (Aneta Corsaut) become semi-regulars. Ellie Walker (Elinor Donahue) is Andy's girlfriend in the first season, while Peggy McMillan (Joanna Moore) is a nurse who becomes his girlfriend in season 3. Ernest T. Bass (Howard Morris) made his first appearance in Episode #94 (\\"Mountain Wedding\\"). In the color seasons, County Clerk Howard Sprague (Jack Dodson) and handyman Emmett Clark (Paul Hartman) appear regularly, while Barney's replacement deputy Warren Ferguson (Jack Burns) appears in about half of season six. Unseen characters such as telephone operator Sarah, and Barney's love interest, local diner waitress Juanita Beasley, as mentioned in the first season, are often referenced. The show's announcer for the first five seasons, Colin Male, portrayed a game warden in Episode #140 (\\"Andy and Helen Have Their Day\\"). In the series' last few episodes, farmer Sam Jones (Ken Berry) debuts, and later becomes the lead of the retitled show, Mayberry R.F.D..[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDon Knotts, Aneta Corsaut, Jack Dodson, and Betty Lynn also appeared on Andy Griffith's later show Matlock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show comprises eight full seasons and 249 episodes[6]159 episodes in black and white (seasons 1ÿ5) and 90 in color (seasons 6ÿ8). Griffith appears in all 249 episodes with Howard appearing in 209. Only Griffith, Howard, Bavier, Knotts, and Hope Summers appeared in all eight seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnotts left the show at the end of season five to pursue a career in films (on the show it is told that he takes a job as a detective with the State Police in Raleigh) but returned to make five guest appearances as Barney in seasons six through eight. His last appearance in the final season in a story about a summit meeting with Russian dignitaries \\"ranked eleventh among single comedy programs most watched in television between 1960 and 1984, with an audience of thirty-three and a half million.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1964, daytime reruns began airing.[6] The show was retitled Andy of Mayberry to distinguish the repeat episodes from the new episodes airing in prime time.[9] As of 2018, the show has been seen in syndication for 54 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of season four (May 1964), the backdoor pilot \\"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\\" aired, and the following September, the spinoff series Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. debuted with Jim Nabors in the role of Gomer and Frank Sutton as drill instructor Sergeant Vince Carter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last episodes of the eighth season, as Andy Griffith was preparing to leave, the character Sam Jones, played by Ken Berry, was introduced as the new star, and the series was retitled Mayberry R.F.D.. Most of the cast members continued their original roles, with Bavier becoming Sam's housekeeper. To create a smooth transition, Andy and Helen were married in the first episode with the new title and remained for a few additional episodes before leaving with a move to Raleigh, effectively ending their appearances. After RFD's cancellation in 1971, George Lindsey played Goober for many years on the popular country-variety show Hee Haw.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoober, Barney and Emmett all made appearances in the series premiere of The New Andy Griffith Show, which starred Griffith as a similar but canonically different character, Mayor Andy Sawyer. All three characters treated Sawyer as if he were Andy Taylor. The series as a whole only lasted ten episodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986, the reunion telemovie Return to Mayberry was broadcast with several cast members reprising their original roles. Absent, however, was Frances Bavier. She was living in Siler City, North Carolina, in ill health, and declined to participate. In the TV movie, Aunt Bee is portrayed as deceased (and in fact Bavier did die three years later), with Andy visiting her grave. Also absent were Howard McNear, Paul Hartman, Jack Burns, and the cast members who were featured only in the Mayberry RFD seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nGriffith and Howard reprised their roles a final time for a Funny or Die skit supporting the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993, The Andy Griffith Show had a Reunion Special which featured Andy Griffith, Don Knotts, Ron Howard, Jim Nabors, George Lindsey and Jack Dodson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Andy Griffith Show consistently placed in the top ten during its run.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Nielsen study conducted during the show's final season (1967ÿ68) indicated the show ranked number one among blue collar workers followed by The Lucy Show and Gunsmoke. Among white collar workers, the show ranked number three following Saturday Movies and The Dean Martin Show.[6] The Andy Griffith Show is one of only three shows to have its final season be the number one ranked show on television, the other two being I Love Lucy and Seinfeld. In 1998, more than five million people a day watched the show's reruns on 120 stations.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n1961\\r\\n\\r\\n1962\\r\\n\\r\\n1963\\r\\n\\r\\n1966\\r\\n\\r\\n1967\\r\\n\\r\\nDell Comics published two The Andy Griffith Show comic books during the show's first run, with art work by Henry Scarpelli.[13] In 2004, copies in near-mint condition were priced in excess of $500 each.[14] The show's enduring popularity has spawned considerable merchandise since its first run, including board games, bobblehead dolls, kitchenware, books, and other items. In 2007, a line of canned foods inspired by the series was made available in grocery stores across America. Griffith's hometown of Mount Airy, North Carolina annually hosts a week-long \\"Mayberry Days\\" celebration featuring concerts, parades, and appearances by the show's players.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, the episode \\"Opie the Birdman\\" was ranked No. 24 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time.[15] In 2002, TV Guide ranked The Andy Griffith Show ninth on its list of the 50 Best Shows of All Time.[3] Bravo ranked Andy Taylor 63rd on their list of the 100 greatest TV characters.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, the country band Rascal Flatts released the song Mayberry and many of the lyrics pay tribute to the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cable television network TV Land erected bronze statues of Andy and Opie in Mount Airy and Raleigh, North Carolina (see: Pullen Park).[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Taylor Home Inn in Clear Lake, Wisconsin, is a bed-and-breakfast modeled after the Taylor Home.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mayberry Cafe in Danville, Indiana, features Aunt Bee's Fried Chicken and a replica of Andy's Ford Galaxie police car.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, TV Guide ranked The Andy Griffith Show #15 on their list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, Premier Promotions released various episodes on VHS. Most tapes had either two or four episodes. In the early to mid-1990s, United American Video released VHS tapes of various episodes. They either had two or three episodes. These compilations were culled from episodes early in the show's run that had lapsed into the public domain; these episodes continue to be circulated on unofficial video releases.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 2004 and 2006, Paramount Home Entertainment and later in 2006, CBS DVD released all eight seasons as single-season packages on Region 1 DVD. The Andy Griffith Show: The Complete Series was first released as a 40-disc boxed set in 2007. In addition to all 249 episodes of the series, its bonus features included the episode \\"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\\" from The Danny Thomas Show which served as the pilot, the episode \\"Opie Joins the Marines\\" from Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. which featured Ron Howard and the 95-minute, made-for-television comedy film Return to Mayberry. In 2016, The Andy Griffith Show: The Complete Series was repackaged and released again as a 39-disc set that featured all 249 episodes of the series but did not include the bonus feature disc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixteen episodes from the season three, which lapsed into the public domain after CBS neglected to file copyright renewals on the episodes in 1989, are available on discount DVDs. The 2007 lawsuit CBS Operations Inc v. Reel Funds International Inc. ruled that the episodes in question were derivative works based on the copyrighted episodes even though the episodes themselves were not under copyright and granted CBS indirect copyright over the public domain episodes; the ruling enjoined Reel Funds International, a public domain distributor, from selling DVDs with those episodes within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: The Region 1 release of The Third Season contains two episodes edited for syndication: \\"The Darlings Are Coming\\", which had several scenes cut, and \\"Barney Mends a Broken Heart\\", which had its epilogue cut.","input":"Who was the announcer for the andy griffith show?"},{"output":"Tenochtitlan","context":"Tenochtitlan (Spanish: Tenochtitlan, Spanish pronunciation:?[?mexiko tenot??titlan]?(?listen)), originally known as Mxico-Tenochtitlan (Classical Nahuatl: Mxihco-Tenchtitlan [me????.ko te.no?t??.?t.t??an]), was a large Mexica city-state on an island in Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico. Founded on June 20, 1325, it was the capital of the expanding Aztec Empire in the 15th century[1] until it was captured by the Spanish in 1521.\\r\\nAt its peak, it was the largest city in the Pre-Columbian Americas. It subsequently became a cabecera of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Today, the ruins of Tenochtitlan are in the historic center of Mexico City.\\r\\nTenochtitlan was one of two Nahua ltpetl (city-states) on the island, the other being Tlatelolco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, the name Tenochtitlan was thought to come from Nahuatl tetl [?tet?] (\\"rock\\") and nchtli [?no?t?t?i] (\\"prickly pear\\") and is often thought to mean, \\"Among the prickly pears [growing among] rocks\\". However, one attestation in the late 16th-century manuscript known as \\"the Bancroft dialogues\\" suggest the second vowel was short, so that the true etymology remains uncertain.[2]\\r\\nTenochtitlan covered an estimated 8 to 13.5?km2 (3.1 to 5.2?sq?mi), situated on the western side of the shallow Lake Texcoco.\\r\\nAt the time of Spanish conquests, Mexico City comprised both Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco. The city extended from north to south, from the north border of Tlatelolco to the swamps, which by that time were gradually disappearing to the west; the city ended more or less at the present location of Avenida Bucareli.\\r\\nThe city was connected to the mainland by causeways leading to the north, south, and west. The causeways were interrupted by bridges that allowed canoes and other water traffic to pass freely. The bridges could be pulled away, if necessary, to defend the city. The city was interlaced with a series of canals, so that all sections of the city could be visited either on foot or via canoe.\\r\\nLake Texcoco was the largest of five interconnected lakes. Since it formed in an endorheic basin, Lake Texcoco was brackish. During the reign of Moctezuma I, the \\"levee of Nezahualcoyotl\\" was constructed, reputedly designed by Nezahualcoyotl. Estimated to be 12 to 16?km (7.5 to 9.9?mi) in length, the levee was completed circa 1453. The levee kept fresh spring-fed water in the waters around Tenochtitlan and kept the brackish waters beyond the dike, to the east.\\r\\nTwo double aqueducts, each more than 4?km (2.5?mi) long and made of terracotta,[3] provided the city with fresh water from the springs at Chapultepec. This was intended mainly for cleaning and washing. For drinking, water from mountain springs was preferred. Most of the population liked to bathe twice a day; Moctezuma was said to take four baths a day. According to the context of Aztec culture in literature, the soap that they most likely used was the root of a plant called copalxocotl (Saponaria americana),[4] and to clean their clothes they used the root of metl (Agave americana). Also, the upper classes and pregnant women washed themselves in a temazcalli, similar to a sauna bath, which is still used in the south of Mexico. This was also popular in other Mesoamerican cultures.\\r\\nWhen we saw so many cities and villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land we were amazed and said that it was like the enchantments (...) on account of the great towers and cues and buildings rising from the water, and all built of masonry. And some of our soldiers even asked whether the things that we saw were not a dream? (...) I do not know how to describe it, seeing things as we did that had never been heard of or seen before, not even dreamed about.\\r\\nThe city was divided into four zones, or camps; each camp was divided into 20 districts (calpullis, Nahuatl calplli); and each calpulli, or 'big house', was crossed by streets or tlaxilcalli. There were three main streets that crossed the city, each leading to one of the three causeways to the mainland of Tepeyac, Ixtapalpa, and Tlacopan.[6] Bernal Daz del Castillo reported that they were wide enough for ten horses. Surrounding the raised causeways were artificial floating gardens with canal waterways and gardens of plants, shrubs, and trees.[7] The calpullis were divided by channels used for transportation, with wood bridges that were removed at night.\\r\\nThe earliest European images of the city were woodcuts published in Augsburg around 1522.[8]\\r\\nEach calpulli (from Classical Nahuatl calplli, Nahuatl pronunciation: [ka??po?l?i], meaning \\"large house\\") had its own tiyanquiztli (marketplace), but there was also a main marketplace in Tlatelolco ÿ Tenochtitlan's sister city. Corts estimated it was twice the size of the city of Salamanca with about 60,000 people trading daily. Bernardino de Sahag~n provides a more conservative population estimate of 20,000 on ordinary days and 40,000 on feast days. There were also specialized markets in the other central Mexican cities.\\r\\nIn the center of the city were the public buildings, temples, and palaces. Inside a walled square, 500 meters to a side, was the ceremonial center. There were about 45 public buildings, including: the Templo Mayor, which was dedicated to the Aztec patron deity Huitzilopochtli and the Rain God Tlaloc; the temple of Quetzalcoatl; the tlachtli (ball game court) with the tzompantli or rack of skulls; the Sun Temple, which was dedicated to Tonatiuh; the Eagle's House, which was associated with warriors and the ancient power of rulers; the platforms for the gladiatorial sacrifice; and some minor temples.[9]\\r\\nOutside was the palace of Moctezuma with 100 rooms, each with its own bath, for the lords and ambassadors of allies and conquered people. Also located nearby was the cuicalli, or house of the songs, and the calmecac.[10]\\r\\nThe city had great symmetry. All constructions had to be approved by the calmimilocatl, a functionary in charge of the city planning.\\r\\nThe palace of Moctezuma II also had two houses or zoos, one for birds of prey and another for other birds, reptiles, and mammals. About 300 people were dedicated to the care of the animals.\\r\\nThere was also a botanical garden and an aquarium. The aquarium had ten ponds of salt water and ten ponds of fresh water, containing various fish and aquatic birds. Places like this also existed in Texcoco, Chapultepec, Huaxtepec (now called Oaxtepec), and Texcotzingo.[11]\\r\\nTenochtitlan can be considered the most complex society in Mesoamerica in regard to social stratification. The complex system involved many social classes. The macehualtin were commoners who lived outside the island city of Tenochtitlan. The pipiltin were noblemen who were relatives of leaders and former leaders, and lived in the confines of the island. Cuauhipiltin, or eagle nobles, were commoners who impressed the nobles with their martial prowess, and were treated as nobles.[6] Teteuctin were the highest class, rulers of various parts of the empire, including the king. Tlacohtin were individuals who chose to enslave themselves to pay back a debt; they were not slaves forever and were not treated as badly as typical slaves seen in other ancient civilizations worldwide. Finally, the pochteca were merchants who traveled all of Mesoamerica trading. The membership of this class was based on heredity. Pochteca could become very rich because they did not pay taxes, but they had to sponsor the ritual feast of Xocotl Huetzi from the wealth that they obtained from their trade expeditions.\\r\\nStatus was displayed by location and type of house where a person lived. Ordinary people lived in houses made of reeds plastered with mud and roofed with thatch. People who were better off had houses of adobe brick with flat roofs.[6] The wealthy had houses of stone masonry with flat roofs. They most likely made up the house complexes that were arranged around the inner court. The higher officials in Tenochtitlan lived in the great palace complexes that made up the city.\\r\\nAdding even more complexity to Aztec social stratification was the calpolli. Calpolli, meaning big house is a group of families related by either kinship or proximity. These groups consist of both elite members of Aztec society and commoners. Elites provided commoners with arable land and nonagricultural occupations, and commoners performed services for chiefs and gave tribute.[12]\\r\\nTenochtitlan was the capital of the Mexican civilization of the Mexica people founded in 1325. The state religion of the Mexica civilization awaited the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy: the wandering tribes would find the destined site for a great city whose location would be signaled by an eagle with a snake in its beak perched atop a (Opuntia) cactus.\\r\\nThe Mexica saw this vision on what was then a small swampy island in Lake Texcoco, a vision that is now immortalized in Mexico's coat of arms and on the Mexican flag. Not deterred by the unfavourable terrain, they set about building their city, using the chinampa system (misnamed as \\"floating gardens\\") for agriculture and to dry and expand the island.\\r\\nA thriving culture developed, and the Mexica civilization came to dominate other tribes around Mexico. The small natural island was perpetually enlarged as Tenochtitlan grew to become the largest and most powerful city in Mesoamerica. Commercial routes were developed that brought goods from places as far as the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Ocean and perhaps even the Inca Empire.[13]\\r\\nAfter a flood of Lake Texcoco, the city was rebuilt under the rule of Ahuitzotl in a style that made it one of the grandest ever in Mesoamerica.\\r\\nSpanish conquistador Hernn Corts arrived in Tenochtitlan on November 8, 1519. With an estimated population between 200,000 and 300,000, many[who?] scholars believe Tenochtitlan to have been among the largest cities in the world at that time.[14] Compared to the cities of Europe, only Paris, Venice and Constantinople might have rivaled it. It was five times the size of the London of Henry VIII.[6] In a letter to the Spanish king, Corts wrote that Tenochtitlan was as large as Seville or C܇rdoba. Cortes' men were in awe at the sight of the splendid city and many wondered if they were dreaming.[15]\\r\\nAlthough some popular sources put the number as high as 350,000,[16] the most common estimates of the population are of over 200,000 people. One of the few comprehensive academic surveys of Mesoamerican city and town sizes arrived at a population of 212,500 living on 13.5?km2 (5.2?sq?mi),[17] It is also said that at one time, Moctezuma had rule over an empire of almost five million people in central and southern Mexico because he had extended his rule to surrounding territories to gain tribute and prisoners to sacrifice to the gods.[7]\\r\\nWhen Corts and his men arrived in Tenochtitlan, Moctezuma II, who precariously ruled over a large empire, chose to welcome Corts as an honored guest, rather than risk a war which might quickly be joined by aggrieved indigenous people. Moctezuma may have feared that Corts was the returning god Quetzalcoatl, because the Spanish arrival coincided with the close of an Aztec calendar cycle consistent with such a return. This claim is found in the Florenino Codex, among other early sources, and accepted as true in many later histories. However, some scholars doubt it.[18]\\r\\nAs Corts approached the great city of Tenochtitlan, the natives put on many events. One particular event was the most important of them all, the celebration of Toxcatl. This event was when the most prominent warriors of altepetl would dance in front of a huge statue of Huitzilopochtli. The Spanish leader, Pedro de Alvarado, who was left in charge, worried that this would be the day that the natives would plan a surprise attack on them. He captured three natives and began to torture them until they confessed that this was indeed true. There was no proof that the natives would attack the Spaniards during this festival, however, Alvarado would plan an attack first by following an old maxim by deciding that the person who would attack first would be successful in this attack. During the festival, the Spaniards came heavily armed and closed off every exit surrounding the courtyard so that no one would escape. This would happen during their last days in Tenochtitlan.[19].\\r\\nNobles lined each side along the buildings of the city's main causeway, which extended about a league. Walking down the center came Moctezuma II, who had two lords at his side, one being his brother, the ruler of Iztapalapa. Corts dismounted, and was greeted by the ruler and his lords, but was forbidden to touch him. Corts gave him a necklace of crystals, placing it over his neck.[20]\\r\\nThey were then brought to a large house that would serve as their home for their stay in the city. Once they were settled, Moctezuma himself sat down and spoke with Corts. The great ruler declared that anything that they needed would be theirs to have.[21] He was thrilled to have visitors of such stature. Although the Spaniards were seeking gold, Moctezuma expressed that he had very little of the sort, but all of it was to be given to Corts if he so desired it.[22]\\r\\nSince arriving in Tenochtitlan, Corts faced early trouble. Leaving a post in Vera Cruz, the officer left in charge received a letter from Qualpopoca, the leader of Almera, asking to become a vassal of the Spaniards. He requested that officers be sent to him so that he could confirm his submission. To reach the province, the officers would have to travel through hostile land. The officer in charge of Vera Cruz decided to send four officers to meet with Qualpopoca.[23]\\r\\nWhen they arrived, they were captured and two were killed, the other two escaping through the woods. Upon their return to Vera Cruz, the officer in charge was infuriated, and so led troops to storm Almera. Here they learned that Moctezuma was supposedly the one who commanded the officers to be executed.[24] Back in Tenochtitlan, Corts detained Moctezuma and questioned him endlessly.[25] Though no serious conclusions were made, this started the relationship between Moctezuma and the Spaniards on a bad note.[26]\\r\\nCorts subsequently besieged Tenochtitlan for 75 days, causing the inhabitants utter famine,[7] directed the systematic destruction and leveling of the city,[27] and began its rebuilding, despite opposition, with a central area designated for Spanish use (the traza). The outer Indian section, now dubbed San Juan Tenochtitlan, continued to be governed by the previous indigenous elite and was divided into the same subdivisions as before.[28]. While the people of Tenochtitlan were celebrating the few Spaniards who were not able to escape and were killed, the city was in great ruins. The people of Tenochtitlan were exposed to diseases from their enemy. A citizen who was exposed to these diseases would not feel it for the first 10 days, then the disease would spread throughout the body, causing many sores the remaining days. This consisted of pain in the body and high fever. People were weak to the point that they could not move, nor be able to obtain food and water. They couldn't cook or bury the remaining dead bodies from the conquest. The population of the people of Tenochtitlan began to starve and weaken. For the next 60 days, the amount of citizens that died, began to rise even higher.[29]\\r\\nTenochtitlan's main temple complex, the Templo Mayor, was dismantled and the central district of the Spanish colonial city was constructed on top of it. The great temple was destroyed by the Spanish during the construction of a cathedral. The location of the Templo Mayor was rediscovered in the early 20th century, but major excavations did not take place until 1978ÿ1982, after utility workers came across a massive stone disc depicting the nude dismembered body of the moon goddess Coyolxauhqui. This stone disc is 3.25 meters in diameter (or 10.5?ft).[30] These finds are held at the Templo Mayor Museum.\\r\\nThe ruins, constructed over seven periods, were built on top of each other. The resulting weight of the structures caused them to sink into the sediment of Lake Texcoco. This resulted in the ruins now resting at an angle instead of horizontally.\\r\\nMexico City's Z܇calo, the Plaza de la Constituci܇n, is located at the site of Tenochtitlan's original central plaza and market, and many of the original calzadas still correspond to modern city streets. The Aztec calendar stone was located in the ruins. This stone is 4 meters in diameter and weighs over 20 tons. It was once located half-way up the great pyramid. This sculpture was made around 1470 under the rule of King Axayacatl, the predecessor of Tizoc, and is said to tell the history of the Mexicas and a prophecy for the future.[31]\\r\\nIn August 1987, archaeologists discovered a mix of 1,789 human bones five metres below street level in Mexico City.[32] The burial dates back to the 1480s and lies at the foot of the main temple in the sacred ceremonial precinct of the Aztec capital. The bones are from children, teenagers and adults and a complete skeleton of a young woman was also found at the site.[32]","input":"What was the name of the aztecs capital city?"},{"output":"Verona Beach","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (often shortened to Romeo + Juliet) is a 1996 American romantic crime film directed, co-produced, and co-written by Baz Luhrmann, co-produced by Gabriella Martinelli, and co-written by Craig Pearce. It is an adaptation and modernization of William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the leading roles of Romeo and Juliet, who instantly fall in love when Romeo crashes a party and meets her, despite being members of feuding families. Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino, and Diane Venora star in supporting roles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it retains the original Shakespearean dialogue, the film represents the Montagues and the Capulets as warring mafia empires (with legitimate business fronts) during contemporary America, and swords are replaced with guns (with brand names such as \\"Dagger\\" and \\"Sword\\"). Some characters' names are also changed. Lord and Lady Montague and Lord and Lady Capulet are given first names (in the original, their first names are never mentioned); Friar Laurence becomes Father Laurence, and Prince Escalus is renamed Captain Prince, the police chief of Verona Beach. The adaptation eliminates the character of Friar John, and some characters change families: in the original, Gregory and Sampson are Capulets, but in the film, they are Montagues (Abram, as Abra, and Petruchio, conversely, are shifted from the Montague to the Capulet family). In addition, a few plot details are shifted, most notably toward the ending.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was released on November 1, 1996 by 20th Century Fox to commercial success, and was met with generally positive reviews. The film grossed over $147.5 million over a $14.5 million budget. At the 47th Berlin International Film Festival in 1997, DiCaprio won the Silver Bear for Best Actor and Luhrmann won the Alfred Bauer Prize.[3] Luhrmann was also nominated for the Golden Bear Award for Best Picture.[4] At the 69th Academy Awards, Catherine Martin and Brigitte Broch were nominated for Best Art Direction/Set Decoration.[4] In 2005, the film was included on the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Verona Beach, the Capulets and the Montagues are arch-rivals.[6] The animosity of the older generationFulgencio and Gloria Capulet and Ted and Caroline Montagueis felt by their younger relatives. A gunfight between the Montague boys led by Benvolio, Romeo's cousin, and the Capulet boys led by Tybalt, Juliet's cousin, creates chaos in the city. The Chief of Police, Captain Prince, reprimands the families, warning them that if such behavior continues, their lives \\"shall pay the forfeit of the peace\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nBenvolio meets Romeo on a beach. While playing a game of pool they learn of a party being held by the Capulets that evening which they decide to gate-crash. Romeo agrees to come after discovering that Rosaline, with whom he is in love, is attending.  Later, the Montague boys meet their friend, Mercutio, who has tickets to the party. Romeo takes ecstasy Mercutio gave him and they proceed to the Capulet mansion. The effects of the drug and the party overwhelm Romeo, who goes to the restroom. While admiring an aquarium, he sees Juliet on the other side, and the two instantly fall in love. Tybalt spots Romeo and vows to kill him for invading his family's home, but Fulgencio stops him.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomeo and Juliet sneak into an elevator and kiss. The nurse spots them when the doors open and drags Juliet away, telling her that Romeo is a Montague. At the same time, Romeo realizes that Juliet is a Capulet. Mercutio removes Romeo from the party, but he sneaks back to the mansion, hiding under Juliets balcony. Juliet emerges into the courtyard and proclaims her love for Romeo before he sneaks up behind her. Juliet warns him that he is risking his life, but Romeo tells her he doesn't care whether he is caught. Knowing her nurse is looking for her, Juliet tells him that, if he sends word by the following day, they will be betrothed. The next day, Romeo visits Father Laurence, telling him he wants to marry Juliet. He agrees to marry the pair in hopes that their marriage will end the violence between the families. Romeo passes the word on to Juliets nurse and the lovers are married.\\r\\n\\r\\nTybalt encounters Mercutio at the beach just as Romeo arrives. Romeo attempts to make peace, but Tybalt assaults him. Mercutio intervenes and batters Tybalt, and is about to finish him off when Romeo stops him. Tybalt then slashes Mercutio with a shard of glass in his stomach.  Mercutio curses both the Montagues and the Capulets before dying in Romeo's arms. Enraged, Romeo chases after a fleeing Tybalt and guns him down.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Prince banishes Romeo from the city. Romeo goes into hiding with Father Laurence, who treats his injuries and says that, after some time passes, he will help Romeo and Juliet return to the city and reconcile with their family and friends. The nurse arrives and tells Romeo that Juliet is waiting for him. When Romeo climbs over Juliet's balcony, she kisses him and they consummate their marriage. Meanwhile, Fulgencio decides Juliet will marry Dave Paris, the governor's son.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, Romeo narrowly escapes the Capulet mansion as Gloria tells Juliet that the family has promised she will marry Paris. She refuses, and Fulgencio threatens to disown her. Her mother and nurse insist it would be in her best interest to marry Paris. To get out of this, Juliet runs away and seeks out Father Laurence, imploring him to help her and threatening to commit suicide. Father Laurence proposes she fake her own death and be put in the Capulet vault to awaken 24 hours later. Romeo will be told of the plot, sneak into the vault, and once reunited the two can escape to Mantua. He gives her a potion which mimics death. After saying goodnight to her mother, Juliet drinks the potion and slips into a coma. She is found in the morning, declared dead, and placed in the vault. Balthasar, one of Romeo's cousins, learns that Juliet is dead and tells Romeo, who is not home when the messenger arrives with a letter from Father Laurence.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomeo returns to Verona and buys a vial of poison. As he goes to the church, Captain Prince finds out he is back, and tries to capture him, without success. Father Laurence learns that Romeo never got his letter and has no idea Juliet is alive. Romeo enters the church where Juliet lies and bids her goodbye. She awakens just as Romeo takes the poison; the two thus see each other and share a final kiss before he dies. A distraught Juliet picks up Romeo's gun and shoots herself in the head, dying instantly. The two lovers are soon discovered in each other's arms. Prince condemns both families, whose feuding led to such tragedy, while coroners quickly transport the two bodies to the morgue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNatalie Portman had been cast as Juliet but, during rehearsals, it was felt that the footage looked as though DiCaprio was \\"molesting\\" her.[8] Baz Luhrmann has also stated that Portman was too young at the time, and made DiCaprio look older than intended. He was 21 at the time of filming and Portman was only 14.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Sarah Michelle Gellar turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts, DiCaprio proclaimed that Danes should be cast, as he felt she was genuine in her line delivery and did not try to impress him by acting flirtatious.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the success of Strictly Ballroom, Luhrmann took some time over deciding what his next project would be:\\r\\n\\r\\nOur philosophy has always been that we think up what we need in our life, choose something creative that will make that life fulfilling, and then follow that road. With Romeo and Juliet what I wanted to do was to look at the way in which Shakespeare might make a movie of one of his plays if he was a director. How would he make it? We don't know a lot about Shakespeare, but we do know he would make a 'movie' movie. He was a player. We know about the Elizabethan stage and that he was playing for 3000 drunken punters, from the street sweeper to the Queen of England - and his competition was bear-baiting and prostitution. So he was a relentless entertainer and a user of incredible devices and theatrical tricks to ultimately create something of meaning and convey a story. That was what we wanted to do.[11]\\r\\nLuhrmann obtained some funds from Fox to do a workshop and shoot some teaser footage in Sydney. Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to pay his own expenses to fly to Sydney and be part of it. Once Fox saw footage of the fight scene, they agreed to support it.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the development was done in Australia, with pre-production in Australia and Canada and post-production in Australia. While some parts of the film were shot in Miami, most of the film was shot in Mexico City and Boca del Rio, Veracruz. For instance, the Capulet mansion was set at Chapultepec Castle while the ballroom was built on Stage One of Churubusco Studios; and the church is Immaculate Heart of Mary in the Del Valle neighborhood.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film premiered on November 1, 1996 in the United States and Canada, in 1,276 theaters, and grossed $11.1 million its opening weekend, ranking #1 at the box office. It went on to gross $46.3 million in the United States and Canada,[13] with a worldwide total of USD$147,554,998.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes rated the film \\"Fresh\\", with 70% of 61 critics giving positive reviews with an average rating of 6.5/10 with the consensus that says, \\"Baz Luhrmann's visual aesthetic is as divisive as it is fresh and inventive\\".[14] James Berardinelli gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote, \\"Ultimately, no matter how many innovative and unconventional flourishes it applies, the success of any adaptation of a Shakespeare play is determined by two factors: the competence of the director and the ability of the main cast members. Luhrmann, Danes, and DiCaprio place this Romeo and Juliet in capable hands.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonardo DiCaprio won Favorite Actor and Claire Danes won Favorite Actress in a Romance at the 1997 Blockbuster Entertainment Awards.[4] At the 1997 MTV Movie Awards, Danes won Best Female Performance. DiCaprio was nominated for Best Male Performance, and DiCaprio and Danes were both nominated for Best Kiss and Best On-Screen Duo.[4] At the 51st BAFTA Film Awards, director Baz Luhrmann won Best Direction, Luhrmann and Mary Haile won the Best Adapted Screenplay, Nellee Hooper won the Best Film Music, and Catherine Martin won the Best Production Design. The film was also nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Sound.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film won several awards.[4] At the 47th Berlin International Film Festival in 1997, DiCaprio won the Silver Bear for Best Actor and Luhrmann won the Alfred Bauer Prize.[3] Luhrmann was also nominated for the Golden Bear Award for Best Picture.[4] At the 69th Academy Awards, Catherine Martin and Brigitte Broch were nominated for Best Art Direction/Set Decoration.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, Roger Ebert gave the film a mixed review of only 2 stars out of 4, saying, \\"I've seen King Lear as a samurai drama and Macbeth as a Mafia story, and two different Romeo and Juliets about ethnic difficulties in Manhattan (West Side Story and China Girl), but I have never seen anything remotely approaching the mess that the new punk version of Romeo & Juliet makes of Shakespeare's tragedy.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was nominated to appear on the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Passions list in 2002.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was originally released on VHS and DVD in 1997.  A 10th anniversary special edition DVD containing extra features and commentary was released on February 6, 2007, while a Blu-ray edition was released on October 19, 2010.","input":"Where was baz luhrmann's romeo and juliet set?"},{"output":"Kiplingcotes Derby","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nHorse racing is the second largest spectator sport in Great Britain,[1] and one of the longest established, with a history dating back many centuries.  It generates over S3.7 billion for the British economy,[2] and the major horse racing events such as Royal Ascot and Cheltenham Festival are important dates in the British and international sporting and society calendar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sport has taken place in the country since Roman times and many of the sport's traditions and rules originated there.  The Jockey Club, established in 1750, codified the Rules of Racing and one of its members, Admiral Rous laid the foundations of the handicapping system for horse racing, including the weight-for-age scale.  Britain is also home to some of the world's iconic racecourses including Newmarket, Ascot and Cheltenham and many of the world's iconic races including The Derby at Epsom, The Grand National and Cheltenham Gold Cup.  The UK has also produced some of the greatest jockeys, including Fred Archer, Sir Gordon Richards and Lester Piggott.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritain has also historically been a hugely important centre for thoroughbred racehorse breeding.  In fact all racehorses are called English Thoroughbred, the breed having been created in England. All modern thoroughbred racehorses can trace a line back to three foundation sires which were imported to Britain in the late 17th/early 18th centuries[3] and the General Stud Book first published by James Weatherby still records details of every horse in the breed.\\r\\n\\r\\nGambling on horseraces has been one of the cornerstones of the British betting industry and the relationship between the two has historically been one of mutual dependence.  The betting industry is an important funder of horse racing in Great Britain, through the betting levy administered by the Horserace Betting Levy Board and through media rights negotiated by racecourses and betting shops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two main forms of horse racing in Great Britain. \\r\\n\\r\\nCollectively, the above racing is often referred to as racing \\"under rules\\", since there is another form of racing which is run on an altogether more informal and ad hoc basis, known as point-to-point racing. Point-to-point is a form of steeplechasing for amateur riders.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the above forms of the sport are run under the auspices of the governing and regulatory body for horse racing in Great Britain, the British Horseracing Authority.[4] with the exception of point-to-pointing which is administered by the Point-to-Point Authority with the BHA taking on regulatory functions.[5] There is also a limited amount of harness racing which takes place under the auspices of the British Harness Racing Society and Arabian racing which takes place under the auspices of the Arabian Racing Organisation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHorses were used as beasts of burden in pre-Roman times, but it is thought that the first horse races to take place in Britain were organised by Carl in Yorkshire around 200 AD.[6] It is believed that Romans at the encampment at Wetherby matched horses against Arabian horses brought to England by Emperor Severus Septimus.[7] The Venerable Bede reports that the English began to saddle their horses about the year 631.\\r\\n[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest written mention of 'running-horses' is a record of Hugh, from the French House of Capet, gifting some as a present to King Athelstan of England in the 9th/10th century.[6] During Athelstan's reign a ban was placed on the export of English horses, such was supposed to be their superiority to continental ones. Continental ones were still permitted for import, and many were brought to England by William the Conqueror. Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury introduced Spanish stallions to the country.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded race meetings were during the reign of Henry II at Smithfield, London, during the annual St Bartholomew's horse fair.  The event is attested by William Fitzstephen writing at some time after 1174 and the poet Drayton.[6]  The Middle English romance Sir Bevis of Hampton has couplets which refer to races taking place in the time of Richard I.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next three centuries there are numerous records of Kings of England keeping 'running horses'.  Edward III bought horses at S13 6s 8d each, and was also gifted two by the King of Navarre.  The royal stud continued to grow throughout the reign of Henry VII.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecords become more substantial during the time of Henry VIII.  He passed a number of laws relating to the breeding of horses[11] and also imported a large number of stallions and mares for breeding.  He kept a training establishment at Greenwich  and a stud at Eltham.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormal race meetings began to be instigated too.  It is believed that the first occurrence of a trophy being presented to the winner of a race was in 1512 by organisers of a fair in Chester and was a small wooden ball decorated with flowers.[citation needed]  Meanwhile, the oldest horse race still in existence, the Kiplingcotes Derby was first run in 1519. The Carlisle Bells, reputedly the oldest sporting trophy in the world, were first competed for in the 16th century, in a race that still bears their name.  One of the bells is inscribed \\"The sweftes horse thes bel tak\\" (\\"The swiftest horse takes this bell\\").[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nRacing was established at Chester, the oldest surviving racecourse in England, by 1540.[7] In the 1580s Queen Elizabeth I is recorded as attending races on Salisbury Plain.[7]. Leith Races were established by 1591, and at Doncaster by 1595.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the reign of Elizabeth, interest in horse racing appears to have waned, for reasons unrecorded,[13] although she is noted to have attended races on Salisbury Plain in the 1580s.[7] But this changed when in 1605, James I discovered the little village of Newmarket whilst out hawking or riding.  He began to spend time there racing horses, and from then on it has been known as the home of horse racing in England.  In fact, James spent so much time there that the House of Commons petitioned him to concentrate more of his time on running the country.[citation needed]  The region has had a long association with horses going back to the time of Boudica and the Iceni.[citation needed] The first recorded race there was a match for S100 between horses owned by Lord Salisbury and Marquess of Buckingham in 1622, and the racecourse was founded in 1636.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first known Rules of Racing date from Kiplingcotes in 1619.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nRace meetings began to spring up elsewhere in the country.  Races were run for silver bells at Gatherley, Yorkshire, Croydon and Theobalds on Enfield Chase.  Jockey weights began to be measured and rigorously enforced.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the time that Charles I of England came to the throne, Spring and Autumn race meetings were introduced to Newmarket and in 1634 the first Gold Cup event was held.  All horse racing was then banned in 1654 by Oliver Cromwell, and many horses were requisitioned by the state. Despite this Cromwell himself kept a stud running of his own.[15]  With the restoration of Charles II racing flourished and he instituted the Newmarket Town Plate in 1664, writing the rules himself:\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Charles II, Rules of the Newmarket Town Plate\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred, the Byerley Turk, Darley Arabian and Godolphin Barb were imported to England in the late 17th and early 18th centuries and founded the lines which can be traced down to every modern thoroughbred racehorse.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n The improvement of the breed was not purely for sporting purposes though. Warfare and conquest were also factors. As Whyte noted, \\"to the excellence of the British horse... may be ascribed much of our superiority over other nations, both in commerce and in war.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 18th century, Queen Anne kept a large string of horses and was instrumental in the founding of Royal Ascot where the opening race each year is still called the Queen Anne Stakes.  The first published account of race results was John Cheney's Historical list of all the Horse Matches run, and all plates and prizes run for in England and Wales which dates to 1727.[17]  The Weatherby family succeeded Cheney as the keepers of the most complete set of racing records,[18] and in a later work which came into their possession, published in York in 1748, the result is recorded of a race run in September 1709 on Clifton and Rawcliffe Ings, near York, for a gold cup of S50.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1740, Parliament introduced an act \\"to restrain and to prevent the excessive increase in horse racing\\"; this was largely ignored and in the 1750 the Jockey Club was formed to create and apply the Rules of Racing. However, until the 1760s, individual horses seldom ran more than five or six times, due to the scarcity of prizes on offer, but this began to change with major race meetings expanding the prizes on offer. Newmarket and York led the way in this.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nRaces were still generally for mature horses, and were typically run in matches, or in best-of-three heats over long distances.[21]\\r\\nThree year old races were first run in 1731 and two year olds raced for the first time at Newmarket in 1769.[22] In 1791, Cash became the first yearling to race, and beat a three year old in a match at Newmarket, in receipt of 3 stones.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nInterest in the sport was at a high throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.  As Whyte's History of the English Turf noted in 1840, \\"For nearly a century and a half, the \\"Turf\\" has formed a favourite amusement of \\"Kings, Lords and Commons\\".[24]  Or as Rice's History reported in 1879, \\"for some two hundred years the pursuit of Horse-racing has been attractive to more of our countrymen than any other out-door pastime\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the century the 12th Earl of Derby and Sir Charles Bunbury were key influencers in the sport. Under their auspices the Derby and Oaks were established at Epsom, inspired by the St Leger and the growing popularity of shorter races, for younger horses. These races, along with the Leger and the Guineas, became known as the Classics.[21] The first handicap was run at Ascot in 1791.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt around the same time, jockeys began to earn a reputation in their own right, with early pioneers including Frank Buckle, Sam Chifney Sr and Jem Robinson.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nSteeplechasing first became organised by Tom Colman at St Albans in the early 1830s. By the end of that decade, the Grand National had been established at Aintree by William Lynn.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1875, Sandown Park became the first racecourse to open a separate members' enclosure.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1947 Hamilton hosted the first evening race meeting in the UK. Now Wolverhampton Racecourse holds the most evening meetings, with nearly 50 a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jockey Club governed the sport until its governance role was handed to the British Horseracing Board, (formed in June 1993) and while the BHB became responsible for strategic planning, finance, politics, race planning, training and marketing, the Jockey Club continued to regulate the sport. In 2006 it formed the Horseracing Regulatory Authority to carry out the regulatory process whilst it focused on owning 13 racecourses and the gallops in Newmarket and Lambourn. In July 2007 the HRA merged with the BHB to form the British Horseracing Authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 60 licensed racecourses in Great Britain, with a further two in Northern Ireland (Down Royal and Downpatrick). Apart from Chelmsford City and Ffos Las (which opened in 2009), all the courses date back to 1927 or earlier.  The oldest is Chester Racecourse, which dates to the early 16th century.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike some other countries, notably the United States, racing in Britain usually takes place on turf.  However, there are six courses which have all-weather tracks - Kempton Park, Lingfield, Southwell, Wolverhampton, Chelmsford City and Newcastle.  Southwell's surface is Fibresand. Wolverhampton installed a Tapeta surface in August 2014, replacing the existing Polytrack; Newcastle converted its historic Gosforth Park flat racing turf track to a Tapeta course with the addition of a floodlit all-weather straight mile in May 2016. All flat racing at Newcastle now takes place on the Tapeta surface with a turf course retained solely for a winter programme of jumps racing. The other three British all-weather tracks are all Polytrack. Ireland has a single all-weather Polytrack course at Dundalk. Courses also vary wildly in layout.  There are very few which are regular ovals, as is the typical layout of other countries like the United States.  Each course has its own idiosyncrasies, and horses are known to be more suited to some tracks than others, hence the idiom \\"horses for courses.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two main operating groups of British racecourses - Jockey Club Racecourses, which runs fifteen courses, and Arena Racing Company, which runs sixteen courses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritain is home to some of the world's most important flat races and race meetings.  While ancient horse races like the Kiplingcotes Derby and Newmarket Town Plate are now mainly curiosities, there are many older races which retain modern relevance.  The five British Classics - the 1,000 Guineas, 2,000 Guineas, The Oaks, The Derby and the St. Leger - were founded in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and still represent the pinnacle of achievement for each generation of horses.  The structure and distances of these races, if not the exact names, have been adopted by many other European horse racing authorities, such as Ireland.  Royal Ascot is the major flat racing festival in Europe and attracts horses from all over the world.  The modern flat season in Britain now also climaxes with British Champions Day, a festival of championship races, also held at Ascot.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritain is the home of National Hunt racing, although the sport has more national significance and popularity in Ireland.[citation needed]  The Cheltenham Festival is the foremost jump racing festival in the world, and is an annual target for both British and Irish trainers.  The festival hosts races such as the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Champion Hurdle, which are seen as the peak of their disciplines and over the years have been won by horses whose appeal has transcended the sport, including Kauto Star and Desert Orchid.  More widely known still is the Grand National at Aintree, which despite being an anomalously long and difficult race that is historically contested by a lower grade of horses than races at Cheltenham, has produced some of the sports equine superstars, like Red Rum.  It has an estimated global audience of 600 million viewers.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish horse racing is served by a daily, national newspaper, the Racing Post, founded in 1986.  This carries industry news, racecards for all British and Irish race meetings, tipping columns and betting information, as well as smaller sections on greyhound racing and general sport.  There are also dedicated weekly publications including Racing Plus and monthly magazines such as Thoroughbred Owner & Breeder.  In addition, there is a limited amount of racing coverage in broader equestrian magazines, such as Horse & Hound.  Many national dailies also carry racing news and information in their sports pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt various times in history, there has been more than one racing daily, and fierce rivalries have existed between them.[29]  For most of the 20th century, the Sporting Life and Sporting Chronicle were the two competing papers, before the Manchester-based Chronicle closed in 1983 due to debts and falling circulation. The Racing Post was founded in 1986 to fill the gap and challenge the Sporting Life monopoly that resulted and these two were rivals throughout the 80s and 90s.  Ultimately, the Post won the battle when the owners of the Sporting Life, Trinity Mirror, closed the Life and took over the Racing Post trademark.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing back to Victorian times, there was a wide range of sporting newspapers that carried racing news to a greater or lesser extent.  These include Bell's Life in London (forerunner to the Sporting Life),  The Sporting Times and The Sportsman (not to be confused with the short-lived 2006 newspaper of the same name).  In 1840, Bell's Life is reported to compete with the Sunday Times as the two weekly turf newspapers.[30]  There were also four monthly magazines at that time - the Old Sporting Magazine (founded 1792), the New Sporting Magazine (founded 1824), the Sporting Review (founded 1837) and the Sportsman (stated to have originated in 1829, so not the same as the Sportsman above which was founded in 1865).[30]  However, coverage of horse racing in newspapers is believed to date as far back as the Evening English Chronicle in 1779.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two dedicated horse racing channels on British digital television - At The Races (free to air) and Racing UK (subscription only).  Daily broadcasts of British race meetings are split between the two according to contracts arranged by racecourses and racecourse owning groups.  Saturday racing and key midweek festival meetings are also broadcast on terrestrial television by Channel 4, who have been covering the sport since 1984.  The channel broadcasts a four-hour afternoon programme of live racing and an hour-long weekly magazine show on Saturday mornings called The Morning Line.  Since the start of 2013, the network's horse racing output has been fronted by Clare Balding,[32] with support from other presenters such as Nick Luck, Jim McGrath, Alice Plunkett and Mick Fitzgerald.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years, racing was also broadcast on the BBC, who pioneered coverage of the sport in the 1950s.  The network retained the rights to key race meetings, such as the Grand National, Royal Ascot and the Derby until 2012 when it was outbid for the rights by Channel 4.[33]  The BBC broadcast some of the key moments in the history of British horse racing, such as Red Rum winning his third Grand National and the 1967 victory of Foinavon in the same race after most of the field fell at the same fence.  ITV began to show horse racing in its first weeks on air in 1955, and in the 1970s it provided an alternative to BBC coverage with the ITV Seven which featured as part of the channel's World of Sport programme.  This lasted until the early 1980s, when coverage was gradually transferred to Channel 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with other sports, many of the people who have presented racing on TV through the years have become inseparably linked with racing in the public consciousness.   Foremost among these for many years was the BBC's Sir Peter O'Sullevan, known as 'the voice of racing', who commentated on 50 Grand Nationals.[34]  Channel 4's most recognisable racing figure was John McCririck, famed for his eccentric dress sense and use of the bookmakers' sign language 'tic-tac'.  Channel 4 chose not to renew his contract when they became the sole terrestrial racing broadcaster in 2013, leading McCririck to sue them on grounds of ageism.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nWagering money on horse races is as old as the sport itself, but in the United Kingdom the links between horse racing and nationwide wagering are very strong.  Betting shops are common sights in most towns, tending to be sited wherever a significant number of people with disposable cash can be expected.  At one point in the 1970s it was said that the ideal location was \\"close to a pub, the Labour Exchange and the Post Office\\",[by whom?] the first being a source of customers in a good mood, the other two being sources of ready cash in the form of \\"the dole\\" and state pension money, which was dispensed through Post Offices at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as 1938, S500,000,000 was being gambled on horse racing in England according to the Christian Social Council Committee on Gambling.[36]  However, betting shops were not legalised until 1960,[37] at which time many of the famous British betting shop chains such as William Hill, Ladbrokes and Corals were legally established on the high street.  Previously betting was either on course, via certain credit betting offices, or illegally conducted often in or around public houses, with 'bookies runners' ferrying the bets from bookmaker to client.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetting is taxed under the authority of various acts of Parliament.  A gross profit tax is levied on all UK based bookmakers which is payable to the exchequer, and a separate sum is agreed and collected by the Horserace Betting Levy Board, a non-departmental public body of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, who use the funds for race prize money and the improvement of horse racing.[38]  For the latest year reported, the levy resulted in S103.5 million being collected.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMember of Parliament Clement Freud, who himself had owned racehorses, alleged in an article published in the 1970s, before his election to Parliament, that horse racing was organized purely to generate taxes.  He cited the large number of otherwise non-viable racecourses kept open (to ensure sufficient races being run) even as the financial rewards to the owners and trainers declined to the point where most could barely cover their expenses.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 October 2001, the Government abolished the turnover-based tax on betting, which had been 9% of the stake or the winnings, the punter having the choice to pay a certain small amount or an uncertain large amount.[citation needed]  The tax, now based on gross profit, is now effectively indirectly levied on the punters, the cost being absorbed in the odds that bookmakers offer.[neutrality is disputed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last 10 years in the UK has seen massive growth in online gambling. Punters are now going online to place their bets[vague], where technology gives them access to a greater wealth of information and knowledge. Now racing punters exchange information on online forums, tipping sites etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early days of British horse racing, owners tended to ride their own horses in races.  This practice died out as racing became more organised and the owners, most of them aristocrats, had grooms ride the horses instead.  Jockeys at this time were often scruffy and unkempt and not well-regarded.[39]  Nevertheless, several Yorkshire-based jockeys became acclaimed in the mid-to-late 18th century.  These included John Mangle, Bill Pierse, John Shepherd, three different individuals named John Singleton, Ben Smith and Bill Clift.[40]  Between them they won many of the early runnings of the oldest classic, the St. Leger.  Their counterparts in the south became similarly celebrated, and exercised a similar dominance over the Newmarket classics. Amongst their number were Sam Chifney, Jem Robinson, the Arnull family - John, Sam and Bill - and \\"the first man to bring respectability to the profession\\" - Frank Buckle.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 19th century was dominated by three jockeys - Nat Flatman, George Fordham and Fred Archer - who between them won forty flat jockeys' championships. With the expansion of print media and the growth of interest in horse racing among ordinary people, these jockeys became nationally recognised figures, with a profile enjoyed by the footballers and TV celebrities of today. When Archer died at his own hand, it is said:\\r\\n\\r\\n                  - Tanner & Cranham, pp 78-79\\r\\n\\r\\nThe high profile of jockeys at this time is illustrated (literally) by the number of caricatures of jockeys that feature in Victorian society magazine, Vanity Fair, alongside MPs, aristocrats and other national figures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree figures dominate the flat racing scene of the 20th century too - Steve Donoghue, Gordon Richards and Lester Piggott.  Richards is often regarded as the greatest jockey ever[42] and set many records which still stand, including most flat race victories and most flat jockey championships.  Piggott is descended from the great racing families of the 19th century, the Days and the Cannons, and for many is the greatest jockey still living.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the modern day, Frankie Dettori is the jockey with the widest public profile beyond racing, appearing on Celebrity Big Brother[43] and launching his own food range.[44]  He has also gained public attention for his feats on the racetrack, including his 'Magnificent Seven' wins at Ascot in 1997[45] and three jockeys' championships. Kieren Fallon was a regular champion around the turn of the century and still rides today, and younger jockeys to have won multiple championships include Ryan Moore, Jamie Spencer and Paul Hanagan.  In recent years, Hayley Turner has come to prominence as the first British woman to win a Group 1 race outright[46] and as Champion Apprentice in 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, jumps jockeys have not had the same profile as their flat counterparts, but this changed to some extent in the 20th century. The large television audience enjoyed by the Grand National has helped in this regard.  Previously unknown jockeys like 2013 winner Ryan Mania have received their first nationwide coverage as a result of the race.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most-celebrated jumps jockey of all-time is the Northern Irishman Tony McCoy, winner of every Jumps Jockeys' Championship from 1995/96 until 2014/15 and the only horse racing figure to ever win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.[48]\\r\\nHe broke Gordon Richards' record for most winners in a season in 2001/02 and his total number of career wins by the time he retired was 4,358, well eclipsing the numbers set by Peter Scudamore and Richard Dunwoody who between them were the leading jumps jockeys of the 1980s and early 1990s.  Richard Johnson, who has been second to McCoy in nearly all of his championships has the second most wins jockey of all time, and gained tabloid fame in the late 1990s for his relationship with Zara Philips.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer champion jump jockeys Dick Francis and John Francome have become known to a wider public after enjoying second careers as writers of racing-based fiction,[50] while Francome (until the end of 2012) and Mick Fitzgerald are known as horse racing TV pundits.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of November 2017, there are around 450 professional jockeys licensed in the United Kingdom, along with around 300 amateur riders.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two dominant forces in flat training in Britain in the modern era are Irish-based trainer Aidan O'Brien and Godolphin, through their trainers Saeed Bin Suroor and Charlie Appleby.  They largely concentrate on Group races.  Operating in much larger numbers of runners, but with a greater spread of quality, are trainers such as Mark Johnston, Richard Hannon Jr. and Richard Fahey.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the jumps sphere, Nicky Henderson and Paul Nicholls dominate, along with the likes of David Pipe, Philip Hobbs, Jonjo O'Neill and Dan Skelton. In recent years, the Irish trainer Willie Mullins has enjoyed huge success in Britain, coming close to taking the Trainers Championship in 2015/16.\\r\\n\\r\\nAristocratic families have always owned horses in Britain and the list of Classic winners features names such as the Earl of Grafton, Earl Grosvenor and Earl of Egremont from early days.  In the modern era, the Queen continues to retain a stable of horses trained by the likes of Michael Stoute.  The Queen Mother was famously keen on horse racing and a race at the Cheltenham Festival, the Queen Mother Champion Chase, is named in her honour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two most prominent flat owners of the current era are Sheikh Mohammed, under the Godolphin banner and the team of Michael Tabor, John Magnier and others, based in Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\nProminent jumps owners include JP McManus, Graham Wylie and Trevor Hemmings\\r\\n\\r\\nModern-day racing originated in Britain, so many figures from British racing have shaped the sport.  Admiral Rous established the handicapping process for horse racing , including the weight-for-age scale, while in the 20th century, form expert and some time administrator of the sport, Phil Bull established Timeform whose ratings are often used to assess the all-time great horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nKey data for 2004, 2005 and 2010 extracted from the British Horseracing Board's annual reports for  2004 and 2005, the 2010 annual reportfrom its successor organisation, the British Horseracing Authority and the 2011/12 British Horseracing Fact Book\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Executive of the BHB stated in the 2005 annual report that \\"Success was achieved in an environment of great uncertainty.\\" The sport is adapting to the loss of income from pre-race data following court ruling prohibiting the practice of charging for such in 2004 and 2005, to which the BHB attributes the fall in prize money in 2005. The data charges were themselves designed to replace income lost when a statutory levy was abolished. In 2004 attendances exceeded 6 million for the first time since the 1950s (2004 annual report). The decrease in 2005 is attributable to the closure of Ascot Racecourse for redevelopment for the entire year.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2006 investigation by The Observer found that each year 6-10,000 horses are slaughtered for consumption abroad, a significant proportion of which are horses bred for racing.?[52]\\r\\nThe industry produces approximately 5,000 foals, whilst 4-5,000 racehorses are retired each year, 90 being taken into care by the industries charity Retraining of Racehorses.?[52] Research conducted by the Equine Fertility Unit found that 66% of thoroughbred foals were never entered for a race, and more than 80% were no longer in training after four years.?[52] Foal production has increased threefold since 1966.?[52] Racehorses are capable of living for more than 30 years.?[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganisations\\r\\n\\r\\nMedia","input":"What is the oldest horse race in england?"},{"output":"fourth century BCE","context":"The petroleum industry is not of recent origin, but petroleum's current status as the key component of politics, society, and technology has its roots in the early 20th century. The invention of the internal combustion engine was the major influence in the rise in the importance of petroleum.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFour thousand years ago, according to Herodotus and confirmed by Diodorus Siculus, asphalt was used in the construction of the walls and towers of Babylon; there were oil pits near Ardericca (near Babylon), and a pitch spring on Zacynthus (Ionian islands, Greece).[1] Great quantities of it were found on the banks of the river Issus[citation needed], one of the tributaries of the Euphrates. Ancient Persian tablets indicate the medicinal and lighting uses of petroleum in the upper levels of their society[citation needed].\\r\\nOil was exploited in the Roman province of Dacia, now in Romania, where it was called picula.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe use of petroleum dates back to ancient China more than 2000 years ago. In I Ching, one of the earliest Chinese writings cites the use of oil in its raw state without refining was first discovered, extracted, and used in China in the first century BCE. In addition, the Chinese were the first to use petroleum as fuel as the early as the fourth century BCE.[2][3][4][5]\\r\\nThe earliest known oil wells were drilled in China in 347 AD or earlier. They had depths of up to about 800 feet (240?m) and were drilled using bits attached to bamboo poles.[6][7][8][9][unreliable source?] The oil was burned to evaporate brine and produce salt. By the 10th century, extensive bamboo pipelines connected oil wells with salt springs. The ancient records of China and Japan are said to contain many allusions to the use of natural gas for lighting and heating. Petroleum was known as burning water in Japan in the 7th century.[1] In his book Dream Pool Essays written in 1088, the polymathic scientist and statesman Shen Kuo of the Song Dynasty coined the word fS (Shy܇u, literally \\"rock oil\\") for petroleum, which remains the term used in contemporary Chinese and Japanese (Sekiy).\\r\\nThe first streets of Baghdad were paved with tar, derived from petroleum that became accessible from natural fields in the region. In the 9th century, oil fields were exploited in the area around modern Baku, Azerbaijan. These fields were described by the Arab geographer Abu al-Hasan 'Alؐ al-Mas'dؐ in the 10th century, and by Marco Polo in the 13th century, who described the output of those wells as hundreds of shiploads. Distillation of Petroleum was described by the Persian alchemist, Muhammad ibn Zakarؐya Rzi (Rhazes).[10][unreliable source] There was production of chemicals such as kerosene in the alembic (al-ambiq),[11] which was mainly used for kerosene lamps.[12] Arab and Persian chemists also distilled crude oil in order to produce flammable products for military purposes. Through Islamic Spain, distillation became available in Western Europe by the 12th century.[13] It has also been present in Romania since the 13th century, being recorded as p?cur?.[14]\\r\\nThe earliest mention of petroleum in the Americas occurs in Sir Walter Raleigh's account of the Trinidad Pitch Lake in 1595; while thirty-seven years later, the account of a visit of a Franciscan, Joseph de la Roche d'Allion, to the oil springs of New York was published in Gabriel Sagard's Histoire du Canada. A Finnish born Swede, scientist and student of Carl Linnaeus, Peter Kalm, in his work Travels into North America published first in 1753 showed on a map the oil springs of Pennsylvania.[1]\\r\\nIn 1710 or 1711 (sources vary) the Russian-born Swiss physician and Greek teacher Eirini d'Eyrinys (also spelled as Eirini d'Eirinis) discovered asphaltum at Val-de-Travers, (Neuchatel). He established a bitumen mine de la Presta there in 1719 that operated until 1986.[15][16][17][18]\\r\\nIn 1745 under the Empress Elizabeth of Russia the first oil well and refinery were built in Ukhta by Fiodor Priadunov. Through the process of distillation of the \\"rock oil\\" (petroleum) he received a kerosene-like substance, which was used in oil lamps by Russian churches and monasteries (though households still relied on candles).[19]\\r\\nOil sands were mined from 1745 in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, Alsace under the direction of Louis Pierre Ancillon de la Sablonnire, by special appointment of Louis XV.[20][21] The Pechelbronn oil field was active until 1970, and was the birthplace of companies like Antar and Schlumberger. The first modern refinery was built there in 1857.[20]\\r\\nThe modern history of petroleum began in the 19th century with the refining of paraffin from crude oil. The Scottish chemist James Young in 1847 noticed a natural petroleum seepage in the Riddings colliery at Alfreton, Derbyshire from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil, at the same time obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery. In 1846, Baku (settlement Bibi-Heybat) the first ever well drilled with percussion tools to a depth of 21 meters for oil exploration. In 1848, Young set up a small business refining the crude oil. The new oils were successful, but the supply of oil from the coal mine soon began to fail (eventually being exhausted in 1851). Young, noticing that the oil was dripping from the sandstone roof of the coal mine, theorized that it somehow originated from the action of heat on the coal seam and from this thought that it might be produced artificially.\\r\\nFollowing up this idea, he tried many experiments and eventually succeeded, by distilling cannel coal at a low heat, a fluid resembling petroleum, which when treated in the same way as the seep oil gave similar products. Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named \\"paraffine oil\\" because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax.[22]\\r\\nThe production of these oils and solid paraffin wax from coal formed the subject of his patent dated 17 October 1850. In 1850 Young & Meldrum and Edward William Binney entered into partnership under the title of E.W. Binney & Co. at Bathgate in West Lothian and E. Meldrum & Co. at Glasgow; their works at Bathgate were completed in 1851 and became the first truly commercial oil-works and oil refinery in the world, using oil extracted from locally mined torbanite, shale, and bituminous coal to manufacture naphtha and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold till 1856.\\r\\nAbraham Pineo Gesner, a Canadian geologist developed a process to refine a liquid fuel from coal, bitumen and oil shale. His new discovery, which he named kerosene, burned more cleanly and was less expensive than competing products, such as whale oil. In 1850, Gesner created the Kerosene Gaslight Company and began installing lighting in the streets in Halifax and other cities. By 1854, he had expanded to the United States where he created the North American Kerosene Gas Light Company at Long Island, New York. Demand grew to where his companys capacity to produce became a problem, but the discovery of petroleum, from which kerosene could be more easily produced, solved the supply problem.\\r\\nIn 1848 first modern oil well is drilled in Asia, on the Aspheron Peninsula north-east of Baku, by Russian engineer F.N. Semyenov.[23]\\r\\nIgnacy ?ukasiewicz improved Gesner's method to develop a means of refining kerosene from the more readily available \\"rock oil\\" (\\"petr-oleum\\") seeps, in 1852, and the first rock oil mine was built in B܇brka, near Krosno in central European Galicia (Poland) in 1854. These discoveries rapidly spread around the world, and Meerzoeff built the first modern Russian refinery in the mature oil fields at Baku in 1861. At that time Baku produced about 90% of the world's oil.\\r\\nThe question of what constituted the first commercial oil well is a difficult one to answer. Edwin Drake's 1859 well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, discussed more fully below, is popularly considered the first modern well.[24] Drake's well is probably singled out because it was drilled, not dug; because it used a steam engine; because there was a company associated with it; and because it touched off a major boom. However, the first well ever drilled anywhere in the world, which produced oil, was drilled in 1857 to a depth of 280 feet by the American Merrimac Company in La Brea (Spanish for Pitch) in southeast Trinidad in the Caribbean [25]. Additionally, there was considerable activity before Drake in various parts of the world in the mid-19th century. A group directed by Major Alexeyev of the Bakinskii Corps of Mining Engineers hand-drilled a well in the Baku region in 1848.[26] There were engine-drilled wells in West Virginia in the same year as Drake's well.[27] An early commercial well was hand dug in Poland in 1853, and another in nearby Romania in 1857. At around the same time the world's first, but small, oil refineries were opened at Jas?o, in Poland, with a larger one being opened at Ploie?ti, in Romania, shortly after. Romania is the first country in the world to have its crude oil output officially recorded in international statistics, namely 275 tonnes.[28][29] In 1875, crude oil was discovered by David Beaty at his home in Warren, Pennsylvania. This led to the opening of the Bradford oil field, which, by the 1880s, produced 77 percent of the global oil supply. However, by the end of the 19th century, the Russian Empire, particularly the Branobel company in Azerbaijan, had taken the lead in production.[30]\\r\\nSamuel Kier established America's first oil refinery in Pittsburgh on Seventh avenue near Grant Street, in 1853. In addition to the activity in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, an important early oil well in North America was in Oil Springs, Ontario, Canada in 1858, dug by James Miller Williams.[31] The discovery at Oil Springs touched off an oil boom which brought hundreds of speculators and workers to the area. New oil fields were discovered nearby throughout the late 19th century and the area developed into a large petrochemical refining centre and exchange.[32] The modern US petroleum industry is considered to have begun with Edwin Drake's drilling of a 69-foot (21?m) oil well in 1859,[33] on Oil Creek near Titusville, Pennsylvania, for the Seneca Oil Company (originally yielding 25 barrels per day (4.0?m3/d), by the end of the year output was at the rate of 15 barrels per day (2.4?m3/d)). The industry grew through the 1800s, driven by the demand for kerosene and oil lamps. It became a major national concern in the early part of the 20th century; the introduction of the internal combustion engine provided a demand that has largely sustained the industry to this day. Early \\"local\\" finds like those in Pennsylvania and Ontario were quickly outpaced by demand, leading to \\"oil booms\\" in Ohio, Texas, Oklahoma, and California.\\r\\nBy 1910, significant oil fields had been discovered in the Dutch East Indies (1885, in Sumatra), Persia (1908, in Masjed Soleiman), Peru (1863, in Zorritos District), Venezuela (1914, in Maracaibo Basin), and Mexico, and were being developed at an industrial level. Significant oil fields were exploited in Alberta (Canada) from 1947. First offshore oil drilling at Oil Rocks (Neft Dashlari) in the Caspian Sea off Azerbaijan eventually resulted in a city built on pylons in 1949. Availability of oil and access to it, became of \\"cardinal importance\\" in military power before[34] and after World War I, particularly for navies as they changed from coal, but also with the introduction of motor transport, tanks and airplanes.[35] Such thinking would continue in later conflicts of the twentieth century, including World War II, during which oil facilities were a major strategic asset and were extensively bombed.[36] In 1938, vast reserves of oil were discovered in the Al-Ahsa region along the coast of the Persian Gulf.\\r\\nUntil the mid-1950s coal was still the world's foremost fuel, but after this time oil quickly took over. Later, following the 1973 and 1979 energy crises, there was significant media coverage on the subject of oil supply levels. This brought to light the concern that oil is a limited resource that will eventually run out, at least as an economically viable energy source. Although at the time the most common and popular predictions were quite dire, a period of increased production and reduced demand in the following years caused an oil glut in the 1980s. This was not to last, however, and by the first decade of the 21st century discussions about peak oil had returned to the news.\\r\\nToday, about 90% of vehicular fuel needs are met by oil. Petroleum also makes up 40% of total energy consumption in the United States, but is responsible for only 2% of electricity generation. Petroleum's worth as a portable, dense energy source powering the vast majority of vehicles and as the base of many industrial chemicals makes it one of the world's most important commodities.\\r\\nThe top three oil producing countries are Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States.[37] About 80% of the world's readily accessible reserves are located in the Middle East, with 62.5% coming from the Arab 5: Saudi Arabia (12.5%), UAE, Iraq, Qatar and Kuwait. However, with high oil prices (above $100/barrel), Venezuela has larger reserves than Saudi Arabia due to its crude reserves derived from bitumen.\\r\\n29. ^ www.geohelp.net/world.html\\r\\n30. ^ www.azer.com/.../102_oil_chronology.html\\r\\n31. ^ archives.datapages.com/data/phi/v12_2011/yusif.pdf\\r\\n32. ^ www.energy-101.org/non-renewable-energy/petroleum-facts/petroleum-history","input":"When was oil first used as an energy source?"},{"output":"part of the executive branch of the U.S. government that normally acts as an advisory body to the President of the United States","context":" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cabinet of the United States is part of the executive branch of the U.S. government that normally acts as an advisory body to the President of the United States.

Secretary of State William H. Seward and then Professor Woodrow Wilson advocated use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government. But President Abraham Lincoln rebuffed Seward, and Woodrow Wilson would have none of it in his administration.

Daffy explains that he and other travelers settled there in secret several years earlier, but difficulties arose and he chose to leave. Daffy commits suicide, leaving Richard a map to the island. Richard convinces a young French couple, Fran?oise and tienne, to accompany him to the island, and the three travel to Ko Samui. Richard meets two Americans who have heard rumors of the island, including that huge amounts of cannabis supposedly grow there. Before departing, Richard leaves them a copy of the map.\\r\\nEn route to the island, Richard becomes infatuated with Fran?oise. After swimming to the island from a neighboring one, they find a large cannabis plantation guarded by armed Thai farmers. Avoiding detection, they make their way across the island and are welcomed into the secret beach settlement.

Things return to normal until a shark attack kills one of the community's fishermen and leaves another, Christo, severely injured. Sal refuses to compromise the community's secrecy by bringing medical help, and Christo is unable to travel to the mainland.

The farmers have also found the map that Richard had given the (now dead) Americans, furious with the community for breaking their deal to not allow anymore newcomers. Richard's part in the sexual betrayals of Fran?oise, tienne and Bugs has already frayed the community's cohesion. The lead farmer gives Sal a gun loaded with a single bullet and orders her to make a choice: kill Richard and the group will be allowed to stay, or else they must all leave immediately. Sal pulls the trigger, but the chamber is empty. Shocked by her willingness to commit murder, the community abandons Sal, leaving the island and going their separate ways.\\r\\nLater, Richard receives an email at an Internet cafe from Fran?oise with a group photograph of the beach community in happier times.\\r\\nAdditional beach community members are played by Myriam Acharki, Andrew Carmichael, Josh Cole, Hlne de Fougerolles, Stacy Hart, Nina Jacques, Sheridan Jones, Gunilla Karlson, Sian Martin, Isabella Seibert, Elizabeth Thomas, Michael Thorpe, Timothy Webster, and Ramon Woolfe.\\r\\nAdditional cannabis farmers are portrayed by Sanya 'Gai' Cheunjit, Kaneung 'Nueng' Kenia, Somchai Santitarangkul, Seng Kawee, and Somkuan 'Kuan' Siroun.\\r\\nEwan McGregor was cast as the main character before leaving due to disputes with the director. It was speculated that Boyle was offered additional funding under the condition that DiCaprio be cast and his character made American.[2]\\r\\nReal-life drama unfurled on set one day when the cast and crew were involved in a boating accident during production. It was reported that the incident involved both Boyle and DiCaprio. No one was injured.[3]\\r\\nThe beach seen in the film is not the same as in real life. There is a gap between mountains on the actual beach in Thailand. The special effects crew digitally added some of the surrounding mountains during the post-production phase. The actual beach was also transformed from its natural look. It is reported that crew members flattened the beach with a tractor, much to the locals' dismay. The tsunami of 2004, however, has reshaped the beach to its natural look.[citation needed]\\r\\nBoyle has been cited saying that the look of the jungle scenes in the film was inspired by the Rare/Nintendo game Banjo-Kazooie.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe waterfall scene, where DiCaprio and others jump from a high cliff to the water below, was filmed in Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand, at the Haew Suwat Waterfall.\\r\\nThe map in the film was illustrated by the author of the book that The Beach was based upon, Alex Garland. He received credit for this as the cartographer.\\r\\nControversy arose during the making of the film due to 20th Century Fox's bulldozing and landscaping of the natural beach setting of Ko Phi Phi Leh to make it more \\"paradise-like\\". The production altered some sand dunes and cleared some coconut trees and grass to widen the beach. Fox set aside a fund to reconstruct and return the beach to its natural state; however, lawsuits were filed by environmentalists who believed the damage to the ecosystem was permanent and restoration attempts had failed.[4] Following shooting of the film, there was a clear flat area at one end of the beach that was created artificially with an odd layout of trees which was never rectified, and the entire area remained damaged from the original state until the tsunami of 2004.\\r\\nThe lawsuits dragged on for years. In 2006, Thailand's Supreme Court upheld an appellate court ruling that the filming had harmed the environment and ordered that damage assessments be made. Defendants in the case included 20th Century Fox and some Thai government officials.[5]\\r\\nAfter the film premiered in Thailand in 2000, some Thai politicians were upset at the way Thailand was depicted in the film and called for it to be banned. The depiction of the drug culture was said to give Thailand a bad image and having a statue of Buddha in a bar was cited as \\"blasphemous\\".[6]\\r\\nThe soundtrack for the film, co-produced by Pete Tong, features the international hits \\"Pure Shores\\" by All Saints and \\"Porcelain\\" by Moby, as well as tracks by New Order, Blur, Underworld, Orbital, Faithless, Sugar Ray, and others. Leftfield's contribution to the soundtrack, \\"Snakeblood\\", was found to have sampled Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's \\"Almost\\" without permission, leading to a lawsuit; band member Neil Barnes said he forgot to remove the sample from the finished track.[7] The songs \\"Synasthasia\\" by Junkie XL, \\"Out of Control\\" by The Chemical Brothers, \\"Fiesta Conga\\" by Movin' Melodies, \\"Redemption Song\\" by Bob Marley, \\"Neon Reprise\\" by Lunatic Calm and \\"Smoke Two Joints\\" by Chris Kay and Michael Kay were also included in the movie but omitted from the soundtrack. The teaser trailer for the film featured \\"Touched\\" by VAST.\\r\\nThe film score was composed by Angelo Badalamenti, and a separate album containing selections of his score was released as well.\\r\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 20% based on 117 reviews, and an average rating of 4.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Beach is unfocused and muddled, a shallow adaptation of the novel it is based on. Points go to the gorgeous cinematography, though.\\"[8] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".[9]\\r\\nCritics suggested that DiCaprio's fame post-Titanic might have contributed to the financial success of this film, which came out less than three years after the James Cameron blockbuster. CNN's Paul Clinton said \\"Leonardo DiCaprio's main fan base of screaming adolescent girls won't be disappointed with The Beach. The majority of the film displays the titanic-sized young heartthrob sans his shirt in this story about the pseudo-angst and alienation of a young man from the United States escaping civilization and his computer-obsessed generation.\\" He agreed with most others that The Beach was \\"nothing to write home about\\". DiCaprio was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Actor for his work on the film.\\r\\nThe budget of the film was US$50 million. Global takings totaled over US$144 million, of which US$39 million was from the USA.[10]\\r\\nDirector Boyle has spoken negatively of the film, telling a Philadelphia audience in 2017 that he realized halfway through filming that he \\"didn't like any of the characters.\\"\\r\\nThe film has been released on VHS and DVD. The standard DVD release included nine scenes that were deleted from the movie, including an alternative opening which to a degree resembles the one in the novel, were later included in a Special Edition DVD release, along with Danny Boyle's commentary on what might have been their purpose. There is also an alternative ending which depicts Sal committing suicide and everyone loading up on a boat from the raft.","input":"Where did they film the beach leonardo dicaprio?"},{"output":"a synovial plane joint","context":"The sacroiliac joint or SI joint (SIJ) is the joint between the sacrum and the ilium bones of the pelvis, which are connected by strong ligaments. In humans, the sacrum supports the spine  and is supported in turn by an ilium on each side. The joint is strong,  supporting the entire weight of the upper body.  It is a synovial plane joint with irregular elevations and depressions that produce interlocking of the two bones.[1] The human body has two sacroiliac joints, one on the left and one on the right, that often match each other but are highly variable from person to person.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nSacroiliac joints are paired C-shaped or L-shaped joints capable of a small amount of movement[2] (2ÿ18 degrees, which is debatable at this time) that are formed between the auricular surfaces of the sacrum and the ilium bones. The joints are covered by two different kinds of cartilage; the sacral surface has hyaline cartilage and the iliac surface has fibrocartilage.[2] The SIJ's stability is maintained mainly through a combination of only some bony structure and very strong intrinsic and extrinsic ligaments.[3] The joint space is usually 0.5 to 4 mm.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we age the characteristics of the sacroiliac joint change.[5] The joint's surfaces are flat or planar in early life but as we start walking, the sacroiliac joint surfaces develop distinct angular orientations and lose their planar or flat topography.[2] They also develop an elevated ridge along the iliac surface and a depression along the sacral surface.[6] The ridge and corresponding depression, along with the very strong ligaments, increase the sacroiliac joints' stability and makes dislocations very rare. The fossae lumbales laterales (\\"dimples of Venus\\") correspond to the superficial topography of the sacroiliac joints.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ligaments of the sacroiliac joint include the following:[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe anterior ligament is not much of a ligament at all and in most cases is just a slight thickening of the anterior joint capsule. The anterior ligament is thin and not as well defined as the posterior sacroiliac ligaments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe posterior sacroiliac (SI) ligaments can be further divided into short (intrinsic) and long (extrinsic).[7] The dorsal interosseous ligaments are very strong ligaments. They are often stronger than bone, such that the pelvis may actually fracture before the ligament tears. The dorsal sacroiliac ligaments include both long and short ligaments. The long dorsal sacroiliac joint ligaments run in an oblique vertical direction while the short (interosseous) runs perpendicular from just behind the articular surfaces of the sacrum to the ilium and functions to keep the sacroiliac joint from distracting or opening. The sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments (also known as the extrinsic sacroiliac joint ligaments) limit the amount the sacrum flexes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ligaments of the sacroiliac joint loosen during pregnancy due to the hormone relaxin; this loosening, along with that of the related symphysis pubis, permits the pelvic joints to widen during the birthing process. The long SI ligaments may be palpated in thin persons for pain and compared from one side of the body to the other; however, the reliability and the validity of comparing ligaments for pain have currently not been shown. The interosseous ligaments are very short and run perpendicular from the iliac surface to the sacrum, they keep the auricular surfaces from abducting or opening/distracting.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most lower extremity joints, one of the SI joints' functions is shock absorption (depending on the amount of available motion at the sacroiliac joint) for the spine, along with the job of torque conversion allowing the transverse rotations that take place in the lower extremity to be transmitted up the spine. The SI joint, like all lower extremity joints, provides a \\"self-locking\\" mechanism (where the joint occupies or attains its most congruent position, also called the close pack position) that helps with stability during the push-off phase of walking.[8] The joint locks (or rather becomes close packed) on one side as weight is transferred from one leg to the other, and through the pelvis the body weight is transmitted from the sacrum to the hip bone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe motions of the sacroiliac joint\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sacroiliac joints like all spinal joints (except the atlanto-axial) are bicondylar joints, meaning that movement of one side corresponds to a correlative movement of the other side.\\r\\n\\r\\nSacroiliitis refers to inflammation of one or both sacroiliac joints, and is one cause of unilateral low back pain. With sacroiliitis, the individual may experience pain in the low back, buttock or thigh, depending on the amount of inflammation. Common problems of the sacroiliac joint are often called sacroiliac joint dysfunction (also termed SI joint dysfunction; SIJD). Sacroiliac joint dysfunction generally refers to pain in the sacroiliac joint region that is caused by abnormal motion in the sacroiliac joint, either too much motion or too little motion. It typically results in inflammation of the SI joint, or sacroiliitis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following are signs and symptoms that may be associated with an SI joint (SIJ) problem:\\r\\n\\r\\nSacroiliac joint dysfunction is tested using provocative and nonprovocative maneuvers. Nonprovocative sacroiliac joint examination maneuvers would include Gillet Test, prone knee flexion test, supine long sitting test, standing flexion test, and seated flexion test. There is a lack of evidence that these sacroiliac joint mobility maneuvers detect motion abnormalities.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the inherent technical limitations of the visible and palpable signs from these sacroiliac joint mobility maneuvers another broad category of clinical signs have been described called provocative maneuvers. These maneuvers are designed to reproduce or increase pain originating from within the sacroiliac joint. \\r\\nWhen the provocative maneuvers reproduce pain along the typical area raises suspicion for sacroiliac joint dysfunction. However no single test is very reliable in the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Weakness, numbness, or the loss of a related reflex may indicate nervous system damage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current gold standard for diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction emanating within the joint is sacroiliac joint injection confirmed under fluoroscopy or CT-guidance using a local anesthetic solution. The diagnosis is confirmed when the patient reports a significant change in relief from pain and the diagnostic injection is performed on 2 separate visits. Published studies have used at least a 75 percent change in relief of pain before a response is considered positive and the sacroiliac joint deemed the source of pain.[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hormonal changes of menstruation, pregnancy, and lactation can affect the integrity of the ligament support around the SIJ, which is why women often find the days leading up to their period are when the pain is at its worst. During pregnancy, female hormones are released that allow the connective tissues in the body to relax. The relaxation is necessary so that during delivery, the female pelvis can stretch enough to allow birth. This stretching results in changes to the SIJs, making them overly mobile. Over a period of years, these changes can eventually lead to wear-and-tear arthritis. As would be expected, the more pregnancies a woman has, the higher her chances of SI joint problems. During the pregnancy, micro tears and small gas pockets can appear within the joint. [This paragraph needs citations]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuscle imbalance, trauma (e.g., falling on the buttock) and hormonal changes can all lead to SIJ dysfunction. Sacroiliac joint pain may be felt anteriorly, however, care must be taken to differentiate this from hip joint pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen are considered more likely to suffer from sacroiliac pain than men, mostly because of structural and hormonal differences between the sexes, but so far no credible evidence exists that confirms this notion. Female anatomy often allows one fewer sacral segment to lock with the pelvis, and this may increase instability.\\r\\n\\r\\nSacroiliac joint. Deep dissection.

The tallest building in the city is the 85-story Panorama Tower, which rises 868 feet (265?m) in Miami's Brickell district and on March 24, 2017 surpassed all other buildings in height. It is to be completed by the end of 2017. Eight of the ten tallest buildings in Florida are located in Miami. By 2020 there will be 10 more buildings in Miami with more than 65 stories each.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMiami's history of high-rises began with the 1912 completion of the sixÿstory Burdine's Department Store, although the Freedom Tower, built in 1925, is Miami's best-known early skyscraper and remains an icon of the city. From the mid-1990s through the late 2000s, Miami went through the largest building boom in the city's history. In what was dubbed a \\"Manhattanization wave\\", there were nearly 60 structures proposed, approved or under construction in the city that were planned to rise over 492 feet (150?m) in height. As a result of the construction boom, only two of the city's 25 tallest buildings were completed before the year 2000, and the city has one of largest skylines in the United States, generally ranking only behind New York City and Chicago.[2] The boom, however, ended abruptly around 2008 when the real estate market crashed and the late-2000s recession began. By 2011 the market began to return, with new office and condominium projects such as Brickell House announced for construction beginning in 2012.[3] This was followed by a second boom that is currently active As of January?2018[update]. This second boom has more proposed towers for the region than were built in the first boom from 2003 to 2010.[4] Only 10 buildings out of 75 on the list were built before 2000, and only 18 were built before 2005.\\r\\nThe tallest skyscraper currently under construction is Panorama Tower in Brickell. It has reached the height taller than any other building in Miami, (Aug 2017) and will continue to rise.[5] The tallest active proposals include One Bayfront Plaza (OBP)[6] and One Brickell City Centre (OBCC),[7] both of which may rise over 1,000 feet (305?m). One Bayfront Plaza is a mixed-use building proposed for 100 South Biscayne Boulevard, approved for construction since 2007, and scheduled to be completed as early as 2018. Since then, it has gone through several design changes and does not have a reliable construction date. By the end of 2016, there were about ten proposals for supertall buildings in downtown and Brickell. In addition to OBCC and OPB, these included The Towers by Foster + Partners, One MiamiCentral, 300 Biscayne, Capital at Brickell (CCCC Miami), World Trade Center of the Americas, Skyrise (tower), as well as the more speculative Sky Plaza and One Fifth.[8]\\r\\nOne Bayfront Plaza[9] was for many years the tallest building ever to be approved for construction in the city, at the maximum FAA height limit of 1,049 feet (320?m), though several other buildings were approved at similar heights in the mid-2010s. It was later reduced and is expected to rise 1,010 feet (308?m), with 80 floors.[10] It also has the distinction of being the first skyscraper over 1,000?feet (305?m), known as a \\"supertall\\", to be approved in Miami. Several other buildings have been proposed to rise over 1,000 feet (305?m), including One Brickell City Centre, but have been reduced by the FAA. Approvals for comparably tall buildings in Miami are very rare due to the proximity of Miami International Airport (MIA). The main runways of MIA align planes taking off and landing directly over the greater downtown area, and for this reason the Federal Aviation Administration sets precise height limits for construction in Downtown Miami. The fate of high rise construction in Miami was greatly threatened by a \\"One Engine Inoperative\\" (OEI) policy proposed by the FAA in 2014. This proposal would drastically reduce the maximum permitted height of structures around 388 airports in the country, even causing existing structures to be modified.[11] In the end, the FAA did not go forward with the extreme limitations and even began giving quicker approvals to buildings with heights up to 1,049 feet (320?m) above sea level, leading to many proposed and approved supertall projects.[8]\\r\\nThis lists ranks the tallest buildings in Miami that stand at least 400?ft (or 122m) tall, based on standard height measurement. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts.[A] An equals sign (=) following a rank indicates the same height between two or more buildings. The \\"Year\\" column indicates the year in which a building was completed or topped-out. Where applicable, floor counts are given by the observed measurements, as reported floor counts may include many skipped floors, not limited to floor 13.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis lists the tallest building in each neighborhood, district, or sub-district of Miami. Note that all buildings over 400 feet (120?m) are within the Greater Downtown area between the Julia Tuttle Causeway and Rickenbacker Causeway, east of Interstate 95. The \\"Year\\" column indicates the year in which a building was completed or topped-out for still under construction or stalled buildings.\\r\\nAll of the planned high-rise buildings that were not constructed by the 2008 financial crisis were either put on hold or cancelled altogether until 2011 as the market was becoming stable once again.\\r\\nThis lists buildings that are currently under construction in Miami and are planned to rise at least 400?feet (122?m). Buildings that have already been topped out are moved to the main list.\\r\\n* Table entries with dashes () indicate that information regarding expected building dates of completion has not yet been released.\\r\\nThis list contains buildings that are approved by the city for construction and are planned to rise at least 400?feet (122?m). Many of these buildings were approved during the 2000s Miami Skyscraper Boom, but were put on hold during the Great Recession and have been announced to start construction in 2013 and early 2014.\\r\\nThere have been several buildings in Miami that have served as the tallest building in the city. While the 5-story Burdine's Department Store was the first high-rise building in the city, the Freedom Tower is generally regarded as Miami's first skyscraper. From 2003 to 2008, the Manhattanization of the city led to a huge amount of new development. Several buildings were under construction, and many that were approved or proposed could have earned the title of tallest building in the city upon completion. However, other than the Four Seasons Hotel (2003), none of them made it before the market crashed in 2007. In 2017, Panorama Tower will overtake Four Seasons as the tallest in the city and the state. In a second building boom from 2014 to 2017, many more skyscrapers in excess of 800 feet (240?m) were approved by the FAA, including several 1,000-foot (300?m) supertalls.","input":"What is the tallest building in miami florida?"},{"output":"43,560 square feet","context":"The acre is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems. It is defined as the area of 1 chain by 1 furlong (66 by 660 feet), which is exactly equal to ?1?640 of a square mile, 43,560 square feet, approximately 4,047?m2, or about 40% of a hectare.\\r\\nThe acre is commonly used in Antigua and Barbuda,[1] American Samoa,[2] the Bahamas,[3] Belize,[4] the British Virgin Islands,[5] the Cayman Islands,[6] Canada,[7] Dominica,[8] the Falkland Islands,[9] Grenada,[10] Ghana,[citation needed] Guam,[11] the Northern Mariana Islands,[12] India,[citation needed] Sri Lanka,[citation needed]Bangladesh,[citation needed]Nepal,[citation needed] Ireland,[13] Jamaica,[14] Montserrat,[15] Myanmar,[citation needed] Pakistan,[citation needed] Samoa,[16] St. Lucia,[17] St. Helena,[18] St. Kitts and Nevis,[19] St. Vincent and the Grenadines,[20] Turks and Caicos,[21] the United Kingdom, the United States[citation needed] and the US Virgin Islands.[22]\\r\\nThe international symbol of the acre is ac. The most commonly used acre today is the international acre. In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use, but differ by only two parts per million; see below. The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land. One international acre is defined as exactly 4,046.8564224?square metres.\\r\\nAn acre was defined in the Middle Ages as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by a yoke of oxen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne acre equals 0.0015625?square miles, 4,840?square yards, 43,560 square feet[23] or about 4,047 square metres (0.4047 hectares) (see below). While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840?square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based. Originally, an acre was understood as a selion of land sized at forty perches (660?ft, or 1?furlong) long and four perches (66?ft) wide;[24] this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day. A square enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57?yards, or 208?feet 9?inches (63.63 metres) on a side. As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any area of 43,560?square feet is an acre.\\r\\nIn the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 the United States and five countries of the Commonwealth of Nations defined the international yard to be exactly 0.9144?metres.[25] Consequently, the international acre is exactly 4,046.8564224?square metres.\\r\\nBoth the international acre and the US survey acre contain ?1?640 of a square mile or 4,840?square yards, but alternative definitions of a yard are used (see survey foot and survey yard), so the exact size of an acre depends upon which yard it is based. The US survey acre is about 4,046.872609874252 square metres; its exact value (4046?13,525,426/15,499,969?m2) is based on an inch defined by 1?metre = 39.37?inches exactly, as established by the Mendenhall Order. Surveyors in the United States use both international and survey feet, and consequently, both varieties of acre.[26]\\r\\nSince the difference between the US survey acre and international acre is only about a quarter of the size of an A4 sheet of paper (0.016?square metres, 160 square centimetres or 24.8?square inches), it is usually not important which one is being discussed. Areas are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectable.[27]\\r\\nIn India, residential plots are measured in cents or decimal, which is one hundredth of an acre, or 435.60 square feet (40.469?m2). In Sri Lanka the division of an acre into 160 perches or 4 roods is common.[28]\\r\\n1 international acre is equal to the following metric units:\\r\\n1 United States survey acre is equal to:\\r\\n1?acre (both variants) is equal to the following customary units:\\r\\nPerhaps the easiest way for US residents to envision an acre is as a rectangle measuring 88?yards by 55?yards (?1?10 of 880?yards by ?1?16 of 880?yards), about ?9?10 the size of a standard American football field.\\r\\nTo be more exact, one acre is 90.75% of a 100-yd-long by 53.33-yd-wide American football field (without the end zones). The full field, including the end zones, covers about 1.32 acres (0.53?ha).\\r\\nFor residents of other countries, the acre might be envisioned as approximately half of a 105-m-long by 68-m-wide association football (soccer) pitch.\\r\\nIt may also be remembered as 44,000?square feet, less 1%.\\r\\nThe word \\"acre\\" is derived from Old English ?cer originally meaning \\"open field\\", cognate to west coast Norwegian ?kre and Swedish ?ker, German Acker, Dutch akker, Latin ager, Sanskrit ajr, and Greek ϫ?? (agros). In English, it was historically spelled aker.\\r\\nThe acre was roughly the amount of land tillable by a yoke of oxen in one day.[29] This explains one definition as the area of a rectangle with sides of length one chain and one furlong. A long, narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot, since the plough does not have to be turned so often. The word \\"furlong\\" itself derives from the fact that it is one furrow long.\\r\\nBefore the enactment of the metric system, many countries in Europe used their own official acres. These were differently sized in different countries, for instance, the historical French acre was 4,221?square metres, whereas in Germany as many variants of \\"acre\\" existed as there were German states.\\r\\nStatutory values for the acre were enacted in England, and subsequently, the United Kingdom, by acts of:\\r\\nHistorically, the size of farms and landed estates in the United Kingdom was usually expressed in acres (or acres, roods, and perches), even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles. For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000?acres of land, not 50?square miles of land.\\r\\nThe acre is related to the square mile, with 640?acres making up one square mile. One mile is 5280?feet (1760?yards). In western Canada and the western United States, divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile, and fractions thereof. If the square mile is divided into quarters, each quarter has a side length of ?1?2 mile (880?yards) and is ?1?4 square mile in area, or 160?acres. These subunits would typically then again be divided into quarters, with each side being ?1?4 mile long, and being ?1?16 of a square mile in area, or 40?acres. In the United States, farmland was typically divided as such, and the phrase \\"the back 40\\" would refer to the 40-acre parcel to the back of the farm. Most of the Canadian Prairie Provinces and the US Midwest are on square-mile grids for surveying purposes.","input":"How big is 1 acre in square feet?"},{"output":"January 15, 2009","context":"US Airways Flight 1549 was an Airbus A320-214 which, in the climbout after takeoff from New York City's LaGuardia Airport on January 15, 2009, struck a flock of Canada geese just northeast of the George Washington Bridge and consequently lost all engine power.

With Skiles in control, the crew made its first report after becoming airborne at 3:25:51 as being at 700 feet (210?m) and climbing.[20]\\r\\nThe weather at 2:51?p.m. was 10 miles visibility with broken clouds at 3,700 feet, wind 8 knots from 290; an hour later it was few clouds at 4,200 feet, wind 9 knots from 310.[21] At 3:26:37 Sullenberger remarked to Skiles: \\"What a view of the Hudson today.\\"[22]\\r\\nAt 3:27:11 the plane struck a flock of Canada geese at an altitude of 2,818 feet (859?m) about 4.5 miles (7.2?km) north-northwest of LaGuardia. The pilots' view was filled with the large birds;[23][24] passengers and crew heard very loud bangs and saw flames from the engines, followed by silence and an odor of fuel.[25][26][27]\\r\\nRealizing that both engines had shut down, Sullenberger took control while Skiles worked the checklist for engine restart.[d][2] The aircraft slowed but continued to climb for a further nineteen seconds, reaching about 3,060 feet (930?m) at an airspeed of about 185 knots (343?km/h; 213?mph), then began a glide descent, accelerating to 210 knots (390?km/h; 240?mph) at 3:28:10 as it descended through 1,650 feet (500?m).\\r\\nAt 3:27:33, Sullenberger radioed a Mayday call to New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON):[29][30] \\"... this is Cactus 1539 [sic?ÿ correct call sign was Cactus 1549], hit birds. We've lost thrust on both engines. We're turning back towards LaGuardia\\".[22] Air traffic controller Patrick Harten[31] told LaGuardia's tower to hold all departures, and directed Sullenberger back to Runway?13.[30] Sullenberger responded, \\"Unable\\".[30]\\r\\nSullenberger asked if they could attempt to land in New Jersey, mentioning Teterboro Airport;[30][32][33] controllers obtained permission for a landing on Teterboro's Runway?1.[33] Sullenberger responded: \\"We can't do it?... We're gonna be in the Hudson\\".[32] The aircraft passed less than 900 feet (270?m) above the George Washington Bridge.[34] Sullenberger commanded over the cabin address system, \\"Brace for impact\\",[34] and the flight attendants relayed the command to passengers.[35] Meanwhile, air traffic controllers asked the Coast Guard to caution vessels in the Hudson and ask them to prepare to assist with rescue.[citation needed]\\r\\nAbout ninety seconds later, at 3:31?pm, the plane made an unpowered ditching, descending southwards at about 125 knots (140?mph; 230?km/h) into the middle of the North River section of the Hudson tidal estuary, at 404610N 740017W? / ?40.7695N 74.0046W? / 40.7695; -74.0046[36] roughly opposite West 50th Street (near the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum) in Manhattan and Port Imperial in Weehawken, New Jersey. Flight attendants compared the ditching to a \\"hard landing\\" with \\"one impact, no bounce, then a gradual deceleration.\\"[32] The ebb tide then began to take the plane southward.[37]\\r\\nSullenberger opened the cockpit door and ordered evacuation. The crew began evacuating the passengers through the four overwing window exits and into an inflatable slide/raft deployed from the front right passenger door (the front left slide failed to operate, so the manual inflation handle was pulled). A panicked passenger opened a rear door, which a flight attendant was unable to reseal.[38] Water was also entering a hole in the fuselage and through cargo doors that had come open,[39] so as the water rose the attendant urged passengers to move forward by climbing over seats.[e] One passenger was in a wheelchair.[41][42] Finally, Sullenberger walked the cabin twice to confirm it was empty.[43][44][45]\\r\\nThe air and water temperatures were about 19?F (?7?C) and 41?F (5?C) respectively.[21] Some evacuees waited for rescue knee-deep in water on the partially submerged slides, some wearing life-vests. Others stood on the wings or, fearing an explosion, swam away from the plane.[38] One passenger, after helping with the evacuation, found the wing so crowded that he jumped into the river and swam to a boat.[46][32][47]\\r\\nSullenberger had ditched near boats to facilitate rescue.[20][43] NY Waterway ferries Thomas Jefferson and then Governor Thomas H. Kean both arrived within minutes[48][49] and began taking people aboard using a Jason's cradle. Sullenberger advised the ferry crews to rescue those on the wings first, as they were in more jeopardy than those on the slides, which detached to become life rafts.[34] As the plane drifted, passengers on one slide, fearing that the boat would crush them, shouted for it to steer away.[50] The last person was taken from the plane at 3:55 pm.[51]\\r\\nAbout 140 New York City firefighters responded to nearby docks,[52][53][54] as did police, helicopters, and various vessels and divers.[52] Other agencies provided medical help on the Weehawken side of the river, where most passengers were taken.[55]\\r\\nThere were five serious injuries,[2] including a deep laceration in flight attendant Doreen Welsh's leg.[32][56] Seventy-eight people were treated, mostly for minor injuries[57] and hypothermia,[58] twenty-four passengers and two rescuers treated at hospitals,[59] with two passengers kept overnight. One passenger now wears glasses because of jet fuel damaging his eyes.[46] No pets were being carried on the flight.[60]\\r\\nEach passenger later received a letter of apology, $5,000 in compensation for lost baggage (and $5,000 more if they could demonstrate larger losses) and refund of the ticket price.[61][62] In May 2009 they received any belongings that had been recovered. In addition, they reported offers of $10,000 each in return for agreeing not to sue US Airways.[63]\\r\\nMany passengers and rescuers later experienced post-traumatic stress symptoms such as sleeplessness, flashbacks, and panic attacks; some began an email support group.[64] Patrick Harten, the controller who had worked the flight, said that \\"the hardest, most traumatic part of the entire event was when it was over\\", and that he was \\"gripped by raw moments of shock and grief\\".[65]\\r\\nIn an effort to prevent similar accidents, officials captured and gassed 1,235 Canada geese at 17 locations across New York City in mid-2009 and coated 1,739 goose eggs with oil to smother the developing goslings.[66]\\r\\nThe partially submerged plane was moored to a pier near the World Financial Center in Lower Manhattan, roughly 4 miles (6?km) downstream from the ditching location.[35] The left engine, detached by the ditching, was recovered from the riverbed.[67] On January 17 the aircraft was barged[68][69] to New Jersey.[70]\\r\\nThe initial National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) evaluation that the plane had lost thrust after a bird strike[71][72][73] was confirmed by analysis of the cockpit voice and flight data recorders.[74]\\r\\nIt was soon reported that a few days earlier the plane had experienced a less severe compressor stall, and its passengers had been told an emergency landing might be required,[75][76] but the affected engine was restarted. The NTSB later reported that a faulty temperature sensor had been the cause, and that the engine had not been damaged in that incident.[77]\\r\\nOn January 21, the NTSB found evidence of soft-body damage in the right engine along with organic debris including a feather.[78][79] The left engine also evidenced soft body impact, with: \\"dents on both the spinner and inlet lip of the engine cowling. Five booster inlet guide vanes are fractured and eight outlet guide vanes are missing.\\" Both engines, missing large portions of their housings,[80] were sent to the manufacturer for examination.[81] On January 31, the plane was moved to Kearny, New Jersey. The bird remains[77][82] were later identified by DNA testing to be Canada geese, which typically weigh more than engines are designed to withstand ingesting.[77]\\r\\nBecause the plane was assembled in France[83] the European Aviation Safety Agency (the European counterpart of the FAA) and the Bureau d'Enqutes et d'Analyses pour la Scurit de l'Aviation Civile (the French counterpart of the NTSB) joined the investigation, with technical assistance from Airbus Industrie and GE Aviation/Snecma, respectively the manufacturers of the airframe and the engines.[84][85]\\r\\nThe NTSB used flight simulators to test the possibility that the flight could have returned safely to LaGuardia or diverted to Teterboro; only seven of the thirteen simulated returns to La Guardia succeeded, and only one of the two to Teterboro.[86] Furthermore, the NTSB report called these simulations unrealistic: \\"The immediate turn made by the pilots during the simulations did not reflect or account for real-world considerations.\\" A further simulation, conducted with the pilot delayed by 35 seconds, crashed.[87] In testimony before the NTSB, Sullenberger maintained that there had been no time to bring the plane to any airport, and that attempting to do so would likely have killed those onboard and more on the ground.[88]\\r\\nThe Board ultimately ruled that Sullenberger had made the correct decision,[88] reasoning that the checklist for dual-engine failure is designed for higher altitudes, when pilots have more time to deal with the situation, and that while simulations showed that the plane might have just barely made it back to LaGuardia, those scenarios assumed an instant decision to do so, with no time allowed for assessing the situation.[89][90]\\r\\nThe NTSB concluded its investigation on May 4, 2010, identifying the probable cause as \\"the ingestion of large birds into each engine, which resulted in an almost total loss of thrust in both engines.\\"[87] The final report credited the outcome to four factors: good decision-making and teamwork by the cockpit crew (including decisions to immediately turn on the APU and to ditch in the Hudson); the fact that the A320 is certified for extended overwater operation (and hence carried life vests and additional raft/slides) even though not required for that route; the performance of the flight crew during the evacuation; and the proximity of working vessels to the ditching site. Contributing factors were good visibility and a fast response from the ferry operators and emergency responders. The report also makes a range of recommendations to improve safety in such situations.[2]\\r\\nAuthor and pilot William Langewiesche asserted that insufficient credit was given to the A320's fly-by-wire design, by which the pilot uses a side-stick to make control inputs to the flight control computers. The computers then impose adjustments and limits of their own to keep the plane stable, which the pilot cannot override even in an emergency. This design allowed the pilots of Flight 1549 to concentrate on engine restart and deciding the course, without the burden of manually adjusting the glidepath to reduce the plane's rate of descent.[51] Sullenberger said that these computer-imposed limits also prevented him from achieving the optimum landing flare for the ditching, which would have softened the impact.[91]\\r\\nIn 2010, the damaged plane (excluding its engines)[92] was acquired for the Carolinas Aviation Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina,[93] which held a reception on June 11 to commemorate the arrival in Charlotte of the plane's body, with Sullenberger as keynote speaker and the passengers invited.[94][95][96][97]\\r\\nAn NTSB board member called the ditching \\"the most successful?... in aviation history. These people knew what they were supposed to do and they did it and as a result, no lives were lost.\\"[98]\\r\\nThe crew, especially Sullenberger, was praised, notably by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New York State Governor David Paterson, who said: \\"We had a Miracle on 34th Street. I believe now we have had a Miracle on the Hudson.\\"[57][99][100] U.S. President George W. Bush said he was \\"inspired by the skill and heroism of the flight crew,\\" and praised the emergency responders and volunteers.[101] President-elect Barack Obama said that everyone was proud of Sullenberger's \\"heroic and graceful job in landing the damaged aircraft.\\" He thanked the crew, whom he invited to his inauguration five days later.[102][103]\\r\\nThe Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators awarded the crew a Master's Medal on January 22, 2009; this is awarded only rarely, for outstanding aviation achievements at the discretion of the Master of the Guild.[8] New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg presented the crew with the Keys to the City, and Sullenberger with a replacement copy of a library book lost on the flight, Sidney Dekker's Just Culture: Balancing Safety and Accountability.[104] Rescuers received Certificates of Honor.[105]\\r\\nThe crew received a standing ovation at the Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009,[106] and Sullenberger threw out the first pitch at the 2009 Major League Baseball season for the San Francisco Giants. His Giants' jersey was inscribed with the name \\"Sully\\" and the number 155?ÿ the count of people aboard the plane.[107]\\r\\nOn July 28, passengers Dave Sanderson and Barry Leonard organized a thank you luncheon for emergency responders from Hudson County, New Jersey, on the shores of Palisades Medical Center in North Bergen, New Jersey, where 57 passengers had been brought following their rescue. Present were members of the U.S. Coast Guard, North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue, NY Waterway Ferries, the American Red Cross, Weehawken Volunteer First Aid, the Weehawken Police Department, West New York E.M.S., North Bergen E.M.S., the Hudson County Office of Emergency Management, the New Jersey E.M.S. Task Force, the Guttenberg Police Department, McCabe Ambulance, the Harrison Police Department, and doctors and nurses who treated survivors.[108][109]\\r\\nSullenberger was named Grand Marshal for the 2010 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California.\\r\\nIn August 2010, Jeppesen issued an approach plate titled \\"Hudson Miracle APCH,\\" dedicated to the five crew of Flight 1549 and annotated \\"Presented with Pride and Gratitude from your friends at Jeppesen.\\"[110]\\r\\nSullenberger retired on March 3, 2010, after thirty years with US Airways and its predecessor, Pacific Southwest Airlines. At the end of his final flight he was reunited with Skiles and a number of the passengers from Flight 1549.[111]\\r\\nThe accident was recorded by several closed-circuit television cameras. Various television reports and documentaries produced soon afterwards contained extensive video of the ditching and rescue, and recorded interviews with the aircrew, passengers, rescuers, and other key participants. These included:\\r\\nThe crash was featured in the Discovery Channel (Canada) / National Geographic TV series Mayday on the episode Hudson Splash Down.[121] It was also recreated in a National Geographic Channel TV special titled \\"Miracle Landing on the Hudson,\\"[122] and in the United Kingdom for a Channel 5 special in 2011.[123]\\r\\nGarrison Keillor honored the entire flight crew by writing a song and performing it on his show, A Prairie Home Companion.[124]\\r\\nThe ditching is referenced in the song \\"A Real Hero\\" by College and Electric Youth, best known from the 2011 movie Drive. The lyrics of the second verse describe the water landing and the survival of the passengers and crew, as well alluding to the freezing river.[125]\\r\\nSullenberger's memoir, Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters was adapted into a feature film Sully: Miracle on the Hudson, directed by Clint Eastwood,[126] with Tom Hanks as Sullenberger and Aaron Eckhart as co-pilot Jeff Skiles.[127] It was released by Warner Bros. on September 9, 2016.[128]","input":"When did the plane crash into the hudson river?"},{"output":"Ho Chi Minh","context":"The Leaders of the Vietnam War listed below comprise the important political and military figures of the Vietnam War.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHo Chi Minh whose real name is Nguyen Sinh Cung and also known as Nguyen Tat Thanh and Nguyen Ai Quoc was a Vietnamese revolutionary leader following the path of communism.\\r\\nHe left his country on a French steamer in 1911 and traveled extensively around the world participating actively in the Communist International before returning to Vietnam in 1941. He then organized and led the Viet Minh to fight for Vietnamese Independence. He became more popular for his declaration of Vietnam independence from France, which paraphrased a part of the U.S declaration of independence that says All men are created equal Since 1945, he became a prime minister and president of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). In the late 1950s, Ho Chi Minh organized another communist guerrilla movement widely known as Viet Cong in South Vietnam.\\r\\nHo Chi Minh was the key figure and held the main leadership of North Vietnam during both wars in the country. He remained as a great source of inspiration for the Vietnamese who were fighting for a united Vietnam as in his wish after he officially stepped aside in 1965 and even after his death in 1969. The final offensive against Saigon ÿ the capital of South Vietnam in 1975 was named after him (the Ho Chi Minh Campaign). Vietnam was reunified under the Communist rule after the fall of Saigon in April 1975, nearly 30 years after Ho's declaration of independence and 6 years after his death. Soon after that, Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh city in honour of his vast contributions to Vietnam.\\r\\nVo Nguyen Giap was a General, Commander in Chief of the Vietnam People's Army (VNA) and Vietnamese politician. He played a major role as a commander in the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Vietnam War (1960-1975) in which he involved directly in many important campaigns such as the Border Campaign in FallÿWinter (1950), the Battle of Dien Bien Phu (1954), the Tet Offensive (1968), the Easter Offensive (1972), the final Ho Chi Minh Campaign (1975) which led to the fall of Saigon and South Vietnam. Giap, together with Ho Chi Minh, was the most prominent figure of North Vietnam during the wars in the country.\\r\\nAfter the war, he was still the Minister of Defence until 1980 and served as a member of Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Vietnam until his retirement in 1991. Giap celebrated his 100th birthday in 2011 and becomes the oldest Vietnam political and military figure that have ever lived. He is also considered by both his partisans and opponents as one of the greatest military commanders in history.\\r\\nDiem was a Vietnamese politician served as an officer in the Nguyen Dynasty. Because of his drastic ideological of anti-communism, Diem received support from the United States and became the first President of the Republic of Vietnam in 1955. However, as a Catholic, Diem pursued the persecution of Buddhists which led to many religious protests notably the self-immolation of Thich Quang Duc in 1963. As a result, Diem gradually lost U.S support and was assassinated, together with his brother Nhu, in a coup in 1963\\r\\nNguyen Cao Ky was a senior army officer and a former politician of Republic of Vietnam. He served as a prime minister (1965-1967) and Vice President (1967-1971) of the Republic of Vietnam. From an ally, he then became the opponent of President Nguyen Van Thieu and was mostly sidelined during Thieu's presidency. Ky had been seen as an aggressive anti-Communist person in the period before 1975 and but then was regarded as a symbol of national reconciliation by the Vietnamese Communist Party since 2004 when he became the first South Vietnamese leader returning to the country.\\r\\nThieu was the Leadership Committee Chairman (1965-1967) and President of the Republic of Vietnam (1967-1975). In 1963, Thieu joined a military coup to overthrow Diem. During his years as president, Thieu was accused of indulging in corruption. His struggle for power with Ky led to the decisions of side-lining Ky's supporters and choosing loyalists instead of decent commanders to lead the Army of Public of Vietnam (APVN) forces. He strongly opposed the Paris Peace Accords (1973) and publicly blamed the U.S not keeping its promise for fall of Saigon and South Vietnam in 1975.","input":"Who was the leader of vietnam during the cold war?"},{"output":"Over 159,000","context":"In the United States, 1 in every 2,000 residents is imprisoned for life.[1] This is similar to the total imprisonment rate in Japan, which is roughly 51 per 100,000 residents (approx. 1 in 1,960 residents).[2] There are many U.S. states where a convict can be released on parole after a decade or more has passed, though in California, people sentenced to life imprisonment can normally apply for parole after 7 years. The laws in the United States divide life sentences between \\"determinate life sentences\\" and \\"indeterminate life sentences\\". For example, sentences of \\"15 years to life\\", \\"25 years to life\\", or \\"life with mercy\\" may be given; this is called an \\"indeterminate life sentence\\", while a sentence of \\"life without the possibility of parole\\" or \\"life without mercy\\" is called a \\"determinate life sentence\\", because a sentence of \\"15 years to life\\" means that it is a life sentence with a non-parole period of 15 years. Parole is not guaranteed, it is discretionary and as a result, this is an indeterminate sentence.[3] Even when a sentence specifically denies the possibility of parole, government officials may have the power to grant amnesty or reprieves, or commute a sentence to time served.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1860s, reformation became favored over penitence in American penology, with the role of prisons seen as reforming prisoners, who were imprisoned until reform was achieved. The concepts of parole and indeterminate sentencing were regarded as forward looking in the 1870s for these reasons. However, these ideals were not as successful as had been hopedcrime was not eradicated, reformatories had the same problems as prisons regarding politicization and underfunding, and indeterminate sentencing became undermined by prisoners, who quickly found that it was possible to \\"beat the system\\" by pretense, giving a better chance of winning parole. Many were soon back in custody. Similarly, prison authorities could twist it to their advantage by selectively denying parole. But the biggest cause of the reformatories' failure to live up to expectations was that despite the enthusiasm of reformers, and Brockway's call for an end to vengeance in criminal justice, those within the prison environmentboth inmates and guards alikecontinued to conceive of prison as a place of retribution.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1954, Master Sergeant Maurice L. Schick was convicted by military court-martial of the murder of eight-year-old Susan Rothschild at Camp Zama in Japan.[5] The soldier admitted the killing stating he had a sudden \\"uncontrollable urge to kill\\" choosing his victim \\"just because she was there\\".[5]\\r\\nSchick was sentenced to death. Six years later, the case was forwarded to President Dwight D. Eisenhower for final review. He exercised his right of executive clemency to commute Schick's death sentence to confinement with hard labor for the term of his natural life with the express condition that he \\"shall never have any rights, privileges, claims or benefits arising under the parole and suspension or remission of sentence laws of the United States\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1971, Schick began a legal challenge against his whole life sentence. The appeal eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 1974. It examined the constitutional basis of the punishment: life imprisonment without parole.[6] Had Schick been given an ordinary life sentence, he would have been eligible for parole in 1969.[7] Although Schick's sentence was given only cursory mention, the court concluded a whole life sentence was constitutional.[8] Schick, together with only five other federal prisoners still ineligible for parole at the time, was made eligible for parole by a separate pardon from President Ford either in 1976 or in 1977, and may have died a free man in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2004.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the Schick opinion's lack of thorough analysis regarding life imprisonment without a chance of parole, an imposing amount of precedent has developed based upon it.[11] After Furman v. Georgia,[12] this has put the constitutionality of the death penalty in question as life imprisonment without parole received increased attention from lawmakers and judges as an alternative to the death penalty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch penalties predate Schick.[13] One early American case was Ex Parte Wells,[14] who was convicted of murder in 1851 and sentenced to be hanged. On the day of his execution, President Millard Fillmore gave him a conditional pardon commuting his sentence to \\"imprisonment for life in the penitentiary at Washington\\". Wells appealed the conditions of his pardon. But the sentence was upheld with no discussion by the majority of the purpose of the substituted punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few countries worldwide have allowed for minors to be given lifetime sentences that have no provision for eventual release. Countries that allow life imprisonment without a possibility of parole for juveniles include Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba, Dominica, Israel, Nigeria, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and the United States. Of these, only the U.S. currently has minors serving such sentences. The University of San Francisco School of Laws Center for Law & Global Justice conducted international research on the use of the sentence of life without parole for juveniles, and has found no cases outside the U.S. in which the sentence is actually imposed on juveniles.[15] As of 2009, Human Rights Watch has calculated that there are 2,589[16] youth offenders serving life without parole in the U.S.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that sentencing minors to automatic sentences of life without a chance of parole for crimes other than those involving a homicide (generally, first-degree murder, and usually with aggravating factors or accompanying felonies) violated the Eighth Amendment's ban on \\"cruel and unusual punishments\\", in the case of Graham v. Florida.[18] In finding that the U.S. Constitution prohibits as cruel and unusual punishment a life without parole sentence for a juvenile in a non-homicide case, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that \\"the overwhelming weight of international opinion against\\" juvenile life without a chance of parole \\"provide[s] respected and significant confirmation for our own conclusions\\".[19] In 2012, the Court considered whether to ban the automatic use of it completely as a sentence for minors, even in cases of aggravated first degree murder (what is usually called felony murder, capital murder, or murder with aggravating circumstances, and for an adult could mean a sentence of death or life without a chance of parole; the planned rape and murder of a young child or the planned murder of more than one person at a timee.g., a couple in their housewould be two examples) where it is still a possibility. The Court had already judged the death penalty unconstitutional for minors in 2005. In June 2012, the Court ruled that it could never be automatically used as a sentence for a minor (under 18), although the Court left room for it as a sentence that can eventually be given (for now) in certain first-degree murder cases once the judge has taken mitigating circumstances and other factors into account.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. practice of sentencing juveniles to life imprisonment without a possibility of parole violates international standards of justice, as well as treaties to which the U.S. is a party. Each state must ensure that its criminal punishments comply with the United States' international treaty obligations:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations General Assembly has called upon governments to: \\"abolish by law, as soon as possible...life imprisonment without possibility of release for those below the age of 18 years at the time of the commission of the offense\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational standards of justice hold that a juvenile life imprisonment without a possibility of parole is not warranted under any circumstances because juvenile offenders lack the experience, education, intelligence and mental development of adults and must be given a reasonable opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough sentences vary for each state, generally the life imprisonment sentences are mandatory sentences for first degree murder, particularly when the first degree murder is done during the commission of another felony (the felony murder rule), or there are other aggravating circumstances present (such as is common for rapes which precede such murders, or the first degree murder of any law enforcement official or other public servant) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, including states without the death penalty, and as an (or the only) alternative sentence in states that have the death penalty and in federal and military courts. Life imprisonment is also a mandatory punishment in Idaho for aircraft hijacking, in New York for terrorism, in Florida for capital sexual battery (sexual abuse of a child under 12 years old that causes injury to the child) and in Georgia for a second conviction for armed robbery, kidnapping, or rape and other serious violent felonies under Georgia's Seven-deadly-sins law.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLife imprisonment is a possible punishment for aggravated mayhem and torture in California. Other specifics about life sentences in the United States continue to vary widely by individual states. Also, it may be given for \\"drug kingpins\\" and \\"habitual criminals\\". It has been applied in every state except Alaska,[21] as well as in the federal courts.[22] In Alaska, the maximum term of imprisonment is for 99 years, although this is almost always considered to be a theoretical life sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 159,000 people were serving life sentences as of 2012, with just under a thirdnearly 50,000serving life without a chance of parole.[1] In 1993 the Times survey found, about 20 percent of all lifers had no chance of parole. By 2004 the number rose to 28 percent.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, the U.S. is now housing by far the world's largest and most permanent population of prisoners who are guaranteed to die of old age behind bars. At the Louisiana State Penitentiary, for instance, more than 3,000 of the 5,100 prisoners are serving life with a chance of parole, and most of the remaining 2,100 are serving sentences so long that they cannot be completed in a typical lifetime. About 150 inmates have died there in the last five years.[23] An article for QZ reported that 35% of all the world's prison lifers are in the U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the federal criminal code, however, with respect to offenses committed after December 1, 1987, parole has been abolished for all sentences handed down by the federal system, including life sentences, so a life sentence from a federal court will result in imprisonment for the life of the defendant, unless a pardon or reprieve is granted by the President, or if upon appeal, the conviction is quashed.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 3,200 people nationwide are serving life terms without a chance of parole for nonviolent offenses. Of those prisoners, 80 percent are behind bars for drug-related convictions. Sixty-five percent are African-American, 18 percent are white, and 16 percent are Latino. The ACLU has called these statistics proof of \\"extreme racial disparities.\\" Some of the crimes that led to life sentences include stealing gas from a truck, shoplifting, etc., but only for those with a pattern of habitual criminal offenses.

It rises to 100 metres (330?ft) in the north, and to more than 1,000 metres (3,300?ft) in the south, forming a raised triangle within the South-pointing triangle of the Indian subcontinent's coastline.[2]\\r\\nIt extends over eight Indian states and encompasses a wide range of habitats, covering most of central and southern India.[3]\\r\\nThe plateau is located between two mountain ranges, the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats, each of which rises from its respective nearby coastal plain, and almost converge at the southern tip of India. It is separated from the Gangetic plain to the north by the Satpura and Vindhya Ranges, which form its northern boundary. The Deccan produced some of the major dynasties in Indian history Pallavas, Satavahana, Vakataka, Chalukya, and Rashtrakuta dynasties; the Western Chalukya, the Kadambas, Kakatiya Empire, Vijayanagara and Maratha empires; and the Muslim Bahmani Sultanate, Deccan Sultanate, and the Nizam of Hyderabad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Deccan is an anglicised form of the Prakrit word dakkha?a or dakkhin, itself derived from the Sanskrit word dk?i?a (meaning \\"southern\\"), as the Deccan Plateau is located in southern part of subcontinent.[4][5]\\r\\nThe Deccan region has historically lacked an enduring geo-political centre, and has been defined in various ways. Geographers have attempted to define it using indices such as rainfall, vegetation, soil type or physical features. When considering physical features, it is taken to be the area bounded by the Narmada River, the Eastern Ghats and the Western Ghats. The 16th-century historian Firishta defined Deccan as the territory inhabited by the native speakers of Kannada, Marathi, and Telugu languages. Richard M. Eaton (2005) also settled on this linguistic definition.[6]\\r\\nThe Western Ghats mountain range is very tall and blocks the moisture from the southwest monsoon from reaching the Deccan Plateau, so the region receives very little rainfall.[7][8] The eastern Deccan Plateau is at a lower elevation spanning the southeastern coast of India. Its forests are also relatively dry but serve to retain the rain to form streams that feed into rivers that flow into basins and then into the Bay of Bengal.[2][9]\\r\\nMost Deccan plateau rivers flow south. Most of the northern part of the plateau is drained by the Godavari River and its tributaries, including the Indravati River, starting from the Western Ghats and flowing east towards the Bay of Bengal. Most of the central plateau is drained by the Tungabhadra River, Krishna River and its tributaries, including the Bhima River, which also run east. The southernmost part of the plateau is drained by the Kaveri River, which rises in the Western Ghats of Karnataka and bends south to break through the Nilgiri Hills at the island town of Shivanasamudra and then falls into Tamil Nadu at Hogenakal Falls before flowing into the Stanley Reservoir and the Mettur Dam that created the reservoir, and finally emptying into the Bay of Bengal.\\r\\nThe climate of the region varies from semi-arid in the north to tropical in most of the region with distinct wet and dry seasons. Rain falls during the monsoon season from about June to October. March to June can be very dry and hot, with temperatures regularly exceeding 40?C. The Deccan plateau is a topographically variegated region located south of the Gangetic plains-the portion lying between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal-and includes a substantial area to the north of the Satpura Range, which has popularly been regarded as the divide between northern India and the Deccan. The name derives from the Sanskrit daksina (\\"south\\"). The plateau is bounded on the east and west by the Ghats, while its northern extremity is the Vindhya Range. The Deccan's average elevation is about 2,000 feet (600 m), sloping generally eastward; its principal rivers, the Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery, flow from the Western Ghats eastward to the Bay of Bengal. The plateau's climate is drier than that on the coasts and is arid in places. Although sometimes used to mean all of India south of the Narmada River, the word Deccan relates more specifically to that area of rich volcanic soils and lava-covered plateaus in the northern part of the peninsula between the Narmada and Krishna rivers.\\r\\nHaving once constituted a segment of the ancient continent of Gondwanaland, this land is the oldest and most stable in India. The Deccan plateau consists of dry tropical forests that experiences only seasonal rainfall\\r\\nOn the western edge of the plateau lie the Sahyadri, the Nilgiri, the Anaimalai and the Elamalai Hills, commonly known as Western Ghats. The average height of the Western Ghats, which run along the Arabian Sea, goes on increasing towards the south. Anaimudi Peak in Kerala, with a height of 2,695 m above sea level, is the highest peak of peninsular India. In the Nilgiris lie Ootacamund, the well-known hill station of southern India. The western coastal plain is uneven and swift rivers flow through it that forms beautiful lagoons and backwaters, examples of which can be found in the state of Kerala. The east coast is wide with deltas formed by the rivers Godavari, Mahanadi and Kaveri. Flanking the Indian peninsula on the western side are the Lakshadweep Islands in the Arabian Sea and on the eastern side lies the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal.\\r\\nThe eastern Deccan plateau, called Telangana and Rayalaseema are made of vast sheets of massive granite rock, which effectively traps rainwater. Under the thin surface layer of soil is the impervious gray granite bedrock. It rains here only during some months.\\r\\nComprising the northeastern part of the Deccan Plateau, the Telangana Plateau has an area of about 148,000?km2, a north-south length of about 770?km, and an east-west width of about 515?km.\\r\\nThe plateau is drained by the Godavari River taking a southeasterly course; by the Krishna River, which divides the peneplain into two regions; and by the Pennai Aaru River flowing in a northerly direction. The plateau's forests are moist deciduous, dry deciduous, and tropical thorn.\\r\\nMost of the population of the region is engaged in agriculture; cereals, oilseeds, cotton, and pulses (legumes) are the major crops. There are multipurpose irrigation and hydroelectric-power projects, including the Pochampad, Bhaira Vanitippa, and Upper Pennai Aaru. Industries (located in Hyderabad, Warangal, and Kurnool) produce cotton textiles, sugar, foodstuffs, tobacco, paper, machine tools, and pharmaceuticals. Cottage industries are forest-based (timber, firewood, charcoal, bamboo products) and mineral-based (asbestos, coal, chromite, iron ore, mica, and kyanite).\\r\\nThe northwestern part of the plateau is made up of lava flows or igneous rocks known as the Deccan Traps. The rocks are spread over the whole of Maharashtra and parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, thereby making it one of the largest volcanic provinces in the world. It consists of more than 2,000 metres (6,600?ft) of flat-lying basalt lava flows and covers an area of nearly 500,000 square kilometres (190,000?sq?mi) in west-central India. Estimates of the original area covered by the lava flows are as high as 1,500,000 square kilometres (580,000?sq?mi). The volume of basalt is estimated to be 511,000 cubic km. The thick dark soil (called regur) found here is suitable for cotton cultivation.\\r\\nThe volcanic basalt beds of the Deccan were laid down in the massive Deccan Traps eruption, which occurred towards the end of the Cretaceous period between 67 and 66 million years ago. Some paleontologists speculate that this eruption may have accelerated the extinction of the dinosaurs. Layer after layer was formed by the volcanic activity that lasted many thousands of years, and when the volcanoes became extinct, they left a region of highlands with typically vast stretches of flat areas on top like a table. The volcanic hotspot that produced the Deccan traps is hypothesized to lie under the present day island of Runion in the Indian Ocean.[10]\\r\\nTypically the Deccan Plateau is made up of basalt extending up to Bhor Ghat near Karjat. This is an extrusive igneous rock. Also in certain sections of the region, we can find granite, which is an intrusive igneous rock. The difference between these two rock types is: basalt rock forms on eruption of lava, that is, on the surface (either out of a volcano, or through massive fissuresas in the Deccan basaltsin the ground), while granite forms deep within the Earth. Granite is a felsic rock, meaning it is rich in potassium feldspar and quartz. This composition is continental in origin (meaning it is the primary composition of the continental crust). Since it cooled relatively slowly, it has large visible crystals. Basalt, on the other hand, is mafic in compositionmeaning it is rich in pyroxene and, in some cases, olivine, both of which are Mg-Fe rich minerals. Basalt is similar in composition to mantle rocks, indicating that it came from the mantle and did not mix with continental rocks. Basalt forms in areas that are spreading, whereas granite forms mostly in areas that are colliding. Since both rocks are found in the Deccan Plateau, it indicates two different environments of formation.\\r\\nThe Deccan is rich in minerals. Primary mineral ores found in this region are mica and iron ore in the Chhota Nagpur region, and diamonds, gold and other metals in the Golconda region.\\r\\nThe large areas of remaining forest on the plateau are still home to a variety of grazing animals from the four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis), chinkara (Gazella bennettii), and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) to the large gaur and wild water buffalo (Bubalus arena).\\r\\nThe Deccan is home to many languages and people. Bhil and Gond people live in the hills along the northern and northeastern edges of the plateau, and speak various languages that belong to both the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian families of languages. Marathi, an Indo-Aryan language, is the main language of the north-western Deccan in the state of Maharashtra. Speakers of Telugu and Kannada, the predominant languages of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka respectively, occupy those states' portions of the plateau. The city of Hyderabad is an important center of the Urdu language in the Deccan; its surrounding areas also host a notable population of Urdu speakers. Northeastern parts of the Deccan are in the state of Odisha. Odia another Indo-Aryan language is spoken in this part of Deccan. The Urdu dialect spoken in this region is also known as Dakhini or as Deccani, named after the region itself.\\r\\nThe chief crop is cotton; also common are sugarcane, rice, and other crops.\\r\\nApart from the states already mentioned, the state of Chhattisgarh is found in the northeast corner of the plateau. The large cities in the Deccan are Pune, the cultural hub of Maharashtra, Bangalore, the capital of Karnataka and Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Other major cities include Mysore, Gulbarga and Bellary in Karnataka; Nagpur, Amravati, Kolhapur, Latur and Aurangabad in Maharashtra; Amaravati, Visakhapatnam, Kurnool, Kadapa, Anantapur, Vijayawada, Guntur, Rajahmundry, Eluru, Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh; and Warangal, Karimnagar, Ramagundam, Nizamabad, Jammikunta, Mahbubnagar in present Telangana.\\r\\nThe Deccan produced some of the most significant dynasties in Indian History like the Chola dynasty, Satavahana dynasty, Vakataka dynasty, Chalukya dynasty, Rashtrakuta dynasty, Western Chalukya Empire, Vijayanagara Empire and Maratha Empire. Of the early history, the main facts established are the growth of the Mauryan empire (300 BC) and after that the Deccan was ruled by the Satavahana dynasty which protected the Deccan against the Scythian invaders, the Western Satraps.[11] Prominent dynasties of this time include the Cholas (3rd century BC to 12th century AD), Chalukyas (6th to 12th centuries), Rashtrakutas (753ÿ982), Hoysalas (10th to 14th centuries), Kakatiya (1083 to 1323 AD) and Vijayanagara Empire (1336ÿ1646). Ahir Kings once ruled over the Deccan. A cave inscription at Nasik refers to the reign of an Abhira prince named Ishwarsena, son of Shivadatta.[12] After the collapse of the Satavahana dynasty the Deccan was ruled by the Vakataka dynasty from the 3rd century to 5th century.\\r\\nFrom the 6th to 8th century the Deccan was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty which produced great rulers like Pulakesi II who defeated the north India Emperor Harsha or Vikramaditya II whose general defeated the Arab invaders in the 8th century. From the 8th to 10th century the Rashtrakuta dynasty ruled this region. It led successful military campaigns into northern India and was described by Arab scholars as one of the four great empires of the world.[13] In the 10th century the Western Chalukya Empire was established which produced scholars like the social reformer Basava, Vij?ne?vara, the mathematician Bhskara II and Someshwara III who wrote the text Manasollasa. From the early 11th century to the 12th century the Deccan Plateau was dominated by the Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola dynasty.[14] Several battles were fought between the Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola dynasty in the Deccan Plateau during the reigns of Raja Raja Chola I, Rajendra Chola I, Jayasimha II, Someshvara I and Vikramaditya VI and Kulottunga I.[15]\\r\\nIn 1294, Alauddin Khalji, emperor of Delhi, invaded the Deccan, stormed Devagiri, and reduced the Yadava rajas of Maharashtra to the position of tributary princes (see Daulatabad), then proceeding southward to conquer the Andhra, Carnatic. In 1307, a fresh series of Muslim incursions led by Malik Kafur began in response to unpaid tributes, resulting in the final ruin of the Yadava power; and in 1338 the conquest of the Deccan was completed by Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq. The imperial hegemony was brief, as soon Andhra and Karnataka reverted to their former masters. These defections by the Hindu states was soon followed by a general revolt of the Muslim governors, resulting in the establishment in 1347 of the independent Muslim dynasty of Bahmani.[16] The power of the Delhi sultanate evaporated south of the Narmada River. The southern Deccan came under the rule of the famous Vijayanagara Empire which reached its zenith during the reign of Emperor Krishnadevaraya.[17]\\r\\nIn the power struggles which ensued, the Hindu kingdom of Andhra fell bit by bit to the Bahamani dynasty, who advanced their frontier to Golkonda in 1373, to Warangal in 1421, and to the Bay of Bengal in 1472. Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire defeated the last remnant of Bahmani Sultanate power after which the Bahmani Sultanate collapsed.[18] When the Bahmani empire dissolved in 1518, its dominions were distributed into the five Muslim states of Golkonda, Bijapur, Ahmednagar, Bidar and Berar, giving rise to the Deccan sultanates.[16] South of these, the Hindu state of Carnatic or Vijayanagar still survived; but this, too, was defeated, at the Battle of Talikota (1565) by a league of the Muslim powers. Berar had already been annexed by Ahmednagar in 1572, and Bidar was absorbed by Bijapur in 1619. Mughal interest in the Deccan also rose at this time; Ahmadnagar was partially incorporated in the Empire in 1598 and as fully in 1636, Bijapur in 1686, and Golkonda in 1688.\\r\\nIn 1674, Shivaji laid the foundation of the Maratha Empire which within 75 years of his death covered territory of over 250?million acres (1 million km2) or one-third of the Indian sub-continent. Marathas under Shivaji directly challenged the foreign rule of the Bijapur Sultanate and ultimately the mighty Mughal empire. Once the Bijapur Sultanate stopped being a threat to the Maratha Empire, Marathas became much more aggressive and began to frequently raid Mughal territory. The Marathas had conquered part of central and western India by Shivaji's death in 1680. After Shivaji, Sambhaji defended the Maratha empire from the Mughal onslaught led by Aurangzeb. Marathas defeated Mughals in the prolonged war. After 1707, the Marathas acquired the right to levy tribute in southern India. After the death of Chhatrapati Shahu, the Peshwas became the de facto leaders of the Empire from 1749 to 1761, while Shivaji's successors continued as nominal rulers from their base in Satara. The Marathas kept the British at bay during the 18th century. By 1760, with the defeat of the Nizam in the Deccan, Maratha power had reached its zenith. However, dissension between the Peshwa and their sardars (army commanders) saw a gradual downfall of the Empire leading to its eventual annexation by the British East India Company in 1818 after the three Anglo-Maratha wars.\\r\\nA few years later, the Aurangzeb's viceroy in Ahmednagar, Nizam-ul-Mulk, established the seat of an independent government at Hyderabad in 1724. Mysore was ruled by Hyder Ali. During the contests for power which ensued from about the middle of the 18th century between the powers on the plateau, the French and British took opposite sides. After a brief course of triumph, the interests of France declined, and a new empire in India was established by the British. Mysore formed one of their earliest conquests in the Deccan. Tanjore and the Carnatic were soon annexed to their dominions, followed by the Peshwa territories in 1818.\\r\\nIn British India, the plateau was largely divided between the presidencies of Bombay and Madras. The two largest native states at that time were Hyderabad and Mysore; many smaller states existed at the time, including Kolhapur, and Sawantwari.\\r\\nAfter independence in 1947, almost all native states were incorporated into the Republic of India. Hyderabad refused to join, and was annexed by the Indian Army in Operation Polo in 1948.[19] In 1956, the States Reorganisation Act reorganized states along linguistic lines, leading to the states currently found on the plateau.\\r\\nThe Deccan plateau is very rich in minerals and precious stones.[20] The plateaus mineral wealth led many lowland rulers, including those of the Mauryan (4thÿ2nd century BCE) and Gupta (4thÿ6th century CE) dynasties, to fight over it.[21] Major minerals found here include coal, iron ore, asbestos, chromite, mica, and kyanite. Since March 2011, large deposits of uranium have been discovered in the Tummalapalle belt and in the Bhima basin at Gogi in Karnataka. The Tummalapalle belt uranium reserve promises to be one of the top 20?uranium reserve discoveries of the world.[22][23][24]\\r\\nLow rainfall made farming difficult until the introduction of irrigation. Currently, the area under cultivation is quite low, ranging from 60% in Maharastra to about 10% in Western Ghats.[25] Except in developed areas of certain river valleys, double-cropping is rare. Rice is the predominant crop in high-rainfall areas and sorghum in low-rainfall areas. Other crops of significance include cotton, tobacco, oilseeds, and sugar cane. Coffee, tea, coconuts, areca, pepper, rubber, cashew nuts, tapioca, and cardamom are widely grown on plantations in the Nilgiri Hills and on the western slopes of the Western Ghats. Cultivation of Jatropha has recently received more attention due to the Jatropha incentives in India.\\r\\nDeccan style\\r\\nCalligraphic emblem of sculpted sandstone ÿ 16th century\\r\\nNimmatnama-i Nasiruddin-Shahi (the Book of Recipes)\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 17N 77E? / ?17N 77E? / 17; 77","input":"What type of soil is found in deccan plateau?"},{"output":"Bobby Hurley","context":"As player:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Coach\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Matthew Hurley (born June 28, 1971) is an American basketball coach and former college and professional player.

In his first conference game with the Sun Devils, he gained notoriety when he got ejected for 2 technical fouls in 15 seconds for arguing with the officials against the rival Arizona Wildcats.[14] After he got ejected, he encouraged the crowd to continue to taunt the officials.[15] Following a 15ÿ17 first season at Arizona State, Hurley's contract was extended through 2021.[16] A second season showed small improvements and ASU improved its roster with transfers and a few recruits. During his third year as head coach, Hurley would lead Arizona State to their first ever 12ÿ0 start to sweep their non-conference schedule. Along the way, ASU beat Top-10 teams Kansas and Xavier and were ranked #3 by the Associated Press. With three senior guards leading the way during that time, they began to market themselves as 'Guard U' to start the 2017-18 Pac-12 Conference schedule against their rivals Arizona Wildcats.

It was invented in 1962 by Lou Groen, a McDonald's franchise owner in owner in Cincinnati, Ohio,[1] [2] in response to falling hamburger sales on Fridays resulting from the Roman Catholic practice of abstaining from meat on Fridays.[3] While the fish composition of the sandwich has changed through the years to satisfy taste and supply shortcomings, the framework of its ingredients have remained constant; a fried breaded fish fillet, a steamed bun, tartar sauce, and pasteurized processed American cheese.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of December 2014[update], the Filet-O-Fish contains a battered, fried fish fillet made from Alaska pollock.[4] In the Republic of Ireland either hoki or Alaska pollock may be served.[5] In New Zealand and the United Kingdom Filet-O-Fish contains hoki instead of Alaska pollock.[6] McDonald's Canada, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Czech Republic, The Netherlands and Hong Kong use a half slice of cheese in each Filet-O-Fish sandwich.[7][8][9][10]\\r\\nThe sandwich was invented in 1962 by Lou Groen, a McDonald's franchise owner in Cincinnati, Ohio;[11] [12] his store was in a predominantly Roman Catholic, which led to falling hamburger sales on Fridays resulting from the Roman Catholic practice of abstaining from meat on Fridays. [13]\\r\\nThe product was named by Cye Landy of Cye Landy Advertising Agency, which was the advertising firm for that particular McDonald's franchise.\\r\\nIt has become popular with people with dietary restrictions concerning meat-based products. For example, in Judaism, the fish used in the sandwich is considered kosher even without special preparation, while other meats would require special slaughter techniques to be considered kosher.[14] However, the preparation of the fish alongside non-kosher meat products and in a non-Kosher kitchen renders the Filet-O-Fish non-kosher.\\r\\nThe sandwich was the first non-hamburger menu item brought in by new McDonald's company owner Ray Kroc.[15] Kroc made a deal with Groen: they would sell two non-meat sandwiches on a Friday, Kroc's own Hula Burger (grilled pineapple with cheese on a cold bun) and the Filet-O-Fish, and whichever sold the most would be added to the permanent menu. The Filet-O-Fish \\"won hands down\\"[16] and was added to menus throughout 1963 until reaching nationwide status in 1965.[17]\\r\\nThe use of farmed fish in the Filet-O-Fish first came about in 1981, when an owner of a New Zealand fisheries company was dissatisfied with the pollock Filet-O-Fish he purchased at the Courtenay Place, Wellington restaurant. Saying to the manager that he could make a better-tasting fish fillet, he was handed a box of fillets and told to come back with identical, better-tasting fillets. He substituted red cod for the pollock, and after the manager was satisfied with the better-tasting red cod fillets, ended up in agreement to supply the Courtenay Place restaurant (and eventually several other New Zealand restaurants) with the red cod fillets. The similar-tasting hoki was substituted several years later, due to its competitive market value and its boneless fillets, and eventually was introduced widely in the early 1990s when global pollock stocks were facing low numbers.[18] McDonald's removed the Filet-O-Fish from its menus in the United States on September 26, 1996,[19] and replaced it with the Fish Filet Deluxe sandwich, which was part of McDonald's ill-fated Deluxe line of sandwiches. However, the Filet-O-Fish was brought back to its menus on a gradual basis starting in the middle of 1997, due to overwhelming letters and petitions, receiving the larger fish patty from the Fish Filet Deluxe. The Fish Filet Deluxe itself was discontinued at most restaurants early the next year, while others kept it a little longer until the Fish Filet Deluxe was finally removed in the year 2000.[20]\\r\\nIn November 2007, McDonald's lowered the use of New Zealand hoki and increased the use of Alaskan pollock,[21] due to declining New Zealand hoki fishery sustainability and large cutbacks in the total allowable commercial catch of hoki by the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries - from 250,000?tonnes in 1997 to 90,000?tonnes in 2007.[22] McDonald's originally used Atlantic cod, before declining cod catches forced McDonald's to find sustainable fish elsewhere. McDonald's is trying to maintain fish only from areas certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council, but that is becoming more difficult each year. Hoki is still a major ingredient.[23]\\r\\nAs of March 2009, the Marine Stewardship Council[24] placed the Alaskan pollock fisheries in a re-assessment program[25] due to catch numbers declining by over 30% between 2005 and 2008, and by-catch problems with salmon.\\r\\nAs of January 2013 the Marine Stewardship Council stated that the pollock comes from suppliers with sustainable fishing practices, and McDonald's packaging and promotion will reflect that change.[26]\\r\\nIn February 2015, for a limited time, McDonald's began offering a special Filet-O-Fish with Old Bay Seasoning in 700 stores within the United States[27]\\r\\nCaptain Crook, the McDonaldland character, was previously used to market the sandwich to children. Frankie the Fish was created to promote the burger in 2009, being based on the early 2000s Big Mouth Billy Bass fad, and even getting an animatronic singing fish counterpart from Big Mouth Billy Bass's creators, Gemmy Industries.","input":"What kind of fish is used at mcdonalds?"},{"output":"United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS)","context":"The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a cabinet department of the United States federal government with responsibilities in public security, roughly comparable to the interior or home ministries of other countries. Its stated missions involve anti-terrorism, border security, immigration and customs, cyber security, and disaster prevention and management.[3] It was created in response to the September 11 attacks and is the youngest U.S. cabinet department.\\r\\nIn fiscal year 2017, it was allocated a net discretionary budget of $40.6 billion.[2] With more than 240,000 employees,[4] DHS is the third largest Cabinet department, after the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.[5] Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council. Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the Departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy.\\r\\nThe former Secretary, John F. Kelly, was replaced by Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on December 5, 2017.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereas the Department of Defense is charged with military actions abroad, the Department of Homeland Security works in the civilian sphere to protect the United States within, at, and outside its borders. Its stated goal is to prepare for, prevent, and respond to domestic emergencies, particularly terrorism.[7] On March 1, 2003, DHS absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and assumed its duties. In doing so, it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies: Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. The investigative divisions and intelligence gathering units of the INS and Customs Service were merged forming Homeland Security Investigations. Additionally, the border enforcement functions of the INS, including the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were consolidated into a new agency under DHS: U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Federal Protective Service falls under the National Protection and Programs Directorate.\\r\\nThe Department of Homeland Security is headed by the Secretary of Homeland Security with the assistance of the Deputy Secretary. The Department contains the components listed below.[8]\\r\\n(Passports for U.S. citizens are issued by the United States Department of State, not the Department of Homeland Security.)\\r\\nAdvisory groups:\\r\\nOther components:\\r\\nIn an August 5, 2002 speech, President Bush said: \\"We're fighting ... to secure freedom in the homeland.\\"[16] Prior to the creation of DHS, American presidents had referred to the U.S. as \\"the nation\\" or \\"the republic\\", and to its internal policies as \\"domestic\\".[17] Also unprecedented was the use, from 2002, of the phrase \\"the homeland\\" by White House spokespeople.[17]\\r\\nIn 2011, the Department of Homeland Security phased out the old Homeland Security Advisory System, replacing it with a two-level National Terrorism Advisory System. The system has two types of advisories: Alerts and Bulletins. NTAS Bulletins permit the Secretary to communicate critical terrorism information that, while not necessarily indicative of a specific threat against the United States, can reach homeland security partners or the public quickly, thereby allowing recipients to implement necessary protective measures. Alerts are issued when there is specific and credible information of a terrorist threat against the United States. Alerts themselves have two levels: Elevated and Imminent. An Elevated Alert is issued when there is credible information about an attack but only general information about timing or a target. An Imminent Alert is issued when the threat is very specific and impending in the very near term.\\r\\nOn March 12, 2002, the Homeland Security Advisory System, a color-coded terrorism risk advisory scale, was created as the result of a Presidential Directive to provide a \\"comprehensive and effective means to disseminate information regarding the risk of terrorist acts to Federal, State, and local authorities and to the American people.\\" Many procedures at government facilities are tied into the alert level; for example a facility may search all entering vehicles when the alert is above a certain level. Since January 2003, it has been administered in coordination with DHS; it has also been the target of frequent jokes and ridicule on the part of the administration's detractors about its ineffectiveness. After resigning, Tom Ridge stated that he did not always agree with the threat level adjustments pushed by other government agencies.[18]\\r\\nIn January 2003, the office[clarification needed] was merged into the Department of Homeland Security and the White House Homeland Security Council, both of which were created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Council, similar in nature to the National Security Council, retains a policy coordination and advisory role and is led by the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security.[19]\\r\\nAs of January 13, 2011, the DHS advised the American public of an 'elevated national threat' level, recommending that all Americans 'should establish an emergency preparedness kit and emergency plan for themselves and their family, and stay informed about what to do during an emergency'.[20]\\r\\nIn response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush announced the establishment of the Office of Homeland Security (OHS) to coordinate \\"homeland security\\" efforts. The office was headed by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, who assumed the title of Assistant to the President for Homeland Security. The official announcement stated:\\r\\nRidge began his duties as OHS director on October 8, 2001.\\r\\nAccording to Peter Andreas, a border theorist, the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War,[21] and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947, which placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency. DHS also constitutes the most diverse merger of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization.[22]\\r\\nThe Department of Homeland Security was established on November 25, 2002, by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. It was intended to consolidate U.S. executive branch organizations related to \\"homeland security\\" into a single Cabinet agency. The following 22 agencies were incorporated into the new department:[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the signing of the bill, controversy about its adoption centered on whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency should be incorporated in part or in whole (neither were included). The bill was also controversial for the presence of unrelated \\"riders\\", as well as for eliminating certain union-friendly civil service and labor protections for department employees. Without these protections, employees could be expeditiously reassigned or dismissed on grounds of security, incompetence or insubordination, and DHS would not be required to notify their union representatives.\\r\\nThe plan stripped 180,000 government employees of their union rights.[24] In 2002, Bush officials argued that the September 11 attacks made the proposed elimination of employee protections imperative.[25]\\r\\nCongress ultimately passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002 without the union-friendly measures, and President Bush signed the bill into law on November 25, 2002. It was the largest U.S. government reorganization in the 50 years since the United States Department of Defense was created.\\r\\nTom Ridge was named secretary on January 24, 2003 and began naming his chief deputies. DHS officially began operations on January 24, 2003, but most of the department's component agencies were not transferred into the new Department until March 1.[19]\\r\\nAfter establishing the basic structure of DHS and working to integrate its components and get the department functioning, Ridge announced his resignation on November 30, 2004, following the re-election of President Bush. Bush initially nominated former New York City Police Department commissioner Bernard Kerik as his successor, but on December 10, Kerik withdrew his nomination, citing personal reasons and saying it \\"would not be in the best interests\\" of the country for him to pursue the post.\\r\\nOn January 11, 2005, President Bush nominated federal judge Michael Chertoff to succeed Ridge. Chertoff was confirmed on February 15, 2005, by a vote of 98ÿ0 in the U.S. Senate. He was sworn in the same day.[19]\\r\\nIn February 2005, DHS and the Office of Personnel Management issued rules relating to employee pay and discipline for a new personnel system named MaxHR. The Washington Post said that the rules would allow DHS \\"to override any provision in a union contract by issuing a department-wide directive\\" and would make it \\"difficult, if not impossible, for unions to negotiate over arrangements for staffing, deployments, technology and other workplace matters.\\"[25]\\r\\nIn August 2005, U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer blocked the plan on the grounds that it did not ensure collective-bargaining rights for DHS employees.[25]\\r\\nA federal appeals court ruled against DHS in 2006; pending a final resolution to the litigation, Congress's fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for DHS provided no funding for the proposed new personnel system.[25] DHS announced in early 2007 that it was retooling its pay and performance system and retiring the name \\"MaxHR\\".[19]\\r\\nIn a February 2008 court filing, DHS said that it would no longer pursue the new rules, and that it would abide by the existing civil service labor-management procedures. A federal court issued an order closing the case.[25]\\r\\nA DHS press release dated June 6, 2003[26] explains the seal as follows:\\r\\nThe seal is symbolic of the Department's mission ÿ to prevent attacks and protect Americans ÿ on the land, in the sea and in the air. In the center of the seal, a graphically styled white American eagle appears in a circular blue field. The eagle's outstretched wings break through an inner red ring into an outer white ring that contains the words \\"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF\\" in the top half and \\"HOMELAND SECURITY\\" in the bottom half in a circular placement. The eagle's wings break through the inner circle into the outer ring to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will break through traditional bureaucracy and perform government functions differently. In the tradition of the Great Seal of the United States, the eagle's talon on the left holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 seeds while the eagle's talon on the right grasps 13 arrows.\\r\\nCentered on the eagle's breast is a shield divided into three sections containing elements that represent the American homeland ÿ air, land, and sea. The top element, a dark blue sky, contains 22 stars representing the original 22 entities that have come together to form the department. The left shield element contains white mountains behind a green plain underneath a light blue sky. The right shield element contains four wave shapes representing the oceans alternating light and dark blue separated by white lines.\\r\\nThe seal was developed with input from senior DHS leadership, employees, and the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts. The Ad Council ÿ which partners with DHS on its Ready.gov campaign ÿ and the consulting company Landor Associates were responsible for graphic design and maintaining heraldic integrity.\\r\\nSince its inception, the department has had its temporary headquarters in Washington, D.C.'s Nebraska Avenue Complex, a former naval facility. The 38-acre (15?ha) site, across from American University, has 32 buildings comprising 566,000 square feet (52,600?m2) of administrative space.[27] In early 2007, the Department submitted a $4.1 billion plan to Congress to consolidate its 60-plus Washington-area offices into a single headquarters complex at the St. Elizabeths Hospital campus in Anacostia, Southeast Washington, D.C. The earliest DHS would begin moving to St. Elizabeths is 2012.[28]\\r\\nThe move is being championed by District of Columbia officials because of the positive economic impact it will have on historically depressed Anacostia. The move has been criticized by historic preservationists, who claim the revitalization plans will destroy dozens of historic buildings on the campus.[29] Community activists have criticized the plans because the facility will remain walled off and have little interaction with the surrounding area.[30] On January 8, 2009, the National Capital Planning Commission approved the Department of Homeland Security's plans to move into the campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital.[31] In February 2015 the General Services Administration said that the site would open in 2021.[32]\\r\\nDuring a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the reauthorization of DHS, Elaine Duke, deputy secretary of DHS, said there is a weariness and anxiety within DHS about the repeated congressional efforts to agree to a long-term spending plan, which has resulted in several threats to shutdown the federal government. \\"Shutdowns are disruptive,\\" Duke said. She said the \\"repeated failure on a longtime spending plan resulting in short-term continuing resolutions (CRs) has caused angst among the departments 240,000 employees in the weeks leading up to the CRs.\\"[33] The uncertainty about funding hampers DHSs ability to pursue major projects and it takes away attention and manpower from important priorities. Seventy percent of DHS employees are considered essential and are not furloughed during government shutdowns.[33]\\r\\nSoon after the formation of Department of Homeland Security, the department worked with the Ad Council to launch the Ready Campaign, a national public service advertising (PSA) campaign to educate and empower Americans to prepare for and respond to emergencies including natural and man-made disasters. With pro bono creative support from the Martin Agency of Richmond, Virginia, the campaign website \\"Ready.gov\\" and materials were conceived in March 2002 and launched in February 2003, just before the launch of the Iraq War.[34][35][36] One of the first announcements that garnered widespread public attention to this campaign was one by Tom Ridge in which he stated that in the case of a chemical attack, citizens should use duct tape and plastic sheeting to build a homemade bunker, or \\"sheltering in place\\" to protect themselves.[37][38] As a result, the sales of duct tape skyrocketed and DHS was criticized for being too alarmist.[39]\\r\\nOn March 1, 2003, the Federal Emergency Management Agency was absorbed into the DHS, and in fall of 2008, took over coordination of the campaign. The Ready Campaign and its Spanish language version Listo.gov asks individuals to do three things: build an emergency supply kit,[40] make a family emergency plan[41] and be informed about the different types of emergencies that can occur and how to respond.[42] The campaign messages have been promoted through television, radio, print, outdoor and web PSAs,[43] as well as brochures, toll-free phone lines and the English and Spanish language websites Ready.gov and Listo.gov.\\r\\nThe general campaign aims to reach all Americans, but targeted resources are also available via \\"Ready Business\\" for small- to medium-sized business and \\"Ready Kids\\" for parents and teachers of children ages 8ÿ12. In 2015, the campaign also launched a series of PSAs to help the whole community,[44] people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs prepare for emergencies, which included open captioning, a certified deaf interpreter and audio descriptions for viewers who are blind or have low vision.[45]\\r\\nOn March 1, 2004, the National Incident Management System (NIMS) was created. The stated purpose was to provide a consistent incident management approach for federal, state, local, and tribal governments. Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5, all federal departments were required to adopt the NIMS and to use it in their individual domestic incident management and emergency prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation program and activities.\\r\\nIn December 2004, the National Response Plan (NRP) was created, in an attempt to align federal coordination structures, capabilities, and resources into a unified, all-discipline, and all-hazards approach to domestic incident management. The NRP was built on the template of the NIMS.\\r\\nOn January 22, 2008, the National Response Framework was published in the Federal Register as an updated replacement of the NRP, effective March 22, 2008.\\r\\nThe Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act directs the DHS Secretary to designate employees from throughout the Department to staff a Surge Capacity Force (SCF). During a declared disaster, the DHS Secretary will determine if SCF support is necessary. The Secretary will then authorize FEMA to task and deploy designated personnel from DHS components and other Federal Executive Agencies to respond to extraordinary disasters.[46]\\r\\nThe DHS National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) is responsible for the response system, risk management program, and requirements for cyber-security in the U.S. The division is home to US-CERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System.[47][48] The DHS Science and Technology Directorate helps government and private end-users transition to new cyber-security capabilities. This directorate also funds the Cyber Security Research and Development Center, which identifies and prioritizes research and development for NCSD.[48] The center works on the Internet's routing infrastructure (the SPRI program) and Domain Name System (DNSSEC), identity theft and other online criminal activity (ITTC), Internet traffic and networks research (PREDICT datasets and the DETER testbed), Department of Defense and HSARPA exercises (Livewire and Determined Promise), and wireless security in cooperation with Canada.[49]\\r\\nOn October 30, 2009, DHS opened the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center. The center brings together government organizations responsible for protecting computer networks and networked infrastructure.[50]\\r\\nIn January 2017, DHS officially designated state-run election systems as critical infrastructure. The designation made it easier for state and local election officials to get cybersecurity help from the federal government. In October 2017, DHS convened a Government Coordinating Council (GCC) for the Election Infrastructure Subsection with representatives from various state and federal agencies such as the Election Assistance Commission and National Association of Secretaries of State.[51]\\r\\nIn the United States Federal Budget for 2010, entitled 'A New Era of Responsibility', the DHS was allocated a discretionary budget of $42.7 billion (financial year 2009: $40.1 billion).[52] The end-of-year DHS Annual Financial Report for financial year 2010 showed a net cost of operations of $56.4 billion (FY 2009, restated: $49.9 billion), out of total budgetary resources of $83.2 billion (FY 2009, restated: $85.2 billion).[53] The components with the highest net cost were US Coast Guard ($12.1 billion), U.S. Customs and Border Protection ($11.6 billion), and Federal Emergency Management Agency ($10.5 billion).[53] Revenues of $10.4 billion were generated in the year (FY 2009, restated: $9.8 billion).[53]\\r\\nAccording to the Washington Post, \\"DHS has given $31 billion in grants since 2003 to state and local governments for homeland security and to improve their ability to find and protect against terrorists, including $3.8 billion in 2010.\\"[54]\\r\\nThe DHS independent auditor is KPMG, one of the Big Four audit firms.[55] Due to the level of material weaknesses identified, KPMG was unable to audit the DHS financial statements for FY 2010.[55] KPMG was unable to express an audit opinion on the FY 2009,[56] FY 2008,[57] FY 2007,[58] FY 2005,[59] and FY 2003[60] financial statements. Attempts to access the reports for FY 2006 and FY 2004 within the 'information for citizens' portal met with a 404 error.[61] The Message from the DHS Chief Financial Officer in the FY 2010 report states 'This Annual Financial Report (AFR) is our principal financial statement of accountability to the President, Congress and the American public. The AFR gives a comprehensive view of the Department's financial activities and demonstrates the Department's stewardship of taxpayer dollars.'[62] The Message from the DHS Chief Financial Officer concludes 'I am extremely proud of the Department's accomplishments ... we will continue to build upon our successes.'[62] The Secretary of Homeland Security endorsed this message saying that the DHS is 'continuing to be responsible stewards of taxpayer resources. The scope of our mission is broad, challenging, and vital to the security of the Nation ... Thank you for your partnership and collaboration. Yours very truly, Janet Napolitano.'[63]\\r\\nThe Department of Homeland Security has received substantial criticism over excessive bureaucracy, waste, fraud, ineffectiveness and lack of transparency. Its information sharing centers have been accused of violating American civil liberties and targeting American citizens as potential threats to national security.\\r\\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been dogged by persistent criticism over excessive bureaucracy, waste, ineffectiveness and lack of transparency. Congress estimates that the department has wasted roughly $15 billion in failed contracts (as of September?2008[update]).[64] In 2003, the department came under fire after the media revealed that Laura Callahan, Deputy Chief Information Officer at DHS with responsibilities for sensitive national security databases, had obtained her bachelor, masters, and doctorate computer science degrees through Hamilton University, a diploma mill in a small town in Wyoming.[65] The department was blamed for up to $2 billion of waste and fraud after audits by the Government Accountability Office revealed widespread misuse of government credit cards by DHS employees, with purchases including beer brewing kits, $70,000 of plastic dog booties that were later deemed unusable, boats purchased at double the retail price (many of which later could not be found), and iPods ostensibly for use in \\"data storage\\".[66][67][68][69]\\r\\nA 2015 inspection of IT infrastructure found that the department was running over a hundred computer systems whose owners were unknown, including Secret and Top Secret databases, many with out of date security or weak passwords. Basic security reviews were absent, and the department had apparently made deliberate attempts to delay publication of information about the flaws.[70]\\r\\nThe Associated Press reported on September 5, 2007, that DHS had scrapped an anti-terrorism data mining tool called ADVISE (Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight and Semantic Enhancement) after the agency's internal Inspector General found that pilot testing of the system had been performed using data on real people without required privacy safeguards in place.[71][72] The system, in development at Lawrence Livermore and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory since 2003, has cost the agency $42 million to date. Controversy over the program is not new; in March 2007, the Government Accountability Office stated that \\"the ADVISE tool could misidentify or erroneously associate an individual with undesirable activity such as fraud, crime or terrorism.\\" Homeland Security's Inspector General later said that ADVISE was poorly planned, time-consuming for analysts to use, and lacked adequate justifications.[73]\\r\\nFusion centers are terrorism prevention and response centers, many of which were created under a joint project between the Department of Homeland Security and the US Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs between 2003 and 2007. The fusion centers gather information not only from government sources, but also from their partners in the private sector.[74][75]\\r\\nThey are designed to promote information sharing at the federal level between agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Justice, US Military and state and local level government. As of July?2009[update], the Department of Homeland Security recognized at least seventy-two fusion centers.[76] Fusion centers may also be affiliated with an Emergency Operations Center that responds in the event of a disaster.\\r\\nThere are a number of documented criticisms of fusion centers, including relative ineffectiveness at counterterrorism activities, the potential to be used for secondary purposes unrelated to counterterrorism, and their links to violations of civil liberties of American citizens and others.[77]\\r\\nDavid Rittgers of the Cato Institute has noted:\\r\\na long line of fusion center and DHS reports labeling broad swaths of the public as a threat to national security. The North Texas Fusion System labeled Muslim lobbyists as a potential threat; a DHS analyst in Wisconsin thought both pro- and anti-abortion activists were worrisome; a Pennsylvania homeland security contractor watched environmental activists, Tea Party groups, and a Second Amendment rally; the Maryland State Police put anti-death penalty and anti-war activists in a federal terrorism database; a fusion center in Missouri thought that all third-party voters and Ron Paul supporters were a threat....[78]\\r\\nThe Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) made news in 2009 for targeting supporters of third party candidates (such as Ron Paul), pro-life activists, and conspiracy theorists as potential militia members.[79] Anti-war activists and Islamic lobby groups were targeted in Texas, drawing criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union.[80]\\r\\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security:[81]\\r\\nThe Privacy Office has identified a number of risks to privacy presented by the fusion center program:\\r\\nIn 2009, the Virginia Fusion Center came under criticism for publishing a terrorism threat assessment which stated that certain universities are potential hubs for terror related activity.[82] The report targeted historically black colleges and identified hacktivism as a form of terrorism.[83]\\r\\nIn 2006, MSNBC reported that Grant Goodman, \\"an 81-year-old retired University of Kansas history professor, received a letter from his friend in the Philippines that had been opened and resealed with a strip of dark green tape bearing the words \\"by Border Protection\\" and carrying the official Homeland Security seal.\\"[84] The letter was sent by a devout Catholic Filipino woman with no history of supporting Islamic terrorism.[84] A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection \\"acknowledged that the agency can, will and does open mail coming to U.S. citizens that originates from a foreign country whenever it's deemed necessary\\":\\r\\n\\"All mail originating outside the United States Customs territory that is to be delivered inside the U.S. Customs territory is subject to Customs examination,\\" says the CBP Web site. That includes personal correspondence. \\"All mail means 'all mail,'\\" said John Mohan, a CBP spokesman, emphasizing the point.[84]\\r\\nThe Department declined to outline what criteria are used to determine when a piece of personal correspondence should be opened or to say how often or in what volume Customs might be opening mail.[84]\\r\\nGoodman's story provoked outrage in the blogosphere,[85] as well as in the more established media. Reacting to the incident, Mother Jones remarked that \\"[u]nlike other prying government agencies, Homeland Security wants you to know it is watching you.\\"[86] CNN observed that \\"[o]n the heels of the NSA wiretapping controversy, Goodman's letter raises more concern over the balance between privacy and security.\\"[87]\\r\\nIn July 2006, the Office of Personnel Management conducted a survey of federal employees in all 36 federal agencies on job satisfaction and how they felt their respective agency was headed. DHS was last or near to last in every category including;\\r\\nThe low scores were attributed to major concerns about basic supervision, management and leadership within the agency. Examples from the survey reveal most concerns are about promotion and pay increase based on merit, dealing with poor performance, rewarding creativity and innovation, leadership generating high levels of motivation in the workforce, recognition for doing a good job, lack of satisfaction with various component policies and procedures and lack of information about what is going on with the organization.[88][89]\\r\\nDHS is the only large federal agency to score below 50% in overall survey rankings. It was last of large federal agencies in 2014 with 44.0% and fell even lower in 2015 at 43.1%, again last place.[90]\\r\\nIn the Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests, published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data), the Department of Homeland Security earned a D by scoring 69 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. did not earn a satisfactory overall grade. It also had not updated its FOIA policies since the 2007 FOIA amendments.[91]","input":"What agency was created to secure america from terrorist attacks?"},{"output":"borders the city of St. Louis","context":"Clayton is a city in and the county seat of St. Louis County, Missouri, United States,[6] and borders the city of St. Louis.

Ever since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the United States, America has had much trouble with environmental issues, air pollution in particular. According to a 2009 report, around \\"60 percent of Americans live in areas where air pollution has reached unhealthy levels that can make people sick\\".[1] Pollution in the United States has plummeted in the recent decade, with pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide decreasing despite the fact the number of vehicles on the road isn't. This is due to better regulations, economic shifts, and technological innovations. With respect to nitrogen dioxide, NASA reported a 32% decrease in New York City and a 42% decrease in Atlanta between the periods of 2005-2007 and 2009-2011. Air pollution can cause a variety of health problems including, but not limited to infections, behavioral changes, cancer, organ failure, and even premature death. These health effects are not equally distributed in terms of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, and more in the United States. California has the worst air quality of any state, and in most surveys the cities in California rank in the top 5 or top 10 of most polluted air in the United States.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s, 1970s, and 1990s, the United States Congress enacted a series of Clean Air Acts which significantly strengthened regulation of air pollution. Individual U.S. states, some European nations and eventually the European Union followed these initiatives. The Clean Air Act sets numerical limits on the concentrations of a basic group of air pollutants and provide reporting and enforcement mechanisms.\\r\\nIn 1999, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) replaced the Pollution Standards Index (PSI) with the Air Quality Index (AQI) to incorporate new PM2.5 and Ozone standards.\\r\\nThe effects of these laws have been very positive. In the United States between 1970 and 2006, citizens enjoyed the following reductions in annual pollution emissions:[3]\\r\\nIn an October 2006 letter to EPA, the agency's independent scientific advisors warned that the ozone smog standard needs to be substantially reduced and that there is no scientific justification for retaining the current, weaker standard. The scientists unanimously recommended a smog threshold of 60 to 70 ppb after they conducted an extensive review of the evidence.[4]\\r\\nThe EPA has proposed, in June 2007, a new threshold of 75 ppb. This is less strict than the scientific recommendation, but is more strict than the current standard.\\r\\nSome industries are lobbying to keep the current standards in place. Environmentalists and public health advocates are mobilizing to support the scientific recommendations.[citation needed]\\r\\nAn outpouring of fugitive dust layered with man-made sulfates, smog, industrial fumes, carbon grit, and nitrates is crossing the Pacific Ocean on prevailing winds from booming Asian economies in plumes so vast they alter the climate. Almost a third of the air over Los Angeles and San Francisco can be traced directly to Asia. With it comes up to three-quarters of the black carbon particulate pollution that reaches the West Coast.[5]\\r\\nIn the United States unhealthy levels of pollution are measured by the Environmental Protection Agency and independent researchers or agencies, like the American Lung Association. Federal limits and pollution standards are set by the Clean Air Act.\\r\\nAs air pollution increases, symptoms of asthma worsen. Asthma's etiology is poorly understood and currently has no cure. There are many environmental factors that attribute to asthma. The main sources of environmental pollution are the burning of fossil fuels in the combustion engines, dust generated by traffic on road surfaces, and biomass used for cooking and heating. In urban areas, there are high concentrations of particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and other volatile organic compounds and can make breathing more difficult. Young children who are exposed to air pollution are extremely vulnerable. One reason they are more vulnerable is because the average breathing pattern for an adult is 16 to 20 breaths per minute, while a 1-year-old child has a faster breathing pattern which is 20 to 40 breaths per minute. Therefore, children will be inhaling more pollutants than adults.[6]\\r\\nPrenatal exposures to air pollution have influenced respiratory health starts in utero.[7] Mothers who were exposed to PM2.5 weekly during gestation, were likely to have a child diagnosed with asthma by the age 6 years. Many of the mothers exposed to PM2.5 were ethnic minorities (54% Hispanic, 30% black), had 12 or fewer years of education (66%), and did not smoke in pregnancy (80%).[7] Inner-city children from the age of 5ÿ11 years old were diagnosed with Asthma, due to prenatal exposure to phthalates, butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP). These phthalates were detected in urine samples from 300 pregnant women.[8]\\r\\nRoughly seven million children suffer from asthma, meaning 1 out of every 10 children, and the rates have been steadily increasing. Among African American children, one out of six children suffer from asthma, which has rose from 50% since 2001. This issue of respiratory problems accounts for 88% of premature deaths in low-income to middle-class counties in America.[9] Population-based studies have shown that communities with a high proportion of African Americans and Hispanics experience high rates of asthma.\\r\\nIn a study conducted by Yale University, 'Environmental Inequality in Exposures to Airborne Particulate Matter Components in the United States, Hispanics were exposed to 10 out of the 14 pollutants (e.g., 152% higher than whites for chlorine, 94% higher for aluminum), African Americans were exposed to 13 out of the 14 pollutants (e.g., 43% higher for zinc, 25% for vanadium), and Asians had higher exposures than whites (e.g., 103% for chlorine, 69% for vanadium, 64% for nickel). Some of the pollutants studied have been connected to asthma. In Bronx, New York, 66% of individuals who live in proximity of hazardous industrial facilities and waste sites are likely to be hospitalized for asthma. It has been reported that people who live within 1.86 miles of toxic waste facilities in the United States are people of color and twice as likely as white residents to live within a fence line zone of an industrial facility, contribute to air pollution, safety issues, and health concerns.[10]\\r\\nIn the United States, cardiovascular disease kills a person every 40 seconds.[11] While the effects of air pollution on the respiratory diseases are well understood, air pollution also affects the cardiovascular system at the same level as or higher level than the respiratory system,[12] and the adverse cardiovascular health outcomes in both children and adults are high when exposed to air pollution. Carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, ozone, lead, and particulate matter are also associated with increased hospitalization and mortality due to cardiovascular disease. Chromosomal damage is high among African American children and their mothers from Oakland, California who are exposed to traffic and regional ozone levels.[13] Coronary heart disease has been one of the leading cause of death in ethnic groups.[14] One study found that PM2.5 exposure increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases by 13%. Also, those who live in the area of lower socioeconomic status have higher risk of cardiovascular diseases caused by PM2.5 exposure.[15]\\r\\nIndoor air pollution, caused by kerosene space heaters, cooking, wall paints, second hand smoke and more, are also known to have an association with the cardiovascular diseases.[16][12] This increased risk of cardiovascular diseases by indoor air pollution disproportionately affects the people in the United States. The prevalence of being exposed to secondhand smoke is higher in African American population and lower income population, especially in those who live below the poverty level.[17] On the other hand, the risk of fatal cardiovascular diseases is higher in African American men and women than white men and women. For example, 25% of African American men have 6.67% or greater increased risk of fatal cardiovascular disease while only 10% of the white men have the same level of increased risk.[18] Furthermore, one county-level study found that median income and education level were the most significant factors associated with the cardiovascular diseases mortality disparities in the United States.[19]\\r\\nExposure to air pollution increases the risk of developing respiratory infections and cancers. Inhaled air pollutants damage the respiratory system and can lead to infections or cancer. Respiratory infections and cancer are related to each other. Having a respiratory infection raise the risk of cancer and vice versa.[20] Also, studies show that the risk of the respiratory infections and cancers caused by air pollution are not distributed equally in terms of race, class, and geographic placement.\\r\\nEven though the mechanistic association between air pollution and infections is still unclear and require further research,[21] some studies shows that the some air pollutants, including secondhand smoking, ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), may cause the infections.[21][22] According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), children have higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitis, if their parents smoke. CPSC mentions that 150,000 to 300,000 children (under 18 month) are affected by the lower respiratory tract infections which leads to 7,500 to 15,000 hospitalizations each year based on the EPA estimation. Exposure to higher level NO2 or long term exposure to low level NO2 also leads to higher risk for infections.[23]\\r\\nBiological air pollution also can lead to the infections. Small, invading organisms in human body, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites, can cause infections in the pulmonary system. There are variety of infections because many different organisms can cause the infections.\\r\\nThe prevalence of the bacterial infections is not equally distributed in terms race of and socioeconomic status. In the United States, bacterial pneumonia, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria (pneumococcus) which enters human body usually via inhalation,[24] is significantly associated with morbidity and mortality among adults. The risk of being diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia is more than double in African American people compared to white people (RR= 2.40). Also the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia in most impoverished African American census area, 20% or more people in the area live below the federal poverty level, is 4.44 times higher than the least impoverished white census area, less than 5% of the population in the area live below the federal poverty level, and 2.12 time higher than most impoverished white census area.[25]\\r\\nMany studies found that both indoor and outdoor air pollution can increase the risk of respiratory cancer. Indoor pollution such as tobacco smoking is responsible to lung cancer. Outdoor air pollution also increases the risk of lung cancer.[26] A study found that the combination of formaldehyde and benzene is responsible for 60% of cancer related health problems in the United States. Air pollutants can also cause other types of cancer. Another study found that the hazardous air pollutant (HAP) can cause cervical cancer and the upper aero-digestive tract cancer.[27]\\r\\nThe cancer caused by air pollution is not equally distributed in the United States. Cancer incidence and death rates are higher in African Americans than other races. A study conducted in Greater Houston, Texas shows that Hispanics and African-Americans have higher risks of HAP cancer. People who live near the public transit exhibit have higher HAP cancer risk as well.[28] Furthermore, another study shows that highly segregated metropolitan areas have higher estimated cancer risk caused by the air pollution. This trend was found for all racial groups, but was the strongest for Hispanics.[29]\\r\\nA study conducted in 2000 used geographic census data and outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration data to examine the disparities of NO2 air pollution across the United States. The study found that there is disproportional disparities in terms of both race and socioeconomic groups. The people of color were exposed to 4.6 ppb more than average NO2 concentrations than white people. Those who live in below poverty level are exposed to 1.2 ppb more. Lower-income Caucasians are exposed to 3.4 ppb higher NO2 concentrations than the higher-income Caucasians. The study also reports disproportional disparities of NO2 concentration exposure by education level; those who without high school education are more likely to be exposed to higher concentrations.[30] Association between NO2 exposure and cancer development has been found in many studies.[31]\\r\\nThe disproportional effects of air pollution on peoples cancer risk is seen not only in race difference. Within a single race community, there is unequal distribution of cancer risks. Among the Hispanic population in Miami, Florida, the traffic-related cancer risks are unequally distributed in terms of socioeconomic levels and country of origin. The Hispanic community with lower incomes are more likely to have higher traffic-related cancer risks. Also, it was found that Hispanics originally from Cuba and Colombia have higher risk of cancer caused by the traffic related toxins.[32]\\r\\nAir pollution is traditionally associated with pulmonary problems, but it also affects the entire body. Nano-sized pollutants can enter the body by penetrating pulmonary tissue after it is inhaled and enter the blood stream via capillaries. Once inside the circulatory system, the heart will spread the pollutants throughout the body. One of the places these pollutants accumulate and affect is the brain and nervous system. The brain is constantly changing and growing throughout a persons lifetime by reorganizing its synaptic connections in regards to its changing environment.[33] Therefore, presence and buildup of toxic pollutants in the brain can lead to health problems, diseases, and behavior changes[34] and people living in communities with poor air quality, usually low income, and colored communities, have higher chances of becoming ill than wealthy, white communities.\\r\\nIt is found that children living in areas of high air pollution, particularly high traffic pollution, tend to do worse on standardized testing. Black carbon is very small (PM2.5), very light absorbent pollutant that mostly comes from incomplete combustion of fuels.[35] According to a study in 1986ÿ2001 in Boston, children who were exposed to more black carbon did worse on the standardized tests they were given (Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test) in all subjects. In the study, there was also association found between increased black carbon levels, worse testing results and children who primarily spoke Spanish at home and have parents with lower education.[36] A similar study conducted was conducted on inner New York City children. This time, the study looked at polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (PM2.5) which is found in coal, tar, and incomplete combustion emissions. All of the children in the study were African American or Dominican and it was found that they have lower mental development index (MDI) scores and greater chances of having cognitive developmental delay than their Caucasian counterparts living in less polluted parts of the city.[37]\\r\\nAir pollution components such as heavy metals and reactive oxygen species can cause central nervous system health problems ranging from neuroinflammation to short-term memory disturbances to Parkinsons.[34] Particulate matter (PM), especially ultrafine particles (UFPM), that make its way up to and stay around the brain also become pro-inflammatory stimulus. This stimulus also leads to neuroinflammation. Human and animal studies show that neuroinflammation leads to neurodegenerative diseases.[34] A study showed that residents aged 54.7 I 4.8 years from highly polluted cities have significantly higher gene expression for an inflammatory gene in their brain than residents in the same age group from less polluted cities.[37] Though the mechanisms on how PM causes neuroinflammation, many studies hint that theres correlation between air pollutant caused neuroinflammation and development of Parkinsons Disease and Alzheimer Disease.[32]\\r\\nOzone is produced by naturally and artificially (vehicles, refineries, plants, etc.). It is a very strong oxidizing agent and when inhaled, it attacks tissues by modifying parts of cells and it can create potentially toxic by products.[38] It was found that there is no correlation between ozone effects estimates for mortality and PM readings of an area. In other words, damage done by ozone and by PM cannot be considered the same.[39] Extended periods of inhaling ozone causes neuron damage and death, motor deficits, and memory deficits in humans and animals.[34] Certain groups, such as African Americans, have higher chance of having ozone-caused health issues because of their higher ozone exposure.[40] A study conducted in Los Angeles, CA showed that there is a 12-15% increase in chance for a child to be born with or develop autism if the parents lived in areas with high ozone concentration during the child's gestation period. From the hospital records, it was found that majority of those parents were also Hispanic and were low income families. There were less autistic children born in majority white, highly educated, and high income communities.[39] The same study also found that higher levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO), both can undergo chemical reactions to form ozone, also can increase the chance of Autism in a child.\\r\\nThe health consequences of air pollution are often distributed unequally amongst a given area's population, and can disproportionately impact certain groups of people with greater severity than others. Because of this, much research has been devoted to discerning the determinants of increased exposure to pollutants. Three factors strongly correlated with increased risk include: race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and education. The underlying cause of this inequality may involve a multitude of systematic injustices which dictate exposure to harm or access to healthy environmental conditions.[41] This concept is known as environmental justice.\\r\\nIn particular, people of color can be more vulnerable to the detrimental effects of air pollution.[41] Studies have revealed that people of color experience significant disparities in income distribution than their white counterparts.[42] Therefore, many communities of color reside in impoverished neighborhoods and face unequal access to environmental health services and resources.[43]\\r\\nCertain environmental injustices can be viewed as discriminatory towards communities of racial minorities. The study of environmental racism highlights any disproportionate exposure to toxins or inaccessibility to ecological benefits such as clean water, clean air, and natural resources. Also, environmental racism is concerned with situations in which the government and large corporations target minority communities in order to commence environmentally damaging projects. They find that in these communities, there is often much less resistance and pressure to terminate these projects. When these projects are undertaken, nearby households and small businesses in these minority communities are negatively affected, sparking health problems among children and an overall decrease in the standard of living.\\r\\nAccording to the 2014 Census, the median household income for both African-Americans and Hispanics was about $43,300. On the other hand, white household income was around $71,300. Also, over 91% of African-Americans and 86% of Hispanics live in urban areas, whereas only about 70% of whites live in urban areas.[44] Furthermore, in April 2017, three environmental groupsEnvironmental Justice and Health Alliance for Chemical Policy Reform, Coming Clean, and Center for Effective Governmentcompleted a study regarding the disproportionate spread of environmental burdens. They define \\"fenceline zones\\" as areas within the vicinity of U.S. chemical facilities that are at of highest risk of death or injury after a potential chemical accident. They found that the 134 million people living in \\"fenceline zones\\" are 75% more likely to be African-American, 60% more likely to be Latino, and 50% more likely to be classified as having low socioeconomic status. The study was meant to not underline the idea that the United States government fails to justly protect its communities and but also to push the government to update chemical safety regulations nationwide. These factors greatly contribute to the fact minority exposure to harmful air pollutants ranges from 40% to 60% higher than whitesevan as air quality is slowly improving as a whole.[45]\\r\\nSocioeconomic Status (SES) is an individual's or group's sociological and economic status in society.[46] Low socioeconomic status can correlate to a greater risk of exposure to unsafe and unhealthy conditions. People of lower socioeconomic statuses have an unequal access to resources and safety measures while people of higher socioeconomic statuses have a greater access to health and safety resources/measures.[47]\\r\\nPeople of lower socioeconomic status may more frequently have poor health, thus the effects of air pollution can incur additional health risks and shorter lifespans on this population.[48]\\r\\nIn the United States, racial and ethnic minorities, defined as people of color who represent a small portion of the overall population, are socioeconomically disadvantaged, and have a history of past discrimination.[49] There are four recognized minority groups in the United States: Asians and Pacific Islanders, African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Those of low socioeconomic status and people of color are more vulnerable to the short term and long term effects of air pollution.[50] Short-term health effects of air pollution include but is not limited to bronchitis or pneumonia, frequent headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Some long term health effects are lung cancer and respiratory diseases, heart disease, and organ damage, and irreversible nerve damage.[51]\\r\\nPeople of lower socioeconomic status are found to be more vulnerable to air pollutant, PM 2.5, due to their location. PM 2.5 is an air pollutant, arising from the blend of power plants, refineries, and diesel engines, among other sources, and this particle penetrates the lungs.[52] Communities of low socioeconomic statuses are frequently concentrated in areas near highways, busy roads, and refineries. Therefore, limiting one's exposure to air pollution in an impoverished environment is nearly impossible. Communities of low socioeconomic status face an unequal access to environmental health services and resources.[53]\\r\\nThey generally divide into three categories:\\r\\nIn many ways, the socioeconomic status determines the education level that a person can achieve.[55] According to literature, there is a lower rate for students from low socioeconomic status communities to get access to higher level of education compared to the students from more affluent communities.[56] Further studies have indicated that there is a significant correlation between income and educational attainment.[57] Therefore, even though education may not have a direct correlation with the exposure to the environmental injustice, it can still be an indirect indicator of the disparity in the distribution of environmental burden.[58]\\r\\nThe Clean Power Plan is a policy designed by the Obama Administration to lower the levels of carbon dioxide emitted by power plants in the United States. The major estimated positive externalities of the plan include the reduction of air pollutants by up to 25% and the elimination of serious health altercations for those who live near factories and chemical facilities that emit carbon dioxide such as a considerable decrease of premature deaths and asthma attacks among children. Also, although steel, cement, and refining production jobs are likely to decrease on a large scale, this is expected to be counteracted by a boom in production and job opportunities in the solar and wind power sectors.\\r\\nThe plan was unveiled on August 3, 2015, but the continuation of the plan is now in question as the Trump Administration is expected to eliminate the policy during Donald Trumps presidency. On March 28, 2017, President Donald Trump began the first steps to eliminate the Clean Power Plan as he signed an executive order that mandated the Environmental Protection Agency to review the plan and its policies.[59]\\r\\nEnvironmental racism can be defined as any practice of environmental injustice that disproportionately affects minority neighborhoods and communities. Not only is the California population incredibly racially diverse, but because California is the primary air polluter and consequently spends extra time, money and resources to develop technologies that ensure air pollution doesn't become detrimental to the environment, its climate policy is one of the most technologically important in the developed world. As of March 2017, the Trump Administration is expected to withdraw the federal waiver that gives the Environmental Protection Agency and California the power to efficiently monitor and regulate greenhouse-gas pollution from car tailpipes. Environmental agents and environmental rights activists foreshadow that this action will certainly spell trouble for California's important climate policy; as well as further worsen the disproportionate spread of negative environmental health problems to neighborhoods of color throughout counties in California statewide.[60]\\r\\nDonald Trump has suggested that the Trump Administration is pushing for the United States to exit the Paris Agreement, which is an agreement created on December 12, 2015 within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to regulate global climate change as a whole. The Paris Agreement creates policies and regulations for the sustainable development of all regions of the globe with aims of developing technologies that will significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions worldwide as well as increase the ability of all nations to adapt to the multiplying effects of climate change. As of April 2017, 195 countries have signed the agreement and 143 countries have ratified it, already adopting certain policies called upon by the treaty. European Union energy officials are genuinely expressing their concerns that the United States will exit the agreement and are convinced that this action will have substantial negative impacts on the state of the global environment.[61]\\r\\nThe Energy Independence order was issued by the Trump Administration in order to designed to promote energy resources and economic growth by cutting regulation burdens on energy production such as coal, natural gas, nuclear material, flowing water, and other domestic sources, including renewable sources. To ensure that the Nation's electricity is affordable, reliable, safe, secure, and clean, all agencies are to respect their the proper roles of the Congress and the States concerning these matters in our constitutional republic. Environmental regulations must comply with the law, are of greater benefit than cost for the American people, and are developed through the best available peer-reviewed science and economics.[62]\\r\\nTrump promised to revive the coal industry and bring back coal-related jobs.[63] To fulfill his promise, on February 16, 2017, Trump signed a bill undoing the Stream Protection Rule signed during the Obama administration. This bill originally helped prevent coal mining from polluting waterways.[63] Burning coal produces air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PMX), Black carbon, and smog. Increase of coal usage would greatly increase air pollution especially in areas surrounding the facilities many of which are located in communities of color and low-income.[64]\\r\\nEnvironmental Health Education\\r\\nThe education status here does not merely refer to the educational background or the highest degree people have earned, but more importantly, the environmental health education. Generally, the population with less education are more likely to be exposed to the impact of air pollution.[65] For example, in the United States, people with a high school degree had 6.2% higher estimated exposure to PM 2.5 compared to those with a college degree. In addition to PM 2.5, people with a high school degree or lower are estimated to have at least 10% more exposure to Al, Ca, Cl, EC, SI, TI, V, and Zn when compared to people with a college degree.[66] Therefore, environmental health education could be one of the most effective approaches to raise the public awareness of the environmental issues.\\r\\nBefore 2017, the EPA have spent more than $8.7 million on environmental education annually to increase public knowledge and awareness about the current environmental issues and the consequences.[67] They aim to promote the popularization of the necessary skills and knowledge for the public to make decisions and participate in activities that lead to the resolution of environmental challenges.[68]\\r\\nAs of March 2017, the EPA budget have been severely impacted the condition of environmental education.[69] The 2018 United States federal budget cut approximately $2.5 billion from the roughly 8 billion annual budget for EPA, and the budget for environmental education was cut from $8.7 million to $0.555 million, which is reduced by 94%.[70]\\r\\nCalifornia's air is the most polluted in the U.S.A.[71]\\r\\nLos Angeles has the most contaminated air in the country. With a population of roughly over 10 million, the Los Angeles area is a large basin with the Pacific Ocean to the west, and several mountain ranges with 11,000-foot peaks to the east and south. Diesel engines, ports, motor vehicles, and industries are main sources of air pollution in Los Angeles. Frequent sunny days and low rainfall contribute to ozone formation, as well as high levels of fine particles and dust.[72] The strong relationship between AQI and ozone levels may be found on air pollution maps.[73]\\r\\nAir pollution in Los Angeles has caused widespread concerns. In 2011, the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) Survey on Californians and the Environment showed that 45% of citizens in Los Angeles consider air pollution to be a big problem, and 47% believe that the air quality of Los Angeles is worse than it was 10 years ago.[74] In 2013, the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Riverside area ranked the 1st most ozone-polluted city, the 4th most polluted city by annual particle pollution, and the 4th most polluted city by 24-hour particle pollution.[75]\\r\\nBoth ozone and particle pollution are dangerous to human health. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) engaged a panel of expert scientists, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, to help them assess the evidence. The EPA released their most recent review of the current research on health threat of ozone and particle pollution.[38][76]\\r\\nEPA Concludes Ozone Pollution Poses Serious Health Threats\\r\\n- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Integrated Science Assessment for Ozone and Related Photochemical Oxidants, 2013. EPA/600/R-10/076F.\\r\\nEPA Concludes Fine Particle Pollution Poses Serious Health Threats\\r\\n-U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter, December 2009. EPA 600/R-08/139F.\\r\\nHelping the area to meet the national air quality standards and improve the health of local residents continues to be a priority for the EPA. One of EPA's highest priorities is to support the reduction of diesel emissions from ships, trucks, locomotives, and other diesel engines.[75] In 2005, Congress authorized funding for the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA), a grant program, administrated by the EPA, to selectively retrofit or replace the older diesel engines most likely to impact human health. Since 2008, the DERA program has achieved impressive out outcome of improving air quality.[77] The EPA also works with state and local partners to decrease emissions from port operations and to improve the efficient transportation of goods through the region. Both the EPA and the Port of Los Angeles are partners of the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, a sweeping plan aimed at significantly reducing the health risks posed by air pollution from port-related ships, trains, trucks, terminal equipment and harbor craft.[72] For environmental justice, air pollution in low-income LA communities has received more attention. In 2011, the Clean up Green up campaign was launched to designate four low-income LA communities- Pacoima, Boyle Heights and Wilmington. This campaign aims to push green industries through incentives, including help obtaining permits and tax and utility rebates.[78]\\r\\nAlthough Los Angeles air pollution level has declined for the last few decades,[79] citizens in Los Angeles still suffer from high level air pollution.[80]\\r\\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's interactive online map - EJSCREEN - features the low socioeconomic communities across the country that are more vulnerable to air pollution and its associated health risks. As exhibited in this map, Southeast Los Angeles County neighborhoods, primarily impoverished areas in the San Joaquin Valley and Inland Empire, face a higher exposure to air pollution and environmental injustices. In such areas, those in poverty stricken areas have an unequal access to environmental health and safety resources. These poverty-stricken neighborhoods are frequently located in areas that are near freeways, hazardous facilities, and/or rail yards.[81]\\r\\nIn 2017, researchers found that diabetes in Latino children living in Los Angeles is linked to air quality.[82] A study led by the University of Southern California was the first of its kind to follow the health and residential air pollution levels of the same children over a span of several years. The subjects of the study were overweight Latino children, between the ages of eight and fifteen, residing in areas with elevated particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide levels, air pollutants caused nearby power plants and high-volume vehicle traffic.[82] The results demonstrated that the children possessed significantly increased risk factors for Type 2 diabetes by the time they turned eighteen, such as diminished efficiency in the insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas.[83] The insulin resistance that results from such a condition is a direct cause of diabetes onset.[84]\\r\\nDiabetes mellitus is a disease that is characterized by the body's inability to properly regulate blood glucose (or blood sugar) levels. Prolonged levels of high blood sugar may lead to severe health complications such as heart disease, nerve damage, kidney failure, blindness, or even early death.[85] As diabetes becomes a rising epidemic, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that up to nearly 8 million U.S. citizens may have undiagnosed diabetes or its precursor.[86] Conventional medical findings suggest that unhealthy or calorie-dense diets, lack of physical activity, and family history are risk factors for developing the disease; however, recent studies are beginning to trace a connection between Type 2 diabetes and the external factor of air pollution.[83] Because socioeconomic status, race, and exposure to air pollution are frequently correlated, the CDC acknowledges certain socioeconomic conditions or races as pre-existing risk factors for Type 2 diabetes, in addition to those previously listed.[82] Statistics suggest that Hispanic people are 50% more likely to die from diabetes than whites, and studies focusing on issues of environmental injustice are able to demonstrate possible reasons for this disparity.[87]\\r\\nThe spatial arrangement of Californian communities plays a large role in determining exposure to the concentrated air pollution of the state's southern regions. In one suburb of Los Angeles, El Marino Language School sits adjacent to the ten-lane Interstate 405. Students of schools like these, often elementary-aged, are subject to dramatically increased levels of pollution from automobile emissions, including carcinogenic compounds.[88] Health effects of traffic pollution include the onset of cardiovascular disease, asthma, impaired lung function, premature death, and a plethora of other complications.[89] Furthermore, the incomplete development of children's sensitive respiratory systems leads to compounded effects of air pollution when compared with the health effects of the same pollution on adults.[90]\\r\\nThough the health consequences of vehicle pollution are widely recognized and some legislation has been enacted to reduce its impact, very little tangible action has actually been taken. In 2003, California passed Senate Bill No. 352, which banned the construction of new schools within 500 feet of freeways with certain exceptions.[91] However, the bill remained largely ignored as 1 in 5 schools opened between 2014 and 2015 were still in direct violation of the ban.[88] In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency released a report titled \\"Best Practices for Reducing Near-Road Pollution Exposure at Schools\\", available both online and in-print.[90] However, without any requirements regarding school siting from the U.S. Department of Education, state-funded schools are under no obligation to follow its guidelines. The reluctance of public schools to comply with safety regulations often stems from monetary limitations that encourage the use of cheap land, a dilemma that disproportionately impacts children of poorer areas; the report noted that minority and low-income students have a higher prevalence of attendance in public schools of urban areas, such as the big cities in which busy roads and schools share territory.[88]\\r\\nOil fracking is a process that involves a high pressure injection of fluid into the ground to extract oil.[92] The adverse environmental effects of this natural gas extraction are the subject of much controversy, the primary concerns of which surround the contamination of surrounding water and air sources. These risks result when underground drinking water and surface water are exposed to discharges of the chemically-infused fracking fluid due to faulty construction or operation, disposal leaks, or other unintended byproducts like the release of hazardous volatile compounds into the air.[93] In terms of air pollution, \\"hydrofracking\\" causes detriment to both the environment and human health. Enormous quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas, escape into the ozone layer of Earth's atmosphere during the extraction process, where they accelerate the impacts of climate change. Furthermore, air contaminants like nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, formaldehydes, and hydrogen sulfide that are released during drilling have been shown to cause harmful effects ranging from cancer, organ failure, neurological issues, to birth defects.[94]\\r\\nIn 2015, a study revealed that there are forty-five fracking sites within 1.5 miles of one junior high in the town of Shafter, one of California's top ten most polluted communities. The students of this community suffer from the state's decision to allow oil companies to continue hydraulic fracturing within close proximity of their schools. Parents observe severe and unexplainable health complications amongst their children, including asthma and epilepsy, that may be correlated with air toxins from the nearby wells.[95] In all of Kern County, in which Shafter is located, a staggering ten school districts sit within one mile of fracking wells. The situation becomes even more problematic when the fact that Kern County is predominantly Latino in racial/ethnic composition is considered; in fact, 20% or more of its residents are foreign-born emigrants of Asia and Latin America.[94] Some argue that the concentration of fracking sites around the community's population of color is a discriminatory practice in direct violation of California Code 11135, which states that no person shall be unlawfully subjected to discrimination by any state or state-funded agency on the basis of race or ethnic group identification.[96]\\r\\nIn 2012, this research used the method of cumulative environmental hazard inequality Index (CEHII), which is a model developed to environmental inequality in air pollution hazards., to analyze the environmental inequality in three counties in California: Alameda, San Diego and Los Angeles (Jason et al. 2012). In addition to frequently used air pollution parameter like NO2, PM 2.5 and diesel PM, a metric of heat stress was included for the analysis because excessive heat weather comes to be an environmental problem that can threaten human health.\\r\\nThe result indicated that color community bear greater air pollution including NO2, PM 2.5, PM 10, and heat stress compared to predominantly white and more affluent community. In San Diego County, the relative heat stress inequality was founded to be the highest. Also, significant heat stress inequality was observed in Los Angeles. The result shows that in these two counties, there was a strong positive correlation between the percentage of Non-Whites in the community and heat stress inequality. However, in Alameda county, the result indicated an opposite pattern which indicates. The community with a higher White population experience more extreme temperature exceedances. This might be explained by the fact that White population and the more affluent class in Alameda County mainly lived in the eastern area further away from the coast, which resulted in the higher heat stress exposure.\\r\\nAlso, the research verified that poverty status is consistent with the trend of disproportion burden of the racial-ethnic status. As the analysis was conducted according to the poverty status instead of racial-ethnic status for air pollutants NO2, PM2.5, and diesel PM, the results indicated the similar result as the analysis to heat stress. Furthermore, from our data, we found a strong correlation between poverty and proportion of non-white population (Alameda: r=0.69, Los Angeles: r=0.77). After all, this research demonstrates that the air pollution is disproportionally distributed according to the socioeconomic and racial-ethnic status in the United States.\\r\\nAs a future direction of study, it plans to classify the inequality exists in African American, Hispanic, Asian, and other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the technique used in this research provided a way to assess environmental inequality and the results can be used to assist decision makers in efforts to address environmental inequality issues.[97]\\r\\nIn February 2016, the city of Oakland publicly announced construction plans for the Oakland Bulk and Oversized Terminal, a bulk exporting facility in West Oakland. As a predominantly Latino and African-American community, the residents of West Oakland live in a community that suffers from dangerous levels of air pollution. The construction of this port and its proposed partnership with Utah's coal-mining counties would rank the city as the lead coal exporter on the West Coast.[98] To fund such a goliath project in the face of strong resistance from city councils fighting to protect their local communities from drastically increasing pollution emissions, Utah state and county officials arranged a controversial $53 million loan.[99] The fund, composed of taxpayer dollars intended for local projects, would allow for the annual shipping of 9 million tons of coal through Oakland and an increase in national coal exports by 19%.[100] A movement by environmental advocates quickly grew, citing that exposure to toxic coal dust would also subject the city's residents to increased risks of bronchitis, pneumonia, heart disease, emphysema, and more.[98]\\r\\nIn response, thousands of Oakland residents and environmental rights activists worked together to prevent the construction of the coal terminal. In July 2016, Oakland City Council voted to ban coal from being handled and stored in the City of Oakland.[98] The decision marked a large victory for the newly established Department of Race and Equity, an organization designed to protect Oakland's predominantly African-American community from social and racial disparities.[101] According to the \\"Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States\\" report issued by the East Bay Community Foundation, those living in West Oakland already encounter five times more toxic pollution per person than residents of the city of Oakland, and children living in West Oakland are seven times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma than the average child in California.[98] The residents of West Oakland are more likely to face both decreased life expectancy and asthma-related emergency room visits.[101] For a city already bearing a disproportionate amount of environmental burdens, the fight for a coal-free Oakland was a success for proponents of environmental justice.","input":"What is the smoggiest city in the united states?"},{"output":"12 May 2010","context":"The events surrounding the formation of the United Kingdom's government in 2010 took place between 7 May and 12 May 2010, following the 2010 general election, which failed to produce an overall majority for any of the country's three main political parties. The election, held on 6 May, resulted in the first hung parliament in the UK in 36 years, sparking a series of negotiations which would form the first coalition government since the Second World War.\\r\\nThe governing Labour administration led by Gordon Brown was defeated in the election and lost its overall majority after 13 years in office. The opposition Conservatives led by David Cameron won the largest number of seats in the new Parliament, but fell short of the number required to secure an overall majority. Consequently, senior figures from both parties embarked on a series of make-or-break meetings with representatives from the Liberal Democrats led by Nick Clegg, aimed at forming a coalition government.\\r\\nAs leader of the third largest party, Clegg had announced that the Liberal Democrats would enter talks with whichever party held the greater number of seats. A series of meetings with the Conservatives began shortly after the hung parliament was announced, and continued over the weekend after the election. Negotiations were also held with the Labour Party. The Scottish National Party (SNP) signalled its willingness to join Labour and the Liberal Democrats in government as part of a rainbow coalition, but it quickly became clear that Gordon Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as a major obstacle to formulating a LabourÿLiberal Democrat deal.\\r\\nAlthough Brown relinquished his role as Labour leader on 10 May, the party failed to reach an agreement with the Liberal Democrats; the latter instead struck a deal with the Conservatives the following day. Brown resigned as Prime Minister on the evening of 11 May, and the ConservativeÿLiberal Democrat Coalition government led by David Cameron took office shortly thereafter. The Liberal Democrats emerged from a meeting of their Parliamentary party and Federal Executive to announce that the coalition deal had been \\"approved overwhelmingly\\" shortly after midnight on 12 May, and later the same day the two parties published the Conservative ÿ Liberal Democrat coalition agreement setting out the terms of their deal. While Cameron became Prime Minister, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Labour Party came into government under the leadership of Tony Blair in May 1997 after the electoral wipeout of the Conservative government, led by John Major; this ended 18 years of Conservative rule.[1][2][3] Having secured a landslide victory with 418 seats in the House of Commons,[4] the Party had a working majority of 179 seats,[5] and went on to win the 2001 and 2005 elections.[6] During its first term in office Blair's government introduced many popular policies, including legislation to establish a national minimum wage, reducing the length of hospital waiting lists, and devolving lawmaking powers to Scotland and Wales.[3] Blair also played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process.[3] But his decision to commit British troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq turned public opinion against him and lost him the support of some of his own MPs.[7] When Blair stepped down as Prime Minister in June 2007 he was succeeded by his Chancellor, Gordon Brown.[6] Blair's decade-long premiership had been a time of economic boom for the United Kingdom,[3] but Brown's tenure as Prime Minister was dominated by the global recession of the latter part of the 2000s.[8] Although commentators perceived Brown to have made some good decisions during the economic crisis, such as providing financial aid to several UK banks which found themselves in difficulty, his fiscal policy of borrowing and spending led to a dramatic increase in the country's national debt.[3][9][10] He was also viewed by the media as someone who lacked interpersonal skills.[7] Another major event that occurred during Brown's time in government was the 2009 scandal involving MPs expenses, which damaged the public's trust in politicians.[3]\\r\\nBy April 2010 almost five years had passed since the previous general election (held on 5 May 2005), requiring a fresh election to take place. On 6 April 2010 Brown went to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament on 12 April in preparation for a general election. In a live press conference at Downing Street, Brown announced the election would be held on 6 May.[11] The time between the announcement of the election and the dissolution of Parliament, known as wash-up, was to allow for the handling of any unfinished legislative business before the Parliamentary session's conclusion.[6]\\r\\nLabour campaigned to secure a fourth consecutive term in office and to restore support lost since 1997,[12] while the Conservative Party sought to gain a dominant position in British politics after losses in the 1990s, and to replace Labour as the governing party.[13] The Liberal Democrats hoped to make gains from both sides, and possibly hold the balance of power in a hung parliament.[14] After the televised debates between the three leaders?ÿ?the first of their type during an election campaign in the United Kingdom?ÿ?their poll ratings had risen to the point where many considered the possibility of a Liberal Democrat role in Government.[15][16] While Cameron and Clegg were generally well received by the viewers of the three debates, Brown's performance was considered to have been less successful.[17] Brown's image was further harmed when he privately described Gillian Duffy, a 65-year-old pensioner, as a \\"bigoted woman\\" after she raised the issue of benefits and immigration with him during a campaign trip to Rochdale, Greater Manchester.[17][18] His remarks were recorded by a Sky News microphone he was still wearing as he was driven away from the visit, and were widely broadcast.[19]\\r\\nPolls just before election day showed a slight swing from the Liberal Democrats back to Labour and the Conservatives, with most of final polls falling within one point of Conservatives 36%, Labour 28%, Liberal Democrats 27%.[20][21] However, record numbers of undecided voters raised uncertainty about the outcome.[22][23] The SNP, encouraged by its victory in the 2007 Scottish parliament elections, set itself a target of returning 20 MPs and hoped to find itself holding a balance of power.[24] Equally, Plaid Cymru sought gains in Wales.[25] In Northern Ireland the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) aimed to maintain or increase its number of seats, having been the fourth largest party in the House of Commons.[26][27] Smaller parties which had had successes at local elections and the 2009 European elections (UK Independence Party, Green Party, British National Party) aimed to extend their representation to seats in the House of Commons.[28][29][30]\\r\\nThe general election was held on Thursday 6 May 2010 and saw an increase in voter turnout from 61% in 2005 to 65% in 2010.[17] Throughout the day GfK NOP and Ipsos MORI conducted an exit poll on behalf of the BBC, Sky and ITV news services ÿ the results of which were announced as the polls closed at 10:00pm.[31] Data gathered from individuals at 130 polling stations around the country suggested a hung parliament, with an initial estimate that the Conservative Party would achieve 307 seats?ÿ?19 seats short of a controlling majority.[32][33] This deficit was later adjusted to 21 seats. The distribution of seats was initially predicted to be 307 to the Conservatives, 255 to Labour, 59 to the Liberal Democrats and 29 to the other parties,[32] but these figures were later updated with a minor adjustment in Labour's favour.[34] The apparently poor prospects for the Liberal Democrats were a surprise to commentators,[35] as many previous opinion polls had indicated they would receive more seats. A later BBC exit poll published at 5:36am on Friday 7 May predicted the Conservatives on 306, 20 short of an overall majority, with Labour on 262, and the Liberal Democrats on 55.[34]\\r\\nAt 9:41am on 7 May, the BBC confirmed a \\"hung parliament\\", as it was by then impossible for the Conservative party to gain the number of seats needed to form a majority government.[36] 326 seats were required for a technical majority, but only 323 were necessary for a practical majority, as the five Sinn Fin MPs were expected to boycott the House of Commons. At that time the Conservatives stood at 290 seats, Labour at 247 and Liberal Democrats at 51.[37][38] The final results put the Conservatives on 306 seats, Labour on 258, and the Liberal Democrats on 57.[39][40]\\r\\nOf the 532 seats contested in England, the Conservatives won an absolute majority of 61 seats and secured an average swing of 5.6% from Labour.[41] The last seat to be elected, Thirsk and Malton, was contested on 27 May because one of the candidates died.[42] All of Scotland's 59 seats were won by the parties that won them at the 2005 election, with Labour regaining the two seats they lost in by-elections since 2005.[43][44] Labour increased its share of the vote by 2.5% and the Conservatives by 0.9%, giving a swing from the Conservatives to Labour of 0.8%. The Conservatives won only one Scottish constituency,[45] while the SNP?ÿ?which had hoped to increase its share of seats from seven to 20?ÿ?failed to make any headway.[43]\\r\\n40 seats were contested in Wales, where the Conservative share rose from three seats to eight, taking one from the Liberal Democrats and four from Labour. Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru gained one extra seat, Arfon, from Labour. Overall, Labour lost four seats but remained the biggest party in Wales with 26 seats.[46] 18 seats were contested in Northern Ireland, where both Irish nationalist parties, Sinn Fin and the SDLP, held their seats, the unionist UUP (in an electoral pact with the Conservatives) lost their only seat and the DUP lost a seat. This left the nationalist parties with eight seats, the unionist parties with eight seats (all DUP), the Alliance Party with one seat and an independent unionist with one seat. It was the first time since the Partition of Ireland that unionist parties had failed to secure a majority of Northern Ireland's Westminster seats in a general election.[47]\\r\\nWith no single party having achieved an overall majority, the 2010 general election resulted in the first hung parliament since 1974.[48] When it became clear that no party would achieve the outright majority needed to form the next government, the three main party leaders made public statements offering to discuss the options for putting together an administration with the other parties. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg called on Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Conservative leader David Cameron to act \\"in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage\\". However, having stated before the election that the party with the most seats should have the initial say on forming a government, Clegg announced his intention to begin talks with the Conservative Party. Speaking outside the Liberal Democrat headquarters he said: \\"It is now for the Conservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest.\\"[49] Brown said he intended to play his part in securing \\"a stable, strong and principled government\\", and indicated his willingness to speak with both Clegg and Cameron on how to achieve this, saying: \\"What we have seen are no ordinary election results.\\"[50] But shortly after, Cameron held a press conference at which he invited the Liberal Democrats to talks, saying: \\"I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats. I want us to work together in tackling our country's big and urgent problems - the debt crisis, our deep social problems and our broken political system.\\"[51]\\r\\nUnder the constitutional rules governing protocol in the event of a hung parliament, Brown, as the sitting Prime Minister, would remain in office until a new government could be formed, a process which could continue without resolution until the State Opening of Parliament, which was scheduled for 25 May. On Brown's instructions, Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell had updated the protocol for dealing with a hung parliament earlier in the year. Following confirmation that no party had achieved an overall majority, Brown authorised O'Donnell to begin the process. Four-member teams of civil servants were sent to liaise with the main political parties to facilitate negotiations.[52]\\r\\nCameron's willingness to hold talks with the Liberal Democrats was interpreted by BBC News political editor Nick Robinson as hinting at the possibility that Liberal Democrat MPs could serve as part of a Cabinet.[51] On the afternoon of 7 May, Cameron and Clegg spoke by telephone and had what the BBC reported as a \\"very constructive\\" conversation. By that evening exploratory talks between teams of senior representatives from the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives had begun. The Liberal Democrats team consisted of Chris Huhne, Danny Alexander, Andrew Stunell and David Laws, while George Osborne, William Hague, Oliver Letwin and Ed Llewellyn made up the Conservative team.[51]\\r\\nBy the morning of Saturday 8 May, talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats were fully underway. A 70-minute meeting at Admiralty House in Westminster was described by both parties as being \\"constructive and amicable\\", and another meeting was scheduled for the following day. At a private meeting that evening, Cameron and Clegg held the first of a series of talks to discuss the negotiations. Members of the Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Party had earlier met at Local Government House to discuss the coalition talks.[53][54]\\r\\nOne of the chief issues that the Liberal Democrats wished to address in any coalition agreement was that of electoral reform, and as Party members debated the negotiations, a 1,000 strong crowd of protesters from the pressure group 38 Degrees gathered outside. Amid chants of \\"Fair votes now\\" and \\"We want to speak to Nick\\",[54] Clegg briefly left the meeting to accept a petition and told the protesters, \\"Reforming politics is one of the reasons I went into politics.\\" After the meeting, a Liberal Democrats negotiator, David Laws, said members had \\"endorsed in full\\" the strategy outlined by Clegg that the Conservatives should have first choice in negotiations on forming a government. Clegg also met with the Party's federal executive, which also endorsed Clegg's decision.[53][55]\\r\\n8 May 2010 was the 65th anniversary of V.E. Day?ÿ?which marked the victory of the Allied Forces over Nazi Germany and the end of the Second World War in Europe?ÿ?and celebrations were held to mark the occasion. The leaders of all three parties attended a ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, a duty which normally falls to the Prime Minister.[56] After the ceremony, Brown flew to his family home in Scotland, but remained ready to negotiate with the Liberal Democrats if no deal with the Conservatives was reached. Labour denied reports of a heated telephone conversation between Brown and Clegg, and support among Brown's Cabinet colleagues remained strong, but one backbencher, John Mann, urged Brown to step aside as Labour leader before the party conference in September, arguing that Brown's continued leadership \\"rules out the credibility of a Lib/Lab pact\\".[53]\\r\\nOn Sunday 9 May, senior negotiators from the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives embarked on six hours of talks at the Cabinet Office, which were described as \\"very positive and productive\\". William Hague emerged from the discussions to say, \\"The issues that we have covered have included political reform, economic issues and reduction of the deficit, banking reform, civil liberties, environmental issues. So, we've had good discussions about all of those areas. We are agreed that a central part of any agreement that we make will be economic stability and the reduction of the budget deficit, but each negotiating team is now going to report to our party leaders.\\"[57]\\r\\nAs the negotiations were taking place, Gordon Brown returned to Downing Street and held a meeting with Nick Clegg at the Foreign Office for talks. A Downing Street spokesman later confirmed the talks, together with the previous evening's telephone conversation between Brown and Clegg, which was described as \\"an amicable discussion.\\"[57] However, Paddy Ashdown ÿ a previous Liberal Democrat leader ÿ offered a different view of the Brown-Clegg conference call, telling the BBC it \\"was a diatribe, a rant, and that Gordon Brown was threatening in his approach to Nick Clegg.\\"[58] Following the success of the talks between their two parties, Clegg and Cameron held a second round of face-to-face discussions at Westminster that evening, lasting 45 minutes.[57]\\r\\nWhile negotiations continued to form the next administration, the business of government continued with the previous incumbents.[57][a] In this respect Chancellor Alistair Darling flew to Brussels to attend a meeting of European finance ministers. In London, Brown held meetings with Business Secretary Peter Mandelson, his deputy leader Harriet Harman, Secretary of State for Energy Ed Miliband and Tony Blair's former special adviser Alastair Campbell. Brown also sent an email to party activists in which he thanked them for their work during the election campaign. It concluded \\"The past few days have seen us enter a political landscape not considered possible a few short weeks ago - with the outcome of the election leading to no single party able to form a majority government. My duty as prime minister has been to seek to resolve this situation.\\" Several senior Labour backbenchers, including MP George Howarth called on Brown to step down.[57]\\r\\nMonday 10 May saw another day of talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, but at a meeting with his MPs, Nick Clegg was urged to give assurances over offers which were being made by David Cameron's team. They also wished him to continue negotiations with Labour. During the day it emerged that senior Labour and Liberal Democrat representatives had held discussions about forming a coalition, but that one of the barriers to this was the continued presence of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister.[60][61][62] At 5.00pm that afternoon Brown announced that he would step down as Labour leader by September. In a statement he said that he intended to \\"[A]sk the Labour Party to set in train the processes needed for its own leadership election.\\" The statement went on to say, \\"I would hope that it would be completed in time for the new leader to be in post by the time of the Labour Party conference. I will play no part in that contest, I will back no individual candidate.\\" He also urged any prospective candidates for the position to wait until coalition negotiations were complete before announcing their candidacy. Following this announcement, formal talks began between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, but many in the Party felt that a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition was an unrealistic prospect since it would still fall short of the 326 seats needed to form a majority government, with 315 seats to the Conservatives' 306. Labour MP Graham Stringer said, \\"I don't think it makes sense in the arithmetic?ÿ?the numbers don't add up.\\"[60] However, in his account of Labour's negotiations with the Liberal Democrats, Andrew Adonis ÿ who participated in the talks ÿ writes that the general consensus among members of Gordon Brown's cabinet was that talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats would reach an impasse. \\"[The] process would turn to our favour once the Tories and Lib Dems had rehearsed the extent of their differences\\".[58]\\r\\nWith Labour now attempting to form its own coalition government, the Conservatives promised the Liberal Democrats a referendum on changing the voting mechanism to the Alternative Vote (AV) system. In response Labour said that it would introduce AV then hold a public referendum to approve it. In a statement outlining his decision to negotiate with Labour, Clegg said that although his party had made progress with the Conservatives, they had not \\"reached a comprehensive partnership agreement for a full Parliament\\" and negotiating with Labour was the \\"responsible thing to do\\".[60]\\r\\nThe possibility of some SNP involvement in a Labour-led government materialised when Angus Robertson, the SNP's leader in the House of Commons suggested its MPs would be willing to join Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and MPs from other smaller parties to form a rainbow coalition.[63][64] It was reported on 10 May that a meeting to discuss this scenario was held between Robertson, the SNP Chief Whip Stewart Hosie and Cabinet Office officials the previous evening.[63] However, Labour's Douglas Alexander said he could not foresee a situation in which Labour could enter into government with the SNP because the two parties had \\"fundamental differences\\",[65] and he made it clear that no senior Labour officials had been approached by anyone from the SNP.[65]\\r\\nBy 11 May, the possibility of a deal between the Liberal Democrats and Labour was looking unlikely. Talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued,[66] and after concluding that he would not be able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation that evening.[67] He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. He then left Downing Street with his wife and their children, and drove to Buckingham Palace where he tendered his resignation to the Queen and advised her to call for David Cameron.[68][69] Cameron became Prime Minister one hour after the Queen accepted Brown's resignation,[70] and arrived at Downing Street with his wife, Samantha shortly afterwards.[71] In his first address outside 10 Downing Street, he announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats. Cameron appointed Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister.[70] Cameron met with his MPs in the Committee Room of the House of Commons at 10.00pm, where he was greeted with cheering that could be heard from the central hall of the Commons.[72]\\r\\nCameron later told a BBC documentary that he had not expected to become Prime Minister, and the coalition agreement had not yet been completed when Brown resigned. Speaking on the programme, Five Days That Changed Britain, broadcast on 29 July, he said that when he went to meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the coalition deal had not been finalised. Formally, the monarch can only invite a prospective Prime Minister to form a Government; the shape of the Government is for the new Prime Minister to decide.[73] William Hague said that as Cameron travelled to the Palace, the coalition agreement was still being completed and signed.[74]\\r\\nShortly after midnight on 12 May 2010, the Liberal Democrats emerged from a meeting of their Parliamentary party and Federal Executive to announce that the coalition deal had been \\"approved overwhelmingly\\", meaning that David Cameron would lead a coalition government of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. Later that day, the two parties jointly published the Conservative?ÿ?Liberal Democrat coalition agreement specifying the terms of the deal.[75][76][77] Cameron appointed his first Cabinet, which included several senior Conservative and Liberal Democrat figures.[78] From the Conservatives, George Osborne became Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Hague was named as Foreign Secretary and Oliver Letwin was appointed as Minister of State for the Cabinet Office.[78] Liberal Democrat appointments included Danny Alexander as Secretary of State for Scotland, Chris Huhne as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, and David Laws became Chief Secretary to the Treasury.[78]\\r\\nCameron and Clegg gave their first joint press conference in the Downing Street Rose Garden on the afternoon of 12 May,[79][80][81] telling journalists the purpose of their government would be \\"[T]o give our country the strong, stable and decisive leadership we need\\".[82] The new Parliamentary session began with the State Opening of Parliament on 25 May.[83] Cameron attended his first Prime Minister's Questions as Prime Minister on Wednesday 2 June.[84]\\r\\nLabour became the Party of Opposition,[85] and with Brown's departure, Harriet Harman became its acting leader.[86] On 18 May 2010 Labour's National Executive Committee announced the details of the leadership election.[87] Ed Miliband was elected as the party's new leader at its annual national conference on 25 September 2010.[88]","input":"When did the coalition government come into power?"},{"output":"Blacktown","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nWestfield Group was an Australian shopping centre company that existed from 1960 to 2014, when it split into two independent companies: Scentre Group, which now owns and operates the Australian and New Zealand Westfield shopping centre portfolio; and Westfield Corporation, which continued to own and operate the American and European center portfolio.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nWestfield Group undertook ownership, development, design, construction, funds/asset management, property management, leasing, and marketing activities. The multinational company was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and had interests in and operated one of the world's largest shopping centre portfolios with investment interests in 103 shopping centres across Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, Croatia and Brazil, encompassing around 23,000 retail outlets and total assets under management in excess of A$63 billion.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Westfield Group had origins in the western suburbs of Sydney. The first development was named \\"Westfield Place\\", and opened in July 1959 in Blacktown.[4] The name Westfield is derived from \\"west\\" related to the West Sydney location, and \\"field\\" due to having located on subdivided farmland. The centre was opened by John Saunders and Frank Lowy.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1960 and built another five centres in New South Wales before expanding into Victoria and Queensland in 1966-67.[5]  For the first half of 1971, Westfield reported earnings of $886,382.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expansion into the United States began with the purchase of the Trumbull Shopping Park in Connecticut in 1977, and was followed by three centres in California, Michigan and Connecticut in 1980 and three centres in California, New Jersey and Long Island, New York in 1986.[5] In 1994 Westfield joined with General Growth and Whitehall Real Estate to purchase 19 centres for US$1 billion. Westfield seems to form clusters of centres on particular cities or within a small number of states. They built considerable holdings on the East Coast and in California before expanding into the Midwest. By 2005, the company owned centres in 15 US states.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, Westfield began a major expansion to New Zealand, where they mostly bought existing shopping centres of the Fletchers company, progressively rebranding them. Only in 2007, with Westfield Albany, has the company opened a fully new centre in the country.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2012 it was announced that the Westfield Group would sell seven 'non-core' property assets to Starwood Capital Group for A$1 billion and one other property to an undisclosed buyer for A$147 million. The funds would be used to repay debt and invest in businesses offering higher return. The sales were expected to be completed by midÿ2012.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the Westfield Group's asset dimensions, the Westfield Group was strongly controlled by the Lowy Family Group, including non-executive chairman, Frank Lowy, one of its founders.[9] Lowy's two younger sons, Steven and Peter, were joint managing directors.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving been established in Australia, with their original premises being at Blacktown, the Westfield Group continued to operate a large number of shopping centres in Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nA feature of \\"ticketless parking\\" at Westfield Miranda, Hurstville, Bondi Junction and Doncaster was that SMS alerts were provided for when the shopper's 3 free hours of parking were about to expire and when the shopper left the centres.  This feature was removed in 2016 due to concerns that the system could be used \\"to track the movements of others\\" by giving the wrong car numberplate on registration of the phone number.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nWestfield entered the United States market in 1977. In September 2003 the company received $17.3 million as a party in the insurance claim following the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.[11] On 18 February 2006, the Los Angeles Times reported that Westfield had agreed to acquire 15 stores from Federated Department Stores, all but three in southern California.[12] As of 2018, Westfield owned 33 malls in the United States.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nWestfield entered the New Zealand market in 1997 and acquired an interest in the St. Lukes Group portfolio in 1998. Westfield Malls were by far the most numerous chain in New Zealand, with 6 of its 11 centres in Auckland including their largest development located in Albany. Westfield had NZ$2.8 billion in assets under management in New Zealand[14]  In mid-2012 Westfield sold its 50% share of Westfield Shore City in Takapuna on Auckland's North Shore,[14] now known as Shore City Shopping Centre. The group reportedly also had three of its smaller malls; Pakuranga, Glenfield, and Chartwell in Hamilton up for sale.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2014, before Westfield Corporation was created, Westfield had an interest in two shopping centres in England and Northern Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy far its most significant asset was Westfield's 50% partnership[15] in the S1.6b[16] Westfield London  development in Shepherd's Bush, west London. The development included the construction of a new railway station for the London Overground and Southern services, and a new entrance for the London Underground station.\\r\\n\\r\\nWestfield owned the Westfield Stratford City and also controlled the Stratford City redevelopment project next to 2012 Olympic park in Stratford in east London, having acquired the 75% of the project that it did not already own.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWestfield was the developer behind the troubled Broadway shopping development in Bradford after acquiring Stannifer in 2004.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 9 October 2007 Westfield opened the S340m extension and refurbishment of Derby's Eagle Centre, which saw the shopping centre rebranded \\"Westfield Derby\\".[19] The centre was subsequently sold to Intu in 2014.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nWestfield were reviewing plans with the Whitgift Foundation to rebuild the Whitgift Centre in Croydon in south London.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission investigated several disputes between the Westfield Group and its tenants. In 2004 the Commission found Westfield was abusing its market and commercial power in settling disputes with tenants, and forced Westfield to formally undertake to not engage in \\"Unconscionable conduct and intimidation\\" of tenants.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in Australia, Westfield fee structures and policies were criticised by retailers who operated in centres that had been taken over by the company. Retailers suggested that when centres were acquired there should be more cooperation between the new operators and existing tenants in bringing shops up to the corporate standards of the Westfield Group, and increases in rent (required to operate a shopping centre with high standards of fittings and services) should be staged with the required improvements in fittings.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Liverpool, Australia in 2002, a competing shopping centre was lodged to Liverpool Council and subsequently built. The centre would be about 3 kilometres from Westfield Liverpool.","input":"Where was the first westfield shopping centre built?"},{"output":"Gandhi","context":"The Non-Cooperation Movement was a significant phase of the Indian independence movement from British rule. It was led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi after the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. It aimed to resist British rule in India through nonviolent means,\\"satyagraha\\". Protestors would refuse to buy British goods, adopt the use of local handicrafts and picket liquor shops. The ideas of Ahimsa and nonviolence, and Gandhi's ability to rally hundreds of thousands of common citizens towards the cause of Indian independence, were first seen on a large scale in this movement through the summer 1920. Gandhi feared that the movement might lead to popular violence. The non-cooperation movement was launched on 12st August, 1920.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Non-cooperation movement was a reaction to the oppressive policies of the British Indian government such as the Rowlatt Act and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. A meeting of civilians held at Jallianwala Bagh near the Golden Temple in Amritsar was fired upon by soldiers under the command of Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer, killing 379 protesters and injuring thousands. The outcry generated by the massacre led to thousands of unrests and more deaths at the hands of the police. The massacre became the most infamous event of British rule in India.\\r\\nGandhi was horrified. He lost all faith in the goodness of the British government and declared that it would be a \\"sin\\" to cooperate with the \\"satanic\\" government.\\r\\nIndian Muslims who had participated in the Khilafat movement to restore the status of the Caliph gave their support to the non-cooperation movement. In response to the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre and other violence in Punjab, the movement sought to secure Swaraj, independence for India. Gandhi promised Swaraj in one year if his Non-Cooperation programme was fully implemented. The other reason to start the non-cooperation movement was that Gandhi lost faith in constitutional methods and turned from cooperator of British rule to non-cooperator.\\r\\nOther causes include economic hardships to the common man, which the nationalists attributed to the flow of Indian wealth to Britain, the ruin of Indian artisans due to British factory-made goods replacing handmade goods, and resentment with the British government over Indian soldiers dying in World War I while fighting as part of the British Army.\\r\\nThe calls of early political leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak (Congress Extremists) were called major public meetings. They resulted in disorder or obstruction of government services. The British took them very seriously and imprisoned him in mandale in Burma and V.O.Chidambaram Pillai Got 40 years imprisonment . The non-cooperation movement aimed to challenge the colonial economic and power structure, and British authorities would be forced to take notice of the demands of the independence movement .\\r\\nSatyagraha is a Sanskrit term which is a compound of two words: satya (\\"truth\\") and agraha (\\"holding firmly to\\" or \\"force\\"). Gandhi's call was for a nationwide protest against the Rowlatt Act. All offices and factories would be closed. Indians would be encouraged to withdraw from Raj-sponsored schools, police services, the military, and the civil service, and lawyers were asked to leave the Raj's courts. Public transportation and English-manufactured goods, especially clothing, was boycotted.\\r\\nVeterans like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Annie Besant, and Sammed Akiwate opposed the idea outright. The All India Muslim League also criticized the idea. But the younger generation of Indian nationalists were thrilled, and backed Gandhi. The Congress Party adopted his plans, and he received extensive support from Muslim leaders like Maulana Azad, Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, Hakim Ajmal Khan, Abbas Tyabji, Maulana Muhammad Ali and Maulana Shaukat Ali.\\r\\nThe eminent Hindi writer, poet, play-wright, journalist, and nationalist Rambriksh Benipuri, who spent more than eight years in prison fighting for India's independence, wrote:\\r\\nWhen I recall Non-Cooperation era of 1921, the image of a storm confronts my eyes. From the time I became aware, I have witnessed numerous movements, however, I can assert that no other movement upturned the foundations of Indian society to the extent that the Non-Cooperation movement did. From the most humble huts to the high places, from villages to cities, everywhere there was a ferment, a loud echo.[1]\\r\\nThe success of the revolt was a total shock to British authorities and a massive encouragement to millions of Indian nationalists. On 5th February,1922 a clash took place at Chauri Chaura, a small town in the district of Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh. A police officer had beaten some volunteers picketing a liquor shop. A whole crowd of peasants that had gathered there went to the police chowki (pron.-chau key) (station). The mob set fire to the police chowki with some 22 police men inside it.\\r\\nMahatma Gandhi felt that the revolt was veering off-course, and was disappointed that the revolt had lost its non-violent nature. He did not want the movement to degenerate into a contest of violence, with police and angry mobs attacking each other back and forth, victimizing civilians in between. Gandhi appealed to the Indian public for all resistance to end, went on a fast lasting 3 weeks, and called off the non-cooperation movement.\\r\\nThe non-cooperation movement was withdrawn because of the Chauri Chaura incident. Although he had stopped the national revolt single-handedly, on March 10, 1922, Gandhi was arrested. On March 18, 1922, he was imprisoned for six years for publishing seditious materials. This led to suppression of the movement and was followed by the arrest of other leaders.\\r\\nAlthough most Congress leaders remained firmly behind Gandhi, the determined broke away. The Ali brothers would soon become fierce critics. Motilal Nehru and Chittaranjan Das formed the Swaraj Party, rejecting Gandhi's leadership. Many nationalists had felt that the non-cooperation movement should not have been stopped due to isolated incidents of violence, and most nationalists, while retaining confidence in Gandhi, were discouraged.\\r\\nContemporary historians and critics suggest that the movement was successful enough to break the back of British rule, and possibly even the catalyst for the movement that lead to independence in 1947.\\r\\nBut many historians and Indian leaders of the time also defended Gandhi's judgment. However, there have been claims that Gandhi called off the movement in an attempt to salvage his own personal image, which would have been tarnished had he been blamed for the Chauri Chaura incident, although a similar type of movement was introduced in 1930, the civil disobedience movement. The main difference was the introduction of a policy of violating the law.\\r\\nGandhi's commitment to non-violence was redeemed when, between 1930 and 1934, tens of millions again revolted in the Salt Satyagraha which made India's cause famous worldwide for its unerring adherence to non-violence. The Satyagraha ended in success: the demands of Indians were met, and the Congress Party was recognized as a representative of the Indian people. The Government of India Act 1935 also gave India its first taste in democratic self-governance.","input":"Who was the first leader arrested in the non corporation movement?"},{"output":"three","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBonanza is an NBC television western series that ran from 1959 to 1973. Lasting 14 seasons and 431 episodes, Bonanza is NBC's longest-running western, and ranks overall as the second-longest-running western series on U.S. network television (behind CBS's Gunsmoke), and within the top 10 longest-running, live-action American series. The show continues to air in syndication. The show is set in the 1860s and it centers on the wealthy Cartwright family that live in the vicinity of Virginia City, Nevada, bordering Lake Tahoe. The series initially starred Lorne Greene, Pernell Roberts, Dan Blocker, and Michael Landon and later featured (at various times) Guy Williams, David Canary, Mitch Vogel, and Tim Matheson. The show is known for presenting pressing moral dilemmas.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title \\"Bonanza\\" is a term used by miners in regard to a large vein or deposit of silver ore,[5] from Spanish bonanza (prosperity) and commonly refers to the 1859 revelation of the Comstock Lode of rich silver ore mines under the town of Virginia City, not far from the fictional Ponderosa Ranch that the Cartwright family operated. The show's theme song, also titled \\"Bonanza,\\" became a hit song in its own right. Only instrumental renditions, absent Ray Evans' lyrics, were ever used during the series's long run.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, Bonanza was ranked No. 43 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time,[7] and in 2013 TV Guide included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time.[8] The time period for the television series is roughly between 1861 (Season 1) and 1867 (Season 13) during and shortly after the American Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the summer of 1972, NBC aired reruns of episodes from the 1967ÿ1970 period in prime time on Tuesday evening under the title Ponderosa.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show chronicles the weekly adventures of the Cartwright family, headed by the thrice-widowed patriarch Ben Cartwright (Lorne Greene). He had three sons, each by a different wife: the eldest was the urbane architect Adam Cartwright (Pernell Roberts) who built the ranch house; the second was the warm and lovable giant Eric \\"Hoss\\" Cartwright (Dan Blocker); and the youngest was the hotheaded and impetuous Joseph or \\"Little Joe\\" (Michael Landon). Via exposition (S01:E01 ÿ \\"Rose for Lotta\\") and flashback episodes, each wife was accorded a different ancestry: English (S02:E65 ÿ \\"Elizabeth My Love\\"), Swedish (S03:E95 ÿ \\"Inger My Love\\") and French Creole (S04:E120 ÿ \\"Marie My Love\\") respectively. The family's cook was the Chinese immigrant Hop Sing (Victor Sen Yung). Greene, Roberts, Blocker, and Landon were billed equally. The opening credits would alternate the order among the four stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family lived on a thousand square-mile (2,600 km2) ranch called the Ponderosa on the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe in Nevada opposite California on the edge of the Sierra Nevada range].[10] The vast size of the Cartwrights' land was quietly revised to \\"half a million acres\\" (2,000 km2) on Lorne Greene's 1964 song, \\"Saga of the Ponderosa.\\" The ranch name refers to the Ponderosa Pine, common in the West. The nearest town to the Ponderosa was Virginia City, where the Cartwrights would go to converse with Sheriff Roy Coffee (played by veteran actor Ray Teal), or his deputy Clem Foster (Bing Russell).\\r\\n\\r\\nBonanza was considered an atypical western for its time, as the core of the storylines dealt less about the range but more with Ben and his three dissimilar sons, how they cared for one another, their neighbors, and just causes. \\"You always saw stories about family on comedies or on an anthology, but Bonanza was the first series that was week-to-week about a family and the troubles it went through. Bonanza was a period drama that attempted to confront contemporary social issues. That was very difficult to do on television. Most shows that tried to do it failed because the sponsors didn't like it, and the networks were nervous about getting letters\\", explains Stephen Battaglio, a senior editor for TV Guide magazine.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nEpisodes ranged from high drama (\\"Bushwhacked\\", episode #392, 1971; \\"Shanklin\\", episode #409, 1972), to broad comedy (\\"Hoss and the Leprechauns\\", episode #146, 1964; \\"Mrs. Wharton and the Lesser Breeds\\", episode #318, 1969; \\"Caution, Bunny Crossing\\", episode #358, 1969), and addressed issues such as the environment (\\"Different Pines, Same Wind\\", episode #304, 1968), substance abuse (\\"The Hidden Enemy\\", episode #424, 1972), domestic violence (\\"First Love\\", episode #427, 1972), anti-war sentiment (\\"The Weary Willies\\", episode #364, 1970), and illegitimate births (\\"Love Child\\", episode #370, 1970; \\"Rock-A-Bye Hoss\\", episode #393, 1971). The series sought to illustrate the cruelty of bigotry against: Asians (\\"The Fear Merchants\\", episode #27, 1960; \\"The Lonely Man\\", episode #404, 1971), African-Americans (\\"Enter Thomas Bowers\\", episode #164, 1964; \\"The Wish\\", episode #326, 1968; \\"Child\\", episode #305, 1969), Native Americans (\\"The Underdog\\", episode #180, 1964; \\"Terror at 2:00\\", episode #384, 1970), Jews, (\\"Look to the Stars\\", episode #90, 1962); Mormons (\\"The Pursued\\", episodes #239-40, 1966), the disabled (\\"Tommy\\", episode #249, 1966) and \\"little people\\" (\\"It's A Small World\\", episode #347, 1968).\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, the Cartwrights tended to be depicted as put-off by outsiders. Lorne Greene objected to this, pointing out that as the area's largest timber and livestock producer, the family should be less clannish. The producers agreed with this observation and changed the Cartwrights to be more amiable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough not familiar stars in 1959, the cast quickly became favorites of the first television generation. The order of billing at the beginning of the broadcast appeared to be shuffled randomly each week, with no relation whatsoever to the current episode featured that week. The main cast of actors portraying Cartwrights is listed here in the order of their characters' ages, followed by an array of recurring supporting players:\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, to Russian-Jewish parents,[12][13] Lorne Greene was chosen to play widowed patriarch Ben Cartwright. Early in the show's history, he recalls each of his late wives in flashback episodes. A standard practice with most westerns was to introduce some romance but avoid matrimony. Few media cowboys had on-screen wives. Any time one of the Cartwrights seriously courted a woman, she died from a malady, was abruptly slain, or left with someone else.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreene appeared in all but fourteen Bonanza episodes. Greene was 44 years old at the beginning of the series while Pernell Roberts and Dan Blocker, who portrayed two of his sons, were both 31, only thirteen years younger.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, a TV Guide survey listed Ben Cartwright as television's #2 favorite dad.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nPernell Roberts played eldest son Adam, an architectural engineer with a university education. Adam built the impressive ranch house.[15][16] Roberts disdained the assembly-line mindset of serial television[citation needed] (a rigid 34 episode season), and fought with series writers regarding Adam's lack of independence, noting that his 30-plus year old character was dependent on his \\"Pa's\\" approval. Despite the show's success, Roberts departed the series after the 1964ÿ65 season (202 episodes) and returned to stage productions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttempts to replace Adam with Little Joe's maternal half-brother Clay (Barry Coe) and Cartwright cousin Will (Guy \\"Zorro\\" Williams), were unsuccessful.[17] Creator David Dortort introduced a storyline that would keep the character of Adam in the mix, but with a lighter schedule. During season five Adam falls for a widow with a young daughter, while making Will Cartwright a central figure. Roberts decided to stay an additional season, so the scripts were quickly revised by having Adam's fiance and her daughter depart the series prematurely with Guy Williams' Will, with whom she'd fallen in love. It was Landon, not Roberts, who objected to the infusion of any new Cartwrights.[13][17] After Roberts did leave the following year, it was eventually mentioned that Adam had gone \\"to sea\\", and in the later movies he had emigrated to Australia. In mid 1972, the series producers considered inviting Roberts back in the wake of Dan Blocker's death: \\"One suggestion was to return Pernell Roberts, who had played another Cartwright son when Bonanza first premiered on NBC fourteen years ago. We only considered that briefly, [producer Richard] Collins says... Some people felt it was a logical stepthe oldest son returning at a time of family needbut most of us didn't think it would work.'\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nDan Blocker was 6-foot-4, 320-pounds[19] when chosen to play the gentle middle son Eric, better known as \\"Hoss\\". The nickname was used as a nod to the character's ample girth,[20] an endearing term for \\"big and friendly\\", used by his Swedish mother (and Uncle Gunnar).[21] In the Bonanza flashback,[22] his mother Inger names him Eric after her father. To satisfy young Adam, Inger and Ben agree to try the nickname Hoss and \\"see which one sticks.\\" Inger says of \\"Hoss\\", \\"In the mountain country, that is the name for a big, friendly man.\\" According to a biography,[13] the show's crew found Blocker to be the \\"least actor-ish as well as the most likeable\\" cast member. According to producer David Dortort: \\"Over the years he gave me the least amount of trouble.\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1972, Blocker died suddenly from a post-operative pulmonary embolism following surgery to remove his gall bladder. The producers felt nobody else could continue the role. It was the first time a TV show's producers chose to kill off a young major male character (though it was done twice previously with young female leadsin 1956 on Make Room For Daddy, and again in 1963 with The Real McCoys). Not until the TV movie Bonanza: The Next Generation was it explained that Hoss had drowned attempting to save a woman's life.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough \\"big and lovable\\", Blocker was also tough. Several years after his death, Landon appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and related the following anecdote. During the shooting of one episode, Blocker's horse stumbled and fell, throwing Blocker and breaking his collarbone. Blocker got up and the bone was actually protruding from his skin. The crew wanted to call an ambulance but Blocker refused and stuck the bone back in place himself and resumed filming. At the end of the day he was convinced to go to the hospital where they set the broken bone and gave him strict instructions, no riding for six weeks. According to Landon, evidently Blocker's horse forgot what it was like to carry the big man during his convalescence because the first time that Blocker swung up into the saddle on his return, the horse collapsed under his weight and the cast and crew collapsed in fits of laughter.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of \\"Little Joe\\" was given to Michael Landon, who had earlier played the title role in I Was a Teenage Werewolf. He portrayed the youngest Cartwright son, whose mother (Felicia in the pilot, and later changed to Marie) was of French Creole descent. Landon began to develop his skills in writing and directing Bonanza episodes, starting with \\"The Gamble.\\" Most of the episodes Landon wrote and directed were dramas, including the two-hour, \\"Forever\\" (1972), which was recognized by TV Guide as being one of television's best specials (November 1993).[vague] Landon's development was a bit stormy according to David Dortort, who felt that the actor grew more difficult during the last five seasons the show ran.[23] Landon appeared in all but fourteen Bonanza episodes for its run, a total of 416 episodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 1962, a foundation was being laid to include another \\"son\\", as Pernell Roberts was displeased with his character. In the episode \\"First Born\\" (1962), viewers learn of Little Joe's older, maternal half-brother Clay Stafford. The character departed in that same episode, but left an opportunity for a return if needed. This character's paternity is open to debate. In the 1963 flashback episode \\"Marie, My Love\\", his father was Jean De'Marigny. Then in 1964, Lorne Greene released the song \\"Saga of the Ponderosa\\",[23] wherein Marie's previous husband was \\"Big Joe\\" Collins, who dies saving Ben's life. After Ben consoles Marie, the two bond and marry. They choose to honor \\"Big Joe\\" by calling their son \\"Little Joe\\". So, whether to Stafford, De'Marigny or Collins, Marie Cartwright was previously married. In the last of the three Bonanza TV movies, it is revealed that \\"Little Joe\\" had died in the SpanishÿAmerican War?ÿ a member of the \\"Rough Riders\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nVeteran character actor Ray Teal essayed the role of Sheriff Roy Coffee on 98 episodes from 1960 to 1972.[24] He appeared in more than 250 movies and some 90 television programs during his 37-year career. His longest-running role was as Sheriff Roy Coffee. He had also played a sheriff in the Billy Wilder film Ace in the Hole (1951). Teal co-starred in numerous TV westerns throughout his career: he appeared five times on Cheyenne, twice on The Lone Ranger, on The Alaskans, a short-lived series starring Roger Moore, three times in different roles on another long-running western series, Wagon Train, on NBC's Tales of Wells Fargo with Dale Robertson, on the ABC western series Broken Arrow, five times on the ABC western comedy Maverick starring James Garner and Jack Kelly, on the CBS western series The Texan with Rory Calhoun, the NBC western series The Californians, twice on Colt .45 with Wayde Preston, once on Wanted: Dead or Alive with Steve McQueen and as \\"Sheriff Clay\\" for a single 1960 episode of the NBC western series Riverboat with Darren McGavin, and four times on a western series about the rodeo entitled Wide Country.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeal was a bit-part player in western films for several years before landing a substantial role in Northwest Passage (1940) starring Spencer Tracy. Another of his roles was as Little John in The Bandit of Sherwood Forest (1946). Notable film roles include playing one of the judges in Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) with Spencer Tracy, and an indulgent bar owner to Marlon Brando's motorcycle gang in The Wild One (1953), which was the second of three times that Teal appeared with Brando, having done so already as a drunk in Brando's debut in The Men (1950) and later in Brando's only directorial effort, One-Eyed Jacks (1961), as a bartender.\\r\\n\\r\\nSheriff Coffee was occasionally the focus of a plot as in the episode \\"No Less a Man\\" (broadcast March 15, 1964). A gang of thieves has been terrorizing towns around Virginia City and the town council wants to replace Coffee, whom they consider over-the-hill, with a younger sheriff before the gang hits town, not realizing that they'd been spared earlier because the gang's leader was wary of Coffee's longevity and only acquiesced to rob the Virginia City bank after extreme pressure from other gang members. Coffee ends up showing the town that youth and a fast gun don't replace experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuy Williams was slated in 1964, the year that Bonanza hit #1 in the ratings, to replace Pernell Roberts upon Roberts' departure, enabling the series to preserve the four-Cartwright format for the run of the series. His character, Ben's nephew Will Cartwright, was introduced and was the lead character in five episodes, receiving \\"Starring\\" billing after the four original rotating Cartwrights during his second appearance going forward, but Roberts changed his mind later and decided to stay for one more season, whereupon Williams found himself pushed out of the part; it was rumored that Landon and Greene felt threatened by the studio initiating a precedent of successfully replacing one heroic leading man Cartwright with a new one, particularly in view of Williams' popularity with viewers. Williams had previously portrayed the titular character in Walt Disney's Zorro television series, and went on to play the lead in Lost in Space, a science fiction television series, after the role in Bonanza ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter graduating from the University of Cincinnati, David Canary was offered a left-end position with the Denver Broncos,[13] but pursued acting and singing. In 1967, he joined the cast as \\"Candy\\" Canaday, a plucky Army brat turned cowboy,[25] who became the Cartwrights' confidant, ranch foreman, and timber vessel captain. Dortort was impressed by Canary's talent, but the character vanished in September 1970, after Canary had a contract dispute. He returned two seasons later after co-star Dan Blocker's death, reportedly having been approached by Landon. Canary played the character on a total of 91 episodes.[24] Canary joined the cast in Season 9.\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese American actor Victor Sen Yung played the Cartwrights' happy-go-lucky cook, whose blood pressure rose when the family came late for dinner. Cast here as the faithful domestic, the comedy relief character had little to do beyond chores. He once used martial arts to assail a towering family foe.[26] Though often referenced, Hop Sing only appeared in an average of eight to nine shows each season. As a semi-regular cast member, Sen Yung was only paid per episode. After 14 years, he was widely known, but making far less than his Ponderosa peers. The Hop Sing character was central in only two episodes: \\"Mark Of Guilt\\" (#316) and \\"The Lonely Man\\" (#404).\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Canary's departure in mid-1970, and aware of the show's aging demographic, the writers sought a fresh outlet for Ben's fatherly advice. Fourteen-year-old Mitch Vogel was introduced as Jamie Hunter in  \\"A Matter of Faith\\" (season 12, episode 363). Vogel played the red-haired orphan of a roving rainmaker, whom Ben takes in and adopts later in a 1971 episode, called \\"A Home For Jamie.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the final season, in 1972ÿ1973, Tim Matheson portrayed Griff King, a parolee who tries to reform his life as a worker at the Ponderosa Ranch under Ben Cartwright's tutelage.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Canary's departure, Frizzell's character accompanied Jamie Hunter to the Ponderosa and became the Cartwright's foreman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, Bonanza aired on Saturday evenings opposite \\"Dick Clark's Saturday Night Beech-Nut Show\\" and \\"John Gunther's High Road\\" on ABC, and Perry Mason on CBS. Bonanza's initial ratings were respectable, often coming in behind Mason but ahead of the ABC line-up. Ironically, executives considered canceling the show before its premiere because of its high cost. NBC kept it because Bonanza was one of the first series to be filmed and broadcast in color, including scenes of picturesque Lake Tahoe, Nevada, although most of the episodes were obviously filmed on soundstages until the seasons near the end of the series. NBC's corporate parent, Radio Corporation of America (RCA), used the show to spur sales of RCA-manufactured color television sets (RCA was also the primary sponsor of the series during its first two seasons).\\r\\n\\r\\nNBC moved Bonanza to Sundays at 9:00?pm Eastern with new sponsor Chevrolet (replacing The Dinah Shore Chevy Show). The new time slot caused Bonanza to soar in the ratings, and it eventually reached number one by 1964, an honor it would keep until 1967 when it was seriously challenged by the socially daring variety show, The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour on CBS. By 1970, Bonanza was the first series to appear in the Top Five list for nine consecutive seasons (a record that would stand for many years) and thus established itself as the most consistent strong-performing hit television series of the 1960s. Bonanza remained high on the Nielsen ratings until 1971, when it finally fell out of the Top Ten.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the summer of 1972, NBC broadcast reruns of episodes of the show from the 1967ÿ1970 era on Tuesday evenings at 7:30?p.m. under the title Ponderosa while also rerunning more recent episodes on Sunday evenings in the show's normal time slot as Bonanza.[9] In the fall of 1972, off-network episodes were released in broadcast syndication to local stations by NBC under the Ponderosa name.  After the series was canceled, the syndicated reruns reverted to the Bonanza name.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the fourth season on, the Cartwrights and nearly every other recurring character on the show wore the same clothing in almost every episode. The reason for this is twofold: it made duplication of wardrobe easier for stunt doubles (Hal Burton, Bob Miles, Bill Clark, Lyle Heisler, Ray Mazy) and it cut the cost of refilming action shots (such as riding clips in-between scenes), as previously shot stock footage could be reused. Below is a survey of costumes employed:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not unusual for Little Joe Cartwright and Candy Canaday to appear shirtless in various scenes involving manual labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1968, Blocker began wearing a toupee on the series, as he was approaching age 40 and his hair loss was becoming more evident. He joined the ranks of his fellow co-stars Roberts and Greene, both of whom had begun the series with hairpieces (Greene wore his modest frontal piece in private life too, whereas Roberts preferred not wearing his, even to rehearsals/blocking). Landon was the only original cast member who was wig-free throughout the series, as even Sen Yung wore an attached queue.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBonanza features a memorable theme song by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans that was orchestrated by David Rose and arranged by Billy May for the television series. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bonanza theme song famously opens with a blazing Ponderosa map and saddlebound Cartwrights. The melodic intro, emulating galloping horses, is one of the most recognized television scores. Variations of the theme were used for 12 seasons on the series. Although there were two official sets of lyrics (some country-western singers, avoiding royalties, substituted the copyright renditions with their own words), the series simply used an instrumental theme. Three of the cast members bellowed-out the original lyrics, unaccompanied, at the close of the pilot (Pernell Roberts, the sole professional singer of the quartet, abstained and untethered the horse reins). Before the pilot aired (on September 12, 1959), the song sequence, deemed too campy, was edited out of the scene and instead the Cartwrights headed back to the ranch whooping and howling. In a 1964 song, the Livingston-Evans lyrics were revised by Lorne Greene with a more familial emphasis, \\"on this land we put our brand, Cartwright is the name, fortune smiled the day we filed the Ponderosa claim\\" (\\"Bonanza\\", Bear Family Box set, Disc #2). In 1968, a slightly revamped horn and percussion-heavy arrangement of the original score introduced the series- which was used until 1970. A new theme song, called \\"The Big Bonanza\\" was written in 1970 by episode scorer David Rose, and was used from 1970ÿ1972. Action-shot pictorials of the cast replaced the galloping trio. Finally, a faster rendition of the original music returned for the 14th and final season, along with action shots of the cast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme song has been recorded by numerous artists in a diverse variety of styles. The first recorded and released version was an instrumental by Marty Gold, on his 1960 album Swingin' West. This was followed by the February 1960 single by Buddy Morrow and his Orchestra, which included vocals. Morrow's version also appeared on his 1960 album Double Impact which featured several other then-recent television themes. In December 1960, another vocal version was issued only in the United Kingdom by Johnny Gregory (bandleader) and his Orchestra and Chorus released on the Fontana label. All aforementioned vocal versions, including the television pilot, used lyrics written by Livingston and Evans contained in the first published sheet music for the song, though not all the lyrics were sung. A Bonanza soundtrack album released in late 1961 included a version by David Rose; Rose also had a 1960 single and included the theme on his 1961 album Exodus in a different mix. The biggest hit version is a guitar instrumental by Al Caiola, which reached number 19 on Billboard in 1961. Other versions were released by Billy Vaughn, Valjean, Lorne Greene, Johnny Cash and Nelson Riddle.\\r\\n\\r\\nCountry singer Johnny Cash was first to record a full length vocal version of the theme song. He and Johnny Western discarded the original Livingston and Evans lyrics, and wrote new ones, though the revised lyrics still make direct reference to the Cartwrights and the Ponderosa. The song first saw release by September 1962 as a single. Sometime after June 1963, it was released as a track on his sixteenth album: Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash. This version was later covered by Faron Young for his 1963 album Aims at the West. Singer Ralf Paulsen recorded a German-language version of the song in 1963, released in mid-June 1963 on Capitol Records in the United States. His German version (lyrics attributed to \\"Nicolas\\") was sung in the same style and mood in which Cash had recorded it, and was fairly close in translation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarlos Malcolm & His Afro-Jamaican Rhythms released a ska version of the song as \\"Bonanza Ska\\" on Trojan Records in 1964. This version was later covered by Bad Manners (1989) and the Hurtin' Buckaroos (1997). Michael Richards, as Stanley Spadowski, sang a bit of the theme song while being held hostage by Channel 8's news goons in UHF (he did not know the words to the song he was originally supposed to sing, \\"Helter Skelter\\"). Michael Feinstein was the last to record the song in 2002 on his Songs of Evans and Livingston tribute CD. The Little House on the Prairie theme (also by Rose), was heard first in a 1971 episode of Bonanza. The overture for The High Chaparral composed by Harry Sukman can be heard briefly at the start of the 1966 episode \\"Four Sisters from Boston\\". On January 29, 2011, Marty Stuart and the Fabulous Superlatives performed the song on episode 56 of The Marty Stuart Show. The band often includes the song in their live shows.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening scene for the first season was shot at Lake Hemet, a reservoir in the San Jacinto Mountains, Riverside County, California, and later moved to Lake Tahoe. During the first season extra horses were rented from the Idyllwild Stables in Idyllwild, also in the San Jacinto Mountains. The first Virginia City set was used on the show until 1970 and was located on a backlot at Paramount and featured in episodes of Have Gun ÿ Will Travel, Mannix, and The Brady Bunch. In the 1970 premiere episode of the 12th season entitled \\"The Night Virginia City Died\\", Deputy Clem Foster's pyromaniac fiance levels the town in a series of fires (reflecting a real 1875 fire that destroyed three-quarters of Virginia City). This allowed for a switch to the less expensive Warner studios from September 1970 through January 1973. The script was initially written for the departing David Canary's Candy, but was rewritten for actors Ray Teal (Sheriff Roy Coffee) and Bing Russell (Deputy Clem Foster), who rarely appeared together on the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program's Nevada set, the Ponderosa Ranch house, was recreated in Incline Village, Nevada, in 1967, and remained a tourist attraction until its sale thirty-seven years later in September 2004.\\r\\n\\r\\nBonanza is uniquely known for having addressed racism, not typically covered on American television during the time period, from a compassionate, humanitarian point-of-view.\\r\\n\\r\\nBigotry, and specifically anti-semitism,[31] was the subject of the episode \\"Look to the Stars\\" (Season 3, Episode 26; original air date March 18, 1962). A bigoted school teacher Mr. Norton (oblivious of his prejudice) routinely expels minority students. When he expels the brilliant Jewish student Albert Michelson, a scientific genius whose experiments on the streets of Virginia City often cause commotion, Ben Cartwright steps in and confronts Norton on his bigotry. Ashamed, the school teacher vows to reform.[32]  A coda to the episode reveals that Michelson went on to win the Nobel Prize for Physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the episode \\"Enter Thomas Bowers\\" (Season 5, Episode 30; original air date April 26, 1964), the Cartwright family helps the opera singer Bowers, an African American freedman, after he encounters prejudice while in Virginia City to perform. Bowers winds up arrested as a fugitive slave. At the beginning of the episode, Adam is shown to be outraged at the Supreme Court's Dred Scott v. Sandford decision (placing the time as 1857), which he discusses with his father.  According to David Dortort, sponsor General Motors was anxious about the episode. As producer, Dortort ensured that the episode re-aired during the summer rerun seasons, though two TV stations in the South refused to air it.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the episode \\"The Wish,\\" directed by Michael Landon, Hoss protects an African American former slave's family when confronted with racism after the American Civil War. In  \\"The Fear Merchants,\\" discrimination against Chinese immigrants who attempt to assimilate in American society is addressed.[34][35] \\"The Lonely Man\\" presents the controversial interracial marriage between the Cartwrights  longtime Chinese chef (Hop Sing) and a white woman (Missy).\\r\\n\\r\\nBonanza has had a highly profitable merchandising history. Currently, Bonanza Ventures, Inc. grants merchandising and licensing rights worldwide. The original series has spawned: several successful novelty western/folk albums from 1962ÿ1965; three dozen Dell and Gold Key comic books from 1962 through 1970; a short-lived comic book adaptation by Dutch comics artist Hans G. Kresse between 1965-1966,[36] Jim Beam Whiskey Ponderosa Ranch decanters 1964ÿ1966; a series of \\"Big-Little\\" books from 1966ÿ1969; Revel Bonanza model character sets from 1966ÿ1968; a chain of Bonanza and Ponderosa steakhouses from 1963ÿpresent; the Lake Tahoe-based \\"Ponderosa\\" theme park from 1967ÿ2004; a line of American Character action figures in 1966ÿ1967; Aladdin lunch buckets and thermos bottles in 1966ÿ1968; View Master slide sets in 1964, 1971; Ponderosa tin cups from 1967ÿ2004; a series of Hamilton collector plates in 1989ÿ1990; and most recently, Breyer Fiftieth Anniversary Ponderosa Stable sets, with horses and Cartwright figures in 2009ÿ2011. Fourteen Bonanza novels have been published: Bonanza: A Novel by Noel Loomis (1960); Bonanza: One Man With Courage by Thomas Thompson (1966); Bonanza: Killer Lion by Steve Frazee (1966); Bonanza: Treachery Trail by Harry Whittington (1968); Winter Grass by Dean Owen (1968); Ponderosa Kill by Dean Owen (1968); The Pioneer Spirit by Stephen Calder (1988); The Ponderosa Empire by Stephen Calder (1991); Bonanza: The High Steel Hazard by Stephen Calder (1993); Journey of the Horse by Stephen Calder (1993); The Money Hole by Stephen Calder (1993); The Trail to Timberline by Stephen Calder (1994); Bonanza: Felling of the Sons by Monette L. Bebow-Reinhard (2005), and Bonanza: Mystic Fire by Monette L. Bebow-Reinhard (2009). There is also a collection of Bonanza stories: The Best of Bonanza World: A Book of Favorite Stories, published by CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (2012). Bonanza Gold (2003ÿ2009), a quarterly magazine, featured detailed information about the show, including interviews with guest actors and other production personnel, articles about historical events and people depicted in the series, fan club information, and fan fiction.  Seasons 1-8 (as of 06/2015) are available on DVD, as well as several non-successive public-domain episodes (sans original theme music). The prequel series, The Ponderosa, as well as the three sequel movies (see below), are all available on DVD.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall of 1972, NBC moved Bonanza to Tuesday nights?ÿ where reruns from the 1967ÿ1970 period had aired the previous summer under the title Ponderosa[9]?ÿ opposite the All In The Family spinoff show, Maude, a virtual death sentence for the show. The scheduling change, as well as Dan Blocker's death several months earlier, resulted in plunging ratings for the show. David Canary returned to his former role of Candy (to offset Hoss' absence), and a new character named Griff King (played by Tim Matheson) was added to lure younger viewers. Griff, in prison for nearly killing his abusive stepfather, was paroled into Ben's custody and got a job as a ranch hand. Several episodes were built around his character, one that Matheson never had a chance to fully develop before the show's abrupt cancellation in November 1972 (with last episode airing January 16, 1973). Many fans, as well as both Landon and Greene, felt that the Hoss character was essential, as he was a nurturing, empathetic soul who rounded out the all-male cast.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 14 years, the Cartwrights were the premier western family on American television and have been immensely popular on cable networks such as TV Land, INSP, Family Channel, and the Hallmark Channel. The series currently airs on Me-TV, TV Land, INSP, and Encore Westerns. TV Land airs Bonanza from only the first season to the 1969-1970 season. INSP first aired only selected first and second-season episodes of Bonanza and began to air the Bonanza Lost Episodes packages which contains episodes that originally aired from 1965-1973. Family Channel and the Hallmark Channel were two other channels that have also only aired the Bonanza Lost Episodes package. In October 2015, Me-TV additionally began airing the Bonanza Lost Episodes package.[37] As of December 2016, Me-TV returned to airing the original episodes package.  Ever since March 2018 Me-TV has been airing the Lost Episodes, wanting to play the entire series from beginning to end.\\r\\n\\r\\nBonanza was revived for three made-for-television movies featuring the Cartwrights' children: Bonanza: The Next Generation (1988), Bonanza: The Return (1993), and Bonanza: Under Attack (1995). Michael Landon Jr., played Little Joe's son Benji while Gillian Greene, Lorne Greene's daughter, played a love interest. In the second movie, airing on NBC, a one-hour retrospective was done to introduce the drama. It was hosted by both Michael Landon Jr., and Dirk Blocker, who looks and sounds much like his father Dan Blocker. According to the magazine TV Guide, producer Dortort told Blocker he was too old to play the Hoss scion, but gave him the role of an unrelated newspaper reporter. Clips of his appearance were heavily used in advertisements promoting the \\"second generation\\" theme, perhaps misleading audiences to believe that Blocker was playing Hoss' heir. Hoss' son Josh was born out of wedlock, as it is explained that Hoss drowned without knowing his fianc?e was pregnant. Such a storyline might have been problematic in the original series. (The Big Valley, however, had a major character in Heath, who was presented as illegitimate. The Gunsmoke movies of the early 1990s employed a similar theme when Marshal Matt Dillon learned he had sired Michael Learned's character's daughter in a short-lived romance. The initial story was first introduced in 1973, when depiction of fornication courted protests, so CBS insisted their hero Matt have the encounter when he had amnesia.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, there was an attempt to revive the Bonanza concept with a prequel, Ponderosa?ÿ not to be confused with the 1972 summer reruns under the same title[9]?ÿ with a pilot directed by Simon Wincer and filmed in Australia. Covering the time when the Cartwrights first arrived at the Ponderosa, when Adam was a teenager and Joe a little boy, the series lasted 20 episodes and featured less gunfire and brawling than the original. Bonanza creator David Dortort approved PAX TV (now Ion TV)'s decision to hire Beth Sullivan, formerly of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, which some believe gave the series more depth as well as a softer edge. The Hop Sing character is depicted not only as a cook but also a family counselor and herbal healer. The series takes place in Nevada Territory in 1849, which is actually an anachronism.  The Nevada Territory did not split from the Utah Territory until 1861, meaning that until at least the 5th season (the episode \\"Enter Thomas Bowers\\" establishes that year as 1857), Bonanza is also set in what in real life would have been Utah Territory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral early episodes have fallen into the public domain. These episodes have been released by several companies in different configurations, with substandard picture and sound quality, edited, and by legal necessity with the copyright-protected Evans-Livingston theme song replaced with generic western music.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1973, NBC licensed the distribution rights to the series, along with the rest of its pre-1973 library, to National Telefilm Associates, which changed its name to Republic Pictures in 1986. Republic would become part of the Spelling Entertainment organization in 1994 through Worldvision Enterprises. Select episodes (\\"The Best of Bonanza\\") were officially released in North America in 2003 on DVD through then-Republic video licensee Artisan Entertainment (which was later purchased by Lionsgate Home Entertainment). Republic (through CBS Television Distribution, which holds the television side of Republic's holdings) still retains the syndication distribution rights to the series. CBS Home Entertainment (under Paramount Home Media Distribution) is the official home video rights distributor at present.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in September 2009, CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount) has to date released the first eight seasons on DVD in Region 1.  All episodes have been digitally remastered from original 35mm film elements to yield the best picture and sound quality possible with current technology. CBSHE has released each season in two-volume sets (available together and separately). Each and every set contains exclusive multiple and rare bonus features, more than any other vintage long-running television series released on DVD. Classic series collections usually have bonus features included with the first season release only, if at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Region 2, AL!VE AG released the first seven seasons on DVD in Germany between 2008ÿ2010.  These releases are now out of print as AL!VE has lost the rights.  In 2011, StudioCanal acquired the rights to the series and have begun re-releasing it on DVD, and all seasons have now been released but have not been remastered.\\r\\n\\r\\nEpisodes of the series have also been officially released as part-works on DVD in France and the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nBonanza \\"the official first season\\" was released in Scandinavia during 2010. The first season is released in 4 volumes. The first two volumes were released on October 20, 2010, and the second two volumes on April 27, 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegion 1","input":"How many times was ben cartwright married on bonanza?"},{"output":"from seventy to over one hundred musicians, depending on the work being played and the size of the venue","context":"An orchestra (/???rk?str?/; Italian:?[or?k?stra]) is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which mixes instruments from different families, including bowed string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, each grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments.\\r\\n\\r\\nA full-size orchestra may sometimes be called a symphony orchestra or philharmonic orchestra. The actual number of musicians employed in a given performance may vary from seventy to over one hundred musicians, depending on the work being played and the size of the venue. The term chamber orchestra (and sometimes concert orchestra) usually refers to smaller-sized ensembles of about fifty musicians or fewer. Orchestras that specialize in the Baroque music of, for example, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel, or Classical repertoire, such as that of Haydn and Mozart, tend to be smaller than orchestras performing a Romantic music repertoire, such as the symphonies of Johannes Brahms. The typical orchestra grew in size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak with the large orchestras (of as many as 120 players) called for in the works of Richard Wagner, and later, Gustav Mahler. \\r\\n\\r\\nOrchestras are usually led by a conductor who directs the performance with movements of the hands and arms, often made easier for the musicians to see by use of a conductor's baton. The conductor unifies the orchestra, sets the tempo and shapes the sound of the ensemble.[1] The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on their interpretation of the music being performed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leader of the first violin section, commonly called the concertmaster, also plays an important role in leading the musicians. In the Baroque music era (1600ÿ1750), orchestras were often led by the concertmaster or by a chord-playing musician performing the basso continuo parts on a harpsichord or pipe organ, a tradition that some 20th century and 21st century early music ensembles continue. Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire, including symphonies, opera and ballet overtures, concertos for solo instruments, and as pit ensembles for operas, ballets and some types of musical theater (e.g., Gilbert and Sullivan operettas).\\r\\n\\r\\nAmateur orchestras include those made up of students from an elementary school or a high school, youth orchestras, and community orchestras; the latter two typically being made up of amateur musicians from a particular city or region.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term orchestra derives from the Greek ??ϫ (orchestra), the name for the area in front of a stage in ancient Greek theatre reserved for the Greek chorus.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe typical symphony orchestra consists of four groups of related musical instruments called the woodwinds, brass, percussion, and strings (violin, viola, cello and double bass). Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes be grouped into a fifth section such as a keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and electric and electronic instruments. The orchestra, depending on the size, contains almost all of the standard instruments in each group.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the history of the orchestra, its instrumentation has been expanded over time, often agreed to have been standardized by the classical period[3] and Ludwig van Beethoven's influence on the classical model.[4] In the 20th and 21st century, new repertory demands expanded the instrumentation of the orchestra, resulting in a flexible use of the classical-model instruments and newly developed electric and electronic instruments in various combinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe terms symphony orchestra and philharmonic orchestra may be used to distinguish different ensembles from the same locality, such as the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. A symphony orchestra will usually have over eighty musicians on its roster, in some cases over a hundred, but the actual number of musicians employed in a particular performance may vary according to the work being played and the size of the venue.\\r\\n\\r\\nChamber orchestra usually refers to smaller-sized ensembles; a major chamber orchestra might employ as many as fifty musicians; some are much smaller than that. The term concert orchestra may also be used, as in the BBC Concert Orchestra and the RT Concert Orchestra.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe so-called \\"standard complement\\" of doubled winds and brass in the orchestra from the first half of the 19th century is generally attributed to the forces called for by Beethoven.[citation needed] The composer's instrumentation almost always included paired flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns and trumpets. The exceptions to this are his Symphony No. 4, Violin Concerto, and Piano Concerto No. 4, which each specify a single flute. Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion of this particular timbral \\"palette\\" in Symphonies 3, 5, 6, and 9 for an innovative effect. The third horn in the \\"Eroica\\" Symphony arrives to provide not only some harmonic flexibility, but also the effect of \\"choral\\" brass in the Trio movement. Piccolo, contrabassoon, and trombones add to the triumphal finale of his Symphony No. 5. A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver the effect of storm and sunshine in the Sixth, also known as the Pastoral Symphony. The Ninth asks for a second pair of horns, for reasons similar to the \\"Eroica\\" (four horns has since become standard); Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussionplus chorus and vocal soloistsin his finale, are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries of symphony might be expanded. For several decades after his death, symphonic instrumentation was faithful to Beethoven's well-established model, with few exceptions.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from the core orchestral complement, various other instruments are called for occasionally.[5] These include the flugelhorn and cornet. Saxophones and classical guitars, for example, appear in some 19th- through 21st-century scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example Maurice Ravel's orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and Sergei Rachmaninoff's Symphonic Dances, the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's Bolro, Sergei Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2, Vaughan Williams' Symphonies No.6 and 9 and William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. The euphonium is featured in a few late Romantic and 20th-century works, usually playing parts marked \\"tenor tuba\\", including Gustav Holst's The Planets, and Richard Strauss's Ein Heldenleben. The Wagner tuba, a modified member of the horn family, appears in Richard Wagner's cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen and several other works by Strauss, Bla Bart܇k, and others; it has a prominent role in Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 7 in E Major.[6] Cornets appear in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet Swan Lake, Claude Debussy's La Mer, and several orchestral works by Hector Berlioz. Unless these instruments are played by members \\"doubling\\" on another instrument (for example, a trombone player changing to euphonium or a bassoon player switching to contrabassoon for a certain passage), orchestras typically hire freelance musicians to augment their regular ensemble.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 20th-century orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors.[7] In Beethoven's and Felix Mendelssohn's time, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments, which was very rarely modified by composers. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler; some composers used multiple harps and sound effect such as the wind machine. During the 20th century, the modern orchestra was generally standardized with the modern instrumentation listed below. Nevertheless, by the mid- to late 20th century, with the development of contemporary classical music, instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer (e.g., to add electric instruments such as electric guitar, electronic instruments such as synthesizers, non-Western instruments, or other instruments not traditionally used in orchestra).\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this history in mind, the orchestra can be analyzed in five periods: the Baroque era, the Classical music period, early/mid-Romantic music era, late-Romantic/early 20th century music and 21st century era. The first is a Baroque orchestra (i.e., J.S. Bach, Handel, Vivaldi), which generally had a smaller number of performers, and in which one or more chord-playing instruments, the basso continuo group (e.g., harpsichord or pipe organ and assorted bass instruments to perform the bassline), played an important role; the second is a typical classical period orchestra (e.g., early Beethoven along with Mozart and Haydn), which used a smaller group of performers than a Romantic music orchestra and a fairly standardized instrumentation; the third is typical of an early/mid-Romantic era (e.g., Schubert, Berlioz, Schumann); the fourth is a late-Romantic/early 20th century orchestra (e.g., Wagner, Brahms, Mahler, Stravinsky), to the common complement of a 2010-era modern orchestra (e.g., Adams, Barber, Aaron Copland, Glass, Penderecki).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the instrument groups and within each group of instruments, there is a generally accepted hierarchy. Every instrumental group (or section) has a principal who is generally responsible for leading the group and playing orchestral solos. The violins are divided into two groups, first violin and second violin, with the second violins playing in lower registers than the first violins, playing an accompaniment part, or harmonizing the melody played by the first violins. The principal first violin is called the concertmaster (or \\"leader\\" in the UK) and is not only considered the leader of the string section, but the second-in-command of the entire orchestra, behind only the conductor.  The concertmaster leads the pre-concert tuning and handles musical aspects of orchestra management, such as determining the bowings for the violins or for all of the string section. The concertmaster usually sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience. There is also a principal second violin, a principal viola, a principal cello and a principal bass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal trombone is considered the leader of the low brass section, while the principal trumpet is generally considered the leader of the entire brass section. While the oboe often provides the tuning note for the orchestra (due to 300-year-old convention), no principal is the leader of the woodwind section though in woodwind ensembles, often the flute is leader.[8] Instead, each principal confers with the others as equals in the case of musical differences of opinion. Most sections also have an assistant principal (or co-principal or associate principal), or in the case of the first violins, an assistant concertmaster, who often plays a tutti part in addition to replacing the principal in his or her absence.\\r\\n\\r\\nA section string player plays in unison with the rest of the section, except in the case of divided (divisi) parts, where upper and lower parts in the music are often assigned to \\"outside\\" (nearer the audience) and \\"inside\\" seated players. Where a solo part is called for in a string section, the section leader invariably plays that part. The section leader (or principal) of a string section is also responsible for determining the bowings, often based on the bowings set out by the concertmaster. In some cases, the principal of a string section may use a slightly different bowing than the concertmaster, to accommodate the requirements of playing their instrument (e.g., the double-bass section). Principals of a string section will also lead entrances for their section, typically by lifting the bow before the entrance, to ensure the section plays together. Tutti wind and brass players generally play a unique but non-solo part. Section percussionists play parts assigned to them by the principal percussionist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn modern times, the musicians are usually directed by a conductor, although early orchestras did not have one, giving this role instead to the concertmaster or the harpsichordist playing the continuo. Some modern orchestras also do without conductors, particularly smaller orchestras and those specializing in historically accurate (so-called \\"period\\") performances of baroque and earlier music.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most frequently performed repertoire for a symphony orchestra is Western classical music or opera. However, orchestras are used sometimes in popular music (e.g., to accompany a rock or pop band in a concert), extensively in film music, and increasingly often in video game music. Orchestras are also used in the symphonic metal genre. The term \\"orchestra\\" can also be applied to a jazz ensemble, for example in the performance of big-band music.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2000s, all tenured members of a professional orchestra normally audition for positions in the ensemble. Performers typically play one or more solo pieces of the auditionee's choice, such as a movement of a concerto, a solo Bach movement, and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature that are advertised in the audition poster (so the auditionees can prepare). The excerpts are typically the most technically challenging parts and solos from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the conductor, the concertmaster, the principal player of the section for which the auditionee is applying and possibly other principal players and regular orchestra members.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most promising candidates from the first round of auditions are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a test week, in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual rehearsal and performance setting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a range of different employment arrangements. The most sought-after positions are permanent, tenured positions in the orchestra. Orchestras also hire musicians on contracts, ranging in length from a single concert to a full season or more. Contract performers may be hired for individual concerts when the orchestra is doing an exceptionally large late-Romantic era orchestral work, or to substitute for a permanent member who is sick. A professional musician who is hired to perform for a single concert is sometimes called a \\"sub\\". Some contract musicians may be hired to replace permanent members for the period that the permanent member is on parental leave or disability leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, major professional orchestras have been mostly or entirely composed of male musicians. The first female members hired in professional orchestras have been harpists. The Vienna Philharmonic, for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than comparable orchestras (the other orchestras ranked among the worlds top five by Gramophone in 2008).[9] The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the Berlin Philharmonic.[10] In February 1996, the Vienna Philharmonic's principal flute, Dieter Flury, told Westdeutscher Rundfunk that accepting women would be \\"gambling with the emotional unity (emotionelle Geschlossenheit) that this organism currently has\\".[11] In April 1996, the orchestras press secretary wrote that \\"compensating for the expected leaves of absence\\" of maternity leave would be a problem.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic was \\"facing protests during a [US] tour\\" by the National Organization for Women and the International Alliance for Women in Music. Finally, \\"after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist.\\"[13] As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova, became one of the orchestras concertmasters in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.[14] In 2012, women made up 6% of the orchestra's membership. VPO president Clemens Hellsberg said the VPO now uses completely screened blind auditions.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, an article in Mother Jones stated that while \\"[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membershipwomen outnumber men in the New York Philharmonic's violin sectionand several renowned ensembles, including the National Symphony Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony, and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists\\", the double bass, brass, and percussion sections of major orchestras \\"...are still predominantly male.\\"[16] A 2014 BBC article stated that the \\"...introduction of blind auditions, where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also a variety of amateur orchestras:\\r\\n\\r\\nOrchestras play a wide range of repertoire ranging from 17th-century dance suites, 18th century divertimentos to 20th century film scores and 21st-century symphonies. Orchestras have become synonymous with the symphony, an extended musical composition in Western classical music that typically contains multiple movements which provide contrasting keys and tempos. Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts. The conductor uses the score to study the symphony before rehearsals and decide on their interpretation (e.g., tempos, articulation, phrasing, etc.), and to follow the music during rehearsals and concerts, while leading the ensemble. Orchestral musicians play from parts containing just the notated music for their instrument. A small number of symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., Beethoven's Ninth Symphony).\\r\\n\\r\\nOrchestras also perform overtures, a term originally applied to the instrumental introduction to an opera.[18] During the early Romantic era, composers such as Beethoven and Mendelssohn began to use the term to refer to independent, self-existing instrumental, programmatic works that presaged genres such as the symphonic poem, a form devised by Franz Liszt in several works that began as dramatic overtures. These were \\"at first undoubtedly intended to be played at the head of a programme\\".[18] In the 1850s the concert overture began to be supplanted by the symphonic poem.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrchestras also play with instrumental soloists in concertos. During concertos, the orchestra plays an accompaniment role to the soloist (e.g., a solo violinist or pianist) and, at times, introduces musical themes or interludes while the soloist is not playing. Orchestras also play during operas, ballets, some musical theatre works and some choral works (both sacred works such as Masses and secular works). In operas and ballets, the orchestra accompanies the singers and dancers, respectively, and plays overtures and interludes where the melodies played by the orchestra take centre stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Baroque era, orchestras performed in a range of venues, including at the fine houses of aristocrats, in opera halls and in churches. Some wealthy aristocrats had an orchestra in residence at their estate, to entertain them and their guests with performances. During the Classical era, as composers increasing sought out financial support from the general public, orchestra concerts were increasingly held in public concert halls, where music lovers could buy tickets to hear the orchestra. Of course, aristocratic patronage of orchestras continued during the Classical era, but this went on alongside public concerts. In the 20th and 21st century, orchestras found a new patron: governments. Many orchestras in North America and Europe receive part of their funding from national, regional level governments (e.g., state governments in the U.S.) or city governments. These government subsidies make up part of orchestra revenue, along with ticket sales, charitable donations (if the orchestra is a registered as a charity) and other fundraising activities. With the invention of successive technologies, including sound recording, radio broadcasting, television broadcasting and Internet-based streaming and downloading of concert videos, orchestras have been able to find new revenue sources.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the \\"great unmentionable [topics] of orchestral playing\\" is \\"faking\\", the process by which an orchestral musician gives the \\"...impression of playing every note as written\\", typically for a very challenging passage that is very high or very fast, while not actually playing the notes that are in the printed music part.[19] An article in The Strad states that all orchestral musicians, even those in the top orchestras, occasionally \\"fake\\" certain passages.[19] One reason that musicians \\"fake\\" is because there are not enough rehearsals.[19] Another factor is the extreme challenges in 20th century and 21st century contemporary pieces; professionals interviewed by the magazine said \\"faking\\" was \\"...necessary in anything from ten to almost ninety per cent of some modern works.[19] Professional players who were interviewed were of a consensus that faking may be acceptable when a part is not written well for the instrument, but faking \\"just because you havent practised\\" the music is not acceptable.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invention of the piston and rotary valve by Heinrich St?lzel and Friedrich Blhmel, both Silesians, in 1815, was the first in a series of innovations which impacted the orchestra, including the development of modern keywork for the flute by Theobald Boehm and the innovations of Adolphe Sax in the woodwinds, notably the invention of the saxophone. These advances would lead Hector Berlioz to write a landmark book on instrumentation, which was the first systematic treatise on the use of instrumental sound as an expressive element of music.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next major expansion of symphonic practice came from Richard Wagner's Bayreuth orchestra, founded to accompany his musical dramas. Wagner's works for the stage were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity: indeed, his score to Das Rheingold calls for six harps. Thus, Wagner envisioned an ever-more-demanding role for the conductor of the theatre orchestra, as he elaborated in his influential work On Conducting.[21] This brought about a revolution in orchestral composition, and set the style for orchestral performance for the next eighty years. Wagner's theories re-examined the importance of tempo, dynamics, bowing of string instruments and the role of principals in the orchestra. Conductors who studied his methods would go on to be influential themselves.[vague]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the early 20th?century dawned, symphony orchestras were larger, better funded, and better trained than ever before; consequently, composers could compose larger and more ambitious works. The influence of Gustav Mahler was particularly innovational; in his later symphonies, such as the mammoth Symphony No.?8, Mahler pushes the furthest boundaries of orchestral size, employing huge forces. By the late Romantic era, orchestras could support the most enormous forms of symphonic expression, with huge string sections, massive brass sections and an expanded range of percussion instruments. With the recording era beginning, the standards of performance were pushed to a new level, because a recorded symphony could be listened to closely and even minor errors in intonation or ensemble, which might not be noticeable in a live performance, could be heard by critics. As recording technologies improved over the 20th and 21st centuries, eventually small errors in a recording could be \\"fixed\\" by audio editing or overdubbing. Some older conductors and composers could remember a time when simply \\"getting through\\" the music as best as possible was the standard. Combined with the wider audience made possible by recording, this led to a renewed focus on particular star conductors and on a high standard of orchestral execution.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the advent of the early music movement, smaller orchestras where players worked on execution of works in styles derived from the study of older treatises on playing became common. These include the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the London Classical Players under the direction of Sir Roger Norrington and the Academy of Ancient Music under Christopher Hogwood, among others.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the late 20th century saw a crisis of funding and support for orchestras. The size and cost of a symphony orchestra, compared to the size of the base of supporters, became an issue that struck at the core of the institution. Few orchestras could fill auditoriums, and the time-honored season-subscription system became increasingly anachronistic, as more and more listeners would buy tickets on an ad hoc basis for individual events. Orchestral endowments andmore centrally to the daily operation of American orchestrasorchestral donors have seen investment portfolios shrink or produce lower yields, reducing the ability of donors to contribute; further, there has been a trend toward donors finding other social causes more compelling. Also, while government funding is less central to American than European orchestras, cuts in such funding are still significant for American ensembles. Finally, the drastic falling-off of revenues from recording, tied to no small extent to changes in the recording industry itself, began a period of change that has yet to reach its conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. orchestras that have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy include the Philadelphia Orchestra (in April 2011), and the Louisville Orchestra, in December 2010; orchestras that have gone into Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have ceased operations include the Northwest Chamber Orchestra in 2006, the Honolulu Orchestra in March 2011, the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra in April 2011, and the Syracuse Symphony in June 2011. The Festival of Orchestras in Orlando, Florida ceased operations at the end of March, 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne source of financial difficulties that received notice and criticism was high salaries for music directors of US orchestras,[23] which led several high-profile conductors to take pay cuts in recent years.[24][25][26]  Music administrators such as Michael Tilson Thomas and Esa-Pekka Salonen argued that new music, new means of presenting it, and a renewed relationship with the community could revitalize the symphony orchestra. The American critic Greg Sandow has argued in detail that orchestras must revise their approach to music, performance, the concert experience, marketing, public relations, community involvement, and presentation to bring them in line with the expectations of 21st-century audiences immersed in popular culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not uncommon for contemporary composers to use unconventional instruments, including various synthesizers, to achieve desired effects. Many, however, find more conventional orchestral configuration to provide better possibilities for color and depth. Composers like John Adams often employ Romantic-size orchestras, as in Adams' opera Nixon in China; Philip Glass and others may be more free, yet still identify size-boundaries. Glass in particular has recently turned to conventional orchestras in works like the Concerto for Cello and Orchestra and the Violin Concerto No. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with a decrease in funding, some U.S. orchestras have reduced their overall personnel, as well as the number of players appearing in performances. The reduced numbers in performance are usually confined to the string section, since the numbers here have traditionally been flexible (as multiple players typically play from the same part).\\r\\n\\r\\nConducting is the art of directing a musical performance, such as an orchestral or choral concert. The primary duties of the conductor are to set the tempo, ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and to \\"shape\\" the phrasing where appropriate.[27] To convey their ideas and interpretation, a conductor communicates with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, typically though not invariably with the aid of a baton, and may use other gestures or signals, such as eye contact with relevant performers.[28] A conductor's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the full score, which contains the musical notation for all the instruments and voices. Since the mid-18th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting,[citation needed] although in earlier periods of classical music history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In Baroque music from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the harpsichordist or first violinist (see concertmaster), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a piano or synthesizer may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in art music, but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a \\"count in\\"). However, in rehearsals, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.\\r\\n\\r\\nConductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their scores, to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections, and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,[29] planning a concert season, hearing auditions and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. Orchestras, choirs, concert bands and other sizable musical ensembles such as big bands are usually led by conductors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Baroque music era (1600ÿ1750), most orchestras were led by one of the musicians, typically the principal first violin, called the concertmaster. The concertmaster would lead the tempo of pieces by lifting his or her bow in a rhythmic manner. Leadership might also be provided by one of the chord-playing instrumentalists playing the basso continuo part which was the core of most Baroque instrumental ensemble pieces. Typically, this would be a harpsichord player, a pipe organist or a luteist or theorbo player. A keyboard player could lead the ensemble with his or her head, or by taking one of the hands off the keyboard to lead a more difficult tempo change. A lutenist or theorbo player could lead by lifting the instrument neck up and down to indicate the tempo of a piece, or to lead a ritard during a cadence or ending. In some works which combined choirs and instrumental ensembles, two leaders were sometimes used: a concertmaster to lead the instrumentalists and a chord-playing performer to lead the singers. During the Classical music period (ca. 1720ÿ1800), the practice of using chordal instruments to play basso continuo was gradually phased out, and it disappeared completely by 1800. Instead, ensembles began to use conductors to lead the orchestra's tempos and playing style, while the concertmaster played an additional leadership role for the musicians, especially the string players, who imitate the bowstroke and playing style of the concertmaster, to the degree that is feasible for the different stringed instruments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1922, the idea of a conductor-less orchestra was revived in post-revolutionary Soviet Union. The symphony orchestra Persimfans was formed without a conductor, because the founders believed that the ensemble should be modeled on the ideal Marxist state, in which all people are equal. As such, its members felt that there was no need to be led by the dictatorial baton of a conductor; instead they were led by a committee, which determined tempos and playing styles. Although it was a partial success within the Soviet Union, the principal difficulty with the concept was in changing tempo during performances, because even if the committee had issued a decree about where a tempo change should take place, there was no leader in the ensemble to guide this tempo change. The orchestra survived for ten years before Stalin's cultural politics disbanded it by taking away its funding.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Western nations, some ensembles, such as the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, based in New York City, have had more success with conductorless orchestras, although decisions are likely to be deferred to some sense of leadership within the ensemble (for example, the principal wind and string players, notably the concertmaster). Others have returned to the tradition of a principal player, usually a violinist, being the artistic director and running rehearsal and leading concerts. Examples include the Australian Chamber Orchestra, Amsterdam Sinfonietta & Candida Thompson and the New Century Chamber Orchestra. As well, as part of the early music movement, some 20th and 21st century orchestras have revived the Baroque practice of having no conductor on the podium for Baroque pieces, using the concertmaster or a chord-playing basso continuo performer (e.g., harpsichord or organ) to lead the group.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome orchestral works specify that an offstage trumpet should be used or that other instruments from the orchestra should be positioned off-stage or behind the stage, to create a haunted, mystical effect. To ensure that the offstage instrumentalist(s) play in time, sometimes a sub-conductor will be stationed offstage with a clear view of the principal conductor. Examples include the ending of \\"Neptune\\" from Gustav Holst's The Planets. The principal conductor leads the large orchestra, and the sub-conductor relays the principal conductor's tempo and gestures to the offstage musician (or musicians). One of the challenges with using two conductors is that the second conductor may get out of synchronization with the main conductor, or may mis-convey (or misunderstand) the principal conductor's gestures, which can lead to the offstage instruments being out of time. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, some orchestras use a video camera pointed at the principal conductor and a closed-circuit TV set in front of the offstage performer(s), instead of using two conductors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe techniques of polystylism and polytempo[31] music have led a few 20th and 21st century composers to write music where multiple orchestras or ensembles perform simultaneously.  These trends have brought about the phenomenon of polyconductor music, wherein separate sub-conductors conduct each group of musicians.  Usually, one principal conductor conducts the sub-conductors, thereby shaping the overall performance. In Percy Grainger's \\"The Warriors\\" which includes three conductors: the primary conductor of the orchestra, a secondary conductor directing an off-stage brass ensemble, and a tertiary conductor directing percussion and harp. One example in the late century orchestral music is Karlheinz Stockhausen's Gruppen, for three orchestras, which are placed around the audience. This way, the \\"sound masses\\" could be spacialized, as in an electroacoustic work. Gruppen was premiered in Cologne, in 1958, conducted by Stockhausen, Bruno Maderna and Pierre Boulez. It has been[when?] performed by Simon Rattle, John Carewe and Daniel Harding.","input":"How many instruments in a full symphony orchestra?"},{"output":"Eugene Andrew Cernan","context":"Eugene Andrew Cernan (/?s?r.n?n/; March 14, 1934 ÿ January 16, 2017) was an American astronaut, naval aviator, electrical engineer, aeronautical engineer, and fighter pilot. During the Apollo 17 mission, Cernan became the eleventh person to walk on the moon and, as he re-entered the lunar module after Harrison Schmitt on their third and final lunar excursion, is the last person to have walked on the Moon.\\r\\nCernan traveled into space three times; as pilot of Gemini 9A in June 1966, as lunar module pilot of Apollo 10 in May 1969, and as commander of Apollo 17 in December 1972, the final Apollo lunar landing. Cernan was also a backup crew member of the Gemini 12, Apollo 7 and Apollo 14 space missions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCernan was born on March 14, 1934, in Chicago, Illinois; he is the son of Rose (ne Cihlar) and Andrew Cernan. His father was of Slovak descent and his mother was of Czech ancestry.[1][2] Cernan grew up in the Illinois towns Bellwood and Maywood. He was a Boy Scout and earned the rank of Second Class.[3] After attending McKinley Elementary School in Bellwood and graduating from Proviso East High School in Maywood in 1952, he studied at Purdue University, where he became a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. After his sophomore year, he accepted a partial Navy ROTC scholarship that required him to serve aboard USS?Roanoke between his junior and senior years. In 1956, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering; his final GPA was 5.1 out of 6.0.[4]\\r\\nCernan's hobbies included love for horses, sports, hunting, fishing, and aviation.[5]\\r\\nCernan was commissioned a U.S. Navy Ensign through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps at Purdue, and was initially stationed on the USS Saipan. Cernan changed to active duty and attended flying training at Whiting Field, Baron Field, Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, and Naval Air Station Memphis.[6]:29ÿ31 Following flight training on the T-28 Trojan, T-33 Shooting Star, and F9F Panther, Cernan became a Naval Aviator, flying FJ-4 Fury and A-4 Skyhawk jets in Attack Squadrons 126 and 113.[6]:31ÿ33,38ÿ39 Upon completion of his assignment in Miramar, California, he finished his education in 1963 at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School with a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering.[5]\\r\\nDuring his naval career, Cernan logged more than 5,000 hours of flying time, including 4,800 hours in jet aircraft. Cernan also made 200 landings on aircraft carriers.[5]\\r\\nIn October 1963, NASA selected Cernan as one of the third group of astronauts to participate in the Gemini and Apollo space programs.[5]\\r\\nCernan was originally selected with Thomas Stafford as backup pilot for Gemini 9. When the prime crew was killed in the crash of NASA T-38A \\"901\\" (USAF serial 63-8181) at Lambert Field on February 28, 1966, the backup crew became the prime crewthe first time this happened.[7] Gemini 9A encountered a number of problems; the original target vehicle exploded during launch and the planned docking with a substitute target vehicle was made impossible by the failure of a protective shroud to separate after launch.[7] The crew, however, performed a rendezvous that simulated procedures that would be used in the Apollo 10 mission; the first optical rendezvous and a lunar-orbit-abort rendezvous. Cernan performed the second American EVAthe third-ever spacewalkbut overexertion caused by a lack of limb restraints prevented testing of the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit and forced the early termination of the spacewalk.[7] Cernan was also a backup pilot for the Gemini 12 mission.[8]\\r\\nCernan was selected for the lunar module pilot position on the backup crew for Apollo 7although that flight carried no lunar module.[9] Standard crew rotation put him in place as the Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 10the final dress rehearsal mission for the first Apollo lunar landingon May 18ÿ26, 1969. During the latter mission, Cernan and Apollo 10 Commander Tom Stafford piloted the Lunar Module Snoopy in lunar orbit to within 8.5 nautical miles (15.7?km) of the lunar surface, successfully executing every phase of a lunar landing up to final powered descent and providing NASA planners with critical knowledge of technical systems and lunar gravitational conditions to enable Apollo 11 to land on the Moon two months later.\\r\\nCernan turned down the opportunity to walk on the moon as Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 16, preferring to risk missing a flight for the opportunity to command his own mission.[10] Cernan moved back into the Apollo rotation as commander of the backup crew of Cernan, Ronald E. Evans, and Joe Engle for Apollo 14, putting him in position through normal crew rotation to command his own crew on Apollo 17. Escalating budget cutbacks for NASA, however, brought the number future lunar missions into question. After the cancellation of Apollo 15 in its original H class profile and Apollo 19 in September 1970, pressure from the scientific community to shift Harrison Schmitt, the sole professional geologist in the active Apollo roster of astronauts, to the crew of Apollo 17, the final surviving Apollo mission, mounted. In August 1971, NASA named Schmitt as the lunar module pilot for Apollo 17, which meant the original LM pilot Joe Engle never had the opportunity to walk on the Moon. Cernan fought to keep his crew together; given the choice of flying with Schmitt as LMP or seeing his entire crew removed from Apollo 17, Cernan chose to fly with Schmitt. Cernan eventually came to have a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities; he concluded that Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot while Englenotwithstanding his outstanding record as an aircraft test pilotwas merely an adequate one.[11]\\r\\nCernan's role as commander of Apollo 17 closed out the Apollo program's lunar exploration mission with a number of record-setting achievements. During the three days of Apollo 17's surface activity (Dec. 11-14, 1972), Cernan and Schmitt performed three EVAs for a total of about 22 hours of exploration of the TaurusÿLittrow valley. Their first EVA alone was more than three times the length astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin spent outside the LM on Apollo 11. During this time Cernan and Schmitt covered more than 35?km (22?mi) using the Lunar Rover and spent a great deal of time collecting geologic samples (including a record 34 kilograms (75?lb) of samples, the most of any Apollo mission) that would shed light on the Moon's early history. Cernan piloted the rover on its final sortie, recording a maximum speed of 11.2?mph (18.0?km/h), giving him the unofficial lunar land speed record.[12]\\r\\nAs Cernan prepared to climb the ladder for the final time, he spoke these words; currently the last spoken by a human standing on the Moon's surface:\\r\\nBob, this is Gene, and I'm on the surface; and, as I take man's last step from the surface, back home for some time to come ÿ but we believe not too long into the future ÿ I'd like to just (say) what I believe history will record: that America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow. And, as we leave the Moon at TaurusÿLittrow, we leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind. Godspeed the crew of Apollo 17.\\r\\nCernan's status as the last person to walk on the Moon means Purdue University is the alma mater of both the first person to walk on the MoonNeil Armstrongand the most recent. Cernan is one of only three astronauts to travel to the moon on two occasions; the others being Jim Lovell and John Young. As of 2018[update], he is also one of only twelve people to have walked on the Moon. Apollo 10 holds the record for the highest speed attained by any manned vehicle at 39,897?km/h (24,791?mph) during its return from the moon on May 26, 1969.[8]\\r\\nIn 1976, Cernan retired from the Navy with the rank of captain and went from NASA into private business, becoming Executive Vice President of Coral Petroleum Inc before starting his own company, The Cernan Corporation, in 1981.[5] From 1987 he was a contributor to ABC News and the weekly segment of its Good Morning America program titled \\"Breakthrough\\", which covered health, science, and medicine.[14]\\r\\nIn 1999, with co-author Donald A. Davis, he published his memoir The Last Man on the Moon, which is about his naval and NASA career. He is featured in the space exploration documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, in which he stated, \\"truth needs no defense\\" and \\"nobody can take those footsteps I made on the surface of the moon away from me\\".[15] Cernan also contributed to the book of the same name.\\r\\nCernan and Neil Armstrong testified before U.S. Congress in 2010 in opposition to the cancellation of the Constellation program, which had been initiated during the George W. Bush administration as part of the Vision for Space Exploration with the aim of returning humans to the Moon and eventually Mars, but was deemed underfunded and unsustainable by the Augustine Commission in 2009.[16]\\r\\nCernan paired his criticism of the cancellation of Constellation with expressions of skepticism about Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) and Commercial Crew Development (CCDev), NASA's planned replacements for that program's role in supplying cargo and crew to the International Space Station. Such companies, Cernan warned, \\"do not yet know what they dont know\\". Cernan's view of commercial space companiesin particular SpaceX, which participates in both programsunderwent a positive shift after being debriefed by SpaceX venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson as part of his effort to obtain the signatures of nine Apollo astronauts on a photograph meant as a gift to SpaceX founder Elon Musk to commemorate the first successful SpaceX cargo mission to the ISS in 2012. Eventually, Cernan was won over and signed the photograph; As I told him these stories of heroic entrepreneurship, I could see his mind turning, Jurvetson wrote; He found a reconciliation: I never read any of this in the news. Why doesnt the press report on this?' [17]\\r\\nIn 2016, Cernan appeared in the documentary The Last Man on the Moon, made by British filmmaker Mark Craig and based on Cernan's 1999 memoir of the same title.[18] The film received the Texas Independent Film Award from Houston Film Critics Society and the Movies for Grownups Award from AARP The Magazine.[19][20]\\r\\nCernan was married twice and had one daughter. His first wife was Barbara Jean Atchley, a flight attendant for Continental Airlines whom he married in 1961. They had one daughter, Tracy (born in 1963). The couple separated In 1980 and divorced in 1981. They remained friends.[21] His second marriage was to Jan Nanna Cernan, which lasted for nearly 30 years from 1987 until his death. Cernan gained two step-daughters, Kelly and Danielle.[22]\\r\\nCernan died in a hospital in Houston on January 16, 2017, at the age of 82.[23] He was buried with full military honors at Texas State Cemeterythe first astronaut to be buried thereduring a private service on January 25, 2017.[24][25]\\r\\nCernan was a member of several organizations: Fellow, American Astronautical Society; member, Society of Experimental Test Pilots; member, Tau Beta Pi (National Engineering Society), Sigma Xi (National Science Research Society), Phi Gamma Delta (National Social Fraternity), and The Explorers Club.[5]\\r\\nOn July 2, 1974, Cernan was a roaster of Don Rickles on The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast. At the end of the roast, Rickleswho attended the Apollo 17 launchpaid tribute to Cernan as a \\"delightful, wonderful, great hero\\".[33] Cernan was featured in the Discovery Channel's documentary miniseries When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions, talking about his involvement and missions as an astronaut.[34] In the 1998 Primetime Emmy Award-winning HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, he was portrayed by Daniel Hugh Kelly.[35]\\r\\nA popular belief is that Cernan wrote his daughter's initials on a rock on the moon. The story, and Cernan's relationship with his daughter, was later adapted into \\"Tracy's Song\\" by pop-rock band No More Kings. The story is inaccurate; Cernan did not write his daughter's initials on a rock. He states in the 2014 documentary The Last Man on the Moon that he wrote them in the lunar dust as he left the rover to return to the LEM and Earth.[36] The true story of leaving the initials on the lunar surface was prominently mentioned in the an episode of Modern Family.[37]\\r\\nA recording of Cernan's voice during the Apollo 17 mission was sampled by Daft Punk for \\"Contact\\", the last track on their 2013 album Random Access Memories.[38] Cernan's last words from the lunar surface, along with Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt's recollections, were used by the band Public Service Broadcasting for the song Tomorrow, the final track of their 2015 album The Race for Space.[39]","input":"Who was the last person on the moon?"},{"output":"Model 29","context":"The Smith & Wesson Model 29 is a six-shot, double-action revolver chambered for the .44 Magnum cartridge and manufactured by the United States company Smith & Wesson.\\r\\nThe Model 29 was offered with 3\\", 4\\", 5\\", 6\\", 6?\\", 8?\\" and, later, 10?\\" barrel lengths as standard models. Other barrel lengths were available either by special order from Smith & Wesson's Custom Shop or custom built by gunsmiths. The 5\\" barreled variant had a full length underlug. Finish options available included a highly polished blued or nickel-plated surface.\\r\\nAt the time of its introduction, the Model 29 was the most powerful production handgun. It was made famous by association with the fictional character \\"Dirty Harry\\" Callahan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Model 29 will chamber and fire .44 Special cartridges, as the .44 Magnum was developed from the .44 Special. The Magnum case is slightly longer to prevent magnum rounds from being chambered and fired in handguns chambered for the .44 Special.\\r\\nElmer Keith's achievements in maximizing the power and performance of the .44 Special was the inspiration and driving force behind the introduction of the .44 Magnum by Smith & Wesson. His intention for the new round was for it to be used in sidearms for hunters of large, dangerous game, rather than for self-defense, though with today's specialty cartridges, it can be a good defensive round.[1]\\r\\nS&W's production of a large N-frame revolver in .44 Magnum began in 1955; the Model 29 designation was applied in 1957.[2]\\r\\nAt the time of its introduction, the Model 29 was the most powerful production handgun. There were a number of custom calibers that were more powerful, as in the old Howdah pistols of the 19th century.\\r\\nIt remained primarily the province of handgun enthusiasts, some law enforcement personnel and hunters until 1971, when Clint Eastwood made it famous as \\"the most powerful handgun in the world\\" in the movie Dirty Harry. After the movie's release, retailers had trouble keeping the Model 29 in stock.[3]\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, Smith & Wesson discontinued production of many models of revolvers, including the 'basic' Model 29; since then, at various times, the model, in limited or 'custom' configurations, has been manufactured in as many as 10 evolutions.[4]\\r\\nThe original Model 29 was superseded by the Model 29-1 in 1960, with modifications made to the ejector-rod screw. The Model 29-2 replaced it the following year, with one screw that had secured the cylinder-stop spring being deleted. The barrel length was shortened from 6 1/2\\" to 6\\" in 1979. These two versions are known as \\"pinned and recessed\\". \\"Pinned\\" means that the barrels are screwed in, and secured by a pin driven through the frame and a notch in the barrel. \\"Recessed\\" denotes the rear of the bored cylinder holes being countersunk, so that, when loaded, the cartridge rims are fully enclosed by the cylinder. In 1982, the cost-cutting Model 29-3 dropped recessed cylinders and pinned barrels for crush-fit barrels.[2]\\r\\nThe -4 and -5, produced from 1988 and 1990 respectively had changes to improve durability for heavy use. In 1994 the 29-6 began production, now fitted as standard with rubber Monogrips from Hogue to replace the previous wooden items, standard tapped holes also being provided for attaching scope mounts. The 29-7 started production in 1998 with changes to the locking mechanism, the firing pin's attachment, and a hammer and trigger produced with a metal injection molding process.[2]\\r\\nIntroduced in 1978, the Smith & Wesson Model 629 is a stainless steel version of the Model 29.\\r\\nThe 629 model designation derives from Smith & Wesson's practice of denoting a stainless steel version of one of their already existing designs by placing a 6 in front of the model number of the original weapon. The 629 Classic variant features a full-length barrel underlug, other variants include the 629 Stealth Hunter.\\r\\nSome S&W model 29s were rebuilt by the AAI Corporation to make the Quiet Special Purpose Revolvers (QSPR). These had new, short, smoothbore barrels (35?mm / 1.375?inch), with .40\\" / 10mm bore, with cylinder chambers reamed to accept special QSPR ammunition which externally resembled metal-cased .410-gauge shotgun shells but internally worked as a piston to trap the gases. This special ammunition was made by AAI.[5]\\r\\nThis pistol was developed from 1967 to 1971 to be used by tunnel rats in the Vietnam War. The QSPR was tested on the battlefield in 1969, and an improvement and testing program ran from 1970 until 1971. At least officially it never entered service. The US withdrawal from Vietnam reduced interest in the QSPR weapon, and the program ended in about 1972.[5]\\r\\nA Russian handgun of more-recent vintage, the Ohs-38 Stechkin, is described as using a system virtually identical to that employed by the Quiet Special Purpose Revolver (QSPR).\\r\\nThe Mountain Gun was introduced in 1989 as a lightweight version of the Model 29 designed to be \\"carried often and shot little\\".[6] The barrel profile is a reprise of the original design.

Produced by Al Shux, Angela Hunte and Jane't Sewell-Ulepic, it was released as the third single from Jay-Z's 11th studio album, The Blueprint 3 (2009), by his Roc Nation label in October 2009. The song was written as a tribute to both artists' hometown, New York City, and features music samples of \\"Love on a Two-Way Street\\" performed by The Moments. The following month they submitted the song to Jay-Z's Roc Nation, whose reviews were a discouragement. Following an incident that Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic describe as an omen, they took the suggestion of an associate of EMI Music Publishing and resubmitted it to Jay-Z, who kept the \\"New York\\" singing part on the hook, changed the verses, and recorded it as a single.\\r\\nThe single was supposed to feature Hunte on the song's hook, but when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought anyone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested Keys. Mary J. Blige was also considered for the part, but Keys was chosen after Jay-Z heard the song's piano loop. Keys wrote the bridge of the song. The song was viewed as being an \\"orchestral rap ballad\\" and has pop-rap musical styles. It contains references to various locations in New York and its famous residents, while describing the city's essence. Profanity is present throughout the song and, although it is usually included during live performances, it was omitted during the performance at Game 2 of the 2009 World Series.\\r\\nA critical success, the song was included in multiple critics' top 10 list for the best songs of 2009; including Rolling Stone magazine and the New York Times. The song was also nominated for three Grammy Awards, winning Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. \\"Empire State of Mind\\" achieved commercial success worldwide. The track peaked within the top 10 in countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, Italy and Sweden. The single was commercially successful in the United States, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks, becoming Jay-Z's first number-one single on the chart as a lead artist. It appeared in 2009 year-end charts in Italy, Australia and the US, where the song was also the last number one hit of the 2000s. As of June 2014, the single has sold over 5.5 million copies in the United States.[1]\\r\\nIn the song's music video, which is primarily in black-and-white, Jay-Z and Keys are shown performing the song in various locations in New York. \\"Empire State of Mind\\" has been performed by Jay-Z and Keys multiple times, including during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2009 American Music Awards. Usually when the duo performs the song, an overhead screen shows images of places in New York. Keys recorded a sequel entitled \\"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\\", which is featured on her fourth studio album The Element of Freedom (2009). Her version was positively received by critics, reached the Top 10 in the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland charts, and peaked at number fifty-five on the Billboard Hot 100 without an official release. Keys said that she chose to record her own version of \\"Empire State of Mind\\" because she wanted to express her own personal feelings about New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Empire State of Mind\\" was created by singer-songwriter-producer Angela Hunte, a native of Brooklyn, along with writing partner Jane't \\"Jnay\\" Sewell-Ulepic. Hunte grew up in the same building where rapper and hip hop artist Jay-Z lived560 State Street, an address which is mentioned in the song.[2] The track's creation was inspired during an overseas trip Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic made to London in February 2009 when they were both feeling homesick.[2] Hunte was ill during that summer, while Sewell-Ulepic's mother was ill. Hunte recalls, \\"We said to ourselves, 'we complain so much about New Yorkabout the busy streets, about the crowds and the pushing, about the subway systembut I would trade that for anything right now.' Before we left the hotel that night, we knew we would write a song about our city.\\"[2] Although they wrote the song as a simple way to voice their feelings for their hometown, they sent it to the Roc Nation music label the following month in hope that Jay-Z would like it and record it. When they received negative reviews about the track they were convinced it would never be recorded.[2] However, in the summer of the same year, EMI Music Publishing's (EMI) Jon \\"Big Jon\\" Platt heard the track at a barbecue and fell in love with it, believing that \\"it would be perfect for Jay-Z\\".[2]\\r\\nHunte and Sewell-Ulepic were hesitant though, as they had sent the track for consideration already and been unsuccessful. According to Hunte, when a Notorious B.I.G. figure she kept by the computer fell over as they played the track for Platta statue that had never moved before regardless of how loud they've blasted musicshe realized it was an omen.[2] She commented, \\"We all just looked at each other like, 'if Biggie approves, then, send it to Jay'\\". The next day Platt sent it to Jay-Z and he \\"loved it and recorded it that night\\".[2] Hunte recalls, \\"We were just so happy he wanted to honor our work and our production. Two female producers/writers, and for him as a rapper to take our songthat's not a combination you see a lot. For him to be so open-minded about it, we just couldn't be any more grateful and thankful.\\"[2] Originally composed as a song to be sung,[3] Jay-Z ended up rewriting new verses inspired from the original lyrics and leaving Hunte on the song's hook. However, when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought someone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested R&B and soul artist Alicia Keys.[2] Hunte said, \\"She's never done a record with him and she also has my same vocal tone. She made the song sound so close to the original, She just nailed it and brought it home. It was a great choice.\\"[2] Keys also contributed to writing \\"Empire State of Mind\\"'s new bridge.[3]\\r\\nAlicia Keys, MTV News[4]\\r\\nJay-Z stated in an interview that after he first heard the track's piano loops (which are sampled from \\"Love on a Two-Way Street\\" by The Moments), he immediately thought of Keys and wanted her to be featured on the song. Jay-Z said that Mary J. Blige was initially considered for Keys' part on \\"Empire State of Mind\\"[5] and admitted that he was \\"two seconds away\\" from asking Blige to appear on the record's chorus. His second choice for the track's vocals was Keys and that using Blige on the song would have been a safe move, but said that the combination of Keys' sound and piano talent had struck a chord with him.[5] In December 2009 Hunte, who would not reveal many details, said the original version of \\"Empire State of Mind\\" will one day be released, adding that \\"The original is so powerful it's only a matter of time till you hear it down the line\\".[2]\\r\\n\\"Empire State of Mind\\" features rap verses from Jay-Z and vocals during the song's chorus from Keys. It is a rap hip hop song with influences of electropop and orchestral pop. The track also has pop-rap musical styles[6] and contains a music sample of the 1970 Billboard R&B chart-topping single \\"Love on a Two-Way Street\\" by The Moments,[7] the sample being the piano component that runs throughout the song. The song is played at a moderate tempo of 84 beats per minute[6] and is written in the key of F# major.[6] It has a sequence of F?ÿC?/BÿBÿF? as its chord progression, throughout the single Keys' vocal range changes from the register of A?3 to C?5.[6] Pete Cashmore of NME described Keys as having established \\"crashing piano chords\\" during her verses in the track.[8] Mariel Concepcion of Billboard magazine noted that the track has a \\"simple piano pattern\\".[9] Stephen Dalton of The Times described the song as an \\"orchestral rap ballad\\".[10]\\r\\nLyrically, the single opens with lyrics referencing locations in New York,[6] it name-checks notable neighborhoods and captures the city's essence; from attending Knicks basketball games to its famous residents.[11] Drug dealing references, \\"N-words\\", and profanity are also present throughout the song.[12][13] Raju Mudhar of the Toronto Star commented on the track's lyrics \\"I'm the new Sinatra/And since I made it here/I can make it anywhere/Yeah they love me everywhere\\" remarking \\"who can argue?\\" noting that he's \\"one of those waffling retirees\\", but is a living \\"hip hop legend\\".[14]\\r\\nJayson Rodriguez of MTV News felt that Keys \\"croons\\" on the track's chorus line, \\"I'm from Neeeeww Yooooork/These streets will make you feel brand-new/Bright lights will inspire you.\\"[15] Keys said that while recording the song she wanted to make sure she got the hook right explaining, \\"I did try it a couple of times, but it was more about capturing the kind of grand feeling of it. With the way I sang it the first time, I was actually kind of sick, and I knew that he needed the record, so I was like, 'Let me get to it.'\\" She added, \\"I came back and revisited it so that it could be what it is now[.] So it actually took a couple of times, but every time, the energy was just so high.\\"[4] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly felt that the singer who sings the song's hook has a \\"crucial role\\", believing that \\"Empire State of Mind\\" is a \\"smash that concert attendees expect Jay to play, and it just wouldn't work without a big, clear voice to sing that hook\\".[16] In November 2012, Keys said she was congested when she first recorded the vocals and had to redo them after Jay-Z said he wasn't satisfied with her original take.[17]\\r\\n\\"Empire State of Mind\\" received acclaim from contemporary music critics, with most reviewers praising Keys' vocal performance. Jon Bush of AllMusic listed the song as being a highlight from The Blueprint 3. He commented that the song is Jay-Z's \\"king of crossovers ... a New York flag-waver with plenty of landmark name-dropping that turns into a great anthem with help on the chorus from Alicia Keys\\".[18] Los Angeles Times writer Greg Kot commended Jay-Z for his ability to perform with cameos and called the song \\"the sound of Jay-Z cruising for pop hits.\\"[19] Pete Cashmore of NME described Alicia Keys's cameo as \\"lusty bellowing\\".[8] Martin Andrew of PopMatters called the song \\"yet another chance\\" for Jay-Z to show his respect to New York, but commented that it \\"remains interesting thanks to a fantastic Al Shux beat and celebratory hook from Alicia Keys.\\"\\r\\nWriting in Rolling Stone magazine, Jody Rosen called it a \\"pallid New York shout-out\\".[20] USA Today's Steve Jones perceived a maturity by Jay-Z in the song, writing that \\"The upper-crust landmarks he now references are a far cry from the grimy Marcy Projects sights that he once detailed, something that perhaps is to be expected from the self-described 'new Sinatra'.\\"[21] The Daily Telegraph described the song's sound as \\"anthemic club pop\\" and called Keys's chorus line a \\"singalong\\".[22] Shannon Barbour of About.com called \\"Empire State of Mind\\" the album's apex, while commending Keys for her \\"excellent display of some unusually strong vocals\\".[23] Slant Magazine writer William McBee described it as a \\"glittering paean to the Big Apple\\" with Keys \\"soaring skyscraper-level on the hook and Jay putting on for his city.\\"[24]\\r\\nIGN music reviewer Chris Carle described Keys as having \\"soaring vocals\\" in the song.[25] New York Post writer Ryan Brockington called \\"Empire State of Mind\\" his favorite song from The Blueprint 3[26] and Tyler Gray from the same publication said \\"Empire State of Mind\\" was the \\"most soulful\\" song on the album.[27] Francois Marchand of the Vancouver Sun called the song \\"shiver-inducing\\".[28] The Times writer Stephen Dalton called the track a \\"heartfelt love letter to New York City,\\" with Jay-Z playing the \\"hip-hop Sinatra\\" over Keys' \\"luscious\\" chorus,[10] and The Guardian's Alexis Petridis described its chorus as \\"incredible, breezy pop\\".[29] Killan Fox of the same publication felt that the track was a \\"terrific homage\\" to New York and listed the song as being one of the \\"really good tracks\\" on The Blueprint 3.[30] Pitchfork's Ian Cohen stated that \\"the piledriver hooks of \\"Run This Town\\" and \\"Empire State of Mind\\" are content to annoy their way to ubiquity\\".[31]\\r\\n\\"Empire State of Mind\\" has been included in multiple music critics list for the best songs of 2009. The single was ranked the 8th best song of 2009 by MTV, the second-best song of 2009 by Rolling Stone magazine, and was voted the best single of 2009 by The Village Voice's 37th annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll.[32][33][34] On the 2010 Pazz & Jop list, the song was, along with a number of other songs, ranked at 226.[35] Jon Pareles of The New York Times placed \\"Empire State of Mind\\" at number three on his list of the top songs of 2009, and Pitchfork also ranked it at number 44 on its The Top 100 Tracks of 2009 list.[36][37] Entertainment Weekly placed it number one on its list of \\"The 10 Best Singles of 2009\\".[38] \\"Empire State of Mind\\" was placed at number six on NME's Albums and Tracks of the Year, 2009 list.[39] It was placed at number nine on PopMatters' list of \\"The Best Singles of 2009\\" and at number twelve on Consequence of Sound's list of \\"The Top 50 Songs of '09\\".[40][41] The song appears at number one on Rap-Up's list of the 25 best songs of 2009.[42] Jay-Z, a long-time fan of the New York Yankees, said that he was elated that his songs, namely \\"Empire State of Mind\\" and \\"Run This Town\\", had been played during different Yankee player's batting at home games in the 2009 World Series, commenting that it was \\"incredible\\" and \\"beyond explanation\\" to hear his music being played during Yankee games.[43] New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg commented that \\"Empire State of Mind\\" had become \\"one of the newest anthems of the Yankees\\".[44] The New York Daily News included it at number ten on its list of \\"The 10 best songs about New York\\".[45]\\r\\nAt the 53rd Grammy Awards ceremony the track won Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best Rap Song.

According to Billboard magazine, the song was the 15th biggest hit by two recording artists for all time.[58]\\r\\nThe single sold 205,000 digital copies in the US in its opening week and its highest week sale was of 360,000 in December 2009.[59] \\"Empire State of Mind\\" has also peaked at number one on the Billboard component chart for the sales of legal digital downloads on October 3, 2009,[60] as well as topping the Billboard component chart for singles with the most radio airplay throughout the country for eight consecutive weeks from November 28 to January 23, 2010.[61] The track also peaked at the top position on the R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart for three consecutive weeks,[62] as well as topping the Billboard Rap Songs chart for nine consecutive weeks.[63] After five months of release \\"Empire State of Mind\\" was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for the shipment of over 3,000,000 units in the US.[64] By August 2012, the single has reached its 5 millionth sales mark in the US,[65] and as of June 2014, the song has sold 5,513,000 copies in the US.[1]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom the track debuted at number fifteen and, in the two succeeding weeks, the single peaked at number two,[66] having been held from the top position by Taio Cruz's \\"Break Your Heart\\".[67] \\"Empire State of Mind\\" peaked at number three on the Canadian Hot 100 and was listed as being the top digital gainer on December 12.[68] The song peaked at number four in Australia,[69] and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for the shipment of 35,000 units in the country.[70] \\"Empire State of Mind\\" was also included in Australia's 2009 year-end music chart at number 64.[71] In New Zealand the song peaked at number six.[69] Furthermore, the single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) for the shipment of over 7,500 units in New Zealand.[72] The single debuted at number 18 in France, eventually peaking at number eight in the following three weeks.[69] It also peaked at number four in Belgium's Flemish and French charts.[69] The song also peaked within the top 10 positions in the music charts of Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Finland, the Netherlands, and Sweden.[69] In Italy \\"Empire State of Mind\\" was certified multi-platinum.[73] \\"Empire State of Mind\\"'s least commercially successful charting territories were Austria, Brazil, and Spain; peaking at number 13, 17, and 27 respectively.[69][74] The song has been featured in trailers for Sex and the City 2.\\r\\nThe music video for \\"Empire State of Mind\\" was directed by Hype Williams.[75] The video, which was filmed on location, features black-and-white images of New York City intercut with full-color shots of Jay-Z and Keys performing in Times Square.[75] \\"Empire State of Mind\\"'s music video began filming on September 29, in Tribeca and around Ground Zero,[75] and was released on October 30, 2009. Keys praised the music video and said that the video has all the key elements of a homage to her hometown.[75]\\r\\nThe music video opens with black and white images of locations in New York being shown in the form of a slideshow. The slideshow is then intercut with a black and white clip of Jay-Z, wearing a Yankees cap and a vest with no sleeves, performing the song on a street in front of apartment buildings. Then the video begins to rotate from images of New York being shown briefly, to clips of Jay-Z singing \\"Empire State of Mind\\" in several locations with different outfits. Images shown include a monument to John D. Rockefeller, Jr., street signs and stairwells leading to subway stations.\\r\\nNext we see black and white clips of Keys, who is wearing large hoop-earrings with high heels, a black shirt and pants, playing a Yamaha piano that has an image of the Statue of Liberty on it. She is singing her verse of the song in a street at night while cars drive by. Keys' performance is then intercut with aerial views of skyscrapers and clips of the Yankee Stadium, clips of the New York Police, and NYPD cars and logos. Some people, such as ones who are walking around New York or wearing Yankee emblems, have their faces shown or blurred out. Keys and Jay-Z, both wearing sunglasses at night, are then shown performing the song together as the video continues to be intercut with clips of them performing \\"Empire State of Mind\\" individually, as well as images of New York. The video ends with color vision of the duo performing at night on the red glass steps forming the roof of the TKTS pavilion in Times Square. Interspersed are clips of Keys playing piano and views of the New York skyline.\\r\\nJay-Z's Lifestyle blog came out with an alternative video which features supermodels lip-syncing to the song in various locations in Manhattan.[76][77] The video was directed by Justin Wu.[78] The New York Observer wrote of the video that \\"[w]e're not sure exactly what this video is promoting\\" but \\"the caliber of the cast's sheer ubiquity is impressive\\".[79] A blogger on Yahoo Music commented that the models \\"do a better job modeling clothes than miming Jigga\\", but concluded, however, that the video is \\"without a doubt the greatest lip-dub ever committed to video\\".[80]\\r\\n\\"Empire State of Mind\\" was first performed at Jay-Z's \\"Answer the Call\\" benefit concert in Madison Square Garden on September 11, 2009,[81] where it was the opening song.[82] All ticket proceeds from the show went to the New York Police and Fire Widows and Children's Fund.[82] The song was then performed live at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards (MTV VMA) on September 13, 2009, where it closed the awards show.[83] The VMA performance was the first time Jay-Z and Keys performed the song together.[81] Shaheem Redi of MTV News commented on the performance that, \\"Their set was elegant and 'hood at the same time, and it was such a powerful moment\\".[84] Ryan Brockington of the New York Post wrote \\"Alicia's buttery voice and Jay-Z's impeccable stage presence made for an audio adrenaline overload\\" and placed the performance third on his list of the \\"top six performances\\" from the MTV VMAs.[26] For the performance Jay-Z wore his signature Yankees cap[81] and Keys wore all black while playing the piano. During the MTV VMA performance images of locations in New York, such as the Empire State Building and the Apollo Theatre, were shown on an overhead screen behind Jay-Z and Keys. Towards the end of the performance rapper Lil' Mama got up onto the stage uninvited and posed with Jay-Z and Keys while they were finishing the final verse of the track.[85] Lil' Mama said she did not mean to disrespect either performer but the song had her \\"emotions running high\\", adding that \\"in that moment I came up onstage to celebrate my two icons singing about NY.\\"[83] Keys responded to the incident saying \\"We can appreciate her being overwhelmed and inspired, but we would have appreciated it if she would have done it from her seat\\", and Jay-Z added, \\"It was a lot of planning that went into that performance. To disrupt that was outta line.\\"[86] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said that the duo \\"brought some genuine street heat to the tongue-twisting torrents\\" of \\"Empire State of Mind\\". She added that \\"Keys, on piano and soaring chorus, brought the feminine strength and soul.\\"[87]\\r\\nJay-Z was due to perform \\"Empire State of Mind\\" with Keys during the opening game of the baseball 2009 World Series in early October 2009 but, due to an inclement weather, the duo did not perform.[88] They ultimately performed the song live in the Yankee Stadium before Game 2 of the 2009 World Series in mid-October.[89][90] The two musicians performed the song on a custom-made stage adorned with Yankees flags,[89] while images of New York City flashed across several large screens throughout the stadium.[90] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News wrote of the performance, \\"If the Yankees were looking to change their tune heading into Game 2 of the World Series, they couldn't have picked better musical guests.\\"[90] During most live performances of the track, the lyrics containing profanity are included in the song, but they were omitted for the World Series set.[12][13] On November 5, 2009, Jay-Z and Keys sang \\"Empire State of Mind\\" at the MTV Europe Music Awards (EMA) in Berlin, Germany, while performing in front of a New York cityscape.[91] Jocelyn Vena and Eric Ditzian of MTV News noted that Jay-Z \\"took his hometown pride rather seriously\\" during the performance.[91] Jay-Z also performed the song at the Yankees' World Series victory ceremonies in New York City Hall on November 6, 2009. Keys was not in attendance for the performance, so singer and Roc Nation recording artist Bridget Kelly filled in.[44] As the last verse of the song was sung, Yankee members got up from their seats to shower Jay-Z with handshakes and hugs.[44]\\r\\nThe single was also performed by Jay-Z and Keys at the American Music Awards (AMA) on November 22, 2009.[92] They began their performance of \\"Empire State of Mind\\" with a rendition of Frank Sinatra's \\"New York, New York\\".[92] Keys played on a piano on a stage with blue lights in front of a backdrop that had tall buildings. Also, the words \\"New York\\" scrolled across screens on the stage.[93] Towards the end of the song, Keys sang with Jay-Z at the front of the stage while holding up a \\"I love you\\" sign.[93] Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times felt that the song had \\"worn out its welcome\\", and gave the performance a letter grade \\"D\\".[94] However, Jeremy Blacklow of Access Hollywood had a more positive feeling towards the performance, describing it as being \\"so great\\" in his live blog for the award ceremony.[95] \\"Empire State of Mind\\" was performed by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys at the 2010 BRIT Awards on February 16, 2010.[96] The Guardian wrote that Jay-Z and Alicia Keys \\"dazzled with their rendition of \\"Empire State of Mind\\"\\".[97] The Daily Mail commented on the performance that it was \\"a rare highlight in a show of lowlights\\".[98] According to Metro, Jay-Z and Alicia Keys \\"blew the place away\\" with their performance and \\"Jay-Z was given a welcome befitting a cultural hero\\" while \\"Keys oozed elegance and soul as her startlingly powerful voice stopped everyone in their tracks\\".[99] The Nation opined that the pair \\"delivered a powerful rendition\\" of the song.[100]\\r\\nIn March, Jay-Z joined Keys onstage during one of her Freedom Tours New York concerts to perform \\"Empire State of Mind\\", while images of New York were shown throughout the concert arena.[101] Jay-Z performed \\"Empire State of Mind\\" as well as three of his other singles, at California's Coachella music festival in April 2010.[102] Jay-Z performed the song live on an episode of Saturday Night Live on May 9, 2010. Jay-Z performed the song with a medley of his other singles, including \\"On to the Next One\\".[103][104] Jay-Z wore a white T-shirt with a black leather vest while performing the song on a stage light by blue lights, with musicians playing instruments in the far back. Caitlyn Millat of San Diego's NBC felt that Jay-Z \\"brought the house down\\" during his performances of the melodies.[103] Rodriguez of MTV News said that Bridget Kelly, who sang Keys' part, \\"turned more than a few heads\\" because the outfit she was wearing was \\"tighter than her boss' rhyme\\".[105]\\r\\nJay-Z and Keys performed the song during Keys' Here in Times Square concert special, televised on BET.[106][107]\\r\\nFollowing the release of \\"Empire State of Mind\\" in January 2010, Keys stated that she was planning to release a second version of the song as a single the following month, featuring only her vocals.[108] The track, entitled \\"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\\", appeared on Keys' fourth studio album The Element of Freedom which was released in December 2009. The original version, entitled \\"Empire State of Mind Part 2\\", included both Keys' vocals and a new rap verse from Jay-Z,[109] but the final product did not include Jay-Z.[110] Discussing the record, Keys said that it acts as a dichotomy of strength and vulnerability, commenting that \\"The music is really strong, and the drums are really aggressive, but my voice is vulnerable and delicate\\".[108]\\r\\n\\"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\\" was generally well received by contemporary music critics in their reviews for The Element of Freedom.[112][113][114] Allison Stewart of The Washington Post noted that the track, which is a pop ballad, had replaced \\"Empire State of Mind\\" sports team references and ruminations with \\"even milder and less controversial string of generalities\\", highlighting Keys' version's lyrics \\"If I could make it here/I could make it anywhere\\".[115] The song peaked at number four in the United Kingdom,[116] number forty on the Canadian Hot 100,[117] and number sixty-nine in Sweden.[118] It also debuted on the Billboard R&B charts at number seventy-seven and peaked at number fifty-five on the Billboard Hot 100 without an official release.[119]\\r\\nComedy website CollegeHumor parodied the song in a video titled \\"Galactic Empire State of Mind\\" which re-writes the lyrics to follow the events of the first three Star Wars films from the perspective of Darth Vader.[120] The video has been viewed nearly four million times on YouTube.[121]\\r\\nThe music video for \\"Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind)\\" parodies the song, replacing references to the \\"Empire State\\" of New York with of the smaller Welsh city of Newport. In the Welsh language Ymerodraeth means \\"empire\\". \\"Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind)\\" was directed by British filmmaker M-J Delaney and featured London-based actors Alex Warren and Terema Wainwright, rapping and singing respectively.[122] Days after its release Delaney said: \\"I hope Jay-Z and Alicia get to see the video as long as their publishing people don't force us to take it offline. It's only tongue in cheek.\\"[123] Its participants were invited to appear on national television news and their work was reported in national newspapers. Their work was also so well received in Wales that they were invited to the reopening of the Newport Transporter Bridge.[123] It achieved viral video status when it reached nearly a million hits in 3 days and, by August 2010, nearly 2.5?million people had watched it on YouTube.[123] In July both Warren and Wainwright met with Universal Records (the music publishers)[124] to discuss releasing the track as a single, with some of the proceeds going to the mental health charity Newport Mind. But the seven co-writers of \\"Empire State of Mind\\" refused to give permission for the Newport single, a situation which led to the video being removed from YouTube on August 10.[125]\\r\\n\\"Empire State of Mind\\" was covered by the cast of the US television series Glee for the second season premiere episode \\"Audition\\" on September 21, 2010. In the episode the fictional William McKinley High School glee club, upon learning that Nationals will be held in New York, decide to perform \\"Empire State of Mind\\" at the school courtyard, in the hopes it will pique the interest of their schoolmates. MTV's Kyle Anderson felt that the choreography of \\"Empire State of Mind\\" compensated for any awkwardness in its delivery.[126] Aly Semigran, also writing for the same publication, thought the cast's performance was lacking the gravitas of the original version, but reported that Keys had deemed the Glee cover \\"amazing\\".[127] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post found the song's performance to be \\"maybe-trying-too-hard\\".[128] Music critic Tom Stack, of Entertainment Weekly, had a more positive assessment of Glee's take on it in the episode, stating that from the wardrobe to the choreography, it was \\"spectacular\\" and elating. He gave it a letter grade of \\"A\\".[129] MTV Buzzworthy wrote that \\"[t]hings get a little dicey when the male cast members make their way through Jay's rapped first verse\\".[130] Glee's cover version was released as a single and debuted at number twenty-one on the Billboard Hot 100, taking the title for biggest jump of that week.[131] It also charted number twenty in Australia.[132]\\r\\nIn 2010, American alternative dance band LCD Soundsystem played \\"Empire State of Mind\\" in concert, performing a verse of the song as a duet between James Murphy and keyboardist Nancy Whang.[133][134] In May 2011, at 64th Cannes Film Festival, British singer-songwriter Jamie Cullum performed a piano medley of Frank Sinatra's \\"New York, New York\\" and \\"Empire State of Mind\\" in honour of Robert De Niro.[135][136] In February 2012, British singer Ed Sheeran did a soulful acoustic rendition of the song at BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.[137] Sheeran later sang it as a duet with Jason Mraz at the Jingle Ball Viewing Party in December 2012.[138] In April 2012, British glam rock band Sweet released an updated version of the Hello and Ace Frehley hit single \\"New York Groove\\" that incorporated the chorus of \\"Empire State of Mind\\" into its own chorus.[139]\\r\\nThe song was also parodied in The Simpsons episode \\"The Food Wife\\" as \\"Bloggin' a Food Blog\\", sung by Tim Heidecker, Eric Wareheim and Carmen Carter.\\r\\nNeil Patrick Harris, Audra McDonald, and Lin-Manuel Miranda performed a parody of \\"Empire State of Mind\\" to close the 67th Tony Awards, with modified lyrics to recap the awards show.","input":"Who wrote the song new york alicia keys?"},{"output":"during indigenous rule in early antiquity","context":"Petra (Arabic: ???????, Al-Batr?; Ancient Greek: ?ϫ), originally known as Raqmu (Nabataean Arabic: ??????), is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. Petra lies on the slope of Jabal Al-Madbah in a basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of Arabah valley that run from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Established possibly as early as the 4th century BC as the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.[3]\\r\\nThe trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue, and Petra became the focus of their wealth. The earliest recorded historical reference to the city was when an envious Greek dynasty attempted to ransack the city in 312 BC. The Nabataeans were, unlike their enemies, accustomed to living in the barren deserts. And so were able to repel attacks by utilizing the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture and stone carving. The Kingdom's capital continued to flourish until the 1st century AD when its famous Al-Khazneh facade was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.\\r\\nEncroaching troops of the Roman Empire in 106 AD forced the Nabataeans to surrender. The Romans annexed and renamed the Kingdom to Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after a 363 earthquake destroyed many structures. The Byzantine Era witnessed the construction of several Christian churches. By 700, the city became an abandoned place where only a handful of nomads grazed goats. It remained an unknown place until it was rediscovered by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1812, sparking renewed interest in the city.[4]\\r\\nThe city is famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system. Another name for Petra is the Rose City due to the color of the stone out of which it is carved. It is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction.[5] It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has described it as \\"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPliny the Elder and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Tadeanos and the center of their caravan trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream, Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in the west, to Bosra and Damascus in the north, to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea, and across the desert to the Persian Gulf.\\r\\nExcavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial oasis. The area is visited by flash floods, and archaeological evidence demonstrates the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of dams, cisterns and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.[7][8]\\r\\nIn ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun (\\"Aaron's Mountain\\"), the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial-place of Aaron, brother of Moses. Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge (in places only 3ÿ4?m (9.8ÿ13.1?ft) wide) called the Siq (\\"the shaft\\"), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa. At the end of the narrow gorge stands Petra's most elaborate ruin, Al Khazneh (popularly known as and meaning \\"the Treasury\\"), hewn into the sandstone cliff. While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumored to be hidden within it.[9]\\r\\nA little further from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called en-Nejr, is a massive theatre, positioned so as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view. At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect. The amphitheatre has been cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-colored mountain walls, divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers.\\r\\nBy 2010 BC, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in Beidha, a pre-pottery settlement just north of Petra.[10] Petra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters as Pel, Sela or Seir. Though the city was founded relatively late, a sanctuary has existed there since very ancient times. The Jewish historian, Josephus (ca. 37ÿ100), describes the region as inhabited by the Madianite nation as early as 1340 BC, and that the nation was governed by five kings, whom he names: \\"Rekem; the city which bears his name ranks highest in the land of the Arabs and to this day is called by the whole Arabian nation, after the name of its royal founder, Rekeme: called Petra by the Greeks.\\"[11] The famed architecture of Petra, and other Nabataean sites, was built during indigenous rule in early antiquity.\\r\\nThe Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water.[12] They became familiar with their area as seasons passed, and they struggled to survive during bad years when seasonal rainfall diminished.[12] Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by modern scholars. Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian tribe.[13]\\r\\nThe Semitic name of the city, if not Sela, remains unknown. The passage in Diodorus Siculus (xix. 94ÿ97) which describes the expeditions which Antigonus sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BC is understood to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the \\"petra\\" (rock) referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name and the description implies that the metropolis was not yet in existence, although its place was used by Arabians.[14]\\r\\nThe name \\"Rekem\\" was inscribed in the rock wall of the Wadi Musa opposite the entrance to the Siq.[15] However, Jordan built a bridge over the wadi and this inscription was buried beneath tons of concrete.[16]\\r\\nIn AD 106, when Cornelius Palma was governor of Syria, the part of Arabia under the rule of Petra was absorbed into the Roman Empire as part of Arabia Petraea and became its capital. The native dynasty came to an end but the city continued to flourish under Roman rule. It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road was built. A century later, in the time of Alexander Severus, when the city was at the height of its splendor, the issue of coinage comes to an end. There is no more building of sumptuous tombs, owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe, such as an invasion by the neo-Persian power under the Sassanid Empire. Meanwhile, as Palmyra (fl. 130ÿ270) grew in importance and attracted the Arabian trade away from Petra, the latter declined. It appears, however, to have lingered on as a religious centre. Another Roman road was constructed at the site. Epiphanius of Salamis (c.315ÿ403) writes that in his time a feast was held there on December 25 in honor of the virgin Khaabou (Chaabou) and her offspring Dushara (Panarion LI, 22:9-12[17]). Dushara and al-Uzza were two of the main deities of the city, which otherwise included many idols from other Nabatean deities such as Allat and Manat.[18]\\r\\nPetra declined rapidly under Roman rule, in large part from the revision of sea-based trade routes. In 363 an earthquake destroyed many buildings, and crippled the vital water management system.[19] The last inhabitants abandoned the city (further weakened by another major earthquake in 551) when the Arabs conquered the region in 663.[citation needed] The old city of Petra was the capital of the Byzantine province of Palaestina III and many churches were excavated in and around Petra from the Byzantine era. In one of them more than 150 papyri were discovered which contained mainly contracts.[citation needed] The ruins of Petra were an object of curiosity during the Middle Ages and were visited by Sultan Baibars of Egypt towards the end of the 13th century.\\r\\nThe first European to describe them was Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt during his travels in 1812.[20] At that time, the Greek Church of Jerusalem operated a diocese in Al Karak named Battra (????? in Arabic, and ?ϫ? in Greek) and it was the opinion among the clergy of Jerusalem that Kerak was the ancient city of Petra.[20]\\r\\nThe Scottish painter David Roberts visited Petra in 1839, and returned to England with sketches and stories of the encounter with local tribes.\\r\\nBecause the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and many treasures were stolen. In 1929, a four-person team, consisting of British archaeologists Agnes Conway and George Horsfield, Palestinian physician and folklore expert Dr Tawfiq Canaan and Dr Ditlef Nielsen, a Danish scholar, excavated and surveyed Petra.[21]\\r\\nNumerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Winged Lion Temple in Petra in December 1993.[22]\\r\\nIn October 1917, as part of a general effort to divert Ottoman military resources away from the British advance before the Third Battle of Gaza, a revolt of Arabs in Petra was led by British Army officer T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) against the Ottoman regime. The Bedouin women living in the vicinity of Petra and under the leadership of Sheik Khallil's wife were gathered to fight in the revolt of the city. The rebellions, with the support of British military, were able to devastate the Ottoman forces.[23]\\r\\nThe Bidoul/ Bidul or Petra Bedouin were forcibly resettled from their cave dwellings in Petra to Umm Sayhoun/ Um Seihun by the Jordanian government in 1985, prior to the UNESCO designation process. Here, they were provided with block-built housing with some infrastructure including in particular a sewage and drainage system. Among the six communities in the Petra Region, Umm Sayhoun is one of the smaller communities. The village of Wadi Musa is the largest in the area, inhabited largely by the Layathnah Bedouin, and is now the closest settlement to the visitor centre, the main entrance via the Siq and the archaeological site generally. Umm Sayhoun gives access to the 'back route' into the site, the Wadi Turkmaniyeh pedestrian route.[24]\\r\\nOn December 6, 1985, Petra was designated a World Heritage Site. In a popular poll in 2007, it was also named one of the New7Wonders of the World.\\r\\nThe Bidouls belong to one of the Bedu tribes whose cultural heritage and traditional skills were proclaimed by UNESCO on the Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2005 and inscribed[25] in 2008.\\r\\nIn 2011, following an 11-month project planning phase, the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority in Association with DesignWorkshop and JCP s.r.l published a Strategic Master Plan that guides planned development of the Petra Region. This is intended to guide planned development of the Petra Region in an efficient, balanced and sustainable way over the next 20 years for the benefit of the local population and of Jordan in general. As part of this, a Strategic Plan was developed for Umm Sayhoun and surrounding areas.[26]\\r\\nThe process of developing the Strategic Plan considered the area's needs from five points of view:\\r\\n27 sites in Petra are now available on Google Street View.[27]\\r\\nIn 2016, archaeologists discovered a large, previously unknown monumental structure buried beneath the sands of Petra using satellite imagery.[28][29][30]\\r\\nThe site suffers from a host of threats, including collapse of ancient structures, erosion from flooding and improper rainwater drainage, weathering from salt upwelling,[31] improper restoration of ancient structures and unsustainable tourism.[32] The last has increased substantially, especially since the site received widespread media coverage in 2007 during the New Seven Wonders of the World Internet and cellphone campaign.[33]\\r\\nIn an attempt to reduce the impact of these threats, the Petra National Trust (PNT) was established in 1989. It has worked with numerous local and international organizations on projects that promote the protection, conservation, and preservation of the Petra site.[34] Moreover, UNESCO and ICOMOS recently collaborated to publish their first book on human and natural threats to the sensitive World Heritage sites. They chose Petra as its first and the most important example of threatened landscapes. A book released in 2012, Tourism and Archaeological Heritage Management at Petra: Driver to Development or Destruction?, was the first in a series of important books to address the very nature of these deteriorating buildings, cities, sites, and regions.[35] The next books in the series of deteriorating UNESCO World Heritage Sites will include Machu Picchu, Angkor Wat, and Pompeii.\\r\\nThe Nabataeans worshipped Arab gods and goddesses during the pre-Islamic era as well as a few of their deified kings. One, Obodas I, was deified after his death. Dushara was the primary male god accompanied by his three female deities: Al-Uzz, Allat and Mant. Many statues carved in the rock depict these gods and goddesses. New evidence indicates that broader Edomite, and Nabataean theology had strong links to Earth-Sun relationships, often manifested in the orientation of prominent Petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets.[36]\\r\\nA stele dedicated to Qos-Allah 'Qos is Allah' or 'Qos the god', by Qosmilk (melech ÿ king) is found at Petra (Glueck 516). Qos is identifiable with Kaush (Qaush) the God of the older Edomites. The stele is horned and the seal from the Edomite Tawilan near Petra identified with Kaush displays a star and crescent (Browning 28), both consistent with a moon deity. It is conceivable that the latter could have resulted from trade with Harran (Bartlett 194). There is continuing debate about the nature of Qos (qaus ÿ bow) who has been identified both with a hunting bow (hunting god) and a rainbow (weather god) although the crescent above the stele is also a bow.\\r\\nNabatean inscriptions in Sinai and other places display widespread references to names including Allah, El and Allat (god and goddess), with regional references to al-Uzza, Baal and Manutu (Manat) (Negev 11). Allat is also found in Sinai in South Arabian language. Allah occurs particularly as Garm-'allahi ÿ god dedided (Greek Garamelos) and Aush-allahi ÿ 'gods covenant' (Greek Ausallos). We find both Shalm-lahi 'Allah is peace' and Shalm-allat, 'the peace of the goddess'. We also find Amat-allahi 'she-servant of god' and Halaf-llahi 'the successor of Allah'.[37]\\r\\nThe Monastery, Petra's largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC. It was dedicated to Obodas I and is believed to be the symposium of Obodas the god. This information is inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the translation of the Arabic \\"Ad Deir\\").\\r\\nChristianity found its way to Petra in the 4th century AD, nearly 500 years after the establishment of Petra as a trade center. Athanasius mentions a bishop of Petra (Anhioch. 10) named Asterius. At least one of the tombs (the \\"tomb with the urn\\"?) was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration \\"in the time of the most holy bishop Jason\\" (447). After the Islamic conquest of 629ÿ632 Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way to Islam. During the First Crusade Petra was occupied by Baldwin I of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and formed the second fief of the barony of Al Karak (in the lordship of Oultrejordain) with the title Chateau de la Vale de Moyse or Sela. It remained in the hands of the Franks until 1189. It is still a titular see of the Catholic Church.[38]\\r\\nTwo Crusader-period castles are known in and around Petra. The first is al-Wu'ayra and is situated just north of Wadi Musa. It can be viewed from the road to \\"Little Petra\\". It is the castle of Valle Moise which was seized by a band of Turks with the help of local Muslims and only recovered by the Crusaders after they began to destroy the olive trees of Wadi Musa. The potential loss of livelihood led the locals to negotiate surrender. The second is on the summit of el-Habis in the heart of Petra and can be accessed from the West side of the Qasr al-Bint.\\r\\nAccording to Arab tradition, Petra is the spot where Moses (Musa) struck a rock with his staff and water came forth, and where Moses' brother, Aaron (Harun), is buried, at Mount Hor, known today as Jabal Haroun or Mount Aaron. The Wadi Musa or \\"Wadi of Moses\\" is the Arab name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited. A mountaintop shrine of Moses' sister Miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time of Jerome in the 4th century, but its location has not been identified since.[39]\\r\\nLiterature\\r\\nIt seems no work of Man's creative hand,\\r\\nBut from the rock as if by magic grown,\\r\\nNot virgin-white like that old Doric shrine,\\r\\nNot saintly-grey, like many a minster fane,\\r\\nBut rose-red as if the blush of dawn,\\r\\nThe hues of youth upon a brow of woe,\\r\\nMatch me such marvel save in Eastern clime,\\r\\nFilms\\r\\nTV\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic and music videos\\r\\nVideo games\\r\\nThe Siiq, path to Petra\\r\\nThe end of the Siq, with its dramatic view of Al Khazneh (\\"The Treasury\\")\\r\\nPetra is known as the Rose-Red City[52] for the colour of the rocks from which Petra is carved\\r\\nAd Deir (\\"The Monastery\\") in 1839, by David Roberts\\r\\nThe Petra Visitors Centre in Wadi Musa, the closest town to the historic site\\r\\nSandstone Rock-cut tombs (Kokhim) in Petra\\r\\nByzantine mosaic in the Byzantine Church of Petra\\r\\nObelisk Tomb and the Triclinium\\r\\nThe Silk Tomb\\r\\nJuniperus phoenicea in Petra\\r\\nLonely cave\\r\\nSandstone rocks in Siq\\r\\nMain entrance (Al Khazneh)\\r\\nTheatre\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nBibliography","input":"When was the lost city of petra built?"},{"output":"Tom Perez","context":"","input":"Who is the president of the democratic party?"},{"output":"marijuana","context":"see below\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Kennedy and Heidi\\" is the 83rd episode of the HBO television series The Sopranos, the sixth episode of the second half of the show's sixth season, and the 18th episode of the season overall.

Tony exits the wreckage with minor injuries, but Chris is seriously injured and has difficulty breathing. He tells Tony to call a taxi for him as he will not pass a drug test. Tony begins to call for help, but after noticing that a tree branch has impaled Chris' vehicle directly where his daughter's baby seat was located, Tony suffocates him by pinching his nose shut before calling an ambulance.

Ireland's climate is defined as a temperate oceanic climate, or Cfb on the K?ppen climate classification system, a classification it shares with most of northwest Europe.[1][2] The country receives generally cool summers and mild winters. It is considerably warmer than other areas on its latitude, because it lies in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, and as a result is warmed by the North Atlantic Current all year.\\r\\nAs a small island downwind of a large ocean, the climate of Ireland is profoundly impacted by that ocean. The Atlantic overturning circulation, which includes ocean currents such as the North Atlantic Current, moves heat northwards, which is then carried by the prevailing winds towards Ireland.[3]\\r\\nThe prevailing wind blows from the southwest, breaking on the high mountains of the west coast. Rainfall is therefore a particularly prominent part of western Irish life, with Valentia Island, off the west coast of County Kerry, getting almost twice as much annual rainfall as Dublin on the east (1,400?mm or 55.1?in vs. 762?mm or 30.0?in).\\r\\nJanuary and February are the coldest months of the year, and mean daily air temperatures fall between 4 and 7?C (39.2 and 44.6?F) during these months. July and August are the warmest, with mean daily temperatures of 14 to 16?C (57.2 to 60.8?F), whilst mean daily maximums in July and August vary from 17 to 18?C (62.6 to 64.4?F) near the coast, to 19 to 20?C (66.2 to 68.0?F) inland. The sunniest months are May and June, with an average of five to seven hours sunshine per day.[4] Though extreme weather events in Ireland are comparatively rare when compared with other countries in the European Continent, they do occur. Atlantic depressions, occurring mainly in the months of December, January and February, can occasionally bring winds of up to 160?km/h or 99?mph to Western coastal counties, with the winter of 2013/14 being the stormiest on record.[5] The summer months, and particularly around late July/early August, thunderstorms can develop.[6][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIreland experiences a lack of temperature extremes compared to other areas at similar latitudes. There is regional variation, with inland areas being cooler in winter and warmer in summer than their coastal counterparts.\\r\\nThe warmest areas are found along the southwest coast. Valentia Island has the highest average temperature, at 10.9?C.\\r\\nThe coldest areas are found inland. Mullingar has the lowest average temperature, at 9.3?C\\r\\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Ireland was 33.3?C at Kilkenny Castle, on 26 June 1887. The lowest temperature was -19.1?C at Markree Castle on 16 January 1881.[9]\\r\\nSix of the warmest ten years in Ireland have occurred since 1990.[10] Due to climate change, it is estimated that the temperatures will rise everywhere of up to 3.4 degrees by the end of the century. [11]\\r\\nExtreme heat and cold are both rare throughout the country. Summer temperatures exceed 30?C usually once or twice every decade (2016, 2013, 2006, 2005, 2003, 1995, 1990, 1989, 1983, 1976 and 1975 are recent examples), although they commonly reach the high 20s most summers, while severe freezes occur only occasionally in winter, with temperatures below -10?C being very uncommon in the lowlands, and temperatures below freezing uncommon in many coastal areas, although temperatures in the Wicklow Mountains are said to reach -10?C annually.[citation needed]\\r\\nAir frost occurs frequently in the winter, with most areas seeing over 40 days of air frost every year. In northern areas, air frost occurs on average 10.2 days every January, the month in which air frost occurs most frequently.[13] In the Sperrins and the Glens of Antrim air frost occurs around 80 days a year.[14] The pattern is similar with ground frost, with on average around 100 days of ground frost in the lowlands and over 140 in the mountains.[15]The number of frost days in Ireland have declined massively over the past decade.The largest season decrease has been known to take place in winter.[4]\\r\\nFrost is rarer along the coast, in urban areas and also in western and southern areas.\\r\\nRoches Point, County Cork receives the least number of days with air frost, with an average of 7.0 days with air frost recorded annually.[16]\\r\\nKilkenny, County Kilkenny receives the highest number of days with air frost, with an average of 53.0 days with air frost recorded annually.[17]\\r\\nIn Dublin, Dublin Airport records air frost on average 24.3 days per year, while Casement Aerodrome (which is further inland) records air frost on average 41.3 days per year.[18][19]\\r\\nThe sunniest months are May and June. During these months sunshine duration averages between 5 and 6? hours per day over most of the country. The southeast gets the most sunshine, averaging over 7 hours a day in early summer. December is the most overcast month, with an average daily sunshine ranging from about 1 hour in the north to almost 2 hours in the southeast. Over the year as a whole most areas get an average of between 3? and 3? hours of sunshine each day. Irish skies are completely covered by cloud roughly half of the time.\\r\\nThe sunniest part of the island is the southeast coast. Rosslare, County Wexford is the sunniest area, and receives on average 4.38 hours of sunshine per day (1,598.41 hours per year).[20]\\r\\nThe cloudiest (i.e. least sunny) parts of the island are generally the west and northwest of the country. However, Birr, County Offaly, in the midlands, is the most cloudy (overcast) station, receiving on average 3.2 hours of sunshine per day, considerably less than the stations at Malin Head in the north or Belmullet in the west.[22] Inland areas tend to receive less sunshine than coastal areas due to the convective development of clouds over land. Cloud develops because of vertical air currents caused by thermal heating of the ground.[23]\\r\\nRainfall is the most common form of precipitation on the island, and is extremely common throughout Ireland, although some parts of the west coast receive over four times as much rain as the east coast. Rainfall in Ireland normally comes from Atlantic frontal systems which travel northeast over the island, bringing cloud and rain. Most of the eastern half of the country has between 750 and 1,000?mm (29.5 and 39.4?in) of rainfall in the year. Rainfall in the west generally averages between 1,000 and 1,250?mm (39.4 and 49.2?in). In many mountainous districts rainfall exceeds 3,000?mm (118.1?in) per year. The wettest months almost everywhere are December and January. April is the driest month generally, but in many southern parts June is the driest.\\r\\nThe average number of \\"wet days\\" (days with more than 1?mm (0.039?in) of rain) ranges from about 151 days a year along the east and southeast coasts, to about 225 days a year in parts of the west.\\r\\nThe wettest weather station is Valentia Island, which receives 1,430.1?mm (56.30?in) of rain per year, on average.[25]\\r\\nThe driest weather station is Casement Aerodrome, which receives 711.4?mm (28.01?in) of rain per year, on average.[19]\\r\\nThe weather station with the highest number of \\"wet days\\" is Belmullet, with 193 days per year,[26] while the station with the lowest number of \\"wet days\\" is Dublin Airport, with 128 days per year.[18]\\r\\nSource:[27]\\r\\nSevere cold weather is uncommon in Ireland with the majority of winter precipitation coming in the form of rain, although hills and mountainous regions in the country can commonly see up to 30 days of snowfall annually, with the Wicklow Mountains sometimes seeing 50 or more days of snowfall annually. Most low-lying regions of the island only see a few days of lying snow per year (from December to March inclusive), or may see no snow at all during some winters.\\r\\nHowever, there are preparations for snow and ice, including the distribution of grit, salt, and other snow-treatable minerals. In late 2011, the Irish Government set up \\"Winter-Ready\\", in order to prepare the country for such severe weather.[28]\\r\\nDue to the variability of Ireland's weather (which is mainly because of the influence of the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift, as well as Ireland's northerly latitude and vulnerability to Siberian/Arctic winds) weather during the winter months is difficult to predict, with the aforementioned factors making both extremely low temperatures and relatively mild temperatures possible.\\r\\nThe snowiest weather station is Clones, County Monaghan, which receives, on average, nearly 30 days of snow and/or sleet per year. Of these, 10.8 days have snow lying at 09:00.[29] The least snowy weather station is Valentia Island, County Kerry; which receives, on average, 5.6 days of snow and/or sleet per year. Of these, 0.8 days have snow lying at 09:00.[25]\\r\\nHail, like snow and sleet, is also rare in Ireland; however, it can occur at any time of the year. It is most common in spring during thunderstorms.\\r\\nMalin Head, County Donegal receives the most hail, with an average of 48.4 days per year.[30]\\r\\nRoches Point, County Cork receives the least hail, with an average of 8.0 days per year.[31]\\r\\nThunderstorms are quite rare in Ireland.[citation needed] They are more likely to happen late in summer, although they can occur at any time of the year.\\r\\nCork Airport, County Cork experiences the least thunder; receiving it 3.7 days per year on average.[32]\\r\\nValentia Island, County Kerry experiences the most thunder; receiving it 7.1 days per year on average.[25]\\r\\nGenerally, the coast tends to be windier than inland areas; and the west tends to be windier than the east.\\r\\nThe station with the highest mean wind speed is Malin Head, County Donegal; averaging at 16.3?kn (30.2?km/h; 18.8?mph). Malin Head also receives the most gale-force winds, recording them on average 66.0 days per year.[30]\\r\\nThe station with the lowest mean wind speed is Kilkenny, County Kilkenny; averaging at 6.5?kn (12.0?km/h; 7.5?mph).[17]\\r\\nThe station that records the lowest number of gale-force winds is Birr, County Offaly; recording them on average 1.2 days per year.[33]\\r\\nThe highest wind speed ever recorded in Ireland was 103?kn (191?km/h; 119?mph) at Fastnet Lighthouse, County Cork on 16 October 2017.[27][not in citation given]\\r\\nTornadoes are very rare in Ireland, with around less than ten reported every year - mostly in August.[34]\\r\\nFog is more common inland and on higher altitudes; mainly during winter and during the morning at times of high pressure.\\r\\nThe foggiest station is that at Cork Airport, County Cork, which has 99.5 days of fog per year.[32]\\r\\nThe least foggy station is that at Valentia Island, County Kerry, which has 8.9 days of fog per year.[25]\\r\\nVisibility is generally very good, because of the proximity of industry to the coast, allowing breezes to disperse any smog.[35] Mist and fog often occur, as well as coastal fog in the east,[36] but it is generally not long-lasting. However, in winter, it can be slow to clear.[35]","input":"What is the weather and climate in ireland?"},{"output":"English","context":"The demographics of Toronto, Ontario, Canada make Toronto one of the most multicultural and multiracial cities in the world.

It was started with the building of local isolated wooden wagonways starting in 1560s. The system was later built as a patchwork of local rail links operated by small private railway companies in late 18th century. These isolated links developed during the railway boom of the 1840s into a national network, although still run by dozens of competing companies. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained (see railway mania). The entire network was brought under government control during the First World War and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed. However, the government resisted calls for the nationalisation of the network. In 1923, almost all the remaining companies were grouped into the \\"big four\\", the Great Western Railway, the London and North Eastern Railway, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway. The \\"Big Four\\" were joint-stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947.\\r\\nFrom the start of 1948, the \\"big four\\" were nationalised to form British Railways. Though there were few initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable. Declining passenger numbers and financial losses in the late 1950s and early 1960s prompted the closure of many branch and main lines, and small stations, under the Beeching Axe. Passenger services experienced a renaissance with the introduction of high-speed inter-city trains in the 1970s. The 1980s saw severe cuts in rail subsidies and above-inflation increases in fares and the service became more cost-effective.[citation needed] Railway operations were privatised during 1994-1997. Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to Railtrack, whilst passenger operations were franchised to individual private sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises) and the freight services sold outright. Since privatisation, passenger levels have since increased to their highest ever level, but whether this is due to privatisation is disputed. The Hatfield accident set in motion the series of events that resulted in the ultimate collapse of Railtrack and its replacement with Network Rail, a state-owned, not-for-dividend company.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA wagonway was used by German miners at Caldbeck, Cumbria, England, perhaps from the 1560s.[1] A wagonway was built at Prescot, near Liverpool, sometime around 1600, possibly as early as 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus about half a mile away.[2]\\r\\nAnother wagonway was Sir Francis Willoughby's Wollaton Wagonway in Nottinghamshire built between 1603 and 1604 to carry coal.[3]\\r\\nAs early as 1671 railed roads were in use in Durham to ease the conveyance of coal; the first of these was the Tanfield Wagonway.[4] Many of these tramroads or wagon ways were built in the 17th and 18th centuries. They used simply straight and parallel rails of timber on which carts with simple flanged iron wheels were drawn by horses, enabling several wagons to be moved simultaneously.\\r\\nAlthough the idea of wooden-railed wagonways originated in Germany in the 16th century, the first use of steam locomotives was in Britain. Its earliest \\"railways\\" were straight and were constructed from parallel rails of timber on which ran horse-drawn carts. These were succeeded in 1793 when Benjamin Outram constructed a mile-long tramway with L-shaped cast iron rails. These rails became obsolete when William Jessop began to manufacture cast iron rails without guiding ledges - the wheels of the carts had flanges instead. Cast iron is brittle and so the rails tended to break easily. Consequently, in 1820, John Birkenshaw introduced a method of rolling wrought iron rails, which were used from then onwards.\\r\\nThe first passenger-carrying public railway was opened by the Swansea and Mumbles Railway at Oystermouth in 1807, using horse-drawn carriages on an existing tramline.\\r\\nIn 1804, Richard Trevithick designed and built the first (unnamed) steam locomotive to run on smooth rails.[5]\\r\\nThe first commercially successful steam locomotive was Salamanca, built in 1812 by John Blenkinsop and Matthew Murray for the 4?ft (1,219?mm) gauge Middleton Railway.[6] Salamanca was a rack and pinion locomotive, with cog wheels driven by two cylinders embedded into the top of the centre-flue boiler.\\r\\nIn 1813, William Hedley and Timothy Hackworth designed a locomotive (Puffing Billy) for use on the tramway between Stockton and Darlington.[7] Puffing Billy featured piston rods extending upwards to pivoting beams, connected in turn by rods to a crankshaft beneath the frames which, in turn, drove the gears attached to the wheels. This meant that the wheels were coupled, allowing better traction. A year later, George Stephenson improved on that design with his first locomotive Blcher,[8] which was the first locomotive to use single-flanged wheels.\\r\\nThat design persuaded the backers of the proposed Stockton and Darlington Railway to appoint Stephenson as Engineer for the line in 1821. While traffic was originally intended to be horse-drawn, Stephenson carried out a fresh survey of the route to allow steam haulage. The Act was subsequently amended to allow the usage of steam locomotives and also to allow passengers to be carried on the railway. The 25-mile (40?km) long route opened on 27 September 1825 and, with the aid of Stephenson's Locomotion No 1, was the first locomotive-hauled public railway in the world.\\r\\nIn 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened. This set the pattern for modern railways. It was the world's first inter-city passenger railway and the first to have 'scheduled' services, terminal stations and services as we know them today. The railways carried freight and passengers with also the world's first goods terminal station at the Park Lane railway goods station at Liverpool's south docks, accessed by the 1.26 mile Wapping Tunnel. In 1836, at the Liverpool end the line was extended to Lime Street Station in Liverpool's city centre via a 1.1 mile long tunnel.\\r\\nMany of the first public railways were built as local rail links operated by small private railway companies. With increasing rapidity, more and more lines were built, often with scant regard for their potential for traffic. The 1840s were by far the biggest decade for railway growth. In 1840, when the decade began, railway lines in Britain were few and scattered but, within ten years, a virtually complete network had been laid down and the vast majority of towns and villages had a rail connection[citation needed] and sometimes two or three. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the pioneering independent railway companies amalgamated or were bought by competitors, until only a handful of larger companies remained (see Railway Mania).\\r\\nThe period also saw a steady increase in government involvement, especially in safety matters. The 1840 \\"Act for Regulating Railways\\"[9] empowered the Board of Trade to appoint railway inspectors. The Railway Inspectorate was established in 1840, to enquire into the causes of accidents and recommend ways of avoiding them.[10] As early as 1844, a bill had been put before Parliament suggesting the state purchase of the railways; this was not adopted. It did, however, lead to the introduction of minimum standards for the construction of carriages[11] and the compulsory provision of 3rd class accommodation for passengers - so-called \\"Parliamentary trains\\".\\r\\nThe entire network was brought under government control during the First World War and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed. However, the Conservative members of the wartime coalition government resisted calls for the formal nationalisation of the railways (first proposed by William Ewart Gladstone as early as the 1840s) in 1921.\\r\\nOn 1 January 1923, almost all the railway companies were grouped into the Big Four: the Great Western Railway, the London and North Eastern Railway, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway companies.[12] A number of other lines, already operating as joint railways, remained separate from the Big Four; these included the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway and the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway. The \\"Big Four\\" were joint-stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947.\\r\\nThe competition from road transport during the 1920s and 1930s greatly reduced the revenue available to the railways, even though the needs for maintenance on the network had never been higher, as investment had been deferred over the past decade. Rail companies accused the government of favouring road haulage through the construction of roads subsidised by the taxpayer, while restricting the rail industry's ability to use flexible pricing because it was held to nationally agreed rate cards. The government response was to commission several inconclusive reports; the Salter Report of 1933 finally recommended that road transport should be taxed directly to fund the roads and increased Vehicle Excise Duty and fuel duties were introduced. It also noted that many small lines would never be likely to compete with road haulage. Although these road pricing changes helped their survival, the railways entered a period of slow decline, owing to a lack of investment and changes in transport policy and lifestyles.\\r\\nDuring the Second World War, the companies' managements joined together, effectively operating as one company. Assisting the country's 'war effort' put a severe strain on the railways' resources and a substantial maintenance backlog developed. After 1945, for both practical and ideological reasons, the government decided to bring the rail service into the public sector.\\r\\nFrom the start of 1948, the railways were nationalised to form British Railways (latterly \\"British Rail\\") under the control of the British Transport Commission.[13] Though there were few initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable. Regeneration of track and stations was completed by 1954. Rail revenue fell and, in 1955, the network again ceased to be profitable. The mid-1950s saw the hasty introduction of diesel and electric rolling stock to replace steam in a modernisation plan costing many millions of pounds but the expected transfer back from road to rail did not occur and losses began to mount.[14] This failure to make the railways more profitable through investment led governments of all political persuasions to restrict rail investment to a drip feed and seek economies through cutbacks.\\r\\nThe desire for profitability led to a major reduction in the network during the mid-1960s. Dr. Richard Beeching was given the task by the government of re-organising the railways (\\"the Beeching Axe\\").[15][16] This policy resulted in many branch lines and secondary routes being closed because they were deemed uneconomic. The closure of stations serving rural communities removed much feeder traffic from main line passenger services. The closure of many freight depots that had been used by larger industries such as coal and iron led to much freight transferring to road haulage. The closures were extremely unpopular with the general public at that time and remain so today.[17]\\r\\nPassenger levels decreased steadily from the late fifties to late seventies.[18] Passenger services then experienced a renaissance with the introduction of the high-speed Intercity 125 trains in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[19] The 1980s saw severe cuts in government funding and above-inflation increases in fares, but the service became more cost-effective. Following sectorisation of British Rail, InterCity became profitable. InterCity became one of Britains top 150 companies operating city centre to city centre travel across the nation from Aberdeen and Inverness in the north to Poole and Penzance in the south.[20]\\r\\nBetween 1994 and 1997, British Rail was privatised.[21] Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to Railtrack, passenger operations were franchised to individual private sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises) and the freight services sold outright (six companies were set up, but five of these were sold to the same buyer).[22] The Conservative government under John Major said that privatisation would see an improvement in passenger services. Passenger levels have since increased strongly.[23]\\r\\nSince privatisation, numbers of passengers have grown rapidly; by 2010 the railways were carrying more passengers than at any time since the 1920s.[25] and by 2014 passenger numbers had expanded to their highest level ever, more than doubling in the 20 years since privatisation. Train fares cost more than under British Rail.[26]\\r\\nThe railways have become significantly safer since privatisation and are now the safest in Europe.[27] However, the public image of rail travel was damaged by some prominent accidents shortly after privatisation. These included the Southall rail crash (where a train with faulty automatic train protection equipment went through a red light),[28] the Ladbroke Grove rail crash (also caused by a train going through a red light)[29][30] and the Hatfield accident (caused by a rail fragmenting due to the development of microscopic cracks).[31]\\r\\nFollowing the Hatfield accident, the rail infrastructure company Railtrack imposed over 1,200 emergency speed restrictions across its network and instigated an extremely costly nationwide track replacement programme. The consequential severe operational disruption to the national network and the company's spiralling costs set in motion the series of events which resulted in the ultimate collapse of the company and its replacement with Network Rail, a state-owned, not-for-dividend company.[32]\\r\\npre-1830\\r\\nThe pioneers\\r\\n1830ÿ1922\\r\\nEarly development\\r\\n1923ÿ1947\\r\\nThe Big Four\\r\\n1948ÿ1994\\r\\nBritish Rail\\r\\n1995 to date\\r\\nPost-privatisation","input":"When was the first railway built in england?"},{"output":"Torsen limited slip differential","context":"The Honda S2000 is a roadster that was manufactured by Japanese company Honda from 1999 to 2009. First shown as a concept car at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1995, the production version was launched in April 1999 to celebrate the company's 50th anniversary. The S2000 is named for its engine displacement of two?liters, carrying on in the tradition of the S500, S600, and S800 roadsters of the 1960s.\\r\\nSeveral revisions were made throughout the car's lifetime, including changes to the engine, gearbox, suspension, interior and exterior. Officially two variants exist: the initial launch model was given the chassis code AP1, though cosmetically similar, the facelifted version (known as the AP2 in the US) incorporated significant changes to the drivetrain and suspension. Production of the S2000 ceased in June 2009. In Japan, it was exclusively sold through the Honda Verno sales channel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIntroduced at the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show,[2][3] the Honda Sport Study Model concept car was the design study for the production S2000. The SSM was a rear-wheel-drive roadster powered by a 2.0?L (122?cu?in) inline four-cylinder engine. It featured a rigid 'high X-bone frame' which Honda claimed improved the vehicle's rigidity and collision safety.[4] The concept car was constructed with aluminum body panels and featured a 50:50 weight distribution.[5]\\r\\nThe SSM appeared in many automotive shows for several years afterwards, hinting at the possibility of a production version, which Honda announced in 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe S2000 was introduced in 1999 for the 2000 model year and was given the chassis designation of \\"AP1\\". It features a front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout with power delivered by a 1,997?cc (122?cu?in) inline four-cylinder DOHC-VTEC engine. The engine (codenamed F20C) produces outputs of 177ÿ184?kW (237ÿ247?hp), and 208ÿ218?N?m (153ÿ161?lbf?ft) depending on the target market.[6] The engine is mated to a six-speed manual transmission and Torsen limited slip differential. The S2000 achieved what Honda claimed as the highest specific output normally aspirated production automobile engine in the world. The most powerful version; the JDM F20C was rated at 250 ps (247?hp) or 125 ps per L as a result of a higher 11.7:1 compression ratio.[7]\\r\\nFeatures include independent double wishbone suspension, electrically assisted steering and integrated roll hoops. The car features 16?in (41?cm) wheels with Bridgestone Potenza S-02 tires. The compact and lightweight engine, mounted entirely behind the front axle, allow the S2000 to achieve a 50:50 front/rear weight distribution and lower rotational inertia. An electrically powered vinyl top with internal cloth lining was standard, with an aluminum hardtop available as an optional extra (in 2001). Honda offered Berlina Black, New Formula Red, Gran Prix White, Sebring Silver and Silverstone Metallic in the US domestic market.\\r\\nThe 2001 model was largely unchanged; Honda added a digital clock to the radio display and made the rear wind blocker standard. Honda also added Spa Yellow to the US domestic market lineup. For the 2002 model year, suspension settings were revised and the plastic rear window was replaced by a glass unit incorporating an electric defroster. Other updates included slightly revised tail lamps with chrome rings, an upgraded radio with separate tweeters, a leather gearshift knob, leatherette console cover and a revised engine control unit. Honda added Suzuka Blue to the US domestic market lineup.\\r\\nThe AP1 was manufactured up to 2003 at Honda's Takanezawa plant, alongside the Honda NSX and Honda Insight hybrid.[8]\\r\\nThe Japanese domestic market received the Type V edition starting in mid-2000. It included variable gear ratio steering (VGS), a steering system that continuously changes steering ratio based upon vehicle speed and steering angle to provide improved handling. Honda announced the S2000 Type V on July 7, 2000 as the first system of its kind. The lock-to-lock steering ratio was reduced to 1.4 turns (stock is 2.4). Honda outfitted Type V cars with revised damper units, stabilizers and limited slip differentials to \\"complement the VGS\\". Equipped cars came with a special steering wheel and a VGS badge on the rear. [9] The Type V steering/handling package.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2004 model S2000 underwent several significant changes. Production moved to Suzuka. The new model introduced 17?in (43?cm) wheels and Bridgestone RE-050 tires along with a retuned suspension to reduce oversteer. The spring rates and shock absorber damping were altered and the suspension geometry modified to improve stability by reducing toe-in changes under cornering loads. The subframe also received a revision in design to achieve a high rigidity. In the gearbox the brass synchronizers were replaced with carbon fiber. In addition, cosmetic changes were made to the exterior with new front and rear bumpers, revised headlight assemblies, new LED tail-lights, and oval-tipped exhausts. Although all the cosmetic, suspension and most drivetrain upgrades were included on the Japanese, Australian and European S2000s, they retained the 2.0l F20C engines and remained designated as AP1s.\\r\\nFor the North American market the updates also included the introduction of a larger version of the F20C (F22C1), this larger engine gave the chassis designation AP2. F22C1, the engine's stroke was lengthened, increasing its displacement to 2,157?cc (132?cu?in). At the same time, the redline and fuel cutoff were reduced from 8,800?rpm and 9,000?rpm to 8,000?rpm and 8,200?rpm respectively, mandated by the longer travel of the pistons. Peak torque increased 6% to 220?N?m (160?lbf?ft) at 6,800?rpm while power output remained unchanged, 177?kW (237?hp) at a lower 7,800?rpm. In conjunction with its introduction of the F22C1, Honda also changed the transmission gear ratios by shortening the first five gears and lengthening the sixth.[10]\\r\\nIn 2006, the F22C1 was also introduced to the Japanese market, with an output of (178?kW (239?hp) and 221?N?m (163?lbf?ft)). The F20C continued in all other markets. The 2006 model introduced a drive by wire throttle, an electronic stability control system, new wheels, and one new exterior color, Laguna Blue Pearl. Interior changes included revised seats and additional stereo speakers integrated into the headrests.\\r\\nThe 2007 model year marked the first time the S2000 was offered in more than one trim level in the United States.[11] In addition to the base model, Honda offered a more track-oriented version of the S2000, distinguished by reduced weight, fewer amenities, and an increase in performance. The S2000 Club Racer made its world debut at the New York International Auto Show on 4 April 2007.[12] Changes for the CR included a lower ratio steering rack, revised exhaust system, black lug nuts, darker colored wheels, clear side markers, stiffer suspension and new Bridgestone Potenza RE070 tires that were wider at the rear; 245/40R-17 to 255/40R-17. A revised body kit, composed of a redesigned front lip, and a large spoiler, were wind-tunnel tested and claimed to reduce the overall coefficient of lift by 70ÿ80%. The power folding soft top was removed and replaced with additional chassis bracing topped off with a tonneau cover, while the hard top, optional on other models, became a standard feature on the CR. Honda also revised the shift knob over the base with an exclusive spherical aluminum shift knob that rests 12.6?mm lower for a 6 percent reduction in shift stroke compared to the conventional S2000 cylindrical shift knob (aluminum/leather wrapped). Conversely, the shift load effort increased by 10 percent with the new design.\\r\\nCR models were only available with yellow and black alcantara interiors. Additionally the CR interior has faux carbon fiber overlays on the center console and radio door and a peak power indicator light on the instrument gauge cluster that flashes when the engine is producing its peak power output. Finally, in an effort to reduce weight and lower the center of gravity, the spare tire was omitted and air conditioning and stereo were offered only as options. Net weight savings without the additional hardtop came to 41?kg (90?lb) relative to the standard model. The engine in the S2000 CR was unchanged from the standard trim.[13][14] Shigeru Uehara, the designer of the S2000, stated that the CR was positioned between the Type S and a hypothetical Type R.[15] Honda has never made an official Type R for the S2000.\\r\\nProduction volume of fewer than 2,000 units was expected however the final number produced was 699 for the combined 2008 and 2009 model years. The production numbers were broken down as follows; Apex Blue Pearl: 200 (21 delete models) Rio Yellow Pearl: 140 (20 delete models) Berlina Black: 269 (10 delete models) Grand Prix White: 90 (8 delete models) for a total 699 (668 for 2008, 31 for 2009). Honda continued to offer both the standard and CR versions unchanged for the 2009 model year.\\r\\nThe Japanese domestic market received the Type S edition for the last two years of production (2008ÿ2009). Changes are similar to the U.S. market's CR edition, sharing the weight loss, a purpose built bodykit providing much higher downforce, bespoke wheels and interior. Although it shares the wheels with the CR edition, the Type S retains the rear tire size of 245/40R-17 for better handling. A specific Type S suspension setup with improved geometry was designed to enhance the handling, the setup is stiffer but more compromising than the CR setup to suit it better to everyday spirited driving and the Japanese touge experience.[16] The Type S retains its soft top folding mechanism.\\r\\nThe interior is a Type S specific yellow and black alcantara material scheme. Leather interior from the standard S2000 was available as a free option. The aluminum shift knob with reduced shift stroke is shared with the CR. While the CR is designed to be a pure track car, the Type S is designed for improved handling and retains some creature comforts.[17] Only 1,755 copies of the Type S were made and sold exclusively in Japan. (2007:168 units, 2008:827 units, 2009:737 units, 2010 [Jan-Jun]:23 units)\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the 2009 model was offered in both roadster and GT trim. The GT featured a removable hard-top and an outside temperature gauge. On-the-road prices of these trims were S27,300 and S27,850 respectively.\\r\\nThe S2000 Ultimate Edition (continental Europe) and GT Edition 100 (UK) were limited versions of the S2000 released to commemorate the end of production. Both included Grand Prix White body color, removable hard top, graphite-colored alloy wheels, and red leather interior with red coloring for stitching on the gear lever gaiter.\\r\\nThe Ultimate Edition was unveiled at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show and went on sale in March 2009.[18] The GT Edition 100 was a limited run of 100 units released for the UK market. In addition to the Ultimate Edition's specification, it features a black S2000 badge and a numbered plaque on the kick-plate indicating which vehicle in the series it is.[19]\\r\\n1,260?kg (2,778?lb) (JP type V)\\r\\n1,295?kg (2,855?lb) w/ AC\\r\\nDimensions are approximate and vary across markets and years for the same model.\\r\\nThe S2000 has received much praise from critics and motoring journalists and has received favourable reviews from such publications as Car and Driver. Highlighted are the high output of the engine, the high redline, the balanced handling, and the smooth gearbox. User surveys have named the S2000 as a favorite for overall customer satisfaction.[26]\\r\\nAfter several years of steady production, sales of the roadster began falling dramatically starting in 2006, and the trend accelerated during the 2008 automotive industry crisis. In 2008, only 2,538 units were sold in the U.S. - a 74% decline from the 2002 sales peak. In November of that year, for the first time since its launch, only 90 new S2000s were sold nationwide during a calendar month.[44]\\r\\nProduction of the S2000 ceased in June 2009 [45] and plans for a successor were scrapped in the aftermath of the automotive industry crisis.[46] During the 2009 announcement of the vehicle's production end, Honda reported that worldwide sales through the end of 2008 totaled 110,673 units.[47]\\r\\n*Note: No new cars were produced in 2010 and 2011; sales represent clearance of residual inventory.\\r\\nFigures are not directly comparable as they are obtained through different methodologies in different markets.","input":"What kind of differential does an s2000 have?"},{"output":"the island of Hawai?i","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea (/?ki?la??e??/, US: /?k?l??we??/; Hawaiian:?[ti?l?w?w?j?]) is a currently active shield volcano in the Hawaiian Islands, and the most active of the five volcanoes that together form the island of Hawai?i. Located along the southern shore of the island, the volcano is between 300,000 and 600,000 years old and emerged above sea level about 100,000 years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the second youngest product of the Hawaiian hotspot and the current eruptive center of the HawaiianÿEmperor seamount chain. Because it lacks topographic prominence and its activities historically coincided with those of Mauna Loa, Kؐlauea was once thought to be a satellite of its much larger neighbor. Structurally, Kؐlauea has a large, fairly recently formed caldera at its summit and two active rift zones, one extending 125?km (78?mi) east and the other 35?km (22?mi) west, as an active fault of unknown depth moving vertically an average of 2 to 20?mm (0.1 to 0.8?in) per year.\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea has been erupting nearly continuously since 1983 and has caused considerable property damage, including the destruction of the town of Kalapana in 1990, and the destruction of Vacationland Hawaii in 2018. The 2018 lower Puna eruption, which began May 3, over several weeks opened two dozen lava vents downrift from the summit in Puna. The eruption was accompanied by a strong earthquake on May 4 of Mw 6.9, and nearly 2,000 residents were evacuated from the rural Leilani Estates subdivision and nearby areas. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 17, 2018 at 4:17 AM, the volcano explosively erupted at the summit in Halemaumau Crater, throwing ash 30,000 feet into the air.[4] Summit explosions have caused the long-term closure of the Kؐlauea section of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, and vigorous eruptive activity is ongoing in lower Puna, where lava entered the ocean in three places, destroyed Hawaii's largest freshwater lake, covered substantial portions of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens, completely inundated Vacationland Hawaii and all but three houses in the Kapoho Beach Lots. Lava also filled Kapoho Bay and extended new land nearly a mile into the sea.[5][6] The total number of houses taken by lava since May 3, 2018 was officially announced on June 7 as approximately 600.[7][8] On July 9, the official total had increased to 700 houses.[9][needs update]\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea's eruptive history has been a long and active one; its name means \\"spewing\\" or \\"much spreading\\" in the Hawaiian language, referring to its frequent outpouring of lava. The earliest lavas from the volcano date back to its submarine preshield stage, samples having been recovered by remotely operated underwater vehicles from its submerged slopes; samples of other flows have been recovered as core samples. Lavas younger than 1,000 years cover 90 percent of the volcano's surface. The oldest exposed lavas date back 2,800 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first well-documented eruption of Kؐlauea occurred in 1823 (Western contact and written history began in 1778).  Since then, the volcano has erupted repeatedly. Most historical eruptions occurred at the volcano's summit or its eastern rift zone, and were prolonged and effusive in character. The geological record shows, however, that violent explosive activity predating European contact was extremely common; in 1790 one such eruption killed more than 400 people, making it the deadliest volcanic eruption in what is now the United States.[10] Should explosive activity start anew, the volcano would become much more of a danger to humans. Kؐlauea's current eruption dates back to January 3, 1983, and is by far its longest-duration historical period of activity, as well as one of the longest-duration eruptions in the world; as of January 2011, the eruption has produced 3.5?km3 (1?cu?mi) of lava and resurfaced 123.2?km2 (48?sq?mi) of land.\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea's high state of activity has a major impact on its mountainside ecology, where plant growth is often interrupted by fresh tephra and drifting volcanic sulfur dioxide, producing acid rains particularly in a barren area south of its southwestern rift zone known as the Ka? Desert. Nonetheless, wildlife flourishes where left undisturbed elsewhere on the volcano and is highly endemic thanks to Kؐlauea's (and the island of Hawai?i's) isolation from the nearest landmass. Historically, the five volcanoes on the island were considered sacred by the Hawaiian people, and in Hawaiian mythology Kؐlauea's Halema?uma?u Crater served as the body and home of Pele, goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes.[11] William Ellis, a missionary from England, gave the first modern account of Kؐlauea and spent two weeks traveling along the volcano; since its foundation by Thomas Jaggar in 1912, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, located on the rim of Kؐlauea caldera, has served as the principal investigative and scientific body on the volcano and the island in general. In 1916, a bill forming the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson; since then, the park has become a World Heritage Site and a major tourist destination, attracting roughly 2.6 million people annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all Hawaiian volcanoes, Kؐlauea was created as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's underlying mantle.[12] The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the 6,000?km (3,700?mi)-long HawaiianÿEmperor seamount chain.[13] The prevailing, though not completely settled, view is that the hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era.[13][14] However, while the Hawaiian mantle plume is well understood and extensively studied, the nature of hotspots themselves remains fairly enigmatic.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea is one of five subaerial volcanoes that make up the island of Hawai?i, created by the Hawaii hotspot.[3] The oldest volcano on the island, Kohala, is more than a million years old,[16] and Kؐlauea, the youngest, is believed to be between 300,000 and 600,000 years of age;[3] L?ihi Seamount, on the island's flank, is younger and has yet to breach the surface.[17] Thus Kilauea is the second youngest volcano in the HawaiianÿEmperor seamount chain, a chain of shield volcanoes and seamounts extending from Hawaii to the KurilÿKamchatka Trench in Russia.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the pattern of Hawaiian volcano formation, Kؐlauea started as a submarine volcano, gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt lava before emerging from the sea with a series of explosive eruptions[19] about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano's activity has likely been as it is now, a continual stream of effusive and explosive eruptions of roughly the same pattern as its activity in the last 200 or 300 years.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt most 600,000 years old, Kؐlauea is still quite young for a Hawaiian volcano;[3] the oldest volcano on the island, the northwestern Kohala, experienced almost 900,000 years of activity before going extinct.[16] The volcano's foreseeable future activity will likely be much like it has been for the past 50,000 to 100,000 years; Hawaiian and explosive activity will make Kؐlauea taller, build up its rift zones, and fill and refill its summit caldera.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea has been active throughout its history.[20] Since 1918, Kؐlauea's only prolonged period of rest was an 18-year pause between 1934 and 1952.[21] The bulk of Kؐlauea consists of solidified lava flows, intermittent with scattered volcanic ash and tephra sourced from relatively lower-volume explosive eruptions.[20] Much of the volcano is covered in historical flows, and 90 percent of its surface dates from the last 1,100 years.[22] Kؐlauea built itself up from the seafloor over time, and thus much of its bulk remains underwater;[19] its subaerial surface is in the form of a gently sloping, elongate, decentralized shield with a surface area of approximately 1,500?km2 (579?sq?mi),[23] making up 13.7 percent of the island's total surface area.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea lacks a topographical prominence, appearing only as a bulge on the southeastern flank of the nearby Mauna Loa; because of this, both native Hawaiians and early geologists considered it an active satellite of its more massive neighbor. However, analysis of the chemical composition of lavas from the two volcanoes shows that they have separate magma chambers, and are thus distinct. Nonetheless, their proximity has led to a historical trend in which high activity at one volcano roughly coincides with low activity at the other. When Kؐlauea lay dormant between 1934 and 1952, Mauna Loa became active, and when the latter remained quiet from 1952 to 1974, the reverse was true. This is not always the case; the 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa started during an eruption at Kؐlauea, but had no discernible effect on the Kؐlauea eruption, and the ongoing inflation of Mauna Loa's summit, indicative of a future eruption, began the same day as new lava flows at Kؐlauea's Pu?u ?? crater. In 2002, Kilauea experienced a high-volume effusive episode at the same time that Mauna Loa began inflating.  This unexpected communication is evidence of crustal-level interactions between Mauna Loa and Kؐlauea, even though these two volcanoes are thought to be fairly independent of each other.[24] Geologists have suggested that \\"pulses\\" of magma entering Mauna Loa's deeper magma system may have increased pressure inside Kؐlauea and triggered the concurrent eruptions.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea has a large summit caldera, measuring 4 by 3.2?km (2.5 by 2.0?mi) with walls up to 120?m (400?ft) high, breached by lava flows on the southwestern side.[21] It is unknown if the caldera was always there or if it is a relatively recent feature, and it is possible that it has come and gone throughout Kؐlauea's eruptive history.[20] What is known is that the summit caldera likely formed over several centuries, with its construction estimated to have begun about 500 years ago,[26] and its present form was finalized by a particularly powerful eruption in 1790.[20] A major feature within the caldera is Halema?uma?u Crater, a large pit crater and one of Kؐlauea's most historically active eruption centers. The crater is approximately 920?m (3,018?ft) in diameter and 85?m (279?ft) deep, but its form has varied widely through its eruptive history; the floor of the Halema?uma?u Crater is now mostly covered by flows from its 1974 eruption.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea has two rift zones radiating from its summit, one leading 125?km (78?mi) out to the east, the other 35?km (22?mi) long and trending towards the southwest.[20] A series of fault scarps connecting the two rift zones form the Koa'e Fault Zone. Tectonic extension along both rift zones is causing Kؐlauea's bulk to slowly slide seaward off its southern flank at a rate of about 6 to 10?cm (2 to 4?in) per year, centered on a basal dcollement fault 7 to 9?km (4 to 6?mi) beneath the volcano's surface.[28]  The eastern rift zone in particular is a dominant feature on the volcano; it is almost entirely covered in lava erupted in the last 400 years, and at its crest near the summit is 2 to 4?km (1 to 2?mi) wide.[23] Non-localized eruptions, typical of rift zone activity,[20] have produced a series of low-lying ridges down the majority of the east rift zone's length.[23] Its upper segment is the most presently active section of the volcano,[22][26] and is additionally the site of a number of large pit craters;[29] its lower extremity reaches down Kؐlauea's submerged flank to a depth of more than 5,000?m (16,400?ft).[26] By contrast, the much smaller southwestern rift has been quiet since a rifting episode in 1974, and to date, has not been involved in the current eruptive cycle at all.[28] The southwestern rift zone's extremity is also underwater, although its submarine length is more limited. The southwestern rift zone also lacks a well-defined ridge line or a large number of pit craters, evidence that it is also geologically less active than the eastern rift zone.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nA prominent structure on Kؐlauea's southern flank is the Hilina fault system, a highly active fault slipping vertically an average of 2 to 20?mm (1?16 to 13?16?in) per year[clarification needed] along the system. Its physiographic province is 500?m (1,640?ft) deep, but it is unknown whether it is a shallow listric fault or if it penetrates to the very base of the volcano.[12] In connection with the 2018 lower Puna eruption the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory published some facts leading to the conclusion, that a catastrophic collapse would be incredibly remote.[30] A number of cinder cones, satellite shields, lava tubes, and other eruptive structures also dot the volcano, evidence of its recent activity.[29] Kؐlauea has some interactions with Mauna Loa, its larger neighbor and only other recently active volcano on the island; interspersed lava flows and ash deposits belonging to its neighbor have been found on its flanks, and some of Mauna Loa's flows are, in turn, blanketed in Kؐlauea tephra. In particular, the saddle between the two volcanoes is currently depressed, and is likely to fill over in the future.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll historical eruptions at Kؐlauea have occurred at one of three places: its summit caldera, its eastern rift zone, or its southwestern rift zone.[3] Half of Kؐlauea's historical eruptions have occurred at or near Kؐlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, capped by a massive explosive eruption in 1924, before petering out by 1934. Recent activity has mostly shifted to Kؐlauea's eastern rift zone, the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section; by contrast, the volcano's southwestern rift zone has been relatively quiet, and has only been the site of five events to date.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeologists have dated and documented dozens of major eruptions over the volcano's long history, bridging the long gap between Kؐlauea's oldest known rock and only extremely recent written records and historical observation.[31] Historical lava flows from the volcano are generally recovered by scientists in one of three ways. The oldest flows, dating back 275,000 to 225,000 years, have been recovered from Kؐlauea's submerged southern slope by ship-towed remotely operated vehicles. These lavas exhibit forms characteristic of early, submerged preshield-stage eruptive episodes, from when the volcano was still a rising seamount that had not yet breached the ocean surface,[32] and their surface exposure is unusual, as in most other volcanoes such lavas would have since been buried by more recent flows.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second method of recovering older rock is through the drilling of deep core samples; however, the cores have proved difficult to date, and several samples from depths of around 1,700?m (5,600?ft) that suggested dates as old as 450,000 years have since been found erroneous. More reliable paleomagnetic dating, limited to rocks dating from after Kؐlauea's emergence from the sea, has suggested ages of around 50,000 years. Exposed flows above sea level have proved far younger. Some of the oldest reliably dated rock, 43,000 years old, comes from charcoal sandwiched beneath an ash layer on a fault scarp known as Hilina Pali; however, samples dated from higher up the scarp indicate ash deposition at an average rate of 6?m (20?ft) per thousand years, indicating that the oldest exposed flows, from the base of the feature, could date back as far as 70,000 years.[32] This date is similar to that of the oldest dated extant lava flow, a southwestern rift zone flow with an uncorrected radiocarbon dating of approximately 4650 BC.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest well-studied eruptive product from Kؐlauea is the Uwkahuna Ash Member, the product of explosive eruptions between 2,800 and 2,100 years ago. Although it has since been largely buried by younger flows, it remains exposed in some places, and has been traced more than 20?km (12?mi) from the volcano's caldera, evidence of very powerful eruptions. Evidence suggests the existence of an active eruptive center at this time, termed the Powers Caldera, 2?km (1?mi) away from the modern one. At least 1,200 years ago, lava from the Powers Caldera overtopped its rim and solidified the structure; this was followed by a period of very voluminous tube-fed phoehoe flows from the summit. Following cessation of activity around 400 years ago, eruptions re-centered on the eastern part of Kؐlauea's summit, and concurrently activity increased at the northern end of the eastern rift zone.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest reliable written records of historical activity date back to about 1820,[33] and the first well-documented eruption occurred in 1823, when the volcano was first put under observation;[20] although Native Hawaiians are thought to have first settled on the island around 1,500 years ago, oral records predating European arrival on the island are few and difficult to interpret.[26] One pre-contact eruption in particular, a phreatomagmatic event in 1790,[21]  was responsible for the death of a party of warriors, part of the army of Keua Kuahu?ula, the last island chief to resist Kamehameha I's rule; their death is evidenced by a set of footprints preserved within the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[33] Kؐlauea has been the site of 61 separate eruptions since 1823, easily making it one of the most active volcanoes on Earth.[3][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring its observed history, the volume of lava erupted by Kؐlauea has varied widely. In 1823 Kؐlauea's summit caldera was far deeper than it is today, but was in the process of filling up under nearly continuous summit eruption, with 3?km3 (1?cu?mi) of lava erupted there alone by 1840. The period between 1840 and 1920 saw approximately half that in eruptive volume, and in the thirty years between then and about 1950, the volcano was unusually quiet and exhibited very little activity; Kؐlauea's eruptive volume has increased steadily since then, with present activity comparable to that of the early 1800s.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe length and origin of these eruptions have also varied. Events last anywhere between days and years, and occur at a number of different sites. Half of all eruptions occur at or near Kؐlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, and after a reprieve between 1894 and 1907, continued onwards until 1924. There have been five historical eruptions at the volcano's relatively quiet southwestern rift zone, and 24 along its more active eastern rift zone, mostly along its upper section.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe volcano's observed history has mostly been one of effusive eruptions; however, this is a relatively recent occurrence. Prior to the arrival of the first Europeans on the island, Kؐlauea was the site of regular explosive activity, evidenced then by tribal chants referencing the volcano's fickle nature, and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity. Although explosive activity still occurs at the volcano, it is not as intense as it once was, and the volcano would become much more dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea erupted in 1823 and 1832, but the first major eruption since the 1790 event occurred in 1840, when its eastern rift zone became the site of a large, effusive Hawaiian eruption over 35?km (22?mi) of its length, unusually long even for a rift eruption.[35] The eruption lasted for 26 days and produced an estimated 205 to 265 million cubic meters of lava;[21]  the light created by the event was so intense that one could reportedly read a newspaper in Hilo at night, 30?km (19?mi) away.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe volcano was active again in 1868, 1877, 1884, 1885, 1894, and 1918,[21] before its next major eruption in 1918ÿ1919. Halema?uma?u, then a small upwelling in the caldera floor, was topped by a lava lake that then drained, before refilling again, forming an enormous lava lake and nearly reaching the top edge of the caldera before draining once more. This activity eventually gave way to the construction of Mauna Iki, building up the large lava shield within the caldera over a period of eight months. The eruption also featured concurrent rift activity and a large amount of lava fountaining.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nActivity in 1921ÿ1923 followed.[21] The next major eruption occurred in 1924. Halema?uma?u Crater, a fully formed pit crater after the 1919 event and the site of a sizable lava lake, first drained, then quickly began sinking into the ground, deepening to nearly 210?m (689?ft) beneath a thick cloud of volcanic ash. Explosive activity began on May 10 of that year, blowing rock chunks weighing as much as 45?kg (99?lb) 60?m (197?ft) out, and smaller fragments weighing about 9?kg (20?lb) out as far as 270?m (886?ft),  and, after a brief reprieve, intensified through a major blast on May 18, when an enormous explosive event caused the eruption's only fatality. The eruption continued and formed numerous eruption columns up to and beyond 9?km (6?mi) in height, before slowly petering down and ending by May 28.[34][37] Volcanic activity was soon confined to the summit, and ceased completely after 1934.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Halema?uma?u event, Kؐlauea remained relatively quiet, and for a time, completely silent, with all activity confined to the summit.[21] The volcano came alive again in 1952, with an enormous lava fountain 245?m (800?ft) high at the Halema?uma?u Crater. Multiple continuous lava fountains between 15 and 30?m (50 and 100?ft) persisted, and the eruption lasted 136 days.[38] Eruptions occurred soon after in 1954, 1955, and 1959, capped by a large event in 1960, when fissure-based phreatic eruption and earthquake activity gave way to a massive ?a? flow that overran multiple evacuated communities and resorts; the resulting summit deflation eventually caused the ever-active Halema?uma?u to collapse even further.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the event, eruptive events yearly and nearly continuous, a state of activity that remains today. The period 1967ÿ1968 saw a particularly large, 80-million-cubic-meter, 251-day event from Halema?uma?u Crater.[21] This event was superseded the very next year by the marathon Mauna Ulu eruption, a large effusive eruption which lasted from May 24, 1969 to July 24, 1974 and added 230 acres (93?ha) of new land to the island. After eruptive activity had died down, there was a magnitude 7.2 earthquake that caused a partial summit collapse, after which activity did not resume at Kؐlauea until 1977.[40] At the time, Mauna Ulu was the longest flank eruption of any Hawaiian volcano in recorded history. The eruption created a new vent, covered a large area of land with lava, and added new land to the island. The eruption started as a fissure between two pit craters, ?lo?i and ?Alae, where the Mauna Ulu shield would eventually form. Both phoehoe and ?a? lava erupted from the volcano. Early on, fountains of lava burst out as much as 540?meters (1772?ft) high. In early 1973, an earthquake occurred that caused Kؐlauea to briefly stop erupting near the original Mauna Ulu site and instead erupt near the craters Pauahi and Hi?iaka.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most recent major eruption at Kؐlauea has been the longest duration of any observed eruption. The current Kؐlauea eruption began on January 3, 1983, along the eastern rift zone. The vent produced vigorous lava fountains that quickly built up into the Pu?u ?? cone, sending lava flows down the volcano's slope. In 1986, activity shifted down the rift to a new vent, named Kpa?ianah, where it took on a more effusive character. Kpa?ianah built up a low, broad volcanic shield, and lava tubes fed flows extending 11 to 12?km (about 7?mi) to the sea. Between 1986 and 1991, the connection between Chain of Craters Road and Hawaii Route 130 was cut, and the community of Kapaahu, the village of Kalapana, and the subdivisions of Klapana Gardens and Royal Gardens were lost to the lava.[41] A black sand beach at Kaim was also engulfed.[42] In 1992, the eruption moved back to Pu?u ??, but continued in the same manner, covering nearly all of the 1983ÿ86 lava flows and large areas of coastline.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the end of 2016, the east rift zone eruption had produced 4.4?km3 (1?cu?mi) of lava, covered 144?km2 (56?sq?mi) of land, added 179?ha (442 acres) of land to the island, destroyed 215 structures, and buried 14.3?km (9?mi) of highway under lava as thick as 35?m (115?ft).[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the nearly continuous activity at Pu?u ?O?o and other vents on the east rift zone, a separate eruption began at Kilauea's summit in March 2008. On March 19, 2008, following several months of increased sulfur dioxide emissions and seismic tremor, a new vent opened at Halema?uma?u Crater at Kilauea's summit in an explosive eruption. Following this event, the new crater formed in the explosion, informally named the \\"Overlook Crater,\\" emitted a thick gas plume that obscured views into the vent. Several other explosive events occurred at the vent throughout 2008.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 5, 2008, scientists observed a lava pond deep within the Overlook Crater for the first time. Beginning in February 2010, a lava pond was visible at the bottom of the crater almost continuously through the beginning of May 2018. Lava briefly overflowed the vent onto the floor of Halema?uma?u Crater in April and May 2015, October 2016, and April 2018.[45][46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in March 2018, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory began to detect rapid inflation at Puu ,[48] leading scientists to warn that the increased pressure could lead to the formation of a new vent at Kilauea.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing weeks of increased pressure, the crater floor of the cone of Pu?u ?? collapsed on April 30, 2018, as magma migrated underground into the lower Puna region of Kilauea's lower east rift zone.[50] Over the next few days, hundreds of small earthquakes were detected on Kؐlaueas East rift zone, leading officials to issue evacuation warnings. On May 3, 2018, new fissures formed, and lava began erupting in lower Puna after a 5.0 earthquake earlier in the day, causing evacuations of the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nA seemingly related 6.9 magnitude earthquake occurred on May 4.[53] By May 9, 27 houses had been destroyed in Leilani Estates.[54][55]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy May 21, two lava flows had reached the Pacific Ocean, creating thick clouds of laze (a toxic lava and haze cloud), which is made up of hydrochloric acid and glass particles.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy May 31, 87 houses in Leilani Estates and nearby areas had been destroyed by lava. Advancing lava flows caused additional evacuation orders, including the town of Kapoho.[57][58] By June 4, with the lava having crossed through Kapoho and entered the ocean, the confirmed number of houses lost had reached 159.[59] Two weeks later, the confirmed number of homes lost was 533,[60][dead link] and as of June 25 it had risen to 657.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conjunction with the outbreak of lava in lower Puna, a lava lake at Halema?uma?u Crater at Kilauea's summit began to drop on May 2, 2018.[50] The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory warned that the lowering of the lava lake increased the potential for phreatic (steam) explosions at the summit caused by interaction of magma with the underground water table, similar to the explosions that occurred at Halema?uma?u in 1924. These concerns prompted the closure of Hawai?i Volcanoes National Park.[62] On May 17, at approximately 4:15 a.m., an explosive eruption occurred at Halema?uma?u, creating a plume of ash 30,000 feet into the air.[63] This marked the beginning of a series of vigorous explosions that have produced significant ash plumes from Halema?uma?u.[64] These explosions, accompanied by large earthquakes and inward slumping and collapse within and around Halema?uma?u Crater, continued until early August.[65][66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Global Volcanism Program has assigned a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI; the higher the number, the more explosive) to all except five of Kؐlauea's ninety-five known eruptions of the last 11,700 years. The eruption of 1790 has a VEI of 4. The eruptions of 1820, 1924, 1959 and 1960 have a VEI of 2. The eruptions of 680, 1050, 1490, 1500, 1610, 1868, four eruptions in 1961 and the current eruption since 1983 have a VEI of 1. The other seventy-four eruptions have a VEI of 0.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of its position more than 3,000 kilometers (2,000 mi) from the nearest continental landmass, the island of Hawai?i is one of the most geographically isolated landmasses on Earth; this in turn has strongly influenced its ecology. The majority of the species present on the island are endemic to it and can be found nowhere else on Earth, the result of an isolated evolutionary lineage sheltered from external biotic influence; this makes its ecosystem vulnerable both to invasive species and human development, and an estimated third of the island's natural flora and fauna has already gone extinct.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea's ecological community is additionally threatened by the activity of the volcano itself;[29] lava flows often overrun sections of the volcano's forests and burn them down, and volcanic ash distributed by explosive eruptions often smothers local plant life. Layers of carbonized organic material at the bottom of Kؐlauea ash deposits are evidence of the many times the volcano has wrought destruction on its own ecosystem and that of its neighbor Mauna Loa, and parts of the volcano present a dichotomy between pristine montane forest and recently buried volcanic \\"deserts\\" yet to be recolonized.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea's bulk affects local climate conditions through the influence of trade winds coming predominantly  from the northeast, which, when squeezed upwards by the volcano's height, result in a moister windward side and a comparatively arid leeward flank. The volcano's ecology is further complicated by height, though not nearly as much as with its other, far taller neighbors, and by the local distribution of volcanic products, making for varied soil conditions. The northern part of Kؐlauea is mostly below 1,000?m (3,281?ft) and receives more than 75?in (191?cm) mean annual rainfall, and can mostly be classified as a lowland wet community; farther south, the volcano has squeezed out much of the precipitation and receives less than 50?in (127?cm) mean annual rainfall, and is considered mostly a lowland dry environment.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of Kؐlauea's southern ecosystem lies within the Hawai?i Volcanoes National Park, where ae ferns, ?hi?a trees (Metrosideros polymorpha), and hapuu of the genus Cibotium are common.[71] The park hosts a large variety of bird species, including the 'apapane (Himatione sanguinea); the 'amakihi (Hemignathus virens); the 'i'iwi (Vestiaria coccinea); the mao (Myadestes obscurus), the  ?elepaio (Chasiempis sp.); and the endangered 'akepa (Loxops coccineus), 'akiapola'au (Hemignathus munroi), nn (Branta sandvicensis), ?ua?u (Pterodroma sandwichensis), and ?io (Buteo solitarius) species.[72] The Kؐlauea coast also hosts three of the nine known critically endangered hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) nesting sites on the island.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the area alongside Kؐlauea's southwestern rift zone takes the form of the unusual Ka? Desert. Although not a \\"true\\" desert (rainfall there exceeds the maximum 1,000?mm (39?in) a year), precipitation mixing with drifting volcanic sulfur dioxide forms acid rain with a pH as low as 3.4, greatly hampering regional plant growth.[74] The deposited tephra particulates make the local soil very permeable. Plant life in the region is practically nonexistent.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea's northern lowland wet-forest ecosystem is partially protected by the Puna Forest Reserve and the Kahauale\`a Natural Area Reserve. At 27,785 acres (11,244?ha), Wao Kele in particular is Hawai?i's largest lowland wet forest reserve, and is home to rare plant species including hpu?u ferns (Cibotium spp.), 'ie'ie vines (Freycinetia arborea), and kpiko (Psychotria mariniana), some of which play a role in limiting invasive species' spread. ?Ope?ape?a (Lasiurus cinereus semotus) ?io (Buteo solitarius), common ?amakihi (Hemignathus virens), and nananana makaki?i (Theridion grallator)  live in the trees. There are thought to be many more as-yet-undocumented species within the forest.[76][77] Wao Kele's primary forest tree is ?hi?a lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha).[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Ancient Hawaiians to arrive on Hawaii island lived along the shores, where food and water were plentiful.[79] Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source.[80] Early settlements had a major impact on the local ecosystem, and caused many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species, as well as introducing foreign plants and animals and increasing erosion rates.[81] The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change was caused by the use of fire, but the main reason appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans).[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe summits of the five volcanoes of Hawaii are revered as sacred mountains. Hawaiians associated elements of their natural environment with particular deities. In Hawaiian mythology, the sky father Wkea marries the earth mother Papa, giving birth to the Hawaiian Islands.[80] Kؐlauea itself means \\"spewing\\" or \\"much spreading\\" in Hawaiian, referencing its high state of activity,[3] and in Hawaiian mythology, Kؐlauea is the body of the deity Pele, goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes.[83] It is here that the conflict between Pele and the rain god Kamapua?a was centered; Halema?uma?u, \\"House of the ?ama?uma?u fern\\", derives its name from the struggle between the two gods. Kamapua?a, hard-pressed by Pele's ability to make lava spout from the ground at will, covered the feature, a favorite residence of the goddess, with fern fronds. Choked by trapped smoke, Pele emerged. Realizing that each could threaten the other with destruction, the other gods called a draw and divided the island between them, with Kamapua?a getting the moist windward northeastern side, and Pele directing the drier Kona (or leeward) side. The rusty singed appearance of the young fronds of the ?ama?uma?u is said to be a product of the legendary struggle.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis early era was followed by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century. Land was divided into regions designed for both the immediate needs of the populace and the long-term welfare of the environment. These ahupua?a generally took the form of long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first foreigner to arrive at Hawaii was James Cook in 1778.[85] The first non-native to observe Kؐlauea in detail was William Ellis, an English missionary who in 1823 spent more than two weeks trekking across the volcano. He collated the first written account of the volcano and observed many of its features, establishing a premise for future explorations of the volcano.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother missionary, C. S. Stewart, U.S.N., wrote of it in his journal 'A Residence in the Sandwich Islands', which Letitia Elizabeth Landon quoted from in the notes to her poem 'The Volcano of Ki-Rau-E-A' in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1832.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the earliest and most important surveyors of Kؐlauea was James Dwight Dana, who, staying with the missionary Titus Coan, studied the island's volcanoes in detail for decades first-hand.[87] Dana visited Kؐlauea's summit and described it in detail in 1840.[88] After publishing a summary paper in 1852, he directed a detailed geological study of the island in 1880 and 1881 but did not consider Kؐlauea a separate volcano, instead referring to it as a flank vent of Mauna Loa; it was not until another geologist, C. E. Dutton, had elaborated on Dana's research during an 1884 expedition that Kؐlauea came to be generally accepted as a separate entity.[89]:154ÿ155\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next era of Kؐlauea's history began with the establishment of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory on the volcano's rim in 1912. The first permanent such installation in the United States, the observatory was the brainchild of Thomas Jaggar, head of geology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; after witnessing the devastation of the 1908 Messina earthquake near Mount Etna in Italy, he declared that something must be done to support systematic volcanic and seismic study, and chose Kؐlauea as the site of the first such establishment. After securing initial funding from MIT and the University of Hawaii, Jaggar took directorship of the observatory and, whilst its head between 1912 and 1940, pioneered seismological and observational study and observation of active volcanoes.[90] After initial funding ran out, the Observatory was successively funded by the National Weather Service, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Park Service, before settling on the USGS, under whose banner the observatory has been operating since 1947. The main building has been moved twice since establishment, and today is positioned on the northwest rim of Kؐlauea's caldera.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nNASA used the area to geologically train the Apollo Astronauts in recognizing volcanic features, planning traverses, collecting samples and taking photographs.  Training took place in April 1969, April 1970, December 1970, December 1971, and June 1972. Astronauts of Apollo 12, Apollo 14, Apollo 15, Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 used this training on the Moon. Notable geologist instructors included William R. Muehlberger.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe volcano has been a tourist attraction since the 1840s, and local businessmen such as Benjamin Pitman and George Lycurgus ran a series of hotels at the rim, including Volcano House which is still the only hotel or restaurant located within the borders of the Hawai?i Volcanoes National Park.[93] In 1891, Lorrin A. Thurston, grandson of the American missionary Asa Thurston and investor in hotels along the volcano's rim, began campaigning for a park on the volcano's slopes, an idea first proposed by William Richards Castle, Jr. in 1903. Thurston, who owned the Honolulu Advertiser newspaper, printed editorials in favor of the idea; by 1911 Governor Walter F. Frear had proposed a draft bill to create  \\"Kilauea National Park\\". Following endorsements from John Muir, Henry Cabot Lodge, and former President Theodore Roosevelt (in opposition to local ranchers) and several legislative attempts introduced by delegate Jonah Khi Kalaniana'ole, House Resolution 9525 was signed into law by Woodrow Wilson on August 1, 1916. It was the 11th National Park in the United States, and the first in a Territory;[94] a few weeks later, the National Park Service Organic Act was signed into law, creating the National Park Service and tasking it with running the expanding system.[95] Originally called \\"Hawaii National Park\\", it was split from the Haleakala National Park on September 22, 1960. Today, the park, renamed the Hawai?i Volcanoes National Park, is a major conservatory agency and tourist attraction, and, since 1987, a World Heritage Site.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its early days, tourism was a relatively new concept, but grew slowly before exploding with the advent of air travel around 1959, the year Hawai?i became a state. Today, tourism is driven by the island's exotic tropical locations,[97] and Kؐlauea, being one of the few volcanoes in the world in a more or less constant state of moderate eruption, was a major part of the island's tourist draw.[98] Until its closure on May 11 due to the danger and damage associated with the 2018 Lower East Rift Zone and summit events, Kؐlauea was visited by roughly 2.6 million people annually, most of whom proceeded to visit the volcano from the Kilauea Visitor Center near the park entrance. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum was also a popular tourist stop; located at the edge of Kؐlauea caldera, the museum's observation deck offered the best sheltered view on the volcano of the activity at Halema'uma'u Crater. The Volcano House provided the nearest lodging, and the nearby Volcano Village the most numerous; visitors associated with the military could find lodging at the Kilauea Military Camp. A number of hiking trails, points of interest, and guided ranger programs existed, and the Chain of Craters Road, Hilina Pali Road, and Crater Rim Drive provided access.[99][100] In 2008, a Lava Viewing Area was opened by the county for tourists in Kalapana, on the southeastern side of the National Park, accessible only from State Route 130.[101]","input":"What island in hawaii is the volcano active?"},{"output":"2,430","context":"The Major League Baseball (MLB) season schedule consists of 162 games for each of the 30 teams in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), played over approximately six monthsa total of 2,430 games, plus the postseason. The regular season runs from late March/early April to late September/early October, followed by the postseason which can run to early November.  The season begins with the official Opening Day, and, as of 2018, runs 26? weeks through the last Sunday of September or first Sunday of October. One or more International Opener games may be scheduled outside the United States before the official Opening Day.[1][2] It is possible for a given team to play a maximum of 20 games in the postseason in a given year, provided the team is a wild card and advances to each of the Division Series, Championship Series, and World Series with each series going the distance (5 games in the Division Series, 7 games each in the League Championship Series/World Series).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regular season is constructed from series.  Due to travel concerns and the sheer number of games, pairs of teams are never scheduled to play single games against each other (except in the instance of making up a postponed game); instead they play games on several consecutive days in the same ballpark.  Most often the series are of three or four games, but two-game series are also scheduled.  Teams play one mid-week series and one weekend series per week. Depending on the length of the series, mid-week series games are usually scheduled between Monday and Thursday, while weekend games are scheduled between Thursday and Monday.  Beginning in 2018, teams start and end their season on a weekend for a total of 26? weeks. Due to the mid-week all-star break in July, teams are scheduled to play 27 weekend series and 25 mid-week series for a total of 52 series (24 divisional series, 20 inter-divisional series, 8 inter-league series).  A team's road games are usually grouped into a multi-series road trip; home series are grouped into homestands.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that rainouts and other cancellations are often rescheduled ad hoc during the season, sometimes as doubleheaders.  However, if two teams are scheduled to meet for the final time in the last two weeks of the season, and the game is cancelled, it may not be rescheduled if there is no impact on the divisional or wild card races.  For example, in 2016, the September 29 game between the Cleveland Indians and Detroit Tigers was cancelled due to rain because the teams were unable to reschedule a make-up date before the end of the season on October 2, and it did not affect the divisional race.  In contrast, a 2008 AL Central division game between Detroit and the Chicago White Sox needed to be made up following the last day of the regular season because it affected a division race involving the White Sox and the Minnesota Twins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis account gives the length of the major league \\"championship season\\" schedule by league and year. It does not cover the curtailment of play by war (1918) or by strikes and lockouts (1972, 1981, 1994). The schedules for 1995 were revised and shortened from 162 to 144 games, after late resolution of the strike that had begun in 1994 required a delay in the season to accommodate limited spring training.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe listed years are those in which the league revised its schedule. For example, the National League (NL) scheduled 84 games during 1879, 1880, 1881, and 1882 ÿ that is, four seasons from 1879, ending before 1883, the next listing. 1876 is listed here for convenience although the NL did not schedule games (see 1871 to 1876, below).\\r\\n\\r\\n1882 ÿ 1891\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the AA expanded its schedule to 140 games two years before the National League did so. After 1891 four AA clubs joined the NL and four were bought out, nominally creating one big league, the \\"National League and American Association\\" of 12 clubs.\\r\\n\\r\\n1884\\r\\n\\r\\n1890\\r\\n\\r\\n1914: 1915\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (1871ÿ1875) did not schedule games, nor did it control the number of teams, a major reason for its demise after the 1875 season. Clubs paid a $10 entry fee, later $20, to enter the Association for one season, and thereby declare for that year's national championship. Without continuing membership or heavy investment, there was little to deter a team from breaking a commitment, and though it happened, it was mainly due to clubs going out of business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National League organized for 1876 on a different basis, granting exclusive memberships to eight clubs that would continue from year to year  it was generally expected, if only because membership would be profitable. But the new league followed its predecessor in merely agreeing that each club would play a certain number of matches to a decision (excluding ties) by a certain date.  Boston played 70 games with its quota of ten decisions against every rival. The others achieved 56 to 68 decisions, 64 to 66 for the four western teams as the teams from New York and Philadelphia (eastern) abandoned their schedule-concluding road trips.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all six early seasons, prior to the first league schedule in 1877, member clubs scheduled their own matches by mutual arrangement, including championship games necessarily with member clubs, other games with members, and games with non-member clubs. Some may have practically dictated their arrangements with some others, but there was no central control or coordination.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis listing gives the greatest number of games played by any club for each season. Naturally, the leader by games played was always a strong club fielding one of the better gate attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leading numbers of games played to a decision were 33, 54, 59, 71, 82, and 70 decisions; by the listed teams except the Mutuals in 1872.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1998, there have been 30 major league teams with a single advance schedule for every season that comprises 2430 games.  Each team plays 162 games, 81 as the \\"home\\" team, 81 as the \\"visitor\\". (This is true even on the rare occasion when a game is played at a ballpark not home to either team.)  Occasionally, the advance schedule is subsequently altered due to a game postponement or a one-game tie-breaker to determine which team will play in the postseason.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore 2013, the schedule included 252 \\"interleague games\\" that matched one team from the American League and one from the National League; the other 2178 games matched a pair from within one league. About half of the latter matched teams from within one division and about half matched teams from different divisions in one league. In the Central Division of the National League, which alone had six teams, every pair of division rivals played 15 or 16 games. Within the other, smaller divisions every pair of teams played 18 or 19 games. These interleague games were played from late May to mid-to-late June.\\r\\n\\r\\nDivision games (1091). There are 61 pairs of teams from within one division.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther intraleague games (1087). There are 150 pairs of teams from two different divisions within one league.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe schedule for interleague play comprised 84 three-game series in each season from 1998 to 2012, divided as six series (18 games) for each of fourteen AL teams and as many as six for each of sixteen NL teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the 224 interleague pairs of teams, 11 played six games every year, which were scheduled in two three-game series \\"home and home\\", or one at each home ballpark. Five of these 11 special arrangements matched two teams in the same city or in neighboring cities, where they wholly or partly share territorial rights. Six were regional matches at greater distance, four of which were in the same state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese special local and regional series accounted for 66 interleague games annually from 1998-2012, and the other 186 games were determined by rotation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2001 season was suspended for one week due to the September 11 terrorist attacks and resulting disruptions in travel, resulting in games scheduled for September 11ÿ16 being rescheduled to the first week of October and the playoffs and World Series being rescheduled one week later than their originally planned dates, which resulted in the World Series continuing into early November for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchedule changes for 2013, precipitated by realignment that created two equal-sized leagues of 15 teams each, gave every team 20 interleague games.[3] Sixteen of which were determined by a match of divisions, one from each league; all teams in a given division play all teams in a given division from the other league. (Each plays a three-game series against four teams from the designated division and two two-game series against the remaining team.) With this change, interleague games were now scattered throughout the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe matched divisions rotate annually:\\r\\n\\r\\nEach team played its four other interleague games against a designated \\"natural rival\\", with two games in each club's city. Thus all 30 teams, rather than 22 of 30 as previously, were deemed to have a natural rival in the other league. In 2013 the natural rivalry games were all scheduled for May 27 to May 30 (Memorial Day weekend) but in 2014 their scheduled dates range from May to August.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen of the natural rivalries from 2012 and earlier continued, while the HoustonÿTexas \\"Lone Star\\" rivalry had been transformed into an intra-division one with 19 games played. Five of the special arrangements were new in 2013 , including one each for Houston and Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 2014, four (4) of the five (5) new rivalries have been revised (?), all except Detroit and Pittsburgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery team now plays 19 games against each of 4 opponents within its division (76 games), and 6 or 7 games against each of 10 opponents from other divisions within its own league (66 games).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen corresponding divisions (i.e. NL East vs. AL East) play each other, a slight adjustment was made to the interleague games. Teams now play 6 games against their rival and 4 games (home and home) against two opponents plus one home and one away 3 game series (14 total) against the other four teams in the opposing division.  This was done in 2015, and will next occur in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the new collective bargaining agreement reached in December 2016, several changes were done to the scheduling pattern for the 2018 season. The overall length of the season has been extended to 187 days with the addition of four off-days for all teams. All teams will play on Opening Day, which for 2018 will be held on March 29. Sunday Night Baseball will no longer be played on the final Sunday before the All-Star Game, in order to ease travel time for those who are participating in the Home Run Derby. A single, nationally televised afternoon game will be played the following Thursday, with all other teams returning to play on Friday.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nStart of Major League Baseball games depends on days of the week, game number in series, holidays, and other factors. Most games start at 7pm in the local time zone, so there are more night games than day games even though baseball is traditionally played during the day. The reason why there are more night baseball games is to attract more fans to ballparks as well as viewers from home because most fans would be at work or school during the day. On Mondays (excluding Opening Day and holidays), Tuesdays, and Fridays, games are almost exclusively played at night except for Cubs home games. Getaway days, days on which teams play their last game of the series before departing for another series in another city the next day, are usually day games, mainly Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. On Sundays, usually all but one are day games, with the final game reserved for ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout half of Saturday games are day games (1, 2 or 4pm ET).  In some markets, Saturday night start an hour earlier than usual night start times, but other cities start Saturday night games at the same time as weeknight games. In conclusion, weekday games are only played at night except for getaway days while many weekend games are played during the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial pitch typically occurs 5 or 10 minutes after the hour, in order to allow time for pre-game ceremonies.","input":"How many total games in an mlb season?"},{"output":"to make it possible for people to remain at home rather than use residential, long-term, or institutional-based nursing care","context":"Home care (also referred to as domiciliary care, social care, or in-home care) is supportive care provided in the home. Care may be provided by licensed healthcare professionals who provide medical treatment needs or by professional caregivers who provide daily assistance to ensure the activities of daily living (ADLs) are met. In-home medical care is often and more accurately referred to as home health care or formal care. Often, the term home health care is used to distinguish it from non-medical care, custodial care, or private-duty care which refers to assistance and services provided by persons who are not nurses, doctors, or other licensed medical personnel.  For terminally ill patients, home care may include hospice care. For patients recovering from surgery or illness, home care may include rehabilitative therapies.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHome health services help adults, seniors, and pediatric clients who are recovering after a hospital or facility stay, or need additional support to remain safely at home and avoid unnecessary hospitalization. These Medicare-certified services may include short-term nursing, rehabilitative, therapeutic, and assistive home health care. This care is provided by registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPN's), physical therapists (PTs), occupational therapists (OTs), speech language pathologists (SLPs), home health aides (HHAs) and medical social workers (MSWs) as a limited number of up to one hour visits, addressed primarily through the Medicare Home Health benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest segment of home care consists of licensed and unlicensed non-medical personnel, including caregivers[2] who assist the individual. Care assistants may help the individual with daily tasks such as bathing, eating, cleaning the home and preparing meals. Caregivers work to support the needs of individuals who require such assistance. These services help the client to stay at home versus living in a facility. Non-medical home care is paid for by the individual or family. The term \\"private-duty\\" refers to the private pay nature of these relationships. Home care (non-medical) has traditionally been privately funded as opposed to home health care which is task-based and government or insurance funded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese traditional differences in home care services are changing as the average age of the population has risen. Individuals typically desire to remain independent and use home care services to maintain their existing lifestyle. Government and Insurance providers are beginning to fund this level of care as an alternative to facility care. In-Home Care is often a lower cost solution to long-term care facilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessionals providing home health care include licensed practical nurses, registered nurses,  physical therapists, occupational therapists and social workers. Rehabilitation services may be provided by physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech and language pathologists and dietitians.[citation needed] Professionals can be independent practitioners, part of a larger organization, or part of a franchise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome care aides, Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), and caregivers are trained to provide non-custodial or non-medical care, such as help with dressing, bathing, getting in and out of bed, and using the toilet. They may also prepare meals, accompany the client to medical visits, grocery shop, provide companionship and do various other errands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Home care\\", \\"home health care\\" and \\"in-home care\\" are phrases that have been used interchangeably in the United States to mean any type of care - skilled or otherwise - given to a person in their own home. There is, however, a distinction made on a state-by-state basis according to how each state regulates the home care industry. In New York State, for example, \\"home health care\\" is used to describe medical services performed at home by a healthcare professional, whereas \\"home care\\" describes non-medical, private duty care. Other states do not make the same distinction, but the difference between the two must be accounted for when dealing with Medicare reimbursements.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nHome care aims to make it possible for people to remain at home rather than use residential, long-term, or institutional-based nursing care. Home health care providers deliver services in the client's own home. These services may include some combination of professional health care services and life assistance services. Professional home health services may include medical or psychological assessment, wound care, medication teaching, pain management, disease education and management, physical therapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy. Home care services include help with daily tasks such as meal preparation, medication reminders, laundry, light housekeeping, errands, shopping, transportation, and companionship. Home care is often an integral component of the post-hospitalization recovery process, especially during the initial weeks after discharge when the patient still requires some level of regular physical assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile there are differences in terms used in describing aspects of home care or home health care in the United States and other areas of the world, for the most part the descriptions are very similar.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimates for the U.S. indicate that most home care is informal, with families and friends providing a substantial amount of care. For formal care, the health care professionals most often involved are nurses followed by physical therapists and home care aides. Other health care providers include respiratory and occupational therapists, medical social workers and mental health workers. Home health care is generally paid for by Medicaid, Medicare, long term insurance, or paid with the patient's own resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome health care software or home care software falls under the broad category of Health care Information Technology (HIT). HIT is \\"the application of information processing involving both computer hardware and software that deals with the storage, retrieval, sharing, and use of health care information, data, and knowledge for communication and decision making\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state department of health issues requirement for that state.

Companion assistance is provided by a home maker companion agency whereas nursing services and assistance with ADLs can be provided by a home health agency or nurse registry. The state licensing authority is the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nCompensation varies according to discipline, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the 2012 median hourly wage for home health aides was $10.01 per hour with the median annual wage of $20,820.[7] There is a fair deal of variance in the compensation offered to Home health aides across different states. For example, Alaska had the highest annual wage of approximately $29,100 and West Virginia on the other end of the spectrum had the average salary of $18,020.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1974 until 2015, home care work was classified as a \\"companionship service\\" and exempted from federal overtime and minimum wage rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Supreme Court considered arguments on the companionship exemption in a case brought by a home care worker represented by counsel provided by Service Employees International Union. This 2003 case, Evelyn Coke v. Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. and Maryann Osborne, argued that agency-employed home caregivers should be covered under overtime and minimum wage regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvelyn Coke, a home care worker employed by a home care agency that was not paying her overtime, sued the agency in 2003, alleging that the regulation construing the \\"companionship services\\" exemption to apply to agency employees and exempt them from the federal minimum wage and overtime law is inconsistent with the law.[9] The Supreme Court heard the case in 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the court decision, the court stated the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 exempted from the minimum wage and maximum hours rules of the FSLA persons \\"employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for individuals ... unable to care for themselves.\\" 29 U. S. C. 213(a)(15). The court found that the power of the Department of Labor (DOL)  to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the making of rules to fill any 'gap' left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress, and when that agency fills that gap reasonably, it is binding. In this case, one of the gaps was whether to include workers paid by third parties in the exemption and the DOL had done that. Since the DOL followed public notice procedure, and since there was a gap left in the legislation, the DOLs regulation stood and home health care workers were not covered by either minimum wage or overtime pay requirements (but see below).\\r\\n\\r\\nA rule issued from the DOL, entitled \\"Application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to Domestic Service,\\" and meant to be effective from January 1, 2015,  was written to revise \\"the definition of 'companionship services' to clarify and narrow the duties that fall within the term; in addition third party employers, such  as home care agencies, will not be able to claim either of the exemptions [from federal overtime or minimum wage rules.] The major effect of this Final Rule [would be] that more domestic service workers will be protected by the FLSA's minimum wage, overtime, and recordkeeping provisions.\\"[10] However, Home Care Associates of America, the International Franchise Association (IFA), and the National Association for Home Care & Hospice sued the DOL in regards to the rule, and a federal district court threw out the rule.[11] The Labor Department then appealed.[11] In August 2015, the rule was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n710,000 paid by Medicare - Medicare often is the primary billing source, if this is the primary carrier between two types of insurance (like between Medicare and Medicaid).

In the 1940s, Swedes Arne Andersson and Gunder H?gg lowered the record to just over four minutes (4:01.4) while racing was curtailed during World War II in the combatant countries. After the war, John Landy of Australia and Britain's Roger Bannister vied to be the first to break the fabled four-minute mile barrier. Roger Bannister did it first on May 6, 1954, and John Landy followed 46 days later.

Metaphase accounts for approximately 4% of the cell cycle's duration.[citation needed] Preceded by events in prometaphase and followed by anaphase, microtubules formed in prophase have already found and attached themselves to kinetochores in metaphase.\\r\\nIn metaphase, the centromeres of the chromosomes convene themselves on the metaphase plate (or equatorial plate),[2] an imaginary line that is equidistant from the two centrosome poles. This even alignment is due to the counterbalance of the pulling powers generated by the opposing kinetochore microtubules,[3] analogous to a tug-of-war between two people of equal strength, ending with the destruction of B cyclin.[4] In certain types of cells, chromosomes do not line up at the metaphase plate and instead move back and forth between the poles randomly, only roughly lining up along the middleline.[citation needed] Early events of metaphase can coincide with the later events of prometaphase, as chromosomes with connected kinetochores will start the events of metaphase individually before other chromosomes with unconnected kinetochores that are still lingering in the events of prometaphase.[citation needed]\\r\\nOne of the cell cycle checkpoints occurs during prometaphase and metaphase. Only after all chromosomes have become aligned at the metaphase plate, when every kinetochore is properly attached to a bundle of microtubules, does the cell enter anaphase. It is thought that unattached or improperly attached kinetochores generate a signal to prevent premature progression to anaphase, even if most of the kinetochores have been attached and most of the chromosomes have been aligned. Such a signal creates the mitotic spindle checkpoint. This would be accomplished by regulation of the anaphase-promoting complex, securin, and separase.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe analysis of metaphase chromosomes is one of the main tools of classical cytogenetics and cancer studies. Chromosomes are condensed (thickened) and highly coiled in metaphase, which makes them most suitable for visual analysis. Metaphase chromosomes make the classical picture of chromosomes (karyotype). For classical cytogenetic analyses, cells are grown in short term culture and arrested in metaphase using mitotic inhibitor. Further they are used for slide preparation and banding (staining) of chromosomes to be visualised under microscope to study structure and number of chromosomes (karyotype). Staining of the slides, often with Giemsa (G banding) or Quinacrine, produces a pattern of in total up to several hundred bands. Normal metaphase spreads are used in methods like FISH and as a hybridization matrix for comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) experiments.\\r\\nMalignant cells from solid tumors or leukemia samples can also be used for cytogenetic analysis to generate metaphase preparations. Inspection of the stained metaphase chromosomes allows the determination of numerical and structural changes in the tumor cell genome, for example, losses of chromosomal segments or translocations, which may lead to chimeric oncogenes, such as bcr-abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia.","input":"What does a chromosome look like during metaphase?"},{"output":"the Balkans","context":"The powder keg of Europe or Balkan powder keg was the Balkans in the early part of the 20th century preceding World War I. There were a number of overlapping claims to territories and spheres of influence between the major European powers such as the Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the German Empire and, to a lesser degree, the Ottoman Empire, the United Kingdom and Kingdom of Italy.\\r\\nIn addition to the imperialistic ambitions and interests in this region, there was a growth in nationalism with the indigenous peoples of this region leading to the formation of the independent states of Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Romania and Albania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin these nations there were movements to create \\"greater\\" nations, that is to enlarge the boundaries of the state beyond those areas where the national ethnic group was in the majority (irredentism). This led to conflict between the newly independent nations and the empire from which they split, the Ottoman Empire. Additionally, it led to differences between the Balkan nations who wished to gain territory at the expense of their neighbours. Both the conflict with the Ottoman Empire and between the Balkan nations led to the Balkan Wars in 1912ÿ13.\\r\\nIn a different vein, the ideology of Pan-Slavism in Balkans gained popularity; the movement built around it in the region sought to unite all of the Slavs of the Balkans into one nation, Yugoslavia. This, however, would require the union of several Balkan states and territory which was part of Austria-Hungary. For this reason, Pan-Slavism was strongly opposed by Austria-Hungary, while it was supported by Russia which viewed itself as leader of all Slavic nations.\\r\\nTo complicate matters, in the years preceding World War I, there existed a tangle of Great Power alliances, both formal and informal, public and secret. Following the Napoleonic Wars there had existed a \\"balance of power\\" to, in theory, prevent major wars. This theory held that opposing combinations of powers in Europe would be evenly matched entailing that any general war would be far too costly for any nation to risk entering. This system began to fall apart as the Ottoman Empire which had been seen as a check on Russian power began to crumble, and as Germany, which had been a loose confederation of minor states, was united into a major power. Not only did these changes lead to a realignment of power, but of interests as well.\\r\\nAll these factors, and many others, conspired to bring about the First World War. As is insinuated by the name \\"the powder keg of Europe,\\" the Balkans were not the major issue at stake in the war, but were merely the catalyst that led to the conflagration. The Chancellor of Germany in the late 19th century, Otto von Bismarck, correctly predicted it would be the source of major conflict in Europe.\\r\\nThe powder keg \\"exploded\\" causing the First World War, which began with a conflict between imperial Austria-Hungary and Pan-Slavic Serbia. Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, a member of the Austrian royal family, was assassinated by a Bosnian of Serb extraction, a member of the Young Bosnia movement. Austria-Hungary then issued an ultimatum to Serbia intended to provoke it to war through extreme demands. The Serbian government reservedly accepted all of the conditions of the ultimatum, except for condition number six which demanded the inclusion of Austria-Hungary in Serbia's judicial inquiry into the assassination.\\r\\nSerbia indicated this would be unconstitutional and a violation of its sovereignty, and Austria-Hungary used it as a casus belli to invade Serbia. With Germany fully supporting them, the Austro-Hungarians partially mobilized their army against Serbia, which had already begun mobilizing before replying to the Austro-Hungarian July Ultimatum. Russia then began mobilizing in support of Serbia, though not bound by treaty to do so. Due to the system of European alliances, this led to a series of escalating Austrian and Russian mobilizations and eventually Britain and France were also obliged to mobilize and declare war.","input":"What region was referred to as the powderkeg of europe?"},{"output":"the North Pole","context":"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, popularly known as \\"Santa's ninth reindeer\\", is a fabled reindeer created by Robert Lewis May. Rudolph is usually depicted as the lead reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve, though he is a young buck who has only adolescent antlers and a glowing red nose. Though he receives scrutiny for it, the luminosity of his nose is so great that it illuminates the team's path through harsh winter weather.\\r\\nRudolph first appeared in a 1939 booklet written by Robert L. May and published by Montgomery Ward, the department store.[1][2][3]\\r\\nThe story is owned by The Rudolph Company, LP and has been adapted in numerous forms including a popular song, the iconic 1964 television special and sequels, and a feature film and sequel. Character Arts, LLC manages the licensing for the Rudolph Company, LP. In many countries, Rudolph has become a figure of Christmas folklore. 2014 marked the 75th anniversary of the character[4] and the 50th anniversary of the television special.[5] A series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6, 2014.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert L. May created Rudolph in 1939 as an assignment for Chicago-based Montgomery Ward. The retailer had been buying and giving away coloring books for Christmas every year and it was decided that creating their own book would save money. May considered naming the reindeer \\"Rollo\\" or \\"Reginald\\" before deciding upon using the name \\"Rudolph.\\"[8] In its first year of publication, Montgomery Ward distributed 2.4 million copies of Rudolph's story.[9] The story is written as a poem in anapestic tetrameter, the same meter as \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" (also known as \\"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\\").[citation needed] Publication and reprint rights for the book Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer are controlled by Pearson PLC.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile May was pondering how best to craft a Christmas story about a reindeer, while staring out his office window in downtown Chicago, a thick fog from Lake Michigan blocked his viewgiving him a flash of inspiration. \\"Suddenly I had it!\\" he recalled. \\"A nose! A bright red nose that would shine through fog like a spotlight.\\"[10]\\r\\nThe cultural significance of a red nose has changed since the story's publication. In 1930's popular culture, a bright red nose was closely associated with chronic alcoholism and drunkards, so the story idea was initially rejected. May asked his illustrator friend at Montgomery Ward, Denver Gillen, to draw \\"cute reindeer\\", using zoo deer as models. The alert, bouncy character Gillen developed convinced management to support the idea.[11]\\r\\nMaxton Books published the first mass-market edition of Rudolph in 1947[citation needed] and a sequel, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Shines Again, in 1954.[citation needed] In 1992, Applewood Books published Rudolph's Second Christmas, an unpublished sequel that Robert May wrote in 1947.[citation needed] In 2003, Penguin Books issued a reprint version of the original Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer with new artwork by Lisa Papp.[citation needed] Penguin also reprinted May's sequels, Rudolph Shines Again and Rudolph's Second Christmas (now retitled Rudolph to the Rescue).[12]\\r\\nThe story chronicles the experiences of Rudolph, a youthful reindeer buck (male) who possesses an unusual luminous red nose. Mocked and excluded by his peers because of this trait, Rudolph proves himself one Christmas Eve with poor visibility due to inclement weather after Santa Claus catches sight of Rudolph's nose and asks Rudolph to lead his sleigh for the evening. Rudolph agrees, and is finally favored by his fellow reindeer for his heroism and accomplishment.\\r\\nRudolph made his first screen appearance in 1948, in a cartoon short produced by Max Fleischer for the Jam Handy Corporation that was more faithful to May's original story than Marks' song, which had not yet been written.[13] It was reissued in 1951 with the song added.[13]\\r\\nMay's brother-in-law, Johnny Marks, adapted the story of Rudolph into a song. Gene Autry's recording of the song hit No. 1 on the Billboard pop singles chart the week of Christmas 1949. Autry's recording sold 2.5 million copies the first year, eventually selling a total of 25 million, and it remained the second best-selling record of all time until the 1980s.[14]\\r\\nDC Comics, then known as National Periodical Publications, published a series of 13 annuals titled Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer from 1950 to 1962.[15][16] Rube Grossman drew most of the 1950s stories.[17]\\r\\nIn 1972, DC Comics published a 14th edition in an extra-large format. Subsequently, they published six more in that format: Limited Collectors' Edition C-24, C-33, C-42, C-50[18] and All-New Collectors' Edition C-53, C-60.[19]\\r\\nAdditionally, one digest format edition was published as The Best of DC #4 (MarchÿApril 1980).[20] The 1970s Rudolph stories were written and drawn by Sheldon Mayer.[21][22]\\r\\nIn 1958, Little Golden Books published an illustrated storybook, adapted by Barbara Shook Hazen and illustrated by Richard Scarry. The book, similar in story to the Max Fleischer cartoon short, is no longer in print,[citation needed] but a revised Little Golden Books version of the storybook was reissued in 1972.\\r\\nPerhaps the most well-known version of all the Rudolph adaptations is the Rankin/Bass Productions version of 1964.[citation needed] Filmed in Japan, with all sound recordings done in Toronto, Canada, the show premired on NBC. As the producers of the special only had the song as source material and did not have a copy of the original book, they interpolated an original story around the central narrative of the song, one that differed from the book. This re-telling chronicles Rudolph's social rejection among his peers and his decision to run away from home. Rudolph is accompanied by a similarly outcast elf named Hermey, who skipped elf practice to become a dentist, along with a loud, boisterous, eager prospector named Yukon Cornelius who was in search of wealth. Additional original characters include Rudolph's love interest, Clarice; the antagonistic \\"Abominable Snow Monster\\"; and, as narrator, the living Sam the Snowman, voiced by Burl Ives.\\r\\nIn the 1964 stop-motion movie, Rudolph is born to Donner the Reindeer and Donner's wife. He is discovered by Santa to have a shiny, glowing red nose. Donner, regardless of Rudolph's defect, trains him to be a normal reindeer with skills such as gathering food and hiding from the \\"Abominable Snow Monster\\", a giant, furry white beast. To hide Rudolph's nose, Donner puts dirt on it to cover it with a black coating. This causes Rudolph to talk in a funny accent, as told by the Rudolph's peers. A short time later, Rudolph joins his peers at the Reindeer Games, where he meets Fireball, who is initially friendly and has a shock of strawberry blond hair on his head, and Clarice, a female spectator who takes a liking to Rudolph. Clarice's flirtation inspires Rudolph to perform better than all of his peers at flying, but in his excitement he knocks the black cover off his nose, revealing a red glow that causes Fireball and the others to turn against him; this distraction, in turn, prompts the coach (Comet) to ban Rudolph from the Reindeer Games. Clarice remains loyal to him, only to be ordered by her father not to shame the family by associating with \\"a red-nosed reindeer.\\"\\r\\nRudolph soon runs into Hermey, an elf who was forced out of his job at the North Pole's toy factory; Hermey showed a total lack of interest in the toymaking and singing aspects of being an elf and instead wanted to pursue dentistry. They come to the conclusion that they're both misfits and decide to run away together. On their aimless journey, they run into Yukon Cornelius, the self-described \\"greatest prospector of the North\\" who nevertheless seems to never find any silver or gold, and attempt to stay away from the Bumble, a huge abominable snow monster. Their journey leads them to the Island of Misfit Toys, where sentient but unorthodox toys go when they are abandoned by their owners. King Moonracer, the winged lion that lords over the Island, refuses to let them stay there permanently, instead telling the trio to return home and tell Santa Claus of the toys' plight, in exchange for one night's stay on the island. Rudolph refuses the offer and, fearing for his friends' life, runs off alone.\\r\\nA now older Rudolph, still unable to find a place in the world, returns home to the North Pole, only to find that his family and Clarice had left to look for him and are now about to be eaten by the Bumble. With the help of Hermey and Yukon (who arrived separately), they lure the Bumble away and pacify him by knocking him unconscious and allowing Hermey (with dental skills he has acquired by reading books) to remove his sharp teeth. Everyone eventually returns to Santa's workshop, where a dismayed Santa Claus breaks the bad news that the weather is too bad to take the sleigh out and that Christmas would be canceled. Santa changes his mind when he notices Rudolph's red nose and asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh team, which he happily accepts.\\r\\nAfter the story's initial broadcast, its closing credits were revised. Images of wrapped presents being dropped from Santa's sleigh were replaced by a scene in which Santa stops to pick up the Misfit Toys and delivers them to the homes of children below, where they were found by children who loved them. The changes were prompted by viewer feedback pleading for a happy ending for each toy. The special now airs annually on CBS, rather than NBC, and is hailed as a classic by many. The special's original assortment of characters have acquired iconic status, and an uncertainty surrounding an error in the special's copyright has allowed the special to be widely parodied and imitated in the decades since its original airing.\\r\\nThe sequel Rudolph's Shiny New Year (premier air date December 10, 1976) continued the reindeer's journeys, and the series was made into a trilogy with the 1979 feature-length film Christmas in July, which integrated the Rudolph universe into that of Rankin/Bass's adaptation of Frosty the Snowman.\\r\\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie (1998) is an animated feature film. It received only a limited theatrical release before debuting on home video. Its inclusion of a villain, a love interest, a sidekick, and a strong protector are more derivative of the Rankin/Bass adaptation of the story than the original tale and song (the characters of Stormella, Zoey, Arrow, Slyly, and Leonard parallel the Rankin/Bass characters of the Bumble, Clarice, Fireball, Hermey, and Yukon, respectively). The movie amplifies the early backstory of Rudolph's harassment by his schoolmates (primarily his cousin Arrow) during his formative years.\\r\\nGoodTimes Entertainment, the producers of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie, brought back most of the same production team for a CGI animated sequel, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys (2001). Unlike the previous film, the sequel featured the original characters from the Rankin/Bass special (as GoodTimes soon learned that Rankin/Bass had made a copyright error that made the characters unique to their special free to use).\\r\\nA live-action version of Rudolph (complete with glowing nose) along with Donner and Blitzen appears in the Doctor Who Christmas special, \\"Last Christmas\\" which was broadcast on BBC One on 25 December 2014.[23] In this special, Santa is able to park him like a car and turn off his nose.\\r\\nNathaniel Dominy, an anthropology professor at Dartmouth College (Robert L. May's alma mater), published a scholarly paper on Rudolph's red nose in the open access online journal Frontiers for Young Minds in 2015. In the paper, Dominy noted that reindeer eyes can perceive shorter wavelengths of light than humans, allowing them to see ultraviolet light; ultraviolet light, however, is much more easily scattered in fog, which would blind reindeer. Thus, Rudolph's red nose, emitting longer-wavelength red light, would penetrate the fog more easily. A summary of Dominy's findings was released in an Associated Press article on December 22.[24]\\r\\nThree BBC animations carry on the legend by introducing Rudolph's son, Robbie the Reindeer. However, Rudolph is never directly mentioned by name (references are replaced by the first and second films' villain Blitzen interrupting with the phrase, \\"Don't say that name!\\", or something similar, presumably for copyright reasons.)\\r\\nRudolph is also given a younger brother, Rusty Reindeer, in the American special, Holidaze: The Christmas That Almost Didn't Happen (2006). Unlike in the \\"Robbie the Reindeer\\" cartoons, Rudolph's name is mentioned in the film.\\r\\nMichael Fry and T. Lewis have given Rudolph another brother in a series of Over the Hedge comic strips: an overweight, emotionally damaged reindeer named Ralph, the Infra-Red nosed Reindeer, who is referred to as Rudolph's older brother. Ralph's red nose is good for defrosting Santa's sleigh and warming up toast and waffles; he enviously complains about his brother Rudolph's publicity and his own anonymity.","input":"Where does rudolph the red nosed reindeer live?"},{"output":"S.

The restaurant is located in Hapeville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta,[3] and is near the location of the now-demolished Ford Motor Company Atlanta Assembly Plant, for many years a source of many of the restaurant's patrons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1961, after 15 years in the fast food business,  Cathy found a pressure-fryer that could cook the chicken sandwich in the same amount of time it took to cook a fast-food hamburger.[8] Following this discovery, he registered the name Chick-fil-A, Inc. The company's trademarked slogan, \\"We Didn't Invent the Chicken, Just the Chicken Sandwich,\\"[9] refers to their flagship menu item, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Chick-fil-A opened in 1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall, in a suburb of Atlanta.[3] During the 1970s and early 1980s, the chain expanded by opening new franchises in suburban malls' food courts.[10] The first freestanding franchise was opened April 16, 1986, on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta, Georgia,[11] and the company began to focus more on this type of franchise than on the food court type. Although it has expanded outward from its original geographic base, most new restaurants are located in Southern suburban areas.[3] In October 2015, the company opened a three-story 5,000-square-foot restaurant in Manhattan that became the largest free-standing Chick-fil-A in the country at that time.[12][13] As of 2016, the chain has approximately 1,950 locations.[3] It also has 31 drive-through-only locations.[3] Chick-fil-A also can be found at universities, hospitals, and airports through licensing agreements.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1997, the Atlanta-based company has been the title sponsor of the Peach Bowl, an annual college football bowl game played in Atlanta on New Year's Eve. Chick-fil-A also is a key sponsor of the SEC and the ACC of college athletics.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company expanded for the first time outside of the United States by opening an outlet at the Calgary International Airport in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in May 2014.[16][17] This restaurant is located near the departure area for flights bound for the United States.[16] However, as with its American locations, it is closed Sundays and Christmas Day (it is, however, open on what would be Thanksgiving Day in America; as Thanksgiving Day is celebrated the month prior in Canada).\\r\\n\\r\\nChick-fil-A retains ownership of each restaurant. Chick-fil-A selects the restaurant location and builds it.[1] Chick-fil-A franchisees need only a $10,000 initial investment to become an operator.[18] Each operator is handpicked and goes through a rigorous training program; the interviews plus training can take months and is not an easy process. Chick-fil-A states on their site: \\r\\n\\"This is not the right opportunity for you if you:\\r\\n\\r\\n[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2010, Chick-fil-A has led the fast food industry in average sales per restaurant, despite being open only six days a week,[20] earning an average $4.8 million per restaurant in 2016 (Whataburger was second with $2.7 million per restaurant).[21]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Eat Mor Chikin\\" is the chain's most prominent advertising slogan, created by The Richards Group in 1995.[6] The slogan is often seen in advertisements, featuring Holstein dairy cows[22] that are often seen wearing (or holding) signs that (usually) read: \\"Eat Mor Chikin\\" in all capital letters. The ad campaign was temporarily halted during a mad cow disease scare on January 1, 2004, so as not to make the chain seem insensitive or appear to be taking advantage of the scare to increase its sales. Two months later, the cows were put up again. The cows replaced the chain's old mascot, Doodles, an anthropomorphized chicken who still appears as the C on the logo.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nChick-fil-A vigorously protects its intellectual property, sending cease and desist letters to those they think have infringed on their trademarks.[24] The corporation has successfully protested at least 30 instances of the use of an \\"eat more\\" phrase, saying that the use would cause confusion of the public, dilute the distinctiveness of their intellectual property, and diminish its value.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2011 letter to Vermont artist Bo Muller-Moore who screen prints T-shirts reading: \\"Eat More Kale\\" demanded that he cease printing the shirts and turn over his website.[26] The incident drew criticism from Vermont governor Peter Shumlin, and created backlash against what he termed Chick-fil-A's \\"corporate bullying.\\"[27] On December 11, 2014, Bo Muller-Moore announced that the U.S. Patent Office granted his application to trademark his \\"Eat More Kale\\" phrase. A formal announcement of his victory took place on December 12, 2014, with Shumlin and other supporters on the Statehouse steps. His public fight drew regional and national attention, the support of Shumlin, and a team of pro-bono law students from the University of New Hampshire legal clinic.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 22 years with The Richards Group, Chick-fil-A switched to McCann New York in 2016. Along with the cows, ads included famous people in history in a campaign called \\"Chicken for Breakfast. It's not as crazy as you think.\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nTruett Cathy opened his first restaurant, The Dwarf Grill?ÿ later renamed the Dwarf House?ÿ in Hapeville, Georgia, in 1946, and developed the pressure-cooked chicken breast sandwich there.[3] At the original Chick-fil-A Dwarf Grill, in addition to the full-size entrances, there is also an extra small-sized front door.[32] The original Dwarf House in Hapeville, Georgia is open 24 hours a day, six days a week, except on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The store closes at 10:00?p.m. on Saturday nights, and the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas and reopens at 6?a.m. on Monday mornings and day after Thanksgiving and Christmas. It has a larger dine-in menu than the other Dwarf House locations as well as an animated seven dwarfs display in the back of the restaurant.[32] It was across the street from the former Ford Motor Company factory called Atlanta Assembly.\\r\\n\\r\\nTruett's original, full-service restaurants offer a substantial menu and provide customers a choice of table service, walk-up counter service or a drive-thru window. As of  2012[update], 13 Chick-fil-A Dwarf House restaurants were operating in the metro Atlanta area.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, the first Truett's Grill was opened in Morrow, Georgia. The second location opened in 2003 in McDonough, Georgia, and a third location opened in 2006 in Griffin, Georgia.[33] Similar to the Chick-fil-A Dwarf Houses, these independently owned restaurants offer traditional, sit-down dining and expanded menu selections in a diner-themed dinner.[34][35][36] In 2017, Chick-fil-A demolished several Dwarf House locations to replace them with Truett's Grill locations.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nS. Truett Cathy was a devout Southern Baptist; his religious beliefs had a major impact on the company.[39] The company's official statement of corporate purpose says that the business exists \\"To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.\\"[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nCathy's beliefs are also responsible for the chain's most well-known and distinctive feature: all Chick-fil-A locations (both corporate owned and franchised) are closed on Sundays,[41] as well as on Thanksgiving and Christmas.[42] Cathy states as the final step in his Five-Step recipe for Business Success \\"I was not so committed to financial success that I was willing to abandon my principles and priorities. One of the most visible examples of this is our decision to close on Sunday. Our decision to close on Sunday was our way of honoring God and of directing our attention to things that mattered more than our business.\\"[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview with ABC News's Nightline, Truett's son Dan T. Cathy told reporter Vicki Mabrey that the company is also closed on Sundays because \\"by the time Sunday came, he was just worn out. And Sunday was not a big trading day, anyway, at the time. So he was closed that first Sunday and we've been closed ever since. He figured if he didn't like working on Sundays, that other people didn't either.\\" The younger Cathy also quoted his father as saying, \\"I don't want to ask people to do that what I am not willing to do myself.\\"[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir website states, \\"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our Restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect ÿregardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\\"[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nChick-fil-A's reputation on being closed on Sundays extends to non-traditional locations. On December 17, 2017 Chick-fil-A broke their tradition and opened on a Sunday to prepare meals for passengers left stranded, during the power outage at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.[46] In addition to countless shopping malls and airports, a Chick-fil-A location at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta will be closed on Sundays despite its main tenant, the Atlanta Falcons, playing most of their home games on Sundays. The location will be open when the Falcons have a Monday night, Thursday night or Saturday home game, as well as non-Sunday home games of Atlanta United FC and other events at the stadium. On Sundays, the digital signs will be flipped and concessionaire Levy Restaurants will sell nonbranded food and drinks at the location.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis also applies to places that are known for round-the-clock activity.  For example, when Chick-fil-A finally expanded into the Las Vegas area following Cathy's death (as he never wanted to expand into the area due to what he perceived as the city's \\"sinful\\" image), all locations were open 24 hours a day (as most service industries are in the Las Vegas Valley), but still closed on Sunday, closing at 11:59PM on Saturday night and reopening at 12:01AM Monday morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2011, the media reported that Chick-fil-A was co-sponsoring a marriage conference with the Pennsylvania Family Institute (PFI), an organization that has opposed same-sex marriage legislation.[48][49][50][51][52] Chick-fil-A clarified that \\"one of our independent Restaurant Operators in Pennsylvania was asked to provide sandwiches to two Art of Marriage video seminars\\".[53] The WinShape Foundation, a charitable organization founded by Truett and his wife, also stated that it would not allow same-sex couples to participate in its marriage retreats.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nChick-fil-A has donated over $5?million, via WinShape, to groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Of this, more than $3?million was donated primarily to Christian organizations whose agendas included positions that oppose same-sex marriage,[55] with the money donated between 2003 and 2009.[56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63] A total of $1.9?million was donated in 2010 to groups such as the Marriage & Family Foundation, Exodus International, and the Family Research Council (FRC).[64] That year, the FRC, which received $1,000[56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63] was listed as an anti-gay[65] hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[66][67][68] WinShape has also contributed to Christian groups including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Exodus International, the latter of which is noted for supporting ex-gay conversion therapy.[64] In response, students at several colleges and universities worked to ban or remove the company's restaurants from their campuses. On January 28, 2013, Shane L. Windmeyer, the leader of Campus Pride, suspended their campaign.[69][70][71]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June and July 2012, Chick-fil-A's chief operating officer Dan T. Cathy made several public statements about same-sex marriage, saying that those who \\"have the audacity to define what marriage is about\\" were \\"inviting God's judgment on our nation\\".[72][73][74][75][76] Several prominent politicians expressed disapproval.[77] Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Chicago Alderman Proco \\"Joe\\" Moreno said they hoped to block franchise expansion into their areas.[78][79][80] The proposed bans drew criticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union.[81][82][83] The Jim Henson Company, which had a Pajanimals kids' meal toy licensing arrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship, and donate the payment to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.[84][85][86] Chick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys, claiming that unrelated safety concerns that had arisen prior to the controversy.[87] Chick-fil-A released a statement on July 31, 2012, saying, \\"We are a restaurant company focused on food, service, and hospitality; our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.\\"[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the controversy, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee initiated a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a boycott of Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists.[89][90][91] More than 600,000 people RSVPed on Facebook for Huckabee's appreciation event.[90]\\r\\nOn August 1, Chick-fil-A restaurants experienced a large show of public support across the nation with the company reporting record-breaking sales.[89][90][91] A consulting firm estimated that the average Chick-fil-A restaurant had 29.9 percent more sales and 367 more customers than it did on a typical Wednesday.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2012, The Civil Rights Agenda (TCRA) announced that Chick-fil-A had \\"ceased donating to organizations that promote discrimination, specifically against LGBT civil rights.\\"  Chick-fil-A officials did state in an internal document that they \\"will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation.\\"[92] In a letter from Chick-fil-A's Senior Director of Real Estate, the company states, \\"The WinShape Foundation is now taking a much closer look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process will remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with political agendas.\\"[93][94]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Chicago Alderman Proco \\"Joe\\" Moreno, Chick-fil-A has a statement of respect for all people regardless of sexual orientation in an internal document called Chick-fil-A: Who We Are. A document released by Chick-fil-A on September 20, 2012, does not mention any organizations opposed to same-sex marriage as being part of Chick-fil-A's donation base. WinShape Marriage will continue to be supported financially, with a stated focus on couple retreats to strengthen marriages.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Focus on the Family's website, CitizenLink.com, \\"Chick-fil-A and its charitable-giving arm, the WinShape Foundation, did not agree to stop making donations to groups that support the Biblical definition of marriage in exchange for being allowed to open a franchise in Chicago.\\"[96] Mike Huckabee stated that he \\"talked earlier today personally with Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick Fil-A about the new reports that Chick Fil-A had capitulated to demands of the supporters of same sex marriage. This is not true. The company continues to focus on the fair treatment of all of its customers and employees, but to end confusion gave me this statement.\\" The statement provided by Chick-fil-A was posted on Huckabee's website.[97][98]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of April 2018, Chick Fil-A reportedly continues to donate to anti-L.G.B.T. groups.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Chick-fil-A has always used trans-fat free processes in its chicken sandwiches, anticipating the dietary concerns of consumers, in 2008, it became the first fast-food restaurant to become completely trans-fat free.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, food blogger and activist Vani Hari wrote a post titled \\"Chick-fil-A or Chemical Fil-A?\\" on her website, FoodBabe.com. She noted that Chick-fil-A sandwiches contained nearly 100 ingredients, including peanut oil with TBHQ.[100] In October 2012, Chick-fil-A invited Hari to meet with company executives at its Atlanta, GA headquarters.[101] In December 2013, Chick-fil-A notified Hari that it had eliminated the dye Yellow No. 5 and had reduced the sodium content in its chicken soup. The company also said that it is testing a peanut oil that does not contain TBHQ and that it would start testing sauces and dressings made without high-fructose corn syrup in 2014.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration, antibiotics used in livestock, many of which are also used to treat humans, have contributed to the rise of dangerous bacteria. In December 2012, the FDA announced plans to phase out certain antibiotics in the food production industry.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2014, Chick-fil-A announced plans to serve chicken raised without antibiotics in its restaurants nationwide within five years. Chick-fil-A is the first quick service restaurant to set forth a plan and commit to serving only poultry raised without antibiotics.[103]","input":"Who is the founder of chick fil a?"},{"output":"December 1904","context":"Rolls-Royce Limited owned a British luxury car and aero engine manufacturing business founded in 1904 by Charles Stewart Rolls and Frederick Henry Royce. Rolls-Royce Limited was incorporated on 15 March 1906 as a vehicle for their ownership of their Rolls-Royce business. Their business quickly developed a reputation for superior engineering quality and for manufacturing the \\"best car in the world\\", building on F H Royce's existing standing. Rolls-Royce became a leading manufacturer of piston aero-engines after it was brought into building them by the First World War.\\r\\nFrom 1940, Rolls-Royce participated in the development of the jet engine and built for itself, and retains, a pre-eminent position in aero engine development and manufacture for use in defence and civil aircraft.\\r\\nIn the late 1960s, Rolls-Royce Limited became hopelessly crippled by its mismanagement of development of its advanced RB211 jet engine and the consequent cost over-runs. In 1971 their financial collapse was dealt with by sale, at a price which took some years to negotiate, of the entire business to a new government-owned company, Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited. Insolvent Rolls-Royce Limited was put into liquidation. Everything that could be sold off was sold off, but more than 46 years later there are still assets remaining to be sold.[1]\\r\\nRolls-Royce (1971) Limited continued to trade and realise the surplus assets bought from the former company. BAC was sold almost immediately, the profitable but now financially insignificant car division transferred in 1973 to a new subsidiary, Rolls-Royce Motors Holdings Limited, was sold to Vickers in 1980.\\r\\nIn 1977 Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited, given the necessary consent, was renamed Rolls-Royce Limited. It remained nationalised until 1987 when, renamed Rolls-Royce plc, the government sold its shares to the public. Today it owns and operates Rolls-Royce's principal business though it is no longer listed on the stock exchange. Instead it has been a subsidiary of a listed holding company currently Rolls-Royce Holdings plc since 2003.\\r\\nA marketing survey in 1987 showed that only Coca-Cola was a more widely known brand than Rolls-Royce.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1884 Henry Royce started an electrical and mechanical business. He made his first car, a two-cylinder Royce 10, in his Manchester factory in 1904. Henry Royce was introduced to Charles Rolls at the Midland Hotel, Manchester on 4 May of that year. Rolls was proprietor of an early motor car dealership, C.S.Rolls & Co. in Fulham.[3]\\r\\nIn spite of his preference for three- or four-cylinder cars, Rolls was impressed with the Royce 10, and in a subsequent agreement on 23 December 1904 agreed to take all the cars Royce could make. There would be four models:\\r\\nAll would be badged as Rolls-Royces, and be sold exclusively by Rolls. The first Rolls-Royce car, the Rolls-Royce 10 hp, was unveiled at the Paris Salon in December 1904.\\r\\nRolls-Royce Limited was formed on 15 March 1906, by which time it was apparent that new premises were required for production of cars. After considering sites in Manchester, Coventry, Bradford and Leicester, it was an offer from Derby's council of cheap electricity that resulted in the decision to acquire a 12.7 acres (51,000?m2) site on the southern edge of that city. The new factory was largely designed by Royce, and production began in early 1908, with a formal opening on 9 July 1908 by Sir John Montagu. The investment in the new company required further capital to be raised, and on 6 December 1906 S100,000 of new shares were offered to the public. In 1907, Rolls-Royce bought out C.S. Rolls & Co.[5] (The non-motor car interests of Royce Ltd. continued to operate separately.)\\r\\nDuring 1906 Royce had been developing an improved six-cylinder model with more power than the Rolls-Royce 30 hp. Initially designated the 40/50?hp, this was Rolls-Royce's first all-new model.[6] In March 1908 Claude Johnson, Commercial Managing Director and sometimes described as the hyphen in Rolls-Royce,[7] succeeded in persuading Royce and the other directors that Rolls-Royce should concentrate exclusively on the new model, and all the earlier models were duly discontinued.[3]\\r\\nThe new 40/50 was responsible for Rolls-Royce's early reputation with over 6,000 built. Its chassis was used as a basis for the first British armoured car used in both world wars.\\r\\nAero-engine manufacture began in 1914 because the government requested it.[3] Rolls-Royce's Eagle, the first example was made in 1915, was the first engine to make a non-stop trans-Atlantic crossing by aeroplane when in June 1919 two Eagles powered the converted Vickers Vimy bomber on the transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown.\\r\\nIn 1921 Rolls-Royce opened a new factory in Springfield, Massachusetts in the United States (to help meet demand) where a further 1,701 \\"Springfield Ghosts\\" were built. This factory operated for 10 years, closing in 1931. It was located at the former American Wire Wheel factory on Hendee Street, with the administration offices at 54 Waltham Ave.[8] Springfield was the earlier location for the Duryea Motor Wagon Company, the location where the first American gasoline-powered vehicle was built. Their first chassis was completed in 1921. Bodies were supplied by Rolls-Royce Custom Coachwork[citation needed] and by Brewster & Co. in Long Island City, New York.\\r\\nAfter the First World War, Rolls-Royce successfully avoided attempts to encourage British car manufacturers to merge. Faced with falling sales of the 40/50 (later known as Silver Ghost) Rolls-Royce introduced the smaller, cheaper Twenty in 1922, effectively ending the one-model policy followed since 1908.[3]\\r\\nAfter the introduction of the Phantom in 1925 the old 40/50 model was referred to as the Silver Ghost.\\r\\nIn 1931 Rolls-Royce acquired Bentley, the small sports/racing car maker and potential rival,[3] after the latter's finances failed to weather the onset of the Great Depression. Rolls-Royce stopped production of the new big Bentley 8 Litre, which was threatening sales of their current Phantom, disposed of remaining Bentley assets and made use of just the Bentley name and its repute. After some years of development Rolls-Royce produced a new quite different ultra-civilised medium-size range of Bentleys advertising them as \\"the silent sports car\\". They were very much in the Rolls-Royce mould. From soon after World War II until 2002 standard Bentley and Rolls-Royce cars were often very nearly identical apart from the radiator grille and minor details.\\r\\nIn 1933, the colour of the Rolls-Royce radiator monogram was changed from red to black because the red sometimes clashed with the coachwork colour selected by clients, and not as a mark of respect for the death of Royce as is commonly stated.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe British government built a shadow factory in Crewe in 1938 for Rolls-Royce where they could build their Merlin and Griffon aero engines. In 1946 car production was moved there for space to construct bodies and to leave space for aero engines at Derby. The site was bought from the government in 1973.[3] It is now Bentley Crewe\\r\\nIn 1940 a contract was signed with the Packard Motor Car Company in Detroit, Michigan, for the production of Merlin aero engines in the USA.\\r\\nProduction focussed on aero engines but a variant of the Merlin engine, known as the Meteor, was developed for the Cromwell tank. The Meteor's development completed in 1943 the same team at the Belper foundry restarted work on an eight-cylinder car engine widening its uses and it became the pattern for the British Army's B range of petrol engines for post war combat vehicles[3] in particular in Alvis's FV600 range,[nb 2] Daimler's Ferret, Humber's Hornet and Pig and Austin's Champ.\\r\\nAfter the war, in 1946, Rolls-Royce and Bentley car production moved to Crewe where they began to assemble complete Bentley cars with body pressings made by Pressed Steel Company. Previously they had built only the chassis, leaving the bodies to specialist coach-builders. In 1939 Rolls-Royce brought one of the specialist coachbuilders completely in-house by buying the remaining capital of Park Ward Limited which since 1936 in conjunction with Rolls-Royce had been building short production runs of all-metal saloon bodies on Bentley chassis.\\r\\nIn 1959 Rolls-Royce bought coachbuilder H J Mulliner[3] and the two businesses were put together as H J Mulliner Park Ward.\\r\\nLuxury cars did not fit with the new mood of postwar austerity. After starting design and development of what became their C series diesel engine range in 1948 Rolls-Royce began to produce diesel engines in 1951. By 1955 it provided diesel engines for automotive, railway, industrial, earth-moving and marine use.[3]\\r\\nSentinel (Shrewsbury) Limited was bought in 1956. Sentinel made machine tools and industrial locomotives. Rolls-Royce took over Sentinel's Shrewsbury factory for diesel engine production and all its diesel work was transferred there.[3]\\r\\nWest Riding manufacturer of diesel shunting locomotives, Thomas Hill (Rotherham) Limited, was added to the group in 1963.[3]\\r\\nIn 1973 when Shrewsbury activities were put under the umbrella of new owner, Rolls-Royce Motors, the range of diesel engines included:\\r\\nIn 1907, Charles Rolls, whose interests had turned increasingly to flying, tried unsuccessfully to persuade Royce and the other directors to design an aero engine. When World War I broke out in August 1914, Rolls-Royce (and many others) were taken by surprise. As a manufacturer of luxury cars, Rolls-Royce was immediately vulnerable, and Claude Johnson thought the bank would withdraw its overdraft facility on which Rolls-Royce depended at that time. Nevertheless, believing that war was likely to be short-lived the directors initially decided not to seek government work making aero engines. However, this position was quickly reversed and Rolls-Royce was persuaded by the War Office to manufacture fifty air-cooled V8 engines under licence from Renault.[5] Meanwhile, the Royal Aircraft Factory asked Rolls-Royce to design a new 200?hp (150?kW) engine. Despite initial reluctance they agreed, and during 1915 developed Rolls-Royce's first aero engine, the twelve-cylinder Eagle. This was quickly followed by the smaller six-cylinder Hawk, the 190?hp (140?kW) Falcon and, just before the end of the war, the larger 675?hp (503?kW) Condor.\\r\\nThroughout World War I, Rolls-Royce struggled to build aero engines in the quantities required by the War Office. However, with the exception of Brazil Straker in Bristol Rolls-Royce resisted pressure to license production to other manufacturers, fearing that the engines' much admired quality and reliability would risk being compromised. Instead the Derby factory was extended to enable Rolls-Royce to increase its own production rates.[5] By the late 1920s, aero engines made up most of Rolls-Royce's business.\\r\\nHenry Royce's last design was the Merlin aero engine, which was first flown in prototype form in 1935, although he had died in 1933. This was developed from the R engine, which had powered a record-breaking Supermarine S.6B seaplane to almost 400?mph (640?km/h) in the 1931 Schneider Trophy. The Merlin was a powerful supercharged V12 engine and was fitted into many World War II aircraft: the British Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire, de Havilland Mosquito (twin-engine), Avro Lancaster (four-engine) (a development of the Avro Manchester with its unreliable Rolls-Royce Vulture engines), Vickers Wellington (twin-engine); it also transformed the American North American P-51 Mustang into a competitor for the best fighter of its time, its engine a Merlin engine built by Packard under licence. Over 160,000 Merlin engines were produced, including over 30,000 by the Ford Motor Company at Trafford Park, Manchester. During the war most Rolls-Royce flight testing of engines was carried out from Hucknall Aerodrome. The Merlin crossed over into military land-vehicle use as the Meteor powering the Centurion tank among others. Many Meteor engines used engine blocks and parts that failed requirements for high performance engines, but were suitable for use in the derated 480?kW (640?hp) Meteor.\\r\\nRolls-Royce came into jet turbines through an exchange of assets with Rover and in the post-World War II period Rolls-Royce made significant advances in gas turbine engine design and manufacture. The Dart and Tyne turboprop engines were particularly important, enabling airlines to cut times for shorter journeys whilst jet airliners were introduced on longer services. The Dart engine was used in Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy, Avro 748, Fokker F27 Friendship, Handley Page Herald and Vickers Viscount aircraft, whilst the more powerful Tyne powered the Breguet Atlantique, Transall C-160, Short Belfast, and Vickers Vanguard, and the SR.N4 hovercraft. Many of these turboprops are still in service.\\r\\nAmongst the jet engines of this period was the RB163 Spey, which powers the Hawker Siddeley Trident, BAC One-Eleven, Grumman Gulfstream II and Fokker F28 Fellowship.\\r\\nDuring the late 1950s and 1960s there was a significant rationalisation of all aspects of British aerospace and this included aero-engine manufacturers. In 1966 Rolls-Royce acquired Bristol Siddeley (which had resulted from the merger of Armstrong Siddeley and Bristol Aero Engines in 1959) and incorporated it as the Bristol Siddeley division. Bristol Siddeley, with its principal factory at Filton, near Bristol, had a strong base in military engines, including the Olympus, Viper, Pegasus (vectored thrust) and Orpheus. They were also manufacturing the Olympus 593 Mk610 to be used in Concorde in collaboration with SNECMA. They also had a turbofan project with SNECMA.\\r\\nLeavesden Aerodrome, Watford was originally owned by the Ministry of Defence and used during World War II for the manufacture of Mosquito and Halifax aircraft. For a number of years, Rolls-Royce used the site for the manufacture of helicopter engines until the site closed in June 1993. The former Rolls-Royce factory at Watford is now known as the Leavesden Film Studios and has produced world-famous films, including the James Bond, Star Wars and Harry Potter series.\\r\\nThe amalgamations and disappearances of the 1950s and 1960s left a small number of major airframe manufacturers based in only a few countries. The competition for the very large contracts to supply their engines grew intense. Expensive research and development became vital. Real profits came from the maintenance contracts which might peak a whole human generation later. By the 1980s it was said that each generation of aero engines cost around 10 times that of its parent.[9]\\r\\nAt this time Rolls-Royce employed 80,000 people and it was Britain's 14th largest company in terms of manpower. It was generally known that problems had recently arisen requiring government support of the RB211 programme as one outcome of intense financial competition with Pratt & Whitney and General Electric[10] for the original RB211 contract.[11]\\r\\nIn the new year of 1971 financial problems caused largely by development of this new RB211 turbofan engine designed and developed for Lockheed Aircraft Corporation's new L-1011 TriStar led, after several government-provided cash subsidies, to the recognition Rolls-Royce had no resources left and it voluntarily entered receivership 4 February 1971.[12]\\r\\nThere were said to have been acrimonious telephone conversations between US president Richard Nixon and the British prime minister Edward Heath but these were subsequently denied. Responding to questions as to how the situation could have arisen the chief executive advised that in their calculations they were guided by the success of their estimates in the launching of their Spey engine.[13]\\r\\nHad the government simply nationalised Rolls-Royce it would have been unable to avoid the obligations to Lockheed.[14]\\r\\nThe situation was handled in the usual manner with the assets being sold for cash, in this case to the government, leaving the massive liabilities to be dealt with by Rolls-Royce Limited using the funds realised by the sale. However the government would not fix a purchase price for the assets until the situation became clearer because without a continuing business many of them might be worthless.[15][nb 3][16] In the meantime the government would use the assets to continue the activities of the aero-engine, marine and industrial gas turbine and small engine divisions that were important to national defence, the collective programmes with other countries and to many air forces and civil airlines.[17] A new company (1971) was incorporated that May to purchase substantially the whole of the undertakings and assets of the four divisions of Rolls-Royce connected with gas turbine engines. The original company, Rolls-Royce Limited, was placed in liquidation on 4 October 1971.[3]\\r\\nAsking their own government for support Lockheed warned that a switch to either Pratt & Whitney or General Electric engines would delay production by an extra six months and might force Lockheed into bankruptcy.[18]\\r\\nThe receiver negotiated with Lockheed which consented to waive damages allowing the plant to be shut down. The continuing support of the trade creditors was also achieved by the receiver in spite of threats to demand immediate payments in full and to withdraw supplies. The first asset sold was British Aircraft Corporation bought equally by Vickers and GEC. The receiver floated Rolls-Royce Motors in 1973.[14]\\r\\nThe new owner, Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited, had among its board members Lord Cole (a former chairman of Unilever), Sir Arnold Weinstock (managing director of GEC), Hugh Conway (managing director Rolls-Royce Gas Turbines), Dr Stanley Hooker (Rolls-Royce Bristol), Sir William Cook (an adviser to the Minister of Defence), Sir St. John Elstub (managing director of Imperial Metal Industries), and Sir Charles Elworthy (former Chief of Defence Staff).[19]\\r\\nThe new aircraft with its three RB211 engines left USA for the first time and arrived in Paris on 1 June 1971.[20] At Palmdale California the L-1011 received its US Federal Aviation Administration's certificate of airworthiness on 14 April 1972, nine months late. On the day the chairman of Lockeed said \\". . . we know that in airline service it (RB211) will prove itself to be one of the leading power plants in aviation history\\".[21]\\r\\nThe first airliner was delivered to Eastern Air Lines on 5 April 1972 but it had been beaten in the race to production by McDonnell Douglas's DC-10.\\r\\nRolls-Royce Motors Limited was incorporated on 25 April 1971, two and a half months after Rolls-Royce fell into receivership. Under the ownership of the receiver it began to trade in April 1971 manufacturing motor cars, diesel and petrol engines, coachwork and other items previously made by Rolls-Royce's motor car and diesel divisions and Mulliner Park Ward. It continued to take precision engineering work on sub-contracts. In June 1971 it acquired all the business and assets used by the motor car and diesel divisions of Rolls-Royce and Mulliner Park Ward. Rolls-Royce Motors' permitted uses of the various Rolls-Royce trade marks was very precisely defined[3]\\r\\nAt the end of 1972 Rolls-Royce Motors employees in the United Kingdom were 5,855 in the car division and 2,311 in the Diesel division, a total of 8,166 people.[3]\\r\\nIn May 1973 it was sold to Rolls-Royce Motors Holdings Limited in preparation for its public flotation.[3]\\r\\nAt that time the Car Division as well as making cars and special coachwork carried out investment foundry work and the machining of aero-engine components and produced piston engines for light aircraft together with other petrol and multi-fuel engines. Both divisions carried out development work for H M Government.\\r\\nThe car division's headquarters were in Pym's Lane and Minshull New Road, Crewe, bespoke coachbuilding remained in Hythe Road and High Road Willesden London. The Crewe former shadow factory premises were bought from the Government at this time.[3]\\r\\nThe Diesel Division made several types of diesel engine at its premises in Whitchurch Road, Shrewsbury as well as combustion equipment for aero turbine engines.[3]\\r\\nIn the event the flotation met with a disappointing public response and more than 80 percent of the issue was left in the hands of the underwriters.[22]\\r\\nOn 6 August 1980 the shareholders agreement to the merger of Rolls-Royce Motors Holdings and Vickers Limited became unconditional.[23]\\r\\nThe Rolls-Royce diesel business was acquired from Vickers in 1984 by Perkins. Perkins further developed the Eagle Diesels into the Perkins TX series of engines.\\r\\nThe name of Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited was changed to Rolls-Royce Limited on 31 December 1977 the end of the company's financial year. The original Rolls-Royce Limited incorporated in 1906 and still in liquidation had been renamed Rolls-Royce Realisations Limited[nb 4] and had consented in March 1977 to the (1971) company being named Rolls-Royce Limited[24][25][26]\\r\\nLimited was replaced by plc (public limited company) in the summer of 1986 so shares could be offered to the public and traded on sharemarkets.\\r\\nIn April 1987 the government offered for sale all Rolls-Royce plc shares. The heavily advertised issue was a remarkable success.[27]\\r\\nRolls-Royce's was an exceptionally long term business. Before a civil aero engine went into service its development could take 4 to 6 years, military engines often longer. Production might then extend a further 50 years including the manufacture of spare parts required long after complete engine production ends.[26]\\r\\nAccording to the prospectus published for the 1987 issue of shares to members of the public Rolls-Royce was by then one of only three enterprises outside USSR and China able to design develop and produce large gas turbine engines. At that time its engines were installed in the aircraft of more than 270 civil carriers and were used by 110 armed services and 700 operators of executive and corporate aircraft.[26]\\r\\nIn addition its turbines powered the naval vessels of 25 different nations. Over 175 industrial customers operated Rolls-Royce gas turbines for power generation, gas and oil pumping and other industrial purposes. Its single most important customer was the United Kingdom's government. In the preceding five years about 70 percent of production went outside the United Kingdom.[26]\\r\\nRolls-Royce's competitors were GE and Pratt & Whitney (UTC). Aero engines were then only a part of GE and UTC activities as major industrial groups.\\r\\nAt that time Rolls-Royce was organised into five business groups:\\r\\nBentley Models (from 1933) ÿ chassis only","input":"When was the first rolls royce car made?"},{"output":"4 October 1957","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSputnik 1  (/?sp?tn?k/ or /?sp?tn?k/; \\"Satellite-1\\", or \\"PS-1\\", 楰Ѿҿ쳭ҳ Ťҷҿ-1 or Prosteyshiy Sputnik-1, \\"Elementary Satellite 1\\")[5] was the first artificial Earth satellite.[6]  The Soviet Union launched it into an elliptical low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957, orbiting for three weeks before its batteries died, then silently for two more months before falling back into the atmosphere. It was a 58?cm (23?in) diameter polished metal sphere, with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. Its  radio signal was easily detectable even by radio amateurs,[7] and the 65 inclination and duration of its orbit made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth. This surprise success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race, a part of the Cold War. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nTracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided scientists with valuable information. The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced from its drag on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio signals gave data about the ionosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nSputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now known as the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite travelled at about 29,000 kilometres per hour (18,000?mph; 8,100?m/s), taking 96.2 minutes to complete each orbit. It transmitted on 20.005 and 40.002 MHz,[10] which were monitored by radio operators throughout the world. The signals continued for 21 days until the transmitter batteries ran out on 26 October 1957.[4] Sputnik burned up on 4 January 1958 while reentering Earth's atmosphere, after three months, 1440 completed orbits of the Earth,[1] and a distance travelled of about 70?million?km (43?million?mi).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 December 1954, chief Soviet rocket scientist Sergei Korolev proposed a developmental plan for an artificial satellite to Minister of Defence Industry Dimitri Ustinov. Korolev forwarded a report by Mikhail Tikhonravov with an overview of similar projects abroad.[12] Tikhonravov had emphasized that the launch of an orbital satellite was an inevitable stage in the development of rocket technology.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 29 July 1955, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced through his press secretary that the United States would launch an artificial satellite during the International Geophysical Year (IGY).[14] A week later, on 8 August, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union approved the proposal to create an artificial satellite.[15] On 30 August Vasily Ryabikov ÿ the head of the State Commission on R-7 rocket test launches ÿ held a meeting where Korolev presented calculation data for a spaceflight trajectory to the Moon. They decided to develop a three-stage version of the R-7 rocket for satellite launches.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 January 1956 the Council of Ministers approved practical work on an artificial Earth-orbiting satellite. This satellite, named Object D, was planned to be completed in 1957ÿ58; it would have a mass of 1,000 to 1,400?kg (2,200 to 3,100?lb) and would carry 200 to 300?kg (440 to 660?lb) of scientific instruments.[17] The first test launch of \\"Object D\\" was scheduled for 1957.[13] Work on the satellite was to be divided among institutions as follows:[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreliminary design work was completed by July 1956 and the scientific tasks to be carried out by the satellite were defined. These included measuring the density of the atmosphere and its ion composition, the solar wind, magnetic fields, and cosmic rays. These data would be valuable in the creation of future artificial satellites. A system of ground stations was to be developed to collect data transmitted by the satellite, observe the satellite's orbit, and transmit commands to the satellite. Because of the limited time frame, observations were planned for only 7 to 10 days and orbit calculations were not expected to be extremely accurate.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of 1956 it became clear that the complexity of the ambitious design meant that 'Object D' could not be launched in time because of difficulties creating scientific instruments and the low specific impulse produced by the completed R-7 engines (304 sec instead of the planned 309 to 310 sec). Consequently, the government rescheduled the launch for April 1958.[13] Object D would later fly as Sputnik 3.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nFearing the U.S. would launch a satellite before the USSR, OKB-1 suggested the creation and launch of a satellite in AprilÿMay 1957, before the IGY began in July 1957. The new satellite would be simple, light (100?kg or 220?lb), and easy to construct, forgoing the complex, heavy scientific equipment in favour of a simple radio transmitter. On 15 February 1957 the Council of Ministers of the USSR approved this simple satellite, designated 'Object PS'.[21]  This version allowed the satellite to be tracked visually by Earth-based observers, and it could transmit tracking signals to ground-based receiving stations.[21] The launch of two satellites, PS-1 and PS-2, with two R-7 rockets (8K71) was approved, provided that the R-7 completed at least two successful test flights.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe R-7 Semyorka was initially designed as an ICBM by OKB-1. The decision to build it was made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR on 20 May 1954.[22] The R-7 was also known by its GRAU (later GURVO) designation 8K71.[23] At the time, the R-7 was known to NATO sources as the T-3 or M-104,[24] and Type A.[25] A special reconnaissance commission selected Tyuratam for the construction of a rocket proving ground (the 5th Tyuratam range, usually referred to as \\"NIIP-5\\", or \\"GIK-5\\" in the post-Soviet time). The selection was approved on 12 February 1955 by the Council of Ministers of the USSR, but the site would not be completed until 1958.[26] Actual work on the construction of the site began on 20 July by military building units. On 14 June 1956 Sergei Korolev decided to adapt the R-7 rocket to the 'Object D',[27] that would later be replaced by the much lighter 'Object PS'.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first launch of an R-7 rocket (8K71 No.5L) occurred on 15 May 1957. A fire began in the Blok D strap-on almost immediately at liftoff, but the booster continued flying until T+98 seconds when the strap-on broke away and the vehicle crashed some 400?km downrange.[28] Three attempts to launch the second rocket (8K71 No.6) were made on 10ÿ11 June, but an assembly defect prevented launch.[29] The unsuccessful launch of the third R-7 rocket (8K71 No.7) took place on 12 July.[28] An electrical short caused the vernier engines to put the missile into an uncontrolled roll which resulted in all of the strap-ons separating 33 seconds into the launch. The R-7 crashed about 7?km from the pad.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe launch of the fourth rocket (8K71 No.8), on 21 August at 15:25 Moscow Time,[28] was successful. The rocket's core boosted the dummy warhead to the target altitude and velocity, reentered the atmosphere, and broke apart at a height of 10?km (6.2?mi) after traveling 6,000?km. On 27 August TASS issued a statement on the successful launch of a long-distance multistage ICBM. The launch of the fifth R-7 rocket (8K71 No.9), on 7 September[28] was also successful, but the dummy was also destroyed on atmospheric re-entry,[30] and hence needed a redesign to completely fulfill its military purpose. The rocket, however, was deemed suitable for satellite launches, and Korolev was able to convince the State Commission to allow the use of the next R-7 to launch PS-1,[31] allowing the delay in the rocket's military exploitation to launch the PS-1 and PS-2 satellites.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 22 September a modified R-7 rocket, named Sputnik and indexed as 8K71PS,[34] arrived at the proving ground and preparations for the launch of PS-1 began.[35] Compared to the military R-7 test vehicles, the mass of 8K71PS was reduced from 280 tonnes to 272 tonnes; its length with PS-1 was 29.167 metres (95?ft 8.3?in) and the thrust at lift off was 3.90?MN (880,000?lbf).[36] These weight reductions were accomplished by deleting the inertial guidance system, several telemetry measurements, and assorted hardware designed to support a warhead.\\r\\n\\r\\nPS-1 was not designed to be controlled; it could only be observed. Initial data at the launch site would be collected at six separate observatories and telegraphed to NII-4.[32] Located back in Moscow (at Bolshevo), NII-4 was a scientific research arm of the Ministry of Defence dedicated to missile development.[37] The six observatories, designated IP-1 through IP-6, were clustered around the launch site, with the closest (IP-1) situated at a distance of 1?km (0.62?mi) from the launch pad.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nA second, nationwide observation complex was established to track the satellite after its separation from the rocket. Called the Command-Measurement Complex, it consisted of the coordination center in NII-4 and seven distant stations situated along the line of the satellite's ground track.[38] These tracking stations were located at Tyuratam; Sary-Shagan; Yeniseysk; Klyuchi; Yelizovo; Makat in Guryev Oblast; and Ishkup in Krasnoyarsk Krai.[32][38] Stations were equipped with radar, optical instruments, and communications systems. Data from stations were transmitted by telegraphs into NII-4 where ballistics specialists calculated orbital parameters. The complex became an early prototype of the Soviet Mission Control Center.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe observatories used a trajectory measurement system called \\"Tral,\\" developed by OKB MEI, by which they received and monitored data from transponders mounted on the R-7 rocket's core stage.[40] The data was useful even after the satellite's separation from the second stage of the rocket; Sputnik's location was calculated from the data on the second stage's location which followed Sputnik at a known distance.[41] Tracking of the booster during launch had to be accomplished through purely passive means such as visual coverage and radar detection. R-7 test launches demonstrated that the tracking cameras were only good up to an altitude of 200?km (120?mi) but radar could track it for almost 400?km (250?mi).\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside the Soviet Union, the satellite was tracked by amateur radio operators in many countries.[42] The US government followed it from the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards.[43] The booster rocket was located and tracked by the British using the Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, the only telescope in the world able to do so by radar.[42] Canada's Newbrook Observatory was the first facility in North America to photograph Sputnik 1.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief constructor of Sputnik 1 at OKB-1 was Mikhail S. Khomyakov.[45] The satellite was a 585-millimetre (23.0?in) diameter sphere, assembled from two hemispheres that were hermetically sealed with o-rings and connected by 36 bolts. It had a mass of 83.6 kilograms (184?lb).[46] The hemispheres were 2?mm thick,[47] and were covered with a highly polished 1?mm-thick heat shield[48] made of aluminium-magnesium-titanium AMG6T alloy (\\"AMG\\" is an abbreviation for \\"aluminium-magnesium\\" and \\"T\\" stands for \\"titanium\\"; the alloy is 6% magnesium and 0.2% titanium[49]). The satellite carried two pairs of antennas designed by the Antenna Laboratory of OKB-1 led by Mikhail V. Krayushkin.[18] Each antenna was made up of two whip-like parts: 2.4 and 2.9 meters (7.9 and 9.5?ft) in length,[50] and had an almost spherical radiation pattern,[51] so that the satellite beeps were transmitted with equal power in all directions, making reception of the transmitted signal independent of the satellite's rotation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe power supply, with a mass of 51?kg (112?lb),[52] was in the shape of an octagonal nut with the radio transmitter in its hole.[53] It consisted of three silver-zinc batteries, developed at the All-Union Research Institute of Current Sources (VNIIT) under the leadership of Nikolai S. Lidorenko. Two of these batteries powered the radio transmitter and one powered the temperature regulation system.[52] The batteries had an expected lifetime of two weeks, and operated for 22 days. The power supply was turned on automatically at the moment of the satellite's separation from the second stage of the rocket.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe satellite had a one-watt, 3.5?kg (7.7?lb)[32] radio transmitting unit inside, developed by Vyacheslav I. Lappo from NII-885, the Moscow Electronics Research Institute,[54][55] that worked on two frequencies, 20.005 and 40.002?MHz. Signals on the first frequency were transmitted in 0.3 sec pulses (under normal temperature and pressure conditions on-board), with pauses of the same duration filled by pulses on the second frequency.[56] Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere. Temperature and pressure were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. A temperature regulation system contained a fan, a dual thermal switch, and a control thermal switch.[54] If the temperature inside the satellite exceeded 36?C (97?F) the fan was turned on and when it fell below 20?C (68?F) the fan was turned off by the dual thermal switch.[51] If the temperature exceeded 50?C (122?F) or fell below 0?C (32?F), another control thermal switch was activated, changing the duration of the radio signal pulses.[54] Sputnik 1 was filled with dry nitrogen, pressurized to 1.3 atm.[34] The satellite had a barometric switch, activated if the pressure inside the satellite fell below 130 kPa, which would have indicated failure of the pressure vessel or puncture by a meteor, and would have changed the duration of radio signal impulse.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile attached to the rocket, Sputnik 1 was protected by a cone-shaped payload fairing, with a height of 80?cm (31.5?in).[32] The fairing separated from both Sputnik and the spent R-7 second stage at the same time as the satellite was ejected.[54] Tests of the satellite were conducted at OKB-1 under the leadership of Oleg G. Ivanovsky.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe control system of the Sputnik rocket was adjusted to an intended orbit of 223 by 1,450?km (139 by 901?mi), with an orbital period of 101.5 min.[58] The trajectory had been calculated earlier by Georgi Grechko, using the USSR Academy of Sciences' mainframe computer.[32][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sputnik rocket was launched on 4 October 1957 at 19:28:34?UTC (5 October at the launch site[1]) from Site No.1 at NIIP-5.[60] Telemetry indicated that the strap-ons separated 116 seconds into the flight and the core stage engine shut down 295.4 seconds into the flight.[58] At shut down, the 7.5 tonne core stage with PS-1 attached had attained an altitude of 223?km (139?mi) above sea level, a velocity of 7,780?m/s (25,500?ft/s) and velocity vector inclination to the local horizon of 0 degrees 24 minutes. This resulted in an initial orbit of 223 kilometres (139?mi) by 950 kilometres (590?mi), with an apogee approximately 500 kilometres (310?mi) lower than intended, and an inclination of 65.1 degrees and a period of 96.2 minutes.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe launch came very close to failurea postflight examination of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at ignition and the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2 six seconds after liftoff. Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the vernier engines and stabilizer fins. The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the pitch angle would have been great enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and Sputnik 1 crashing to the ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fuel regulator in the booster also failed around 16 seconds into launch, which resulted in excessive RP-1 consumption for most of powered flight and engine thrust 4% above nominal. Core stage cutoff was intended for T+296 seconds, but the premature propellant depletion caused thrust termination to occur one second earlier when a sensor detected overspeed of the empty RP-1 turbopump. There were 375 kilograms (827?lb) of LOX remaining at cutoff.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 19.9 seconds after engine cut-off, PS-1 separated from the second stage[1] and the satellite's transmitter was activated. These signals were detected at the IP-1 station by Junior Engineer-Lieutenant V.G. Borisov, where reception of Sputnik 1's \\"beep-beep-beep\\" tones confirmed the satellite's successful deployment. Reception lasted for two minutes, until PS-1 fell below the horizon.[32][62] The Tral telemetry system on the R-7 core stage continued to transmit and was detected on its second orbit.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe designers, engineers and technicians who developed the rocket and satellite watched the launch from the range.[63] After the launch they drove to the mobile radio station to listen for signals from the satellite.[63]  They waited about 90 minutes to ensure that the satellite had made one orbit and was transmitting, before Korolev called Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first orbit the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) transmitted: \\"As result of great, intense work of scientific institutes and design bureaus the first artificial Earth satellite has been built\\".[65] The R-7 core stage, with a mass of 7.5 tonnes and a length of 26 meters, also reached Earth orbit and was visible from the ground at night as a first magnitude object following the satellite. Deployable reflective panels were placed on the booster in order to increase its visibility for tracking.[64] The satellite, a small, highly polished sphere, was barely visible at sixth magnitude, and thus more difficult to follow optically. A third object, the payload fairing, also achieved orbit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe core stage of the R-7 remained in orbit for two months until 2 December 1957, while Sputnik 1 orbited for three months, until 4 January 1958, having completed 1,440 orbits of the Earth.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nOur movies and television programs in the fifties were full of the idea of going into space. What came as a surprise was that it was the Soviet Union that launched the first satellite. It is hard to recall the atmosphere of the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviets provided details of Sputnik 1 before the launch but few outside the Soviet Union noticed. After reviewing information publicly available before the launch, the science writer Willy Ley wrote in 1958: \\r\\nIf somebody tells me that he has the rockets to shoot  which we know from other sources, anyway  and tells me what he will shoot, how he will shoot it, and in general says virtually everything except for the precise date  well, what should I feel like if I'm surprised when the man shoots?[67]\\r\\n\\r\\n Organized through the citizen science project Operation Moonwatch, teams of visual observers at 150 stations in the United States and other countries were alerted during the night to watch for the Soviet sphere at dawn and during the evening twilight through binoculars or telescopes as it passed overhead.[68] The USSR asked radio amateurs and commercial stations to record the sound of the satellite on magnetic tape.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nNews reports at the time pointed out that \\"anyone possessing a short wave receiver can hear the new Russian earth satellite as it hurtles over this area of the globe\\".[70] Directions, provided by the American Radio Relay League were to \\"Tune in 20 megacycles sharply, by the time signals, given on that frequency. Then tune to slightly higher frequencies. The 'beep, beep' sound of the satellite can be heard each time it rounds the globe.\\"[71] The first recording of Sputnik 1's signal was made by RCA engineers near Riverhead, Long Island. They then drove the tape recording into Manhattan for broadcast to the public over NBC radio. However, as Sputnik rose higher over the East Coast, its signal was picked up by W2AEE, the ham radio station of Columbia University. Students working in the university's FM station, WKCR, made a tape of this, and were the first to rebroadcast the Sputnik signal to the American public (or whoever could receive the FM station).\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first the Soviet Union agreed to use equipment \\"compatible\\" with that of the United States, but later announced the lower frequencies.[68] The White House declined to comment on military aspects of the launch, but said \\"it did not come as a surprise.\\"[72] On 5 October the Naval Research Laboratory announced it had recorded four crossings of Sputnik 1 over the United States.[68] The USAF Cambridge Research Center collaborated with Bendix-Friez, Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to obtain a motion picture of Sputnik's rocket body crossing the pre-dawn sky of Baltimore, broadcast on 12 October by WBZ-TV in Boston.[73] U.S. President Eisenhower obtained photographs of the Soviet facilities from Lockheed U-2 flights conducted since 1956.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe success of Sputnik 1 seemed to have changed minds around the world regarding a shift in power to the Soviets.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe USSR's launch of Sputnik 1 spurred the United States to create the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) in February 1958 to regain a technological lead.[76][77][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Britain the media and population initially reacted with a mixture of fear for the future, but also amazement about humankind's progress. Many newspapers and magazines heralded the arrival of the Space Age. However, when the Soviet Union launched a second craft containing the dog Laika, the media narrative returned to one of anti-communism and many people sent protests to the Russian embassy and the RSPCA.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nSputnik 1 was not immediately used for Soviet propaganda. The Soviets had kept quiet about their earlier accomplishments in rocketry, fearing that it would lead to secrets being revealed and failures being exploited by the West.[80] When the Soviets began using Sputnik in their propaganda, they emphasized pride in the achievement of Soviet technology, arguing that it demonstrated the Soviets' superiority over the West. People were encouraged to listen to Sputnik's signals on the radio[80] and to look out for Sputnik in the night sky. While Sputnik itself had been highly polished, its small size made it barely visible to the naked eye. What most watchers actually saw was the much more visible 26 meter core stage of the R-7.[80] Shortly after the launch of PS-1, Khrushchev pressed Korolev to launch another satellite in time for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution on 7 November 1957.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 surprised the American public and shattered the perception, furthered by American propaganda, of the United States as the technological superpower and the Soviet Union as a backward country.[82] Privately, however, the CIA and President Eisenhower were aware of progress being made by the Soviets on Sputnik from secret spy plane imagery.[83] Together with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Army Ballistic Missile Agency built Explorer 1, and launched it on 31 January 1958. Before work was completed, however, the Soviet Union launched a second satellite, Sputnik 2, on 3 November 1957. Meanwhile, the televised failure of Vanguard TV3 on 6 December 1957 deepened American dismay over the country's position in the Space Race. The Americans took a more aggressive stance in the emerging space race,[84] resulting in an emphasis on science and technological research and reforms in many areas from the military to education systems.[85] The federal government began investing in science, engineering and mathematics at all levels of education.[82][86]  An advanced research group was assembled for military purposes.[82] These research groups developed weapons such as ICBMs and missile defense systems, as well as spy satellites for the U.S.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday, 4 October 1957, the Soviets had orbited the world's first artificial satellite. Anyone who doubted its existence could walk into the backyard just after sunset and see it.\\r\\nInitially U.S. President Eisenhower was not surprised by Sputnik 1. He had been forewarned of the R-7's capabilities by information derived from U-2 spy plane overflight photos, as well as signals and telemetry intercepts.[88][89] The Eisenhower administration's first response was low-key and almost dismissive.[90] Eisenhower was even pleased that the USSR, not the U.S., would be the first to test the waters of the still-uncertain legal status of orbital satellite overflights.[91] Eisenhower had suffered the Soviet protests and shoot-downs of Project Genetrix (Moby Dick) balloons[92] and was concerned about the probability of a U-2 being shot down.[93] To set a precedent for \\"freedom of space\\" before the launch of America's secret WS-117L spy satellites,[94] the U.S. had launched Project Vanguard as its own \\"civilian\\" satellite entry for the International Geophysical Year.[95] Eisenhower greatly underestimated the reaction of the American public, who were shocked by the launch of Sputnik and by the televised failure of the Vanguard Test Vehicle 3 launch attempt. The sense of fear was inflamed by Democratic politicians and professional cold warriors, who portrayed the United States as woefully behind.[96] One of the many books that suddenly appeared for the lay-audience noted seven points of \\"impact\\" upon the nation: Western leadership, Western strategy and tactics, missile production, applied research, basic research, education, and democratic culture.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. soon had a number of successful satellites, including Explorer 1,  Project SCORE, and Courier 1B. However, public reaction to the Sputnik crisis spurred America to action in the Space Race, leading to the creation of both the Advanced Research Projects Agency (renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA in 1972),[97] and NASA (through the National Aeronautics and Space Act),[98] as well as an increase in U.S. government spending on scientific research and education. \\r\\n\\r\\nSputnik also contributed directly to a new emphasis on science and technology in American schools. With a sense of urgency, Congress enacted the 1958 National Defense Education Act, which provided low-interest loans for college tuition to students majoring in math and science.[99][100] After the launch of Sputnik, a poll conducted and published by the University of Michigan showed that 26% of Americans surveyed thought that Russian sciences and engineering were superior to that of the United States. (A year later, however, that figure had dropped to 10% as the U.S. began launching its own satellites into space.)[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne consequence of the Sputnik shock was the perception of a \\"missile gap.\\"[102] This became a dominant issue in the 1960 Presidential campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne irony of the Sputnik event was the initially low-key response of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party newspaper Pravda only printed a few paragraphs about Sputnik 1 on 4 October.[103] In the days following the world's startled response, the Soviets started celebrating their great accomplishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSputnik also inspired a generation of engineers and scientists. Harrison Storms, the North American designer who was responsible for the X-15 rocket plane, and went on to head the effort to design the Apollo Command/Service Module and Saturn V launch vehicle's second stage was moved by the launch of Sputnik to think of space as being the next step for America.[104]  Astronauts Alan Shepard, who was the first American in space, and Deke Slayton later wrote of how the sight of Sputnik I passing overhead inspired them to their new careers.[105] Homer Hickam's memoir Rocket Boys and the movie October Sky tell the story of how a coal miner's son, inspired by Sputnik, started building rockets in the mining town where he lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 inspired United States writer Herb Caen to coin the term \\"beatnik\\" in an article about the Beat Generation in the San Francisco Chronicle on 2 April 1958[106].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag of the Russian city of Kaluga, which, due to its importance as Konstantin Tsiolkovsky's birthplace, is very focused on space, features a small Sputnik in the left section.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least two vintage duplicates of Sputnik 1 exist, built apparently as backup units. One resides just outside Moscow in the corporate museum of Energia, the modern descendant of Korolev's design bureau, where it is on display by appointment only.[107][108] Another is in the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington. Unlike Energia's unit, it has no internal components, but it does have casings and molded fittings inside (as well as evidence of battery wear), which suggest it was built as more than just a model. Authenticated by the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics in Moscow, the unit was auctioned in 2001 and purchased by an anonymous private buyer who donated it to the museum.[107] Two more Sputnik backups are said to be in the personal collections of American entrepreneurs Richard Garriott[107] and Jay S. Walker.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1959, the Soviet Union donated a replica of Sputnik to the United Nations.[110] There are dozens of other full-size Sputnik replicas, more or less accurate, on display in locations around the world, including the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.;[107] the Frontiers of Flight Museum and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, both in Texas;[107][111] the Armstrong Air and Space Museum and the National Museum of the United States Air Force, both in Ohio; the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas; the California Science Center in Los Angeles; the Science Museum, London; the World Museum in Liverpool; the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia and outside the Russian embassy in Madrid, Spain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree one-third scale student-built replicas of Sputnik 1 were deployed from the Mir space station between 1997 and 1999. The first, named Sputnik 40 to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1, was deployed in November 1997.[74] Sputnik 41 was launched a year later, and Sputnik 99 was deployed in February 1999. A fourth replica was launched, but never deployed, and was destroyed when Mir was deorbited.[107][112]","input":"When was the first satellite sent into space?"},{"output":"Magnus Carlsen","context":"A total of seven chess players have been the chess world number one on the official FIDE rating list since it was first published in July 1971.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first world number one, in July 1971, was Bobby Fischer. In January 1976 Anatoly Karpov became the highest-rated player on the FIDE list, FIDE having dropped Fischer (whose rating was higher than Karpov's) from the list due to inactivity. In January 1984, the third world number one was Garry Kasparov. Anatoly Karpov briefly held the world number one ranking in July 1985, and the fourth world number one, Vladimir Kramnik, briefly held the ranking in January 1996. Other than these two brief periods, Kasparov dominated for some 22 years from 1984 until his retirement from professional chess on 10 March 2005. In January 1990, he surpassed Fischer's peak of 2785 and became the first player ever to achieve a 2800 rating. In July 1999, he reached his peak rating, 2851. This was the highest FIDE rating in history until January 2013, when it was surpassed by Magnus Carlsen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Kasparov's retirement, the world number one ranking passed to Veselin Topalov, since Kasparov was removed from the rating list in April 2006 due to inactivity. In April 2007, Viswanathan Anand became the sixth player to top the rankings.[2] Kramnik briefly returned to the number one ranking in January 2008, but was again joint number one by rating, being placed first in the list due to having played more games in the rating period in question. For most of the period April 2007 to November 2009, the top ranking was held by either Anand or Topalov.

It was renamed into Nepalese Army since 28 May 2008 with the abolishing of 238-year-old monarchy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal unification campaign was a turning point in the history of the Nepalese army. Since unification was not possible without a strong army, the management of the armed forces had to be exceptional. Apart from the standard Malla era temples in Kathmandu, army being organized in Gorkhas, technicians and experts had to be brought in from abroad to manufacture war materials. After the Gorkhali troops captured Nuwakot, the hilly northern part of Kathmandu (Kantipur) in the year 1744, the Gorkhali armed forces came to be known as the Royal Nepalese Army.\\r\\nTheir gallantry, sincerity and simplicity impressed even their enemy so much that the British East-India Company started recruiting Nepalese into their forces. Since the British had fought against then RNA, which was till that time, still colloquially known as \\"Army of Gorkha\\" or \\"Gorkhali\\" army, the British called their new soldiers \\"Gurkhas\\". Sikh and Gurkha army 's war took place in 1809 which is known as Gurkha-Sikh War . The Indian army, after gaining their independence from the British, started calling them \\"Gorkha\\". In 1946, the Royal Nepalese Army troops were led by Commanding General Sir Baber Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana at the Victory Parade in London.[2]\\r\\nThe Gurkha Rifles existing in India and Britain are part of foreign military organizations where Nepalis are recruited. The NA are rightfully the true heir of the title of \\"The original Army of the Gorkha\\".\\r\\nPrior to 2006 the Nepalese Army was known as the Royal Nepalese Army and was under the control of the King of Nepal. Yet following the Loktantra Andolan (People's Movement for Democracy) on May 18, 2006 a Bill was passed by the Nepalese parliament curtailing royal power, this included renaming the army.[3]\\r\\nIn 2004 Nepal spent $99.2 million on its military (1.5% of its GDP).

Other duties include humanitarian assistance/disaster relief operations, assisting in national development, nature conservation efforts and participation in international peacekeeping mission.\\r\\nDisarmament of the Khampas ÿ 1974\\r\\nIn 1974, the then Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) was mobilized to disarm the Tibetan Khampas, who had been using Nepalese soil to engage in guerilla warfare against the invading Chinese forces. The Khampas operated mainly from a base secretly established at Mustang in northwest Nepal. The RNA, under diplomatic pressure from China and the international community, moved nine infantry units toward Mustang, and gave the Khampas an ultimatum to either disarm themselves and surrender, or face attack. The terms and conditions of their surrender were that they would be given Nepalese citizenship, land, and money, and free schooling for their children. The Khampa commander, General Wangdi, agreed to surrender but eventually fled the camp. He was later killed by RNA forces in Doti, in far western Nepal, while trying to loot a Nepal Police post. This was the first time the RNA had mobilized domestically in such large numbers.\\r\\nThe Nepalese Army has contributed more than 100,000 peacekeepers to a variety of United Nations-sponsored peacekeeping missions such as:\\r\\nThe U.S.-Nepali military relationship focuses on support for democratic institutions, civilian control of the military, and the professional military ethic to include respect for human rights.

Relocation causes discontinuity in education, which causes migrant students to progress slowly through school and drop out at high rates. Additionally, relocation has negative social consequences on students: isolation from peers due to cultural differences and language barriers. Migrant children, defined as those who relocate because of involvement with agriculture-related industries or other seasonal work,[1] are also at a disadvantage because the majority live in extreme poverty and must work with their parents to support their families. These barriers to equal educational attainment for children of migrant workers are present in countries all over the world. Although the inequality in education remains pronounced, government policies, non-governmental organizations, non-profits, and social movements are working to reverse its effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCultural differences that cause difficulties in assimilation and also lead to prejudice and xenophobia against migrant families are common deterrents from receiving equal educational opportunities. These prejudices can be formalized by restrictive regulations, or they can be informal but negatively affect the learning atmosphere of a school. Students who don't feel welcome or wanted because of their migrant status are less likely to remain in school.[2][3][4] Additionally, students who struggle with cultural adjustment often fail to form connections and make friends in school, which affects their academic achievement.[5]\\r\\nLanguage differences are another common barrier to educational success. Migrant students that speak a language other than the region's dominant language struggle with basic comprehension and literacy, which affects success in school.[2][3] Even students who are fluent in the regions dominant language but face challenges with the written or academic form of the language are often placed in lower-level or special education classes that have the potential to undermine their academic proficiency. Additionally, while a student may have a high level of language acquisition, cultural differences that include short answer responses, unexpected expressions, and mannerisms, can be misunderstood as language deficit. Schools that have contemplated a separate program for second language learning face challenges with limited resources and an insufficient amount of participating students. Language challenges amongst migrant students create a significant barrier given that language deficiency is often tied to alienation and ridicule from peers, and in some cases, academic punishment.[6]\\r\\nMigrant parents are often unaware of their children's right to education or are unfamiliar with the structure of the local public education system. For example, many migrant farmworker parents in the United States do not know they have a right to hold copies of their children's transcripts and school records, which are needed to enroll students in new schools. This makes transferring schools more difficult, taking time away from the student's education.[7] After moving to a new place, parents must focus their energy on finding work and providing for their families, which often means that they do not have time to explore educational options for their children. Additionally, most migrant parents speak a different language, which also affects their ability to receive information.[3]\\r\\nTrauma and other psychological difficulties are common among migrant populations, especially refugees who are forced into migratory status due to political, social, or religious turmoil at home. Adjustment to a new culture, language, and home is also difficult and can lead to psychological strain on migrant families.[3] According to a 2008 study conducted by the Universities of Melbourne and Hong Kong, migrant students are more prone to depression and separation anxiety than their non-migrant peers.[8] This is apparent in the United States where undocumented students who succeeded in making the difficult journey across the border face psychological difficulties due to fear of being separated from their families through deportation.[9] Another factor contributing to increased rates of depression and anxiety among migrant youth is discrimination in school. In the University of Melbourne study, the demographic that faced the most psychological difficulties were migrant teenage boys who had experienced discrimination in school and/or domestic conflict.[8]\\r\\nMany difficulties arise due to the movement of migrant students from one school to another. Children often must adjust to new curricula, testing requirements, and they also must navigate different systems of credit accrual.[10] When migrant students move during the middle of a school year, they are often discouraged from enrolling mid-way through a semester, which disrupts education and has lasting psychological effects. Additionally, when students (especially those in migrant farmworker families) anticipate frequent dislocation, they are less likely to enroll in advanced classes that would increase their prospects of attaining a post-secondary education.[7]\\r\\nMigrant and immigrant children are four times as likely to live in substandard, crowded housing conditions than are non-migrant and non-immigrant children.[9] Many migrant farmworkers live with a large number of extended family members in migrant camps or temporary housing. This density of people in a small, poorly lit and sparsely furnished space is not conducive to studying. Migrant farmworker camps are located close to agricultural fields and not necessarily within walking distance of the local schools, which poses a problem when reliable transportation is also an issue for some families.[7] Many living accommodations have minimal cooking appliances or refrigeration, which for many migrant students means more time spent preparing meals than studying.[5] Some of the migrant worker's accommodations also lack fresh drinking water or sanitation facilities, which increases migrant student's risk of getting sick.[5]\\r\\nThe cost of schooling can also prevent equal access to education. Migrant families, especially migrant farm-working families, have low socioeconomic status and can't afford to pay extra fees on schooling. Even in countries where there are no extra fees for migrant students, there is often an economic disincentive to sending a child to school when they could be working to supplement their parents' incomes.[2][3][4]\\r\\nThe exact demographics of migrant students in the United States are difficult to calculate because they move across state and national borders, have different levels of citizenship status, and have limited English proficiency, complicating survey and census data.[2][11] However, in 2002, the US Department of Education, estimated that there are 783,867 migrant children who meet the federal definition of \\"migrant\\" as set forth in the eligibility requirements for government support (see Government programs below). This refers to children who have moved school districts within the last 3 years due to agricultural work or work in related industries.\\r\\nThe racial breakdown of these migrant students is 86% Hispanic, 8% White, and less than 3% Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander.[1]\\r\\n84% of these students speak little to no English, and about 90% speak a language other than English in their homes. The states with the highest level of students with limited English proficiency are Arizona (with 51% LEP migrant students) and Texas (with 37% LEP migrant students).[2]\\r\\nDistribution of migrant students in the U.S.[2]\\r\\nOf all of the foreign-born migrants in the United States, 22% have less than a 9th grade education. This percentage breaks down differently by country of origin, with migrants from Asia arriving with the most education and migrants from Latin America arriving with the least.[12]\\r\\nWith regards to educational attainment, only six percent of foreign-born migrant farmworkers have completed 12th grade.[13]\\r\\nStarting in the 1960s, the United States' government has passed a series of legislation intended to improve the lives of migrant and immigrant students. In 1968, the Bilingual Education Act allocated funding to individual school districts for the creation of bilingual education programs. As part of the Equal Educational Opportunity Act (EEOA) of 1974, the federal government required schools to recognize the language barriers in migrant communities and offer support for non-English speaking students.[14] The No Child Left Behind Act, however, created new testing requirements that make it difficult for migrant students who might transfer school districts before taking a required test, negatively affecting their ability to progress in school.\\r\\nIn 1965, as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's \\"War on Poverty\\", Title I of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was framed to help support economically disadvantaged students within the United States. However, this act failed to address the specific non-economic barriers faced by migrant workers and their families so it was amended in 1966 to include the Migrant Education Program (MEP).[1] MEP provides support for children of migrant workers through educational services such as extended school days, summer programs, ESL classes, etc. Eligibility requirements are solely based on the mobility of children and not on their economic or cultural struggles as migrants. This was because Title I already focuses on economically disadvantaged children, so it was assumed that children who qualify for MEP would be receiving benefits from those pre-existing anti-poverty programs. To be included in the Migrant Education Program, children must have had moved school districts for temporary or seasonal agricultural work within the past 3 years.[1] The definition of who qualifies has changed several times since 1966. In 1974, the MEP expanded in scope by including migratory fishing, meat-packing, and other agriculture-related jobs into the categories of eligibility. This was also the year that the period of eligibility was increased from 3 years to 6 years after relocating school districts; however, in 1994 with the passage of the Improving America's Schools Act, it was returned to 3 years. In 1994, the definition of who qualified for MEP was further limited to those children who moved school districts for agriculture-related work that represented their family's \\"principle means of livelihood.\\"[1]\\r\\nIn 2001, the No Child Left Behind Act re-authorized MEP and mandated that the federal funding is focused on the \\"neediest students\\" with the \\"highest risk of academic failure\\".[2] Although NCLB re-authorized MEP, the main goals of the program reflect what was already laid out in the 1960s. These goals include supporting educational programs to address educational disruptions, protecting migrant children from being penalized for the differences between State curriculums and graduation requirements, designing assistance programs to address the special needs of migrant children.[15] The Migrant Education Program also facilitates coordination of educational services between states.[2] The Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS) and the New Generation System (NGS) collect students' records and mails them between school districts, which helps provide continuity in education for students who move across state lines.[1]\\r\\nThe primary criticism of the EDEA's Migrant Education Program is its constantly evolving definition of \\"migrant student\\", which makes counting the number of migrants and analyzing statistics difficult. Second, not all migrants are treated equally by the EDEA: former migrant families that have permanently settled down are not included in the definition of \\"migrant\\" so they aren't eligible for the benefits of MEP despite still being at a disadvantage. Third, the MEP doesn't resolve the problem of students moving schools across state lines, learning different curriculums, and then struggling with state-specific standardized tests.[16]\\r\\nThe High School Equivalency Program (HEP) is designed to assist migratory and seasonal farm workers to obtain the equivalent to a high school diploma, to find additional skill training or post-secondary schooling, or to find employment. Each year, it serves at least 7,000 students who qualify for the program by being 16 years of age or older and not currently enrolled in school.[17] The HEP is tailored to the needs of migrant workers by being flexible and allowing students to attend classes based on their own convenience. Additionally, the HEP provides free transportation, and all of its staff members are bilingual.[18]\\r\\nThe College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) is the only national support program aimed at supporting migrant students through the college experience. CAMP was originally created through the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity program of 1972 before being shifted to the U.S. Department of Labor the following year and to the U.S. Department of Education in 1980. CAMP is funded through discretionary grants that are granted to different non-profit organizations and institutions of higher education. These grants are awarded so that different institutions can provide financial aid, career counseling, tutoring, summer enrichment programs, etc. for migrant students.[19] One of the criticisms of CAMP is that there are not enough spaces available for every eligible student who applies for support. Right now, CAMP only supports roughly 2000 college students per year.[20] Furthermore, due to an increase in undergraduate tuition rates, the number of students supported by CAMP has decreased.[19]\\r\\nThe Migrant Education Even Start Program is focused on improving the literacy of migrant children and adults by supporting existing family literacy projects that operate through the government, universities, private organizations, etc.[21] The Even Start program is focused on increasing children's and families' capabilities by using migrant families' existing resources, cultural traditions, and networks to jumpstart their success. The instructional services included in this program include Adult Basic Education, Adult Secondary Education, English as a Second Language, and GED certification. The downside to the Even Start program is that many adults are not able to complete their education due to time constraints and lack of childcare.[22]\\r\\nIn addition to government programs, many non-profit organizations work to help migrant workers and their children achieve educational success. Many programs focus on assisting migrant workers to secure work and decent living conditions, while other programs focus on education. Non-profit organizations offer different types of educational services for migrant workers and their children. Some work with migrants to upgrade or teach technical skills that would be helpful for finding employment. Other organizations aim to educate migrants on workplace rights, so that they are knowledgeable on how to handle workplace abuse, which is common among undocumented migrant workers.[23]\\r\\nThe most widely utilized form of non-profit assistance is English as a Second Language (ESL) education. Of the 20% of crop workers that have taken at least one adult education class, 10% took English language classes.[24] After English language education, many non-profits offer GED education and tutoring because passing the GED can increase educational and occupational opportunities.[25] Organizations such as Project Avanzando in California provide GED instruction, and services to help students transition into college.[26]\\r\\nFor adult learners, participating in these programs can be difficult due to lack of transportation, childcare, confidence, or flexibility in work schedule.[26] Chances of attending adult education classes are higher for crop workers with the most previous educational experiences as well as for authorized workers. Unauthorized workers have a 10% chance of participating in classes versus the 32% chance of authorized workers.[24]\\r\\nThe educational achievement gap between migrant children and non-migrant children is prevalent across the United States. Migrant students generally have lower standardized test scores than the district or state-wide average.[27] In addition to inequality in test scores, there is a persistent graduation gap between migrant and non-migrant students. The national drop-out rate among migrant farmworker students is 50%.[15] In the population of Hispanic immigrants, graduation completion rates correlate to the age in which the student migrated to the United States. The earlier a student immigrates to the United States, the higher their chances are at completing high school.[25]\\r\\nThese high drop-out rates are often the result of too many school absences, which is common for students who need to support their families by working in the fields or babysitting younger siblings. Before dropping out, increased absences can lead to migrant students being held back a year in school. The more this happens, the wider the age discrepancy between students becomes, which furthers the likelihood of dropping out of school.[5]\\r\\nBecause of the complex and interwoven nature of the different issues facing migrant students, there is no consensus of how to solve the inequalities in educational opportunity, attainment, and achievement. Members of the University of Texas at Austin argue that the creation of \\"advocate educators,\\" whose role it is to support the rights of migrant students and act as a solution for bridging gaps between educational institutions and students.[28] A 2001 study conducted along the Texas-Mexican border concluded that advocate educators who demonstrated cross-cultural empathy and an understanding of the nature, context, and needs of migrant farmworkers fostered the educational success of migrant students.[28] Teachers who are better educated on the experiences of migrant farmworkers will help eliminate prejudice and low expectations of students, which in turn, will encourage students to perform better in school. Along these lines, it is also argued that combatting prejudice and racial stereotypes within the wider community will help decrease prejudice in school and help migrant students.[5] Other suggested interventions include finding a more efficient way of making up absences or missed curriculum due to school transfers and increasing the minimum wage of migrant farmworkers. Studies suggest that students have to stay after school constantly to make-up missed work lose motivation and become quickly discouraged with the educational system. By raising the minimum wage of migrant farmworkers, policy makers would decrease the opportunity cost of education because children would no longer be needed to financially support the family.[5]\\r\\nThe primary form of migration within China isn't that of rural-rural farming migration, but that of rural-urban migration. Through the hukou system, a form of citizenship registration, the Chinese government divides citizens into one of two categories of: urban or rural. Historically, this has created a hierarchy between urban and rural citizens because strict regulations give urbanites more access to healthcare, education, food, etc. Migration has led to a changing demographic of cities. According to the 2010 Census, 210 million urban-to-rural migrants are living in cities, without official hukou registration. Of these migrants, about 20 million are children between the ages of 6 and 14 years struggling to receive quality education because they are not registered within the school district.[29] Many local governments require that everyone complete at least 9 years of education; however, migrant children weren't allowed to enroll in urban schools until 1996. The Ministry of Education issued \\"Provisional Measures for the Education of Migrant Children\\" in 1998, but because this was not actually legally binding, many factors continue to prohibit migrants from receiving education:\\r\\nFor rural migrant children who do succeed in enrolling in state schools, discrimination is prevalent: in most schools, migrant children do not receive official grades and can not receive academic honors. Because of this, many parents choose to send their children to unlicensed, privately run migrant-specific (\\"black\\") schools. The quality of education in these schools is poor because they lack the same resources as state schoolsspecifically qualified teachers. Depending on the region, these \\"black\\" schools are also under threat of closure. In 2007 in Shanghai, every unlicensed migrant school in the center of the city was closed. However, schools on the outskirts of the city and in the majority migrant Xiamen Special Economic Zone, 34 unlicensed schools were allowed.\\r\\nResearchers cite the Chinese government's quest for \\"population quality\\" as the primary reason for continued exclusionary policies against rural migrants. However, there are other consequences to the continuation of these policies, as explained by Charlotte Goodburn:\\r\\nIt is difficult to predict precisely what the results of these exclusionary policies will be. However, it seems reasonable to suppose that if these problems are not addressed they will have a serious impact on China's future development. Not only will a large section of the population not have the skills necessary for China's further economic development, but they will also lack the kind of education needed to develop the capabilities for leading decent, happy and successful lives.[4]\\r\\nSouth Africa's migrant population is mainly composed of refugee groups from other countries in Africa. The South African Constitution guarantees refugees and asylum seekers the right to education. However, in addition to the widespread xenophobia and prejudice, migrants face many systemic barriers that reduce their educational attainment.[31]\\r\\nOne such barrier in South Africa is that many migrants are turned away from public schooling because of a lack of documentation (such as report cards, transfer forms, birth certificates, etc.) Second, language difference is a significant barrier for students from French or Portuguese-speaking countries who must continue their education in the predominantly English-speaking South Africa. Third, according to the Gauteng Department of Education, the recent influx of migrants has \\"led to enormous pressure on the education system, resulting in overcrowding in ... schools.\\"[3]\\r\\nSouth African civil society organizations, such as People Against Suffering, Oppression and Poverty (PASSOP) and Agency for Refugee Educational Skills and Advocacy are working to combat the issue of migrant education. Community based social movements such as the Equal Education movement are fighting for educational equality in South Africa through research, analysis, and activism. The Three2Six Project, which is donor-funded, also helps by offering free schooling to migrant children who are turned away from public schools.[3]","input":"What is the definition of a migrant student?"},{"output":"saline water","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ocean (from Ancient Greek  ?ٚϫ??, transc.?Okean܇s, the sea of classical antiquity[1]) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere.[2] On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans.[3][4] The word sea is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaline water covers approximately 360,000,000?km2 (140,000,000?sq?mi) and is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71% of Earth's surface and 90% of the Earth's biosphere.[6] The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water, and oceanographers have stated that less than 5% of the World Ocean has been explored.[6] The total volume is approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu mi) with an average depth of nearly 3,700 meters (12,100?ft).[7][8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the world ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, it is integral to life, forms part of the carbon cycle, and influences climate and weather patterns. The world ocean is the habitat of 230,000 known species, but because much of it is unexplored, the number of species that exist in the ocean is much larger, possibly over two million.[10] The origin of Earth's oceans is unknown; oceans are thought to have formed in the Hadean eon and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nExtraterrestrial oceans may be composed of water or other elements and compounds. The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of Titan, although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the Solar System. Early in their geologic histories, Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans. The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water, and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus. Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice. Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites; notably, the ocean of Europa is estimated to have over twice the water volume of Earth. The Solar System's giant planets are also thought to have liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions. Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons, including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone. Ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word ??ocean?? comes from the figure in classical antiquity, Oceanus (/o??si??n?s/; Greek: ?ٚϫ?? kean܇s,[13] pronounced?[??kean܇s]), the elder of the Titans in classical Greek mythology, believed by the ancient Greeks and Romans to be the divine personification of the sea, an enormous river encircling the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of kean܇s has an Indo-European connection. Greek kean܇s has been compared to the Vedic epithet -?yna-, predicated of the dragon V?tra-, who captured the cows/rivers. Related to this notion, the Okeanos is represented with a dragon-tail on some early Greek vases.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough generally described as several separate oceans, the global, interconnected body of salt water is sometimes referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean.[15][16] The concept of a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major oceanic divisions ÿ listed below in descending order of area and volume ÿ are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria.[9][12][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOceans are fringed by smaller, adjoining bodies of water such as seas, gulfs, bays, bights, and straits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mid-ocean ridges of the world are connected and form a single global mid-oceanic ridge system that is part of every ocean and the longest mountain range in the world. The continuous mountain range is 65,000?km (40,000?mi) long (several times longer than the Andes, the longest continental mountain range).[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total mass of the hydrosphere is about 1.4 quintillion metric tons (7018140000000000000?1.4G1018 long tons or 7018150000000000000?1.5G1018 short tons), which is about 0.023% of Earth's total mass. Less than 3% is freshwater; the rest is saltwater, almost all of which is in the ocean. The area of the World Ocean is about 361.9 million square kilometers (139.7 million square miles),[9] which covers about 70.9% of Earth's surface, and its volume is approximately 1.335 billion cubic kilometers (320.3 million cubic miles).[9] This can be thought of as a cube of water with an edge length of 1,101 kilometers (684?mi). Its average depth is about 3,688 meters (12,100?ft),[9] and its maximum depth is 10,994 meters (6.831?mi) at the Mariana Trench.[29] Nearly half of the world's marine waters are over 3,000 meters (9,800?ft) deep.[16] The vast expanses of deep ocean (anything below 200 meters or 660 feet) cover about 66% of Earth's surface.[30] This does not include seas not connected to the World Ocean, such as the Caspian Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bluish color of water is a composite of several contributing agents. Prominent contributors include dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll.[31] Mariners and other seafarers have reported that the ocean often emits a visible glow which extends for miles at night. In 2005, scientists announced that for the first time, they had obtained photographic evidence of this glow.[32] It is most likely caused by bioluminescence.[33][34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical zones defined by physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone includes all open ocean regions, and can be divided into further regions categorized by depth and light abundance. The photic zone includes the oceans from the surface to a depth of 200?m; it is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is, therefore, the most biodiverse. Because plants require photosynthesis, life found deeper than the photic zone must either rely on material sinking from above (see marine snow) or find another energy source. Hydrothermal vents are the primary source of energy in what is known as the aphotic zone (depths exceeding 200?m). The pelagic part of the photic zone is known as the epipelagic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pelagic part of the aphotic zone can be further divided into vertical regions according to temperature.\\r\\nThe mesopelagic is the uppermost region. Its lowermost boundary is at a thermocline of 12?C (54?F), which, in the tropics generally lies at 700ÿ1,000 meters (2,300ÿ3,300?ft). Next is the bathypelagic lying between 10 and 4?C (50 and 39?F), typically between 700ÿ1,000 meters (2,300ÿ3,300?ft) and 2,000ÿ4,000 meters (6,600ÿ13,100?ft), lying along the top of the abyssal plain is the abyssopelagic, whose lower boundary lies at about 6,000 meters (20,000?ft). The last zone includes the deep oceanic trench, and is known as the hadalpelagic. This lies between 6,000ÿ11,000 meters (20,000ÿ36,000?ft) and is the deepest oceanic zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe benthic zones are aphotic and correspond to the three deepest zones of the deep-sea. The bathyal zone covers the continental slope down to about 4,000 meters (13,000?ft). The abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4,000 and 6,000?m. Lastly, the hadal zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone, which is found in oceanic trenches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pelagic zone can be further subdivided into two subregions: the neritic zone and the oceanic zone. The neritic zone encompasses the water mass directly above the continental shelves whereas the oceanic zone includes all the completely open water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, the littoral zone covers the region between low and high tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions. It is also known as the intertidal zone because it is the area where tide level affects the conditions of the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a thermocline. The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from ?1?C to 3?C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9?C.[citation needed]\\r\\nIf a zone undergoes dramatic changes in salinity with depth, it contains a halocline. If a zone undergoes a strong, vertical chemistry gradient with depth, it contains a chemocline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe halocline often coincides with the thermocline, and the combination produces a pronounced pycnocline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deepest point in the ocean is the Mariana Trench, located in the Pacific Ocean near the Northern Mariana Islands. Its maximum depth has been estimated to be 10,971 meters (35,994?ft) (plus or minus 11 meters; see the Mariana Trench article for discussion of the various estimates of the maximum depth.) The British naval vessel Challenger II surveyed the trench in 1951 and named the deepest part of the trench the \\"Challenger Deep\\". In 1960, the Trieste successfully reached the bottom of the trench, manned by a crew of two men.\\r\\n\\r\\nOceanic maritime currents have different origins. Tidal currents are in phase with the tide, hence are quasiperiodic, they may form various knots in certain places,[clarification needed] most notably around headlands. Non periodic currents have for origin the waves, wind and different densities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind and waves create surface currents (designated as ??drift currents??). These currents can decompose in one quasi permanent current (which varies within the hourly scale) and one movement of Stokes drift under the effect of rapid waves movement (at the echelon of a couple of seconds).).[36] The quasi permanent current is accelerated by the breaking of waves, and in a lesser governing effect, by the friction of the wind on the surface.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis acceleration of the current takes place in the direction of waves and dominant wind. Accordingly, when the sea depth increases, the rotation of the earth changes the direction of currents, in proportion with the increase of depth while friction lowers their speed. At a certain sea depth, the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with speed current becoming nul: known as the Ekman spiral. The influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface, often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth. These currents can considerably alter, change and are dependent on the various yearly seasons. If the mixed layer is less thick (10 to 20 meters), the quasi permanent current at the surface adopts an extreme oblique direction in relation to the direction of the wind, becoming virtually homogeneous, until the Thermocline.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the deep however, maritime currents are caused by the temperature gradients and the salinity between water density masses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn littoral zones, breaking wave is so intense and the depth measurement so low, that maritime currents reach often 1 to 2 knots.\\r\\n\\r\\nOcean currents greatly affect Earth's climate by transferring heat from the tropics to the polar regions. Transferring warm or cold air and precipitation to coastal regions, winds may carry them inland. Surface heat and freshwater fluxes create global density gradients that drive the thermohaline circulation part of large-scale ocean circulation. It plays an important role in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in sea ice regulation. Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on Earth's energy budget. In so far as the thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters reach the surface, it may also significantly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a discussion of the possibilities of changes to the thermohaline circulation under global warming, see shutdown of thermohaline circulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is often stated that the thermohaline circulation is the primary reason that the climate of Western Europe is so temperate. An alternate hypothesis claims that this is largely incorrect, and that Europe is warm mostly because it lies downwind of an ocean basin, and because atmospheric waves bring warm air north from the subtropics.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Antarctic Circumpolar Current encircles that continent, influencing the area's climate and connecting currents in several oceans.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most dramatic forms of weather occurs over the oceans: tropical cyclones (also called \\"typhoons\\" and \\"hurricanes\\" depending upon where the system forms).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ocean has a significant effect on the biosphere. Oceanic evaporation, as a phase of the water cycle, is the source of most rainfall, and ocean temperatures determine climate and wind patterns that affect life on land. Life within the ocean evolved 3 billion years prior to life on land. Both the depth and the distance from shore strongly influence the biodiversity of the plants and animals present in each region.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it is thought that life evolved in the ocean, the diversity of life is immense, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, many land animals have adapted to living a major part of their life on the oceans. For instance, seabirds are a diverse group of birds that have adapted to a life mainly on the oceans. They feed on marine animals and spend most of their lifetime on water, many only going on land for breeding. Other birds that have adapted to oceans as their living space are penguins, seagulls and pelicans. Seven species of turtles, the sea turtles, also spend most of their time in the oceans.\\r\\n\\r\\nA zone of rapid salinity increase with depth is called a halocline. The temperature of maximum density of seawater decreases as its salt content increases. Freezing temperature of water decreases with salinity, and boiling temperature of water increases with salinity. Typical seawater freezes at around ?1.9?C at atmospheric pressure. If precipitation exceeds evaporation, as is the case in polar and temperate regions, salinity will be lower. If evaporation exceeds precipitation, as is the case in tropical regions, salinity will be higher. Thus, oceanic waters in polar regions have lower salinity content than oceanic waters in temperate and tropical regions.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nSalinity can be calculated using the chlorinity, which is a measure of the total mass of halogen ions (includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) in seawater. By international agreement, the following formula is used to determine salinity:\\r\\n\\r\\nSalinity (in R) = 1.80655 G Chlorinity (in R)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average chlorinity is about 19.2R, and, thus, the average salinity is around 34.7R [55]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the world's goods are moved by ship between the world's seaports.[56] Oceans are also the major supply source for the fishing industry. Some of the major harvests are shrimp, fish, crabs, and lobster.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe motions of the ocean surface, known as undulations or waves, are the partial and alternate rising and falling of the ocean surface. The series of mechanical waves that propagate along the interface between water and air is called swell.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Earth is the only known planet with large stable bodies of liquid water on its surface and the only one in the Solar System, other celestial bodies are thought to have large oceans.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are thought to lack surfaces and instead have a stratum of liquid hydrogen, however their planetary geology is not well understood. The possibility of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune having hot, highly compressed, supercritical water under their thick atmospheres has been hypothesised. Although their composition is still not fully understood, a 2006 study by Wiktorowicz and Ingersall ruled out the possibility of such a water \\"ocean\\" existing on Neptune,[60] though some studies have suggested that exotic oceans of liquid diamond are possible.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water, though the water on Mars is no longer oceanic (much of it residing in the ice caps). The possibility continues to be studied along with reasons for their apparent disappearance. Astronomers think that Venus had liquid water and perhaps oceans in its very early history.[citation needed] If they existed, all later vanished via resurfacing.\\r\\n\\r\\nA global layer of liquid water thick enough to decouple the crust from the mantle is thought to be present on the natural satellites Titan, Europa, Enceladus and, with less certainty, Callisto, Ganymede[62][63] and Triton.[64][65] A magma ocean is thought to be present on Io. Geysers have been found on Saturn's moon Enceladus, possibly originating from about 10 kilometers (6.2?mi) deep ocean beneath an ice shell.[57] Other icy moons may also have internal oceans, or may once have had internal oceans that have now frozen.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nLarge bodies of liquid hydrocarbons are thought to be present on the surface of Titan, although they are not large enough to be considered oceans and are sometimes referred to as lakes or seas. The CassiniÿHuygens space mission initially discovered only what appeared to be dry lakebeds and empty river channels, suggesting that Titan had lost what surface liquids it might have had. Cassini's more recent fly-by of Titan offers radar images that strongly suggest hydrocarbon lakes exist near the colder polar regions. Titan is thought to have a subsurface liquid-water ocean under the ice and hydrocarbon mix that forms its outer crust.\\r\\n\\r\\nCeres appears to be differentiated into a rocky core and icy mantle and may harbour a liquid-water ocean under its surface.[67][68]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot enough is known of the larger trans-Neptunian objects to determine whether they are differentiated bodies capable of supporting oceans, although models of radioactive decay suggest that Pluto,[69] Eris, Sedna, and Orcus have oceans beneath solid icy crusts approximately 100 to 180 km thick.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome planets and natural satellites outside the Solar System are likely to have oceans, including possible water ocean planets similar to Earth in the habitable zone or \\"liquid-water belt\\". The detection of oceans, even through the spectroscopy method, however is likely extremely difficult and inconclusive.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheoretical models have been used to predict with high probability that GJ 1214 b, detected by transit, is composed of exotic form of ice VII, making up 75% of its mass,[70]\\r\\nmaking it an ocean planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther possible candidates are merely speculated based on their mass and position in the habitable zone include planet though little is actually known of their composition. Some scientists speculate Kepler-22b may be an \\"ocean-like\\" planet.[71] Models have been proposed for Gliese 581 d that could include surface oceans. Gliese 436 b is speculated to have an ocean of \\"hot ice\\".[72] Exomoons orbiting planets, particularly gas giants within their parent star's habitable zone may theoretically have surface oceans.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrestrial planets will acquire water during their accretion, some of which will be buried in the magma ocean but most of it will go into a steam atmosphere, and when the atmosphere cools it will collapse on to the surface forming an ocean. There will also be outgassing of water from the mantle as the magma solidifiesthis will happen even for planets with a low percentage of their mass composed of water, so \\"super-Earth exoplanets may be expected to commonly produce water oceans within tens to hundreds of millions of years of their last major accretionary impact.\\"[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nOceans, seas, lakes and other bodies of liquids can be composed of liquids other than water, for example the hydrocarbon lakes on Titan. The possibility of seas of nitrogen on Triton was also considered but ruled out.[74] There is evidence that the icy surfaces of the moons Ganymede, Callisto, Europa, Titan and Enceladus are shells floating on oceans of very dense liquid water or waterÿammonia.[75][76][77][78][79] Earth is often called the ocean planet because it is 70% covered in water.[80][81] Extrasolar terrestrial planets that are extremely close to their parent star will be tidally locked and so one half of the planet will be a magma ocean.[82] It is also possible that terrestrial planets had magma oceans at some point during their formation as a result of giant impacts.[83] Hot Neptunes close to their star could lose their atmospheres via hydrodynamic escape, leaving behind their cores with various liquids on the surface.[84] Where there are suitable temperatures and pressures, volatile chemicals that might exist as liquids in abundant quantities on planets include ammonia, argon, carbon disulfide, ethane, hydrazine, hydrogen, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, neon, nitrogen, nitric oxide, phosphine, silane, sulfuric acid, and water.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nSupercritical fluids, although not liquids, do share various properties with liquids. Underneath the thick atmospheres of the planets Uranus and Neptune, it is expected that these planets are composed of oceans of hot high-density fluid mixtures of water, ammonia and other volatiles.[86] The gaseous outer layers of Jupiter and Saturn transition smoothly into oceans of supercritical hydrogen.[87][88] The atmosphere of Venus is 96.5% carbon dioxide, which is a supercritical fluid at its surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn other bodies:","input":"What type of water is in the ocean?"},{"output":"Junko Tabei","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nJunko Tabei ( b, Tabei Junko, 22 September 1939 ÿ 20 October 2016)[1] was a Japanese mountaineer. She was the first woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest, and the first woman to ascend all Seven Summits by climbing the highest peak on every continent.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nTabei was born in Miharu Fukushima, the fifth daughter in a family of seven children.[5][6] She was considered a frail, weak child, but nevertheless she began mountain climbing at the age of 10, going on a class climbing trip to Mount Nasu.[5][7] Although she was interested in doing more climbing, her family did not have enough money for such an expensive hobby, and Tabei made only a few climbs during her high school years.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Tabei studied English literature and education at Showa Women's University, where she was a member of the mountain climbing club.[6] After graduating, Tabei formed the Ladies Climbing Club: Japan (LCC) in 1969. The club's slogan was \\"Let's go on an overseas expedition by ourselves\\", and was the first of its kind in Japan. Tabei later stated that she founded the club as a result of how she was treated by male mountaineers of the time; some men, for example, refused to climb with her, while others thought she was only interested in climbing as a way to find a husband.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time, she climbed mountains such as Mount Fuji in Japan and the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps. By 1972, Tabei was a recognized mountain climber in Japan.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTabei's LCC contained a team known as the Japanese Women's Everest Expedition (JWEE), headed by Eiko Hisano, that would attempt to summit Mount Everest. JWEE contained 15 members, mostly working women, including teachers, a computer programmer and a juvenile counselor. Two of them, including Tabei, were mothers.[8] After Tabei and Hiroko Hirakawa successfully summited Annapurna III on 19 May 1970,[9] LCC decided to tackle Mount Everest.\\r\\n\\r\\nTabei helped to find sponsors for the expedition, although she was frequently told that the women \\"should be raising children instead.\\"[7] She was able to obtain last-minute funding from the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper and Nippon Television, however all the group members still had to pay an amount that was almost equal to Japans average salary. To save money, they would use recycled car seats to sew up waterproof pouches and over-gloves. They also purchased goose feather from China and made their own sleeping bags. Students at school collected unused packets of jam for their teachers.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a long training period, the team began the expedition early in 1975 when they traveled to Kathmandu. They used the same route to ascend the mountain that Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay had taken in 1953.[11] In early May, the group was camping at 6,300 meters when an avalanche struck their camp. The women and their guides were buried under the snow. Tabei lost consciousness for approximately six minutes until her sherpa guide dug her out. Twelve days after the avalanche, on 16 May 1975, with her sherpa guide, Ang Tsering, Tabei became the first woman to reach the summit of Everest.[11][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of her achievement, Tabei was showered with attention: she received messages from the King of Nepal and the Japanese government, a television miniseries was made about the expedition and she toured Japan making personal appearances. However, Tabei was uncomfortable with this level of fame.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990ÿ91 season, Tabei reached the summit of Mount Vinson, Antarctica's highest mountain.[12] \\r\\nOn 28 June 1992, she summited Puncak Jaya and thus became the first woman to complete the Seven Summits.[2][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to her climbing, Tabei worked on ecological concerns; in 2000, she completed postgraduate studies at Kyushu University focusing on the environmental degradation of Everest caused by the waste left behind by climbing groups.[5] Tabei was also the director of the Himalayan Adventure Trust of Japan, an organization working at a global level to preserve mountain environments.[3] One of the trust's projects was to build an incinerator to burn climbers' rubbish. She also led and participated in \\"clean-up\\" climbs in Japan and the Himalayas.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nTabei was married to Masanobu Tabei, a climber she met while climbing in Japan in 1965. The couple had two children: a daughter, Noriko, and a son, Shinya.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nTabei was diagnosed with cancer in 2012, however she continued with many of her mountaineering activities. She died in a hospital in Kawagoe on 20 October 2016.[7]","input":"Who is the first woman climbed mount everest?"},{"output":"on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, theories of worship, and the use of God's law for believers, among other things","context":"Calvinism (also called the Reformed tradition, Reformed Christianity, Reformed Protestantism, or the Reformed faith) is a major branch of Protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice of John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians.\\r\\nCalvinists broke from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century. Calvinism differs from Lutherans on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, theories of worship, and the use of God's law for believers, among other things.[1][2] As declared in the Westminster and Second Helvetic confessions, the core doctrines are predestination and election. The protestant part of this reformation was considering that the Bible be interpreted by itself, meaning the parts that are harder to understand are examined in the light of other passages where the Bible is more explicit on the matter.[3][4] The term Calvinism can be misleading, because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse, with a wide range of influences rather than a single founder. The movement was first called Calvinism by Lutherans who opposed it referring to French reformer John Calvin, and many within the tradition would prefer to use the word Reformed.[5][6]\\r\\nEarly influential Reformed theologians include Ulrich Zwingli, John Calvin, Martin Bucer, William Farel, Heinrich Bullinger, Peter Martyr Vermigli, Theodore Beza, and John Knox. In the twentieth century, Abraham Kuyper, Herman Bavinck, B. B. Warfield, J. Gresham Machen, Karl Barth, Martyn Lloyd-Jones, Cornelius Van Til, and Gordon Clark were influential. Contemporary Reformed theologians include J. I. Packer, John MacArthur, R. C. Sproul, Timothy J. Keller, John Piper, David Wells, and Michael Horton.\\r\\nReformed churches may exercise several forms of ecclesiastical polity; most are presbyterian or congregationalist, though some are episcopalian. Calvinism is largely represented by Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist traditions. The biggest Reformed association is the World Communion of Reformed Churches with more than 80 million members in 211 member denominations around the world.[7][8] There are more conservative Reformed federations such as the World Reformed Fellowship and the International Conference of Reformed Churches, as well as independent churches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCalvinism is named after John Calvin. It was first used by a Lutheran theologian in 1552. It was a common practice of the Catholic Church to name what they perceived to be heresy after its founder. Nevertheless, the term first came out of Lutheran circles. Calvin denounced the designation himself:\\r\\nThey could attach us no greater insult than this word, Calvinism. It is not hard to guess where such a deadly hatred comes from that they hold against me.\\r\\nDespite its negative connotation, this designation became increasingly popular in order to distinguish Calvinists from Lutherans and from newer Protestant branches that emerged later. Even though the vast majority of churches that trace back their history to Calvin (including Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and a row of other Calvinist churches) do not use it themselves, since the designation \\"Reformed\\" is more generally accepted and preferred, especially in the English-speaking world. Moreover, these churches claim to bein accordance with John Calvin's own words\\"renewed accordingly with the true order of gospel\\".\\r\\nSince the Arminian controversy, the Reformed traditionas a branch of Protestantism distinguished from Lutheranismdivided into two separate groups, Arminians and Calvinists.[10][11] However, it is now rare to call Arminians a part of the Reformed tradition, as many see these two schools of thought as opposed, making the terms Calvinist and Reformed synonymous. While the Reformed theological tradition addresses all of the traditional topics of Christian theology, the word Calvinism is sometimes used to refer to particular Calvinist views on soteriology and predestination, which are summarized in part by the Five Points of Calvinism. Some have also argued that Calvinism as a whole stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things including salvation.\\r\\nFirst-generation Reformed theologians include Huldrych Zwingli (1484ÿ1531), Martin Bucer (1491ÿ1551), Wolfgang Capito (1478ÿ1541), John Oecolampadius (1482ÿ1531), and Guillaume Farel (1489ÿ1565). These reformers came from diverse academic backgrounds, but later distinctions within Reformed theology can already be detected in their thought, especially the priority of scripture as a source of authority. Scripture was also viewed as a unified whole, which led to a covenantal theology of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper as visible signs of the covenant of grace. Another Reformed distinctive present in these theologians was their denial of the bodily presence of Christ in the Lord's supper. Each of these theologians also understood salvation to be by grace alone, and affirmed a doctrine of particular election (the teaching that some people are chosen by God for salvation). Martin Luther and his successor Philipp Melanchthon were undoubtedly significant influences on these theologians, and to a larger extent later Reformed theologians. The doctrine of justification by faith alone was a direct inheritance from Luther.[12]\\r\\nJohn Calvin (1509ÿ64), Heinrich Bullinger (1504ÿ75), Wolfgang Musculus (1497ÿ1563), Peter Martyr Vermigli (1500ÿ62), and Andreas Hyperius (1511ÿ64) belong to the second generation of Reformed theologians. Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536ÿ59) was one of the most influential theologies of the era.[13] Toward the middle of the 16th century, the Reformed began to commit their beliefs to confessions of faith, which would shape the future definition of the Reformed faith. The 1549 Consensus Tigurinus brought together those who followed Zwingli and Bullinger's memorialist theology of the Lord's supper, which taught that the supper simply serves as a reminder of Christ's death, and Calvin's view that the supper serves as a means of grace with Christ actually present, though spiritually rather than bodily. The document demonstrates the diversity as well as unity in early Reformed theology. The remainder of the 16th century saw an explosion of confessional activity. The stability and breadth of Reformed theology during this period stand in marked contrast to the bitter controversy experienced by Lutherans prior to the 1579 Formula of Concord.[14]\\r\\nDue to Calvin's missionary work in France, his programme of reform eventually reached the French-speaking provinces of the Netherlands. Calvinism was adopted in the Electorate of the Palatinate under Frederick III, which led to the formulation of the Heidelberg Catechism in 1563, and in Navarre by Jeanne d'Albret. This and the Belgic Confession were adopted as confessional standards in the first synod of the Dutch Reformed Church in 1571. Leading divines, either Calvinist or those sympathetic to Calvinism, settled in England (Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr, and Jan ?aski) and Scotland (John Knox). During the English Civil War, the Calvinistic Puritans produced the Westminster Confession, which became the confessional standard for Presbyterians in the English-speaking world. Having established itself in Europe, the movement continued to spread to other parts of the world including North America, South Africa, and Korea.[15]\\r\\nCalvin did not live to see the foundation of his work grow into an international movement; but his death allowed his ideas to break out of their city of origin, to succeed far beyond their borders, and to establish their own distinct character.[16]\\r\\nAlthough much of Calvin's work was in Geneva, his publications spread his ideas of a correctly Reformed church to many parts of Europe. In Switzerland, some cantons are still Reformed and some are Catholic. Calvinism became the theological system of the majority in Scotland (see John Knox), the Netherlands (see William Ames, T. J. Frelinghuysen and Wilhelmus  Brakel), some communities in Flanders, and parts of Germany (especially these adjacent to the Netherlands) in the Palatinate, Kassel and Lippe with the likes of Olevianus and his colleague Zacharias Ursinus. In Hungary and the then-independent Transylvania, Calvinism was a significant religion. In the 16th century, the Reformation gained many supporters in Eastern Hungary and Hungarian-populated regions in Transylvania. In these parts, the Reformed nobles protected the faith. Almost all Transylvanian dukes were Reformed. Today there are about 3.5 million Hungarian Reformed people worldwide.[17] It was influential in France, Lithuania and Poland before being mostly erased due to the counter-reformational activities taken up by the monarch in each country. Calvinism gained some popularity in Scandinavia, especially Sweden, but was rejected in favor of Lutheranism after the Synod of Uppsala in 1593.[18]\\r\\nMost settlers in the American Mid-Atlantic and New England were Calvinists, including the English Puritans, the French Huguenots and Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam (New York), and the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians of the Appalachian back country. Nonconforming Protestants, Puritans, Separatists, Independents, English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War, and other English dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed, held overwhelmingly Reformed views. They are often cited among the primary founders of the United States of America. Dutch Calvinist settlers were also the first successful European colonizers of South Africa, beginning in the 17th century, who became known as Boers or Afrikaners.\\r\\nSierra Leone was largely colonized by Calvinist settlers from Nova Scotia, who were largely Black Loyalists, blacks who had fought for the British during the American War of Independence. John Marrant had organized a congregation there under the auspices of the Huntingdon Connection. Some of the largest Calvinist communions were started by 19th and 20th century missionaries. Especially large are those in Indonesia, Korea and Nigeria. In South Korea there are 20,000 Presbyterian congregations with about 9ÿ10 million church members, scattered in more than 100 Presbyterian denominations. In South Korea, Presbyterianism is the largest Christian denomination.[19]\\r\\nA 2011 report of the Pew Forum on Religious and Public Life estimated that members of Presbyterian or Reformed churches make up 7% of the estimated 801 million Protestants globally, or approximately 56 million people.[20] Though the broadly defined Reformed faith is much larger, as it constitutes Congregationalist (0.5%), most of the United and uniting churches (unions of different denominations) (7.2%) and most likely some of the other Protestant denominations (38.2%). All three are distinct categories from Presbyterian or Reformed (7%) in this report.\\r\\nThe Reformed family of churches is one of the largest Christian denominations. According to adherents.com the Reformed/Presbyterian/Congregational/United churches represent 75 million believers worldvide.[21]\\r\\nThe World Communion of Reformed Churches, which includes some United Churches (most of these are primarily Reformed; see Uniting and united churches for details), has 80 million believers.[22] WCRC is the third largest Christian communion in the world, after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches.[21]\\r\\nMany conservative Reformed churches which are strongly Calvinistic formed the World Reformed Fellowship which has about 70 member denominations. Most are not part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches because of its ecumenial attire. The International Conference of Reformed Churches is another conservative association.\\r\\nChurch of Tuvalu is the only officially established state church in the Calvinist tradition in the world.\\r\\nReformed theologians believe that God communicates knowledge of himself to people through the Word of God. People are not able to know anything about God except through this self-revelation. Speculation about anything which God has not revealed through his Word is not warranted. The knowledge people have of God is different from that which they have of anything else because God is infinite, and finite people are incapable of comprehending an infinite being. While the knowledge revealed by God to people is never incorrect, it is also never comprehensive.[23]\\r\\nAccording to Reformed theologians, God's self-revelation is always through his son Jesus Christ, because Christ is the only mediator between God and people. Revelation of God through Christ comes through two basic channels. The first is creation and providence, which is God's creating and continuing to work in the world. This action of God gives everyone knowledge about God, but this knowledge is only sufficient to make people culpable for their sin; it does not include knowledge of the gospel. The second channel through which God reveals himself is redemption, which is the gospel of salvation from condemnation which is punishment for sin.[24]\\r\\nIn Reformed theology, the Word of God takes several forms. Jesus Christ himself is the Word Incarnate. The prophecies about him said to be found in the Old Testament and the ministry of the apostles who saw him and communicated his message are also the Word of God. Further, the preaching of ministers about God is the very Word of God because God is considered to be speaking through them. God also speaks through human writers in the Bible, which is composed of texts set apart by God for self-revelation.[25] Reformed theologians emphasize the Bible as a uniquely important means by which God communicates with people. People gain knowledge of God from the Bible which cannot be gained in any other way.[26]\\r\\nReformed theologians affirm that the Bible is true, but differences emerge among them over the meaning and extent of its truthfulness.[27] Conservative followers of the Princeton theologians take the view that the Bible is true and inerrant, or incapable of error or falsehood, in every place.[28] This view is very similar to that of Catholic orthodoxy as well as modern Evangelicalism.[29] Another view, influenced by the teaching of Karl Barth and Neo-Orthodoxy, is found in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)'s Confession of 1967. Those who take this view believe the Bible to be the primary source of our knowledge of God, but also that some parts of the Bible may be false, not witnesses to Christ, and not normative for today's church.[28] In this view, Christ is the revelation of God, and the scriptures witness to this revelation rather than being the revelation itself.[30] Dawn DeVries, a professor at Union Presbyterian Seminary, has written that Barth's doctrine of Scripture is not capable of resolving conflicts in contemporary churches,[31] and proposed that Scripture not be thought of as the Word of God at all, but only human reports of the revealed Jesus Christ.[32]\\r\\nReformed theologians use the concept of covenant to describe the way God enters fellowship with people in history.[33] The concept of covenant is so prominent in Reformed theology that Reformed theology as a whole is sometimes called \\"covenant theology\\".[34] However, sixteenth and seventeenth-century theologians developed a particular theological system called \\"covenant theology\\" or \\"federal theology\\" which many conservative Reformed churches continue to affirm today.[33] This framework orders God's life with people primarily in two covenants: the covenant of works and the covenant of grace.[35] The covenant of works is made with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The terms of the covenant are that God provides a blessed life in the garden on condition that Adam and Eve obey God's law perfectly. Because Adam and Eve broke the covenant by eating the forbidden fruit, they became subject to death and were banished from the garden. This sin was passed down to all mankind because all people are said to be in Adam as a covenantal or \\"federal\\" head. Federal theologians usually infer that Adam and Eve would have gained immortality had they obeyed perfectly.[36]\\r\\nA second covenant, called the covenant of grace, is said to have been made immediately following Adam and Eve's sin. In it, God graciously offers salvation from death on condition of faith in God. This covenant is administered in different ways throughout the Old and New Testaments, but retains the substance of being free of a requirement of perfect obedience.[37]\\r\\nThrough the influence of Karl Barth, many contemporary Reformed theologians have discarded the covenant of works, along with other concepts of federal theology. Barth saw the covenant of works as disconnected from Christ and the gospel, and rejected the idea that God works with people in this way. Instead, Barth argued that God always interacts with people under the covenant of grace, and that the covenant of grace is free of all conditions whatsoever. Barth's theology and that which follows him has been called \\"monocovenantal\\" as opposed to the \\"bi-covenantal\\" scheme of classical federal theology.[38] Conservative contemporary Reformed theologians, such as John Murray, have also rejected the idea of covenants based on law rather than grace. Michael Horton, however, has defended the covenant of works as combining principles of law and love.[39]\\r\\nFor the most part, the Reformed tradition did not modify the medieval consensus on the doctrine of God.[40] God's character is described primarily using three adjectives: eternal, infinite, and unchangeable.[41] Reformed theologians such as Shirley Guthrie have proposed that rather than conceiving of God in terms of his attributes and freedom to do as he pleases, the doctrine of God is to be based on God's work in history and his freedom to live with and empower people.[42]\\r\\nTraditionally, Reformed theologians have also followed the medieval tradition going back to before the early church councils of Nicaea and Chalcedon on the doctrine of the Trinity. God is affirmed to be one God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Son (Christ) is held to be eternally begotten by the Father and the Holy Spirit eternally proceeding from the Father and Son.[43] However, contemporary theologians have been critical of aspects of Western views here as well. Drawing on the Eastern tradition, these Reformed theologians have proposed a \\"social trinitarianism\\" where the persons of the Trinity only exist in their life together as persons-in-relationship.[43] Contemporary Reformed confessions such as the Barmen Confession and Brief Statement of Faith of the Presbyterian Church (USA) have avoided language about the attributes of God and have emphasized his work of reconciliation and empowerment of people.[44] Feminist theologian Letty Russell used the image of partnership for the persons of the Trinity. According to Russell, thinking this way encourages Christians to interact in terms of fellowship rather than reciprocity.[45] Conservative Reformed theologian Michael Horton, however, has argued that social trinitarianism is untenable because it abandons the essential unity of God in favor of a community of separate beings.[46]\\r\\nReformed theologians affirm the historic Christian belief that Christ is eternally one person with a divine and a human nature. Reformed Christians have especially emphasized that Christ truly became human so that people could be saved.[47] Christ's human nature has been a point of contention between Reformed and Lutheran Christology. In accord with the belief that finite humans cannot comprehend infinite divinity, Reformed theologians hold that Christ's human body cannot be in multiple locations at the same time. Because Lutherans believe that Christ is bodily present in the Eucharist, they hold that Christ is bodily present in many locations simultaneously. For Reformed Christians, such a belief denies that Christ actually became human.[48] Some contemporary Reformed theologians have moved away from the traditional language of one person in two natures, viewing it as unintelligible to contemporary people. Instead, theologians tend to emphasize Jesus' context and particularity as a first-century Jew.[49]\\r\\nJohn Calvin and many Reformed theologians who followed him describe Christ's work of redemption in terms of three offices: prophet, priest, and king. Christ is said to be a prophet in that he teaches perfect doctrine, a priest in that he intercedes to the Father on believers' behalf and offered himself as a sacrifice for sin, and a king in that he rules the church and fights on believers' behalf. The threefold office links the work of Christ to God's work in ancient Israel.[50] Many, but not all, Reformed theologians continue to make use of the threefold office as a framework because of its emphasis on the connection of Christ's work to Israel. They have, however, often reinterpreted the meaning of each of the offices.[51] For example, Karl Barth interpreted Christ's prophetic office in terms of political engagement on behalf of the poor.[52]\\r\\nChristians believe Jesus' death and resurrection makes it possible for believers to attain forgiveness for sin and reconciliation with God through the atonement. Reformed Protestants generally subscribe to a particular view of the atonement called substitutionary atonement, which explains Christ's death as a sacrificial payment for sin. Christ is believed to have died in place of the believer, who is accounted righteous as a result of this sacrificial payment.[53] Contemporary Reformed theologians such as William Placher and Nancy Duff have criticized this view, claiming it makes God appear abusive or vindictive and sanctions violence by the strong against the weak.[54]\\r\\nIn Christian theology, people are created good and in the image of God but have become corrupted by sin, which causes them to be imperfect and overly self-interested.[55] Reformed Christians, following the tradition of Augustine of Hippo, believe that this corruption of human nature was brought on by Adam and Eve's first sin, a doctrine called original sin. Reformed theologians emphasize that this sinfulness affects all of a person's nature, including their will. This view, that sin so dominates people that they are unable to avoid sin, has been called total depravity.[56] In colloquial English, the term \\"total depravity\\" can be easily misunderstood to mean that people are absent of any goodness or unable to do any good. However the Reformed teaching is actually that while people continue to bear God's image and may do things that appear outwardly good, their sinful intentions affect all of their nature and actions so that they are not pleasing to God.[57]\\r\\nSome contemporary theologians in the Reformed tradition, such as those associated with the PC(USA)'s Confession of 1967, have emphasized the social character of human sinfulness. These theologians have sought to bring attention to issues of environmental, economic, and political justice as areas of human life that have been affected by sin.[58]\\r\\nReformed theologians, along with other Protestants, believe salvation from punishment for sin is to be given to all those who have faith in Christ.[59] Faith is not purely intellectual, but involves trust in God's promise to save.[60] Protestants do not hold there to be any other requirement for salvation, but that faith alone is sufficient.[59]\\r\\nJustification is the part of salvation where God pardons the sin of those who believe in Christ. It is historically held by Protestants to be the most important article of Christian faith, though more recently it is sometimes given less importance out of ecumenical concerns.[61] People are not on their own able even to fully repent of their sin or prepare themselves to repent because of their sinfulness. Therefore, justification is held to arise solely from God's free and gracious act.[62]\\r\\nSanctification is the part of salvation in which God makes the believer holy, by enabling them to exercise greater love for God and for other people.[63] The good works accomplished by believers as they are sanctified are considered to be the necessary outworking of the believer's salvation, though they do not cause the believer to be saved.[60] Sanctification, like justification, is by faith, because doing good works is simply living as the son of God one has become.[64]\\r\\nReformed theologians teach that sin so affects human nature that they are unable even to exercise faith in Christ by their own will. While people are said to retain will, in that they willfully sin, they are unable not to sin because of the corruption of their nature due to original sin. Reformed Christians believe that God predestined some people to be saved. This choice by God to save some is held to be unconditional and not based on any characteristic or action on the part of the person chosen. This view is opposed to the Arminian view that God's choice of whom to save is conditional or based on his foreknowledge of who would respond positively to God.[65]\\r\\nKarl Barth reinterpreted the Reformed doctrine of predestination to apply only to Christ. Individual people are only said to be elected through their being in Christ.[66] Reformed theologians who followed Barth, including Jrgen Moltmann, David Migliore, and Shirley Guthrie, have argued that the traditional Reformed concept of predestination is speculative and have proposed alternative models. These theologians claim that a properly trinitarian doctrine emphasizes God's freedom to love all people, rather than choosing some for salvation and others for damnation. God's justice towards and condemnation of sinful people is spoken of by these theologians as out of his love for them and a desire to reconcile them to himself.[67]\\r\\nMost objections to and attacks on Calvinism focus on the \\"five points of Calvinism\\", also called the doctrines of grace, and remembered by the mnemonic \\"TULIP\\".[68] The five points are popularly said to summarize the Canons of Dort;[69] however, there is no historical relationship between them, and some scholars argue that their language distorts the meaning of the Canons, Calvin's theology, and the theology of 17th-century Calvinistic orthodoxy, particularly in the language of total depravity and limited atonement.[70] The five points were more recently popularized in the 1963 booklet The Five Points of Calvinism Defined, Defended, Documented by David N. Steele and Curtis C. Thomas. The origins of the five points and the acronym are uncertain, but they appear to be outlined in the Counter Remonstrance of 1611, a less known Reformed reply to the Arminians that occurred prior to the Canons of Dort.[71] The acronym was used by Cleland Boyd McAfee as early as circa 1905.[72] An early printed appearance of the T-U-L-I-P acronym is in Loraine Boettner's 1932 book, The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination.[73] The acronym was very cautiously if ever used by Calvinist apologists and theologians before the booklet by Steele and Thomas.[74] More recently, theologians have sought to reformulate the TULIP acronym to more accurately reflect the Canons of Dort.[75]\\r\\nThe central assertion of these points is that God saves every person upon whom he has mercy, and that his efforts are not frustrated by the unrighteousness or inability of humans.\\r\\nThis table summarizes the classical views of three Protestant beliefs about salvation.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nReformed Christians see the Christian Church as the community with which God has made the covenant of grace, a promise of eternal life and relationship with God. This covenant extends to those under the \\"old covenant\\" whom God chose, beginning with Abraham and Sarah.[110] The church is conceived of as both invisible and visible. The invisible church is the body of all believers, known only to God. The visible church is the institutional body which contains both members of the invisible church as well as those who appear to have faith in Christ, but are not truly part of God's elect.[111]\\r\\nIn order to identify the visible church, Reformed theologians have spoken of certain marks of the Church. For some, the only mark is the pure preaching of the gospel of Christ. Others, including John Calvin, also including the right administration of the sacraments. Others, such as those following the Scots Confession, include a third mark of rightly administered church discipline, or exercise of censure against unrepentant sinners. These marks allowed the Reformed to identify the church based on its conformity to the Bible rather than the Magisterium or church tradition.[111]\\r\\nThe regulative principle of worship is a teaching shared by some Calvinists and Anabaptists on how the Bible orders public worship. The substance of the doctrine regarding worship is that God institutes in the Scriptures everything he requires for worship in the Church and that everything else is prohibited. As the regulative principle is reflected in Calvin's own thought, it is driven by his evident antipathy toward the Roman Catholic Church and its worship practices, and it associates musical instruments with icons, which he considered violations of the Ten Commandments' prohibition of graven images.[112]\\r\\nOn this basis, many early Calvinists also eschewed musical instruments and advocated a cappella exclusive psalmody in worship,[113] though Calvin himself allowed other scriptural songs as well as psalms,[112] and this practice typified presbyterian worship and the worship of other Reformed churches for some time. The original Lord's Day service designed by John Calvin was a highly liturgical service with the Creed, Alms, Confession and Absolution, the Lord's supper, Doxologies, prayers, Psalms being sung, the Lords prayer being sung, Benedictions.[114]\\r\\nSince the 19th century, however, some of the Reformed churches have modified their understanding of the regulative principle and make use of musical instruments, believing that Calvin and his early followers went beyond the biblical requirements[112] and that such things are circumstances of worship requiring biblically rooted wisdom, rather than an explicit command. Despite the protestations of those who hold to a strict view of the regulative principle, today hymns and musical instruments are in common use, as are contemporary worship music styles with elements such as worship bands.[115]\\r\\nThe Westminster Confession of Faith limits the sacraments to baptism and the Lord's Supper. Sacraments are denoted \\"signs and seals of the covenant of grace.\\"[116] Westminster speaks of \\"a sacramental relation, or a sacramental union, between the sign and the thing signified; whence it comes to pass that the names and effects of the one are attributed to the other.\\"[117] Baptism is for infant children of believers as well as believers, as it is for all the Reformed except Baptists and some Congregationalists. Baptism admits the baptized into the visible church, and in it all the benefits of Christ are offered to the baptized.[117] On the Lord's supper, Westminster takes a position between Lutheran sacramental union and Zwinglian memorialism: \\"the Lord's supper really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually, receive and feed upon Christ crucified, and all benefits of his death: the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally in, with, or under the bread and wine; yet, as really, but spiritually, present to the faith of believers in that ordinance as the elements themselves are to their outward senses.\\"[116]\\r\\nThe 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith does not use the term sacrament, but describes baptism and the Lord's supper as ordinances, as do most Baptists Calvinist or otherwise. Baptism is only for those who \\"actually profess repentance towards God\\", and not for the children of believers.[118] Baptists also insist on immersion or dipping, in contradistinction to other Reformed Christians.[119] The Baptist Confession describes the Lord's supper as \\"the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally, but spiritually present to the faith of believers in that ordinance\\", similarly to the Westminster Confession.[120] There is significant latitude in Baptist congregations regarding the Lord's supper, and many hold the Zwinglian view.\\r\\nThere are two schools of thought regarding the logical order of God's decree to ordain the fall of man: supralapsarianism (from the Latin: supra, \\"above\\", here meaning \\"before\\" + lapsus, \\"fall\\") and infralapsarianism (from the Latin: infra, \\"beneath\\", here meaning \\"after\\" + lapsus, \\"fall\\"). The former view, sometimes called \\"high Calvinism\\", argues that the Fall occurred partly to facilitate God's purpose to choose some individuals for salvation and some for damnation. Infralapsarianism, sometimes called \\"low Calvinism\\", is the position that, while the Fall was indeed planned, it was not planned with reference to who would be saved.\\r\\nSupralapsarians believe that God chose which individuals to save logically prior to the decision to allow the race to fall and that the Fall serves as the means of realization of that prior decision to send some individuals to hell and others to heaven (that is, it provides the grounds of condemnation in the reprobate and the need for salvation in the elect). In contrast, infralapsarians hold that God planned the race to fall logically prior to the decision to save or damn any individuals because, it is argued, in order to be \\"saved\\", one must first need to be saved from something and therefore the decree of the Fall must precede predestination to salvation or damnation.\\r\\nThese two views vied with each other at the Synod of Dort, an international body representing Calvinist Christian churches from around Europe, and the judgments that came out of that council sided with infralapsarianism (Canons of Dort, First Point of Doctrine, Article 7). The Westminster Confession of Faith also teaches (in Hodge's words \\"clearly impl[ies]\\") the infralapsarian[121] view, but is sensitive to those holding to supralapsarianism.[122] The Lapsarian controversy has a few vocal proponents on each side today, but overall it does not receive much attention among modern Calvinists.\\r\\nAmyraldism (or sometimes Amyraldianism, also known as the School of Saumur, hypothetical universalism,[123] post redemptionism,[124] moderate Calvinism,[125] or four-point Calvinism) is the belief that God, prior to his decree of election, decreed Christ's atonement for all alike if they believe, but seeing that none would believe on their own, he then elected those whom he will bring to faith in Christ, thereby preserving the Calvinist doctrine of unconditional election. The efficacy of the atonement remains limited to those who believe.\\r\\nNamed after its formulator Moses Amyraut, this doctrine is still viewed as a variety of Calvinism in that it maintains the particularity of sovereign grace in the application of the atonement. However, detractors like B. B. Warfield have termed it \\"an inconsistent and therefore unstable form of Calvinism.\\"[126]\\r\\nHyper-Calvinism first referred to a view that appeared among the early English Particular Baptists in the 18th century. Their system denied that the call of the gospel to \\"repent and believe\\" is directed to every single person and that it is the duty of every person to trust in Christ for salvation. The term also occasionally appears in both theological and secular controversial contexts, where it usually connotes a negative opinion about some variety of theological determinism, predestination, or a version of Evangelical Christianity or Calvinism that is deemed by the critic to be unenlightened, harsh, or extreme.\\r\\nThe Westminster Confession of Faith says that the gospel is to be freely offered to sinners, and the Larger Catechism makes clear that the gospel is offered to the non-elect.[127][128]\\r\\nNeo-Calvinism, a form of Dutch Calvinism, is the movement initiated by the theologian and former Dutch prime minister Abraham Kuyper. James Bratt has identified a number of different types of Dutch Calvinism: The Secederssplit into the Reformed Church \\"West\\" and the Confessionalists; and the Neo-Calviniststhe Positives and the Antithetical Calvinists. The Seceders were largely infralapsarian and the Neo-Calvinists usually supralapsarian.[129]\\r\\nKuyper wanted to awaken the church from what he viewed as its pietistic slumber. He declared:\\r\\nNo single piece of our mental world is to be sealed off from the rest and there is not a square inch in the whole domain of human existence over which Christ, who is sovereign over all, does not cry: 'Mine!'[130]\\r\\nThis refrain has become something of a rallying call for Neo-Calvinists.\\r\\nChristian Reconstructionism is a fundamentalist[131] Calvinist theonomic movement that has remained rather obscure.[132] Founded by R. J. Rushdoony, the movement has had an important influence on the Christian Right in the United States.[133][134] The movement declined in the 1990s and was declared dead in a 2008 Church History journal article.[135] However, it lives on in small denominations such as the Reformed Presbyterian Church in the United States and as a minority position in other denominations. Christian Reconstructionists are usually postmillennialists and followers of the presuppositional apologetics of Cornelius Van Til. They tend to support a decentralized political order resulting in laissez-faire capitalism.[136][citation not found]\\r\\nThe New Calvinism is a growing perspective within conservative Evangelicalism that embraces the fundamentals of 16th century Calvinism while also trying to be relevant in the present day world.[137] In March 2009, Time magazine described the New Calvinism as one of the \\"10 ideas changing the world\\".[138] Some of the major figures in this area are John Piper, Mark Driscoll, Al Mohler,[138] Mark Dever,[139] C. J. Mahaney, Joshua Harris,[137] and Tim Keller.[140] New Calvinists have been criticized for blending Calvinist soteriology with popular Evangelical positions on the sacraments and continuationism.[141]\\r\\nCalvin expressed himself on usury in a 1545 letter to a friend, Claude de Sachin, in which he criticized the use of certain passages of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others of them had been rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of Aristotle) that it is wrong to charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.[142]\\r\\nHe qualified his view, however, by saying that money should be lent to people in dire need without hope of interest, while a modest interest rate of 5% should be permitted in relation to other borrowers.[143]\\r\\nCalvin's concept of God and man contained strong elements of freedom that were gradually put into practice after his death, in particular in the fields of politics and society. After the successful fight for independence from Spain (1579), the Netherlands, under Calvinist leadership, became the freest country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, e.g. French Huguenots, English Independents (Congregationalists), and Jews from Spain and Portugal. The ancestors of philosopher Baruch Spinoza were Portuguese Jews. Aware of the trial against Galileo, Ren Descartes lived in the Netherlands, out of reach of the Inquisition.[144] Pierre Bayle, a Reformed Frenchman, also felt safer in the Netherlands than in his home country. He was the first prominent philosopher who demanded tolerance for atheists. Hugo Grotius was able to publish a rather liberal interpretation of the Bible and his ideas about natural law.[145][146] Moreover, the Calvinist Dutch authorities allowed the printing of books that could not be published elsewhere, e.g. Galileo's Discorsi.[147]\\r\\nEven more important than the liberal development of the Netherlands was the rise of modern democracy in England and North America. In the Middle Ages state and church had been closely connected. Martin Luther's doctrine of the two kingdoms separated state and church in principle.[148] His doctrine of the priesthood of all believers raised the laity to the same level as the clergy.[149] Going one step further, Calvin included elected laymen (church elders, presbyters) in his concept of church government. The Huguenots added synods whose members were also elected by the congregations. The other Reformed churches took over this system of church self-government which was essentially a representative democracy.[150] Baptists, Quakers, and Methodists are organized in a similar way. These denominations and the Anglican Church were influenced by Calvin's theology in varying degrees.[151]\\r\\nAnother precondition for the rise of democracy in the Anglo-American world was the fact that Calvin favored a mixture of democracy and aristocracy as the best form of government (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy.[152] The aim of his political thought was to safeguard the rights and freedoms of ordinary men and women. In order to minimize the misuse of political power he suggested dividing it among several institutions in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if worldly rulers rise up against God they should be put down. In this way, he and his followers stood in the vanguard of resistance to political absolutism and furthered the cause of democracy.[153] The Congregationalists who founded Plymouth Colony (1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628) were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God.[154][155] Enjoying self-rule they practiced separation of powers.[156][157] Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, founded by Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker, and William Penn, respectively, combined democratic government with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews.[158][159][160]\\r\\nIn England, Baptists Thomas Helwys and John Smyth influenced the liberal political thought of Presbyterian poet and politician John Milton and philosopher John Locke, who in turn had both a strong impact on the political development in their home country (English Civil War, Glorious Revolution) as well as in North America.[161][162] The ideological basis of the American Revolution was largely provided by the radical Whigs, who had been inspired by Milton, Locke, James Harrington, Algernon Sidney, and other thinkers. The Whigs' \\"perceptions of politics attracted widespread support in America because they revived the traditional concerns of a Protestantism that had always verged on Puritanism.\\"[163] The United States Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution and (American) Bill of Rights initiated a tradition of human and civil rights that was continued in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen and the constitutions of numerous countries around the world, e. g. Latin America, Japan, India, Germany, and other European countries. It is also echoed in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[164]\\r\\nIn the nineteenth century, the churches that were based on Calvin's theology or influenced by it were deeply involved in social reforms, e.g. the abolition of slavery (William Wilberforce, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Abraham Lincoln, and others), women suffrage, and prison reforms.[165][166] Members of these churches formed co-operatives to help the impoverished masses.[167] Henry Dunant, a Reformed pietist, founded the Red Cross and initiated the Geneva Conventions.[168][169]\\r\\nSome sources would view Calvinist influence as not always being solely positive. The Boers and Afrikaner Calvinists combined ideas from Calvinism and Kuyperian theology to justify apartheid in South Africa.[170] As late as 1974, the majority of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa was convinced that their theological stances (including the story of the Tower of Babel) could justify apartheid.[171] In 1990, the Dutch Reformed Church document Church and Society maintained that although they were changing their stance on apartheid, they believed that within apartheid and under God's sovereign guidance, \\"...everything was not without significance, but was of service to the Kingdom of God.\\"[172] It should be noted that these views were not universal and were condemned by many Calvinists outside South Africa. It was pressure from both outside and inside the Dutch Reformed Calvinist church which helped reverse apartheid in South Africa.\\r\\nThroughout the world, the Reformed churches operate hospitals, homes for handicapped or elderly people, and educational institutions on all levels. For example, American Congregationalists founded Harvard (1636), Yale (1701), and about a dozen other colleges.[173] Princeton was a Presbyterian foundation.","input":"How did calvinist theology differ from lutheran theology?"},{"output":"SS Archimedes","context":"SS Archimedes was a steamship built in Britain in 1839. She is notable for being the world's first steamship[1] to be driven by a screw propeller.[2][3][4][5]\\r\\nArchimedes had considerable influence on ship development, encouraging the adoption of screw propulsion by the Royal Navy, in addition to her influence on commercial vessels. She also had a direct influence on the design of another innovative vessel, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's SS?Great Britain, then the world's largest ship and the first screw-propelled steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principle of moving water with a screw has been known since the invention of the Archimedes' screw, named after Archimedes of Syracuse who lived in the 3rd Century BC. It was not until the 18th century however, and the invention of the steam engine, that a practical means of delivering effective power to a marine screw propulsion system became available, but initial attempts to build such a vessel met with failure.[6]\\r\\nIn 1807, the world's first commercially successful steam-powered vessel, Robert Fulton's North River Steamboat, made its debut. As this vessel was powered by paddlewheels rather than a propeller, the paddlewheel thereby became the de facto early standard for steamship propulsion. Experimentation with screw propulsion continued in some quarters, however, and between 1750 and the 1830s numerous patents for marine propellers were taken out by various inventors,[7] though few of these inventions were pursued to the testing stage, and those that were proved unsatisfactory for one reason or another.[8]\\r\\nIn 1835, two inventors in Britain, John Ericsson and Francis Pettit Smith, began working separately on the problem. Smith, a farmer by trade who had entertained a lifelong fascination with screw propulsion, was first to take out a screw propeller patent on 31 May, while Ericsson, a gifted Swedish engineer then working in Britain, filed his patent six weeks later.[9]\\r\\nSmith quickly built a small model boat to test his invention, which was demonstrated first on a pond at his Hendon farm, and later at the Royal Adelaide Gallery of Practical Science in London, where it was seen by the Secretary of the Navy, Sir William Barrow. Having secured the patronage of a London banker named Wright, Smith then built a 30-foot, 6-horsepower canal boat of six tons burthen called the Francis Smith, which was fitted with a wooden propeller of his own design and demonstrated on the Paddington Canal from November 1836 to September 1837. By a fortuitous accident, the wooden propeller of two turns was damaged during a voyage in February 1837, and to Smith's surprise the broken propeller, which now consisted of only a single turn, doubled the boat's previous speed, from about four miles an hour to eight.[9] Smith would subsequently file a revised patent in keeping with this accidental discovery.\\r\\nIn the meantime, Ericsson was conducting his own experiments. In 1837, he built a 45-foot screw propelled steamboat, Francis B. Ogden, named after his patron, the American consul to Liverpool. In the summer of 1837, Ericsson demonstrated his boat on the River Thames to senior members of the British Admiralty, including Surveyor of the Navy Sir William Symonds. In spite of the boat achieving a speed of 10 miles an hour, comparable with that of existing paddle steamers, Symonds and his entourage were unimpressed. The Admiralty maintained the view that screw propulsion would be ineffective in ocean-going service, while Symonds himself believed that screw propelled ships could not be steered efficiently.[10] Following this rejection, Ericsson built a second, larger screw-propelled boat, the Robert F. Stockton, and had her sailed in 1839 to the United States, where he was soon to gain fame as the designer of the U.S. Navy's first screw-propelled warship, USS?Princeton.[11]\\r\\nApparently aware of the Navy's view that screw propellers would prove unsuitable for seagoing service, Smith determined to prove this assumption wrong. In September 1837, he took his small vessel (now fitted with an iron propeller of a single turn) to sea, steaming from Blackwall, London to Hythe, Kent, with stops at Ramsgate, Dover and Folkestone. On the way back to London on the 25th, Smith's craft was observed making headway in stormy seas by officers of the Royal Navy. The Admiralty's interest in the technology was revived, and Smith was encouraged to build a full size ship to more conclusively demonstrate the technology's effectiveness.[12] He was able to attract a number of investors to provide the necessary capital, including the banker Wright and the engineering firm of J. and G. Rennie, who together formed a new company called the Ship Propeller Company. The company's proposed vessel was initially tentatively named Propeller, but the name eventually adopted for the ship was Archimedes, after the 3rd century Greek inventor.\\r\\nArchimedes was built 1838, by Henry Wimshurst in London. According to F. P. Smith himself, the ship was constructed of English oak,[13] but a later entry in Lloyd's Register indicates that parts of the keel at least were of Baltic fir. The ship was 125 feet long,[14] 22? feet wide, and 237 tons burthen. Built to a schooner pattern, with classic hull lines and a slender, raking funnel and masts, she was considered by contemporaries to be a beautiful vessel.[15]\\r\\nSmith initially had some difficulty sourcing suitable engines for the ship, as screw propulsion presented some unfamiliar technical challenges. Eventually the leading engineering firm of J. and G. Rennie agreed to design and supply the engines, and the Rennies themselves were persuaded to take a financial interest in the ship and its technology.[16]\\r\\nThe twin engines supplied by the Rennies each had two 37-inch cylinders with a three-foot stroke, delivering a combined nominal horsepower of about 80, and an actual horsepower of about 60. The engines ran at 26 rpm, which through gearing drove the propeller shaft at about 140 rpm.[17] The boilers operated at a pressure of 6 psi. The engines were installed in early 1839, following the ship's launch in October 1838.\\r\\nThe gearing provided some additional technical problems. Smith geared the engines to the propeller via spur-wheels and pinions, the largest of which was toothed with hornbeam (a white timber traditionally used for gearing in windmills).[18] The gearing arrangement proved to be very noisy, and the ship's stern was subject to considerable vibration in operation. Smith planned to reduce the noise by the use of spiral gears,[19] but it is unclear whether this modification was ever carried out.\\r\\nThe propeller itself was of sheet iron, 5 feet 9?inches in diameter and about 5 feet long, and consisted of a full 360 screw, single threaded and of a single turn in keeping with Smith's revised 1836 patent. Following the ship's entry into service, the propeller would subsequently undergo a number of modifications, the most important of which were an alteration to a double threaded/half turn format, and a division of the original 360 screw into two separate blades. The propeller had the unusual feature of being fully retractable in order to reduce drag when the ship was under saila task that took about 15 minutes.[16]\\r\\nArchimedes made her maiden voyage, from London to Sheerness near the mouth of the Thames, commencing 2 May 1839.[20] On the 15th, she commenced her first sea voyage, from Gravesend to Portsmouth, which was completed at the unexpectedly high speed of 10 knots. At Portsmouth, Archimedes was successfully trialed against one of the swiftest vessels then in Admiralty service, HMRC?Vulcan, in the presence of some senior Navy officials, who were impressed by Archimedes' performance.[12]\\r\\nAfter this initial trial Archimedes embarked on a return voyage to London, but while in transit the ship's boilerwhich lacked either a gauge or a safety valveexploded, killing the second engineer and scalding several others. The vessel was then laid up for five months for repairs at Wimshurst's shipyard.[21]\\r\\nOn resuming service, Smith received an invitation from the Dutch government to bring the vessel to the Netherlands for a demonstration, which he accepted. On the voyage to the Texel however, Archimedes broke her crankshaft and was forced to return to England for further repairs, which on this occasion were effected by the firm of Miller, Ravenhill & Co. It was during this refit that the original full helix, single turn, single threaded propeller was replaced by a double-threaded, half turn propeller with two distinct blades. The new propeller had the advantage of considerably reducing the ship's vibration at the stern.[21]\\r\\nFollowing these repairs, the British Admiralty arranged with Smith to undertake a new series of trials for Archimedes at Dover. Captain Edward Chappell, RN, was appointed by the Admiralty to oversee the trials and write a report. From April to May 1840, Archimedes was tested against the Navy's fastest Dover-Calais mail packets, the paddlewheelers Ariel, Beaver, Swallow and Widgeon.[22]\\r\\nThe most telling of these trials were against Widgeon, which was not only the fastest of the mail packets, but also the closest ship in size and horsepower to Archimedes. Widgeon proved to be slightly faster than Archimedes in smooth seas, but Chappell concluded that as the latter had a lower horsepower-to-weight ratio, the screw propeller as a means of propulsion had proven \\"equal, if not superior, to that of the ordinary paddle-wheel.\\"[22] This finding was more decisive than it may appear, because from a naval perspective, screw propulsion had only to prove itself approximately equal in efficiency to paddlewheel propulsion, as paddlewheels had well recognized shortcomings in military use. These included the exposure of the paddlewheel and its engines to enemy fire, as well as the reduction of space available for the placement of cannon which impinged upon a warship's broadside firepower. Chappell's report would later lead to the adoption of screw propulsion by the Navy (see Legacy section below).\\r\\nWith the conclusion of the Dover trials, Archimedes was placed at the disposal of Captain Chappell for a circumnavigation of Britain, which took place in July 1840. This voyage presented an opportunity to not only conduct further tests, but also to allow inspection of the technology by shipowners, engineers and scientists in ports throughout the country. Archimedes completed the 2006-mile voyage at an average speed in excess of 7?mph, and a maximum speed under ideal conditions of 10.9?mph.[23]\\r\\nWith the completion of this voyage, Archimedes made a passage from Plymouth to Oporto, Portugal in the record time of 68? hours. The ship subsequently made further voyages to Antwerp, to Amsterdam via the North Holland Canal, and to various other ports on the continent, exciting interest in the new propulsion method everywhere.[23]\\r\\nUpon the return of Archimedes to England, Smith agreed to loan Archimedes for several months to the Great Western Steamship Company, which was in the process of constructing the world's largest steamship, the SS?Great Britain. Great Western's principal engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, took advantage of the loan to test Archimedes with a variety of different propellers in an attempt to find the most efficient design, which was eventually determined to be a new four-bladed model submitted by Smith.\\r\\nBrunel's experiments led him to recommend to his employers the adoption of screw propulsion for the Great Britain. The advantages of screw propulsion listed by Brunel can be summarized as follows:\\r\\nBy these arguments, Brunel in December 1840 was able to persuade the Great Western Steamship Company to adopt screw propulsion for the Great Britain, thus making her the world's first screw-propelled transatlantic steamer. Unfortunately, instead of using Smith's proven design, Brunel later decided to install a six-bladed \\"windmill\\" propeller designed by himself. Brunel's design was to prove a costly failure for the company.[24]\\r\\nSmith and his fellow investors had originally hoped to sell Archimedes to the Royal Navy, but when this did not occur, the Ship Propeller Company sold the vessel into commercial service. The company, which is estimated to have lost a total of about S50,000 on the Archimedes venture,[25] was subsequently wound up.\\r\\nThe later career of Archimedes is sketchy. The ship ran aground at Beachy Head in 1840. In 1845, she disappeared from Lloyd's Register, but appeared again in 1847 following an overhaul. Her engines and machinery were removed on an unspecified date at Sunderland, after which she continued in service as a sailing ship. In 1852, her sails and rigging were renewed, but she disappeared from the Register again a year or two later.[19]\\r\\nArchimedes reportedly grounded on a sandbar and sank in the mouth of the Meuse River, the Netherlands, while attempting to return to port in a storm on 1 March 1864. All her crew were rescued by local lifeguards.[26]\\r\\nAlthough the adoption of the screw propeller was an historical inevitability given the work of John Ericsson and others, Archimedes considerably hastened acceptance of the technology. The Dover trials, carried out in AprilÿMay 1840, persuaded the Royal Navy to build a 900-ton steam sloop-of-war, HMS?Rattler, which was trialled from 1843-45 against HMS Alecto, a sister ship fitted with paddle propulsion. As a result of these trials, the Navy adopted the screw propeller as its preferred propulsion method. By 1855, 174 ships of the Royal Navy had been fitted with screw propulsion, including 52 ships-of-the-line, 23 frigates, 17 corvettes, 55 sloops, and various other vessels.[27]\\r\\nSome merchants were also quick to adopt screw propulsion. In 1840, Wimshurst built a second propeller-driven vessel, the 300-ton Novelty, the first screw-propelled cargo ship and the first to make a commercial voyage. In 1841, a small passenger steamer fitted with Smith's patented propeller, Princess Royal, was built in the north of England, and in 1842, several more screw-propelled vessels were built or launched in Britain, including Bedlington, built at South Shields, Bee, launched at Chatham,[28] and the largest ship built to that date in Ireland, Great Northern, launched at Derry. From this point, screw-propelled merchant ships grew rapidly in number. By the time the Cunard Line built the paddle steamer Persia for transatlantic service in 1856, the paddlewheel was already becoming an anachronism.[29][30]\\r\\nThough Smith's Archimedes had played an important role in the introduction of screw propulsion, Smith himself only lost money on the venture, and was forced to return to farming. He would later be recognized for his contribution however. In 1855, he was amongst five inventors awarded S4,000 each by the House of Commons for invention of the marine propeller. In 1858, a group of patrons arranged a testimonial dinner at which he was presented with a silver salver, claret-jug and subscription, with an aggregate value of S2,678.[31] In 1860, Smith was appointed Curator of the Patent Office Museum in South Kensington, and in 1871 he received a knighthood.[32]\\r\\nBooks\\r\\nJournals","input":"World's first steamship driven by a screw propeller?"},{"output":"more economical","context":"Koeberg nuclear power station is a nuclear power station in South Africa It is currently the only one in the country, and the only one on the entire African continent.

Six of them scaled the wall to hang up an anti-nuclear protest banner. The twelve were arrested and fined.[14]\\r\\nAt the end of 2005, Koeberg started experiencing numerous technical difficulties. On 11 November 2005, a fault on a transmission busbar caused the reactor to go into safe mode, cutting supply to most of the Western Cape for about two hours. On 16 November a fire under a 400 kV transmission line caused the line to trip, causing severe voltage dips which resulted in Koeberg once again shutting down. Various parts of the Cape were left without electricity for hours at a time. On the evening of 23 November, a routine inspection of the backup safety system revealed a below-spec concentration of an important chemical, resulting in a controlled shutdown of the reactor. Due to the sufficiency of backup supply, major power cuts were not experienced until Friday 25 November, when the backup capacity began running out. At this point, rotational load shedding was employed, with customers being switched off in stages for most of the day. Koeberg was re-synchronised to the national grid on Saturday 26 November.\\r\\nOn Sunday 25 December 2005, the generator of Unit 1 was damaged. While the generator was being powered up after scheduled refuelling and maintenance, a loose bolt, which was left inside the generator caused severe damage, forcing it to be shut down. Subsequent to the unexpected unavailability of Unit 1, Unit 2 was also brought down for scheduled refuelling, resulting in a severe shortage of supply to the Western Cape. This resulted in widespread load shedding in order to maintain the stability of the network. A replacement rotor for Unit 1 was shipped in from France and the unit was brought back into operation in May 2006.\\r\\nOn 18 and 19 February 2006 large parts of the Western Cape again experienced blackouts due to a controlled shutdown of Koeberg. According to Eskom and the City of Cape Town, power cuts were to continue until 26 February 2006, however power supply problems continued beyond this date.\\r\\nThe estimated economic losses due to the power cuts was over R?500?M as at February 2007, and was estimated to rise to possibly as high as R?2?billion.\\r\\nOn 12 September 2010, 91 members of staff were contaminated with cobalt-58 dust in an incident that appears confined to the station.[15]\\r\\nAfter the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, seismic safety at Koeberg was reevaluated in conjunction with the IAEA. Although Koeberg was designed for 0.3g zero period ground acceleration (ZPGA), a magnitude 7 earthquake, stress tests evaluated Koeberg against a 0.5g ZPGA. Overall Koeberg found to be seismically robust and well designed, with some areas for attention and improvement that were highlighted.[6]\\r\\nDuynefontein next door on the northern side of Koeberg is a proposed site for a new nuclear power station.[16]\\r\\nSouth Africa's nuclear industry has seen its fair share of opposition, chiefly from environmentalists concerned about safety issues such as radioactive waste, and anti-war activists concerned about nuclear proliferation and use of atomic weapons. Current campaigns against nuclear energy are being run by Earthlife Africa and Koeberg Alert.

El Ni?o Southern Oscillation refers to the cycle of warm and cold temperatures, as measured by sea surface temperature, SST, of the tropical central and eastern Pacific Ocean. El Ni?o is accompanied by high air pressure in the western Pacific and low air pressure in the eastern Pacific. The cool phase of ENSO is called \\"La Ni?a\\" with SST in the eastern Pacific below average and air pressures high in the eastern and low in western Pacific. The ENSO cycle, both El Ni?o and La Ni?a, cause global changes of both temperatures and rainfall.[2][3]\\r\\nDeveloping countries that are dependent upon agriculture and fishing, particularly those bordering the Pacific Ocean, are usually most affected. In American Spanish, the capitalized term \\"El Ni?o\\" refers to \\"the little boy\\", so named because the pool of warm water in the Pacific near South America is often at its warmest around Christmas.[4] The original name, \\"El Ni?o de Navidad\\", traces its origin centuries back to Peruvian fishermen, who named the weather phenomenon in reference to the newborn Christ.[5][6] \\"La Ni?a\\", chosen as the 'opposite' of El Ni?o, literally translates to \\"the little girl\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally the term El Ni?o applied to an annual weak warm ocean current that ran southwards along the coast of Peru and Ecuador at about Christmas time.[7] However, over time the term has evolved and now refers to the warm and negative phase of the El Ni?o Southern Oscillation and is the warming of the ocean surface or above-average sea surface temperatures in either the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.[8][9] This warming causes a shift in the atmospheric circulation with rainfall becoming reduced over Indonesia and Australia, while rainfall and tropical cyclone formation increases over the tropical Pacific Ocean.[10] The low-level surface trade winds, which normally blow from east to west along the equator, either weaken or start blowing from the other direction.[9]\\r\\nHistorically, El Ni?o events are thought to have been occurring for thousands of years.[11] For example, it is thought that El Ni?o affected the Inca Empire in modern-day Peru, who sacrificed humans in order to try to prevent the rains.[11] Scientists have also found the chemical signatures of warmer sea surface temperatures and increased rainfall caused by El Ni?o in coral specimens that are around 13,000?years old.[12] In around 1525 when Francisco Pizarro made landfall on Peru, he noted rainfall occurring in the deserts which subsequently became the first written record of the impacts of El Ni?o.[12] Modern day research and reanalysis techniques have managed to find at least 26 El Ni?o events since 1900, with the 1982-83, 1997ÿ98 and 2014ÿ16 events among the strongest on record.[13][14][15]\\r\\nCurrently, each country has a different threshold for what constitutes an El Ni?o event, which is tailored to their specific interests.[16] For example, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology looks at the trade winds, SOI, weather models and sea surface temperatures in the Nino 3 and 3.4 regions, before declaring an El Ni?o.[17] The United States Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) looks at the sea surface temperatures in the Ni?o 3.4 region, the tropical Pacific atmosphere and forecasts that NOAA's Oceanic Ni?o Index will equal or exceed +0.5?C for several seasons in a row.[18] However, the Japan Meteorological Agency declares that an El Ni?o event has started when the average 5 month sea surface temperature deviation for the NINO.3 region, is over 0.5?C (0.90?F) warmer for 6 consecutive months or longer.[19] The Peruvian government declares that a coastal El Ni?o is under way, if the sea surface temperatures in the Ni?o 1 and 2 regions, equal or exceed +0.4?C for at least 3 months.\\r\\nThere is no consensus on if climate change will have any influence on the occurrence, strength or duration of El Ni?o events, as research supports El Ni?o events becoming stronger, longer, shorter and weaker.[20][21]\\r\\nA timeline of all the El Ni?o episodes between 1900 and 2016.[13][14]\\r\\nEl Ni?o events are thought to have been occurring for thousands of years.[11] For example, it is thought that El Ni?o affected the Inca Empire in modern-day Peru, who sacrificed humans in order to try and prevent the rains.[11]\\r\\nIt is thought that there have been at least 30 El Ni?o events since 1900, with the 1982-83, 1997ÿ98 and 2014ÿ16 events among the strongest on record.[13][14] Since 2000, El Ni?o events have been observed in 2002ÿ03, 2004ÿ05, 2006ÿ07, 2009ÿ10 and 2014ÿ16.[13]\\r\\nMajor ENSO events were recorded in the years 1790ÿ93, 1828, 1876ÿ78, 1891, 1925ÿ26, 1972ÿ73, 1982ÿ83, 1997ÿ98, and 2014ÿ16.[22][23][24][verification needed][needs update]\\r\\nTypically, this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of two to seven years, and lasts nine months to two years.[25] The average period length is five years. When this warming occurs for seven to nine months, it is classified as El Ni?o \\"conditions\\"; when its duration is longer, it is classified as an El Ni?o \\"episode\\".[26]\\r\\nThere is no consensus on whether climate change will have any influence on the occurrence, strength or duration of El Ni?o events, as research supports El Ni?o events becoming stronger, longer, shorter and weaker.[20][21]\\r\\nDuring strong El Ni?o episodes, a secondary peak in sea surface temperature across the far eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean sometimes follows the initial peak.[27]\\r\\nENSO conditions have occurred at two- to seven-year intervals for at least the past 300 years, but most of them have been weak. Evidence is also strong for El Ni?o events during the early Holocene epoch 10,000 years ago.[28]\\r\\nEl Ni?o may have led to the demise of the Moche and other pre-Columbian Peruvian cultures.[29] A recent study suggests a strong El-Ni?o effect between 1789 and 1793 caused poor crop yields in Europe, which in turn helped touch off the French Revolution.[30] The extreme weather produced by El Ni?o in 1876ÿ77 gave rise to the most deadly famines of the 19th century.[31] The 1876 famine alone in northern China killed up to 13 million people.[32]\\r\\nAn early recorded mention of the term \\"El Ni?o\\" to refer to climate occurred in 1892, when Captain Camilo Carrillo told the geographical society congress in Lima that Peruvian sailors named the warm north-flowing current \\"El Ni?o\\" because it was most noticeable around Christmas.[33] The phenomenon had long been of interest because of its effects on the guano industry and other enterprises that depend on biological productivity of the sea.\\r\\nCharles Todd, in 1888, suggested droughts in India and Australia tended to occur at the same time;[34] Norman Lockyer noted the same in 1904.[35] An El Ni?o connection with flooding was reported in 1894 by Vctor Eguiguren?(es) (1852ÿ1919) and in 1895 by Federico Alfonso Pezet (1859ÿ1929).[36][37] In 1924, Gilbert Walker (for whom the Walker circulation is named) coined the term \\"Southern Oscillation\\".[38] He and others (including Norwegian-American meteorologist Jacob Bjerknes) are generally credited with identifying the El Ni?o effect.[39]\\r\\nThe major 1982ÿ83 El Ni?o led to an upsurge of interest from the scientific community. The period 1991ÿ1995 was unusual in that El Ni?os have rarely occurred in such rapid succession.[40] An especially intense El Ni?o event in 1998 caused an estimated 16% of the world's reef systems to die. The event temporarily warmed air temperature by 1.5?C, compared to the usual increase of 0.25?C associated with El Ni?o events.[41] Since then, mass coral bleaching has become common worldwide, with all regions having suffered \\"severe bleaching\\".[42]\\r\\nIt is thought that there are several different types of El Ni?o events, with the canonical eastern Pacific and the Modoki central Pacific types being the two that receive the most attention.[43][44][45] These different types of El Ni?o events are classified by where the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are the largest.[45] For example, the strongest sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the canonical eastern Pacific event are located off the coast of South America.[45] The strongest anomalies associated with the Modoki central Pacific event are located near the International Dateline.[45] However, during the duration of a single event, the area with the greatest sea surface temperature anomalies can change.[45]\\r\\nThe traditional Ni?o, also called Eastern Pacific (EP) El Ni?o,[46] involves temperature anomalies in the Eastern Pacific. However, in the last two decades, nontraditional El Ni?os were observed, in which the usual place of the temperature anomaly (Ni?o 1 and 2) is not affected, but an anomaly arises in the central Pacific (Ni?o 3.4).[47] The phenomenon is called Central Pacific (CP) El Ni?o,[46] \\"dateline\\" El Ni?o (because the anomaly arises near the dateline), or El Ni?o \\"Modoki\\" (Modoki is Japanese for \\"similar, but different\\").[48][49][50][51]\\r\\nThe effects of the CP El Ni?o are different from those of the traditional EP El Ni?oe.g., the recently discovered El Ni?o leads to more hurricanes more frequently making landfall in the Atlantic.[52]\\r\\nThere is also a scientific debate on the very existence of this \\"new\\" ENSO. Indeed, a number of studies dispute the reality of this statistical distinction or its increasing occurrence, or both, either arguing the reliable record is too short to detect such a distinction,[53][54] finding no distinction or trend using other statistical approaches,[55][56][57][58][59] or that other types should be distinguished, such as standard and extreme ENSO.[60][61]\\r\\nThe first recorded El Ni?o that originated in the central Pacific and moved toward the east was in 1986.[62] Recent Central Pacific El Ni?os happened in 1986ÿ87, 1991ÿ92, 1994ÿ95, 2002ÿ03, 2004ÿ05 and 2009ÿ10.[63] Furthermore, there were \\"Modoki\\" events in 1957ÿ59,[64] 1963ÿ64, 1965ÿ66, 1968ÿ70, 1977ÿ78 and 1979ÿ80.[65][66]\\r\\nEl Nino affects the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns, which as a result can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in others.[67][68]\\r\\nMost tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the Westerlies.[69] Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience much fewer SeptemberÿNovember tropical cyclone impacts during El Ni?o and neutral years. During El Ni?o years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago.[70]\\r\\nWithin the Atlantic Ocean vertical wind shear is increased, which inhibits tropical cyclone genesis and intensification, by causing the westerly winds in the atmosphere to be stronger.[71] The atmosphere over the Atlantic Ocean can also be drier and more stable during El Ni?o events, which can also inhibit tropical cyclone genesis and intensification.[71] Within the Eastern Pacific basin: El Ni?o events contribute to decreased easterly vertical wind shear and favours above-normal hurricane activity.[72] However, the impacts of the ENSO state in this region can vary and are strongly influenced by background climate patterns.[72] The Western Pacific basin experiences a change in the location of where tropical cyclones form during El Ni?o events, without a major change in how many develop each year.[71] As a result of this change Micronesia is more likely to be affected by several tropical cyclones, while China has a decreased risk of being affected by several tropical cyclones.[citation needed] A change in the location of where tropical cyclones form also occurs within the Southern Pacific Ocean between 135E and 120W, with tropical cyclones more likely to occur within the Southern Pacific basin than the Australian region.[10][71] As a result of this change tropical cyclones are 50% less likely to make landfall on Queensland, while the risk of a tropical cyclone is elevated for island nations like Niue, French Polynesia, Tonga, Tuvalu and the Cook Islands.[10][73][74]\\r\\nA study of climate records has shown that El Ni?o events in the equatorial Pacific are generally associated with a warm tropical North Atlantic in the following spring and summer.[75] About half of El Ni?o events persist sufficiently into the spring months for the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool to become unusually large in summer.[76] Occasionally, El Ni?o's effect on the Atlantic Walker circulation over South America strengthens the easterly trade winds in the western equatorial Atlantic region. As a result, an unusual cooling may occur in the eastern equatorial Atlantic in spring and summer following El Ni?o peaks in winter.[77] Cases of El Ni?o-type events in both oceans simultaneously have been linked to severe famines related to the extended failure of monsoon rains.[22]\\r\\nMany ENSO linkages exist in the high southern latitudes around Antarctica.[78] Specifically, El Ni?o conditions result in high-pressure anomalies over the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, causing reduced sea ice and increased poleward heat fluxes in these sectors, as well as the Ross Sea. The Weddell Sea, conversely, tends to become colder with more sea ice during El Ni?o. The exact opposite heating and atmospheric pressure anomalies occur during La Ni?a.[79] This pattern of variability is known as the Antarctic dipole mode, although the Antarctic response to ENSO forcing is not ubiquitous.[79]\\r\\nObservations of El Ni?o events since 1950, show that impacts associated with El Ni?o events depend on what season it is.[80] However, while certain events and impacts are expected to occur during events, it is not certain or guaranteed that they will occur.[80] The impacts that generally do occur during most El Ni?o events include below-average rainfall over Indonesia and northern South America, while above average rainfall occurs in southeastern South America, eastern equatorial Africa, and the southern United States.[80]\\r\\nDuring El Ni?o events, the shift in rainfall away from the Western Pacific may mean that rainfall across Australia is reduced.[10] Over the southern part of the continent, warmer than average temperatures can be recorded as weather systems are more mobile and fewer blocking areas of high pressure occur.[10] The onset of the Indo-Australian Monsoon in tropical Australia is delayed by two to six weeks, which as a consequence means that rainfall is reduced over the northern tropics.[10] The risk of a significant bushfire season in south-eastern Australia is higher following an El Ni?o event, especially when it is combined with a positive Indian Ocean Dipole event.[10] During an El Ni?o event, New Zealand tends to experience stronger or more frequent westerly winds during their summer, which leads to an elevated risk of drier than normal conditions along the east coast.[81] There is more rain than usual though on New Zealand's West Coast, because of the barrier effect of the North Island mountain ranges and the Southern Alps.[81]\\r\\nFiji generally experiences drier than normal conditions during an El Ni?o, which can lead to drought becoming established over the Islands.[82] However, the main impacts on the island nation is felt about a year after the event becomes established.[82] Within the Samoan Islands, below average rainfall and higher than normal temperatures are recorded during El Ni?o events, which can lead to droughts and forest fires on the islands.[83] Other impacts include a decrease in the sea level, possibility of coral bleaching in the marine environment and an increased risk of a tropical cyclone affecting Samoa.[83]\\r\\nIn Africa, East Africa? including Kenya, Tanzania, and the White Nile basin? experiences, in the long rains from March to May, wetter-than-normal conditions. Conditions are also drier than normal from December to February in south-central Africa, mainly in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Botswana.\\r\\nAs warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the east Pacific, it takes the rain with it, causing extensive drought in the western Pacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern Pacific. Singapore experienced the driest February in 2014 since records began in 1869, with only 6.3?mm of rain falling in the month and temperatures hitting as high as 35?C on 26 February. The years 1968 and 2005 had the next driest Februaries, when 8.4?mm of rain fell. [84]\\r\\nEl Ni?o's effects on Europe are controversial, complex and difficult to analyse, as it is one of several factors that influence the weather over the continent and other factors can overwhelm the signal.[85][86]\\r\\nOver North America, the main temperature and precipitation impacts of El Ni?o, generally occur in the six months between October and March.[87][88] In particular the majority of Canada generally has a milder than normal winters and cold fronts springs, with the exception of eastern Canada where no significant impacts occur.[89] Within the United States, the impacts generally observed during the six-month period include; wetter-than-average conditions along the Gulf Coast between Texas and Florida, while drier conditions are observed in Hawaii, the Ohio Valley, Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains.[87] Over California and the South-Western United States, there is a weak relationship between El Nino and above-average precipitation, as it strongly depends on the strength of the El Ni?o event amongst other factors.[87]\\r\\nThe synoptic condition for the Tehuantepecer is associated with high-pressure system forming in Sierra Madre of Mexico in the wake of an advancing cold front, which causes winds to accelerate through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts, between October and February, with a summer maximum in July caused by the westward extension of the Azores High. Wind magnitude is greater during El Ni?o years than during La Ni?a years, due to the more frequent cold frontal incursions during El Ni?o winters.[90] Its effects can last from a few hours to six days.[91]\\r\\nBecause El Ni?o's warm pool feeds thunderstorms above, it creates increased rainfall across the east-central and eastern Pacific Ocean, including several portions of the South American west coast. The effects of El Ni?o in South America are direct and stronger than in North America. An El Ni?o is associated with warm and very wet weather months in AprilÿOctober along the coasts of northern Peru and Ecuador, causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme.[92] The effects during the months of February, March, and April may become critical. Along the west coast of South America, El Ni?o reduces the upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water that sustains large fish populations, which in turn sustain abundant sea birds, whose droppings support the fertilizer industry. The reduction in upwelling leads to fish kills off the shore of Peru.[93]\\r\\nThe local fishing industry along the affected coastline can suffer during long-lasting El Ni?o events. The world's largest fishery collapsed due to overfishing during the 1972 El Ni?o Peruvian anchoveta reduction. During the 1982ÿ83 event, jack mackerel and anchoveta populations were reduced, scallops increased in warmer water, but hake followed cooler water down the continental slope, while shrimp and sardines moved southward, so some catches decreased while others increased.[94] Horse mackerel have increased in the region during warm events. Shifting locations and types of fish due to changing conditions provide challenges for fishing industries. Peruvian sardines have moved during El Ni?o events to Chilean areas. Other conditions provide further complications, such as the government of Chile in 1991 creating restrictions on the fishing areas for self-employed fishermen and industrial fleets.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe ENSO variability may contribute to the great success of small, fast-growing species along the Peruvian coast, as periods of low population removes predators in the area. Similar effects benefit migratory birds that travel each spring from predator-rich tropical areas to distant winter-stressed nesting areas.[citation needed]\\r\\nSouthern Brazil and northern Argentina also experience wetter than normal conditions, but mainly during the spring and early summer. Central Chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Altiplano is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events. Drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin, Colombia, and Central America.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen El Ni?o conditions last for many months, extensive ocean warming and the reduction in easterly trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient-rich deep water, and its economic effect on local fishing for an international market can be serious.[93]\\r\\nMore generally, El Ni?o can affect commodity prices and the macroeconomy of different countries. It can constrain the supply of rain-driven agricultural commodities; reduce agricultural output, construction, and services activities; create food-price and generalised inflation; and may trigger social unrest in commodity-dependent poor countries that primarily rely on imported food.[95] A University of Cambridge Working Paper shows that while Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa face a short-lived fall in economic activity in response to an El Ni?o shock, other countries may actually benefit from an El Ni?o weather shock (either directly or indirectly through positive spillovers from major trading partners), for instance, Argentina, Canada, Mexico and the United States. Furthermore, most countries experience short-run inflationary pressures following an El Ni?o shock, while global energy and non-fuel commodity prices increase.[96] The IMF estimates a significant El Ni?o can boost the GDP of the United States by about 0.5% (due largely to lower heating bills) and reduce the GDP of Indonesia by about 1.0%.[97]\\r\\nExtreme weather conditions related to the El Ni?o cycle correlate with changes in the incidence of epidemic diseases. For example, the El Ni?o cycle is associated with increased risks of some of the diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, such as malaria, dengue, and Rift Valley fever[98]. Cycles of malaria in India, Venezuela, Brazil, and Colombia have now been linked to El Ni?o. Outbreaks of another mosquito-transmitted disease, Australian encephalitis (Murray Valley encephalitisMVE), occur in temperate south-east Australia after heavy rainfall and flooding, which are associated with La Ni?a events. A severe outbreak of Rift Valley fever occurred after extreme rainfall in north-eastern Kenya and southern Somalia during the 1997ÿ98 El Ni?o.[99]\\r\\nENSO conditions have also been related to Kawasaki disease incidence in Japan and the west coast of the United States,[100] via the linkage to tropospheric winds across the north Pacific Ocean.[101]\\r\\nENSO may be linked to civil conflicts. Scientists at The Earth Institute of Columbia University, having analyzed data from 1950 to 2004, suggest ENSO may have had a role in 21% of all civil conflicts since 1950, with the risk of annual civil conflict doubling from 3% to 6% in countries affected by ENSO during El Ni?o years relative to La Ni?a years.[102][103]","input":"When did the most recent el ni?o occur?"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(I,[["render",x]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/34.md","filePath":"qapage/34.md"}'),R={name:"qapage/34.md"},F=Object.assign(R,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{D as __pageData,F as default};
