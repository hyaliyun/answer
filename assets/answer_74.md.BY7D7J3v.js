Prison building efforts in the United States came in three major waves . The first began during the Jacksonian Era and led to widespread use of imprisonment and rehabilitative labor as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the American Civil War . The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States . These periods of prison construction and reform produced major changes in the structure of prison systems and their missions , the responsibilities of federal and state agencies for administering and supervising them , as well as the legal and political status of prisoners themselves ."},{"query":"how many aircraft carriers are in the us navy fleet","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"which of these is not an appendage of the skin","short_answer":"","abstract":"Skin appendages ( or adnexa ) are skin - associated structures that serve a particular function including sensation , contractility , lubrication and heat loss .

Secondary messengers are therefore one of the initiating components of intracellular signal transduction cascades . Examples of second messenger molecules include cyclic AMP , cyclic GMP , inositol trisphosphate , diacylglycerol , and calcium . The cell releases second messenger molecules in response to exposure to extracellular signaling molecules -- the first messengers . First messengers are extracellular factors , often hormones or neurotransmitters , such as epinephrine , growth hormone , and serotonin . Because peptide hormones and neurotransmitters typically are biochemically hydrophilic molecules , these first messengers may not physically cross the phospholipid bilayer to initiate changes within the cell directly -- unlike steroid hormones , which usually do . This functional limitation necessitates the cell to devise signal transduction mechanisms to transduce first messenger into second messengers , so that the extracellular signal may be propagated intracellularly . An important feature of the second messenger signaling system is that second messengers may be coupled downstream to multi-cyclic kinase cascades to greatly amplify the strength of the original first messenger signal . For example , RasGTP signals link with the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) cascade to amplify the allosteric activation of proliferative transcription factors such as Myc and CREB ."},{"query":"how many sons does ragnar lothbrok have in vikings","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Tale of Ragnar 's sons ( Old Norse : Ragnarssona þáttr ) is an Old Norse story about Ragnar Lodbrok and his sons ."},{"query":"what was the most important decision the second continental congress made","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Second Continental Congress was a convention of delegates from the Thirteen Colonies that started meeting in the spring of 1775 in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases . In the first phase , the Archidamian War , Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica , while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy .

If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle , the wave can not pass through and is entirely reflected . The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs . This is particularly common as an optical phenomenon , where light waves are involved , but it occurs with many types of waves , such as electromagnetic waves in general or sound waves . When a wave reaches a boundary between different materials with different refractive indices , the wave will in general be partially refracted at the boundary surface , and partially reflected . However , if the angle of incidence is greater ( i.e. the direction of propagation is closer to being parallel to the boundary ) than the critical angle -- the angle of incidence at which light is refracted such that it travels along the boundary -- then the wave will not cross the boundary , but will instead be totally reflected back internally . This can only occur when the wave in a medium with a higher refractive index ( n ) reaches a boundary with a medium of lower refractive index ( n ) . For example , it will occur with light reaching air from glass , but not when reaching glass from air ."},{"query":"when was the last world cup that brazil won","short_answer":"2002","abstract":""},{"query":"pee wee herman's big adventure large marge","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"star trek deep space nine little green man cast","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Little Green Men '' is the 80th episode of the American syndicated science fiction television series Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , the eighth episode of the fourth season ."},{"query":"how many times did the chicago cubs play in the world series","short_answer":"eleven","abstract":"The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago , Illinois .

This means that small increases in calcium ions within the cell are easily detected and can bring about important cellular changes ( the calcium is said to be a second messenger ; see calcium in biology for more details ) . Calcium is used to make calcium carbonate ( found in chalk ) and calcium phosphate , two compounds that the body uses to make teeth and bones . This means that too much calcium within the cells can lead to hardening ( calcification ) of certain intracellular structures , including the mitochondria , leading to cell death .

About 20 % of the atmosphere 's mass is contained in the stratosphere . The stratosphere is stratified in temperature , with warmer layers higher and cooler layers closer to the Earth .

Near the equator , the stratosphere starts at 18 km ( 59,000 ft ; 11 mi ) ; at mid latitudes , it starts at 10 -- 13 km ( 33,000 -- 43,000 ft ; 6.2 -- 8.1 mi ) and ends at 50 km ( 160,000 ft ; 31 mi ) ; at the poles , it starts at about 8 km ( 26,000 ft ; 5.0 mi ) . Temperatures vary within the stratosphere with the seasons , in particular with the polar night ( winter ) . The greatest variation of temperature takes place over the poles in the lower stratosphere ; variations at lower latitudes and higher altitudes are smaller .

This term can be used formally or informally . In Western Europe and the Americas , abolitionism is a historical movement in effort to end the African and Indian slave trade and set slaves free . King Charles I of Spain , usually known as Emperor Charles V , was following the example of Louis X of France who abolished slavery within the Kingdom of France in 1315 . He passed a law which would have abolished colonial slavery in 1542 , although this law was not passed in the largest colonial states , and was not enforced . In the late 17th century , the Roman Catholic Church , taking up a plea by Lourenço da Silva de Mendouça , officially condemned the slave trade , which was affirmed vehemently by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839 . The abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century , however , when English and American Quakers began to question the morality of slavery . James Oglethorpe was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery , banning it in the Province of Georgia on humanitarian grounds , and arguing against it in Parliament , and eventually encouraging his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause . Soon after his death in 1785 , Sharp and More united with William Wilberforce and others in forming the Clapham Sect ."},{"query":"chelsea fc squad that won the champions league","short_answer":"","abstract":"The 2012 UEFA Champions League Final was a football match which took place on Saturday , 19 May 2012 between Bayern Munich of Germany and Chelsea of England at the Allianz Arena in Munich , Germany .

This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , a number of correlated and more specific primary factors are claimed .

The most recent edition , the Bayley - III has three main subtests ; the Cognitive Scale , which includes items such as attention to familiar and unfamiliar objects , looking for a fallen object , and pretend play , the Language Scale , which taps understanding and expression of language , for example , recognition of objects and people , following directions , and naming objects and pictures , and the Motor Scale , which assesses gross and fine motor skills such as grasping , sitting , stacking blocks , and climbing stairs .

In cold weather , high speed diesel engines can be difficult to start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression , preventing ignition ( which relies on that heat ) . Pre-chambered engines use small electric heaters ( glowplugs ) inside the pre-chambers . Direct - injected engines have these glowplugs in the combustion chamber . The glowplug is a pencil - shaped piece of metal with a heating element at the tip . This heating element , when electrified , heats due to its electrical resistance and begins to emit light in the visible spectrum , hence the term glowplug . The visual effect is similar to the heating element in a toaster . The fuel injector spray pattern then impinges directly upon the hot tip of the glow plug during the injection of fuel at top dead center . This ignites the fuel even when the engine is insufficiently hot for normal operation , which reduces the cranking time to start the engine ."},{"query":"where are the green mountains located on a map","short_answer":"in the U.S. state of Vermont|approximately 250 miles ( 400 km ) from the border with Massachusetts to that with Quebec , Canada","abstract":"The Green Mountains are a mountain range in the U.S. state of Vermont .

This particular biochemistry probably represents the origins of catecholamine overload ( PO ) to a molecule . In biology , phosphorylation and its counterpart , dephosphorylation , are critical for many cellular processes . A large fraction of proteins ( between 1 / 3 to 2 / 3 of the proteome in eukaryotes ) are temporarily phosphorylated , as are many sugars , lipids , and other molecules . Phosphorylation is especially important for protein function as this modification activates ( or deactivates ) almost half of the enzymes , thereby regulating their function . Protein phosphorylation is considered the most abundant post-translational modification in eukaryotes . Phosphorylation can occur on Serine , Threonine and Tyrosine side chains ( often called ' residues ' ) through phosphoester bond formation , on Histidine , Lysine and Arginine through phosphoramidate bonds , and on Aspartic Acid and Glutamic Acid through mixed anhydride linkages . Recent evidence confirms widespread Histidine phosphorylation at both the 1 and 3 N - atoms of the imidazole ring Recent work from 2017 ( preprinted at BioRxiv ) suggests widespread human protein phosphorylation on multiple non-canonical amino acids , including motifs containing phosphorylated histidine , aspartate , glutamate , arginine and lysine in HeLa cell extracts . Due to the chemical lability of these phosphorylated residues , and in marked contrast to Ser , Thr and Tyr phosphorylation , the analysis of phosphorylated Histidine using standard biochemical and mass spectrometric approaches is much more challenging and special procedures and separation techniques are required for their preservation alongside classical Ser , Thr and Tyr phosphorylation ."},{"query":"when did the pleistocene epoch began and end","short_answer":"about 2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago","abstract":"For the Holocene , dates are relative to the year 2000 ( e.g. Greenlandian began 11,700 years before 2000 ) .

According to this model , there is a lipid bilayer in which the protein molecules are embedded . The lipid bilayer gives fluidity and elasticity to the membrane . Small amounts of carbohydrates are also found in cell membrane . The model , which was devised by SJ Singer and GL Nicolson in 1972 , describes the cell membrane as a two - dimensional liquid that restricts the lateral diffusion of membrane components . Such domains are defined by the existence of regions within the membrane with special lipid and protein composition that promote the formation of lipid rafts or protein and glycoprotein complexes . Another way to define membrane domains is the association of the lipid membrane with the cytoskeleton filaments and the extracellular matrix through membrane proteins . The current model describes important features relevant to many cellular processes , including : cell - cell signaling , apoptosis , cell division , membrane budding , and cell fusion . The fluid mosaic model is the most acceptable model of plasma membrane ."},{"query":"what did the british not agree to in jay's treaty","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Treaty of Amity , Commerce , and Navigation , Between His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America , commonly known as the Jay Treaty , and also as Jay 's Treaty , was a 1795 treaty between the United States and Great Britain that averted war , resolved issues remaining since the Treaty of Paris of 1783 ( which ended the American Revolutionary War ) , and facilitated ten years of peaceful trade between the United States and Britain in the midst of the French Revolutionary Wars , which began in 1792 .

It is an allosteric enzyme made of 4 subunits and controlled by many activators and inhibitors . PFK - 1 catalyzes the important \`\` committed '' step of glycolysis , the conversion of fructose 6 - phosphate and ATP to fructose 1 , 6 - bisphosphate and ADP . Glycolysis is the foundation for respiration , both anaerobic and aerobic . Because phosphofructokinase ( PFK ) catalyzes the ATP - dependent phosphorylation to convert fructose - 6 - phosphate into fructose 1 , 6 - bisphosphate and ADP , it is one of the key regulatory and rate limiting steps of glycolysis . PFK is able to regulate glycolysis through allosteric inhibition , and in this way , the cell can increase or decrease the rate of glycolysis in response to the cell 's energy requirements . For example , a high ratio of ATP to ADP will inhibit PFK and glycolysis . The key difference between the regulation of PFK in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is that in eukaryotes PFK is activated by fructose 2 , 6 - bisphosphate . The purpose of fructose 2 , 6 - bisphosphate is to supersede ATP inhibition , thus allowing eukaryotes to have greater sensitivity to regulation by hormones like glucagon and insulin ."},{"query":"why did the film boyz in the hood become popular in england","short_answer":"","abstract":"Boyz n the Hood is a 1991 American teen hood drama film written and directed by John Singleton in his directorial debut , and starring Cuba Gooding Jr. , Ice Cube , Morris Chestnut , Laurence Fishburne , Nia Long , Regina King and Angela Bassett .

Some examples are infertility , termination of pregnancy , disappearance of a family member , death of an ex-spouse , a family member being physically alive but in a state of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer 's disease or dementia , etc . An ambiguous loss can be categorized into two types of loss , physical or psychological . Physical loss and psychological loss differ in terms of what is being grieved for , the loss of the physical body , or the psychological mind . Experiencing an ambiguous loss can lead to personal questions , such as , \`\` Am I still married to my missing spouse ? , '' or \`\` Am I still a child to a parent who no longer remembers me ? '' . Since the grief process in an ambiguous loss is halted , it is harder to cope or move on to acceptance from the type of loss experienced . There are various types of grief that can occur due to the type of ambiguity experienced and corresponding therapy techniques to address the certain types of grief .

It is the physical process by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional three - dimensional structure from random coil . Each protein exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mRNA to a linear chain of amino acids . This polypeptide lacks any stable ( long - lasting ) three - dimensional structure ( the left hand side of the first figure ) . As the polypeptide chain is being synthesized by the ribosome , the linear chain begins to fold into its three dimensional structure . Folding begins to occur even during translation of the polypeptide chain . Amino acids interact with each other to produce a well - defined three - dimensional structure , the folded protein ( the right hand side of the figure ) , known as the native state . The resulting three - dimensional structure is determined by the amino acid sequence or primary structure ( Anfinsen 's dogma ) . The energy landscape describes the folding pathways in which the unfolded protein is able to assume its native state . Experiments beginning in the 1980s indicate the codon for an amino acid can also influence protein structure ."},{"query":"when did the emperor's new groove come out","short_answer":"December 15 , 2000","abstract":"The Emperor 's New Groove is a 2000 American animated buddy comedy film created by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures .

The renal tubule extends from the capsule . The capsule and tubule are connected and are composed of epithelial cells with a lumen . A healthy adult has 0.8 to 1.5 million nephrons in each kidney . Blood is filtered as it passes through three layers : the endothelial cells of the capillary wall , its basement membrane , and between the foot processes of the podocytes of the lining of the capsule . The tubule has adjacent peritubular capillaries that run between the descending and ascending portions of the tubule . As the fluid from the capsule flows down into the tubule , it is processed by the epithelial cells lining the tubule : water is reabsorbed and substances are exchanged ( some are added , others are removed ) ; first with the interstitial fluid outside the tubules , and then into the plasma in the adjacent peritubular capillaries through the endothelial cells lining that capillary . This process regulates the volume of body fluid as well as levels of many body substances .

The dilemma of illicit activities is accounting for the origin of the proceeds of such activities without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies .

The first began during the Jacksonian Era and led to widespread use of imprisonment and rehabilitative labor as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the American world war one . The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States .
