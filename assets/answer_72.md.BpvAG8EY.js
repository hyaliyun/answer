The historical ties between the two countries are long and complex , including conquest , wars , and alliances at various points in history . The Roman era saw both areas , except Scotland and Northern Ireland , conquered by Rome , whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day , and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas ; however , the language barrier remained . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO , the western military alliance led by the United States . In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship , especially on defence and foreign policy issues ; the two countries tend , however , to disagree on a range of other matters , most notably the European Union .

In nature complementarity is the base principle of DNA replication and transcription as it is a property shared between two DNA or RNA sequences , such that when they are aligned antiparallel to each other , the nucleotide bases at each position in the sequences will be complementary , much like looking in the mirror and seeing the reverse of things . This complementary base pairing allows cells to copy information from one generation to another and even find and repair damage to the information stored in the sequences . The degree of complementarity between two nucleic acid strands may vary , from complete complementarity ( each nucleotide is across from its opposite ) to no complementarity ( each nucleotide is not across from its opposite ) and determines the stability of the sequences to be together . Furthermore , various DNA repair functions as well as regulatory functions are based on base pair complementarity . In biotechnology , the principle of base pair complementarity allows the generation of DNA hybrids between RNA and DNA , and opens the door to modern tools such as cDNA libraries . While most complementarity is seen between two separate strings of DNA or RNA , it is also possible for a sequence to have internal complementarity resulting in the sequence binding to itself in a folded configuration ."},{"query":"what kind of turf is at at&t stadium","short_answer":"","abstract":"AT&T Stadium , formerly Cowboys Stadium , is a retractable roof stadium in Arlington , Texas , United States .

Fundamental to the notion of sustainable harvest , the concept of MSY aims to maintain the population size at the point of maximum growth rate by harvesting the individuals that would normally be added to the population , allowing the population to continue to be productive indefinitely . Under the assumption of logistic growth , resource limitation does not constrain individuals ' reproductive rates when populations are small , but because there are few individuals , the overall yield is small . At intermediate population densities , also represented by half the carrying capacity , individuals are able to breed to their maximum rate . At this point , called the maximum sustainable yield , there is a surplus of individuals that can be harvested because growth of the population is at its maximum point due to the large number of reproducing individuals . Above this point , density dependent factors increasingly limit breeding until the population reaches carrying capacity . At this point , there are no surplus individuals to be harvested and yield drops to zero . The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the optimum sustainable yield and maximum economic yield ."},{"query":"who is the current steel minister of india","short_answer":"Shri Narendra Singh Tomar","abstract":"The Minister of Steel is the head of the Ministry of Steel and one of the cabinet ministers of the Government of India.

The rate of this movement is a function of temperature , viscosity of the fluid and the size ( mass ) of the particles . Diffusion explains the net flux of molecules from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration . Once the concentrations are equal the molecules continue to move , but since there is no concentration gradient the process of molecular diffusion has ceased and is instead governed by the process of self - diffusion , originating from the random motion of the molecules . The result of diffusion is a gradual mixing of material such that the distribution of molecules is uniform . Since the molecules are still in motion , but an equilibrium has been established , the end result of molecular diffusion is called a \`\` dynamic equilibrium '' . In a phase with uniform temperature , absent external net forces acting on the particles , the diffusion process will eventually result in complete mixing ."},{"query":"how far is it from buffalo new york to new york city","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"when was pslv launched for the first time","short_answer":"20 September 1993","abstract":"The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle , commonly known by its abbreviation PSLV , is an expendable launch system developed and operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) .

The defining characteristic of \`\` common law '' is that it arises as precedent . In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is , a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts , and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts . If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past , the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision ( a principle known as stare decisis ) . If , however , the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases ( called a \`\` matter of first impression '' ) , and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question , judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue ( one party or the other has to win , and on disagreements of law , judges make that decision ) . The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision , and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants . Common law , as the body of law made by judges , stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process , and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch ( the interactions are explained later in this article ) . Stare decisis , the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results , lies at the heart of all common law systems ."},{"query":"who has won the men's single title in the australian open tennis tournament 2018","short_answer":"Roger Federer","abstract":"Roger Federer was the defending champion and successfully defended his title , defeating Marin Čilić in the final , 6 -- 2 , 6 -- 7 , 6 -- 3 , 3 -- 6 , 6 -- 1 .

Heat is energy stored in temperature - dependent motion of particles including electrons , atomic nuclei , individual atoms , and molecules . Heat is transferred to and from matter by the principal energy carriers . The state of energy stored within matter , or transported by the carriers , is described by a combination of classical and quantum statistical mechanics . The energy is also transformed ( converted ) among various carriers . The heat transfer processes ( or kinetics ) are governed by the rates at which various related physical phenomena occur , such as ( for example ) the rate of particle collisions in classical mechanics . These various states and kinetics determine the heat transfer , i.e. , the net rate of energy storage or transport . Governing these process from the atomic level ( atom or molecule length scale ) to macroscale are the laws of thermodynamics , including conservation of energy ."},{"query":"what is a poor man's copyright and how effective is it","short_answer":"","abstract":"Poor man 's copyright is a method of using registered dating by the postal service , a notary public or other highly trusted source to date intellectual property , thereby helping to establish that the material has been in one 's possession since a particular time .

It lies below the lithosphere , at depths between approximately 80 and 200 km ( 50 and 120 miles ) below the surface . The Lithosphere - Asthenosphere boundary is usually referred to as LAB .

The thickness of the asthenosphere depends mainly on the temperature . However , the rheology of the asthenosphere also depends on the rate of deformation , which suggests that the asthenosphere could be also formed as a result of a high rate of deformation . In some regions the asthenosphere could extend as deep as 700 km ( 430 mi ) .

In bacteria , which lack a cell nucleus , the cell cycle is divided into the B , C , and D periods . The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication . DNA replication occurs during the C period . The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells . In cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( M ) phase , and cytokinesis . During interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for cell division and duplicating its DNA . During the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate . During the final stage , cytokinesis , the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells .

The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body , then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events . Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago . In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily . Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves ."},{"query":"which of the following best describes the idea of negative feedback in hormonal control","short_answer":"","abstract":"Negative feedback ( or balancing feedback ) occurs when some function of the output of a system , process , or mechanism is fed back in a manner that tends to reduce the fluctuations in the output , whether caused by changes in the input or by other disturbances ."},{"query":"when did they call it world war 2","short_answer":"","abstract":"Call of Duty : WWII is a first - person shooter video game developed by Sledgehammer Games and published by Activision .

Strictly speaking , true nomads follow an irregular pattern of movement , in contrast with transhumance where seasonal pastures are fixed . However this distinction is often not observed and the term nomad used for both -- in historical cases the regularity of movements is often unknown in any case . The herded livestock include cattle , yaks , sheep , goats , reindeer , horses , donkeys or camels , or mixtures of species . Nomadic pastoralism is commonly practised in regions with little arable land , typically in the developing world , especially in the steppe lands north of the agricultural zone of Eurasia . Of the estimated 30 -- 40 million nomadic pastoralists worldwide , most are found in central Asia and the Sahel region of West Africa . Increasing numbers of stock may lead to overgrazing of the area and desertification if lands are not allowed to fully recover between one grazing period and the next . Increased enclosure and fencing of land has reduced the amount of land available for this practice . There is substantive uncertainty over the extent to which the various causes for degradation affect grassland . Different causes have been identified which include overgrazing , mining , agricultural reclamation , pests and rodents , soil properties , tectonic activity , and climate change . Simultaneously , it is maintained that some , such as overgrazing and overstocking , may be overstated while others , such as climate change , mining and agricultural reclamation , may be under reported . In this context , there is also uncertainty as to the long term effect of human behavior on the grassland as compared to non-biotic factors ."},{"query":"when did the us $2 bill leave circulation","short_answer":"","abstract":"The United States two - dollar bill ( $2 ) is a current denomination of U.S. currency .

This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese .

This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy .

At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action .

The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurised fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system . The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits . When the set pressure is exceeded , the relief valve becomes the \`\` path of least resistance '' as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route . The diverted fluid ( liquid , gas or liquid -- gas mixture ) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header or relief header to a central , elevated gas flare where it is usually burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere . As the fluid is diverted , the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising . Once it reaches the valve 's reseating pressure , the valve will close . The blowdown is usually stated as a percentage of set pressure and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats . The blowdown can vary from roughly 2 -- 20 % , and some valves have adjustable blowdowns ."},{"query":"when was the pyramid added to the louvre","short_answer":"in 1989","abstract":"The Louvre Pyramid ( Pyramide du Louvre ) is a large glass and metal pyramid designed by Chinese - American architect I.M.

Stress is the body 's method of reacting to a challenge . Stimuli that alter an organism 's environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body . The autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis are two major systems that respond to stress . The sympathoadrenal medullary ( SAM ) axis may activate the fight or flight response through the sympathetic nervous system , which dedicates energy to more relevant bodily systems to acute adaption to stress , while the parasympathetic nervous system returns the body to homeostasis . The second major physiological stress , the HPA axis regulates the release of cortisol , which influences many bodily functions such as metabolic , psychological and immunological functions . The SAM and HPA axes are regulated by a wide variety of brain regions , including the limbic system , prefrontal cortex , amygdala , hypothalamus , and stria terminalis . Through these mechanisms , stress can alter memory functions , reward , immune function , metabolism and susceptibility to diseases . Definitions of stress differ ; however , one system proposed by Elliot and Eisdorfer suggests five types of stress . The five types of stress are labeled \`\` acute time limited stressors '' , \`\` brief naturalistic stressors '' , \`\` stressful event sequence '' , \`\` chronic stressors '' , and \`\` distant stressors '' . Acute time limited stressors involve short term challenges , while , on the other hand , brief naturalistic stressors involve an event that is normal but nevertheless challenging . Stressful event sequences are a stressor that occur , and continue to yield stress into the immediate future . Chronic stressors involve exposure to a long - term stressor and a distant stressor is a stressor that is n't immediate ."},{"query":"relation between unit vectors in cartesian and spherical coordinates","short_answer":"","abstract":"NOTE : This page uses common physics notation for spherical coordinates , in which θ ( \\\\ displaystyle \\\\ theta ) is the angle between the z axis and the radius vector connecting the origin to the point in question , while φ ( \\\\ displaystyle \\\\ phi ) is the angle between the projection of the radius vector onto the x-y plane and the x axis .

Their bodies consist of mesoglea , a non-living jelly - like substance , sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick . They have two basic body forms : swimming medusae and sessile polyps , both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes .

Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates .

This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the princeps . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire ."},{"query":"who needs a visa to enter the united states","short_answer":"","abstract":"The visa policy of the United States deals with the requirements which a foreign national wishing to enter the United States must meet to obtain a visa , which is a permit to travel to , enter , and remain in the United States .

It is based on common language descriptors . When factor analysis ( a statistical technique ) is applied to personality survey data , some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person . For example , someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as \`\` always prepared '' rather than \`\` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors . For example , extraversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness , assertiveness , excitement seeking , warmth , activity , and positive emotions ."},{"query":"what french philosopher coined the phrase noble savage","short_answer":"","abstract":"A noble savage is a literary stock character who embodies the concept of the indigene , outsider , wild human , or \`\` other '' who has not been \`\` corrupted '' by civilization , and therefore symbolizes humanity 's innate goodness .

This means a good 's demand is increased when the price of another good is decreased . Conversely , the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is increased . If goods A and B are complements , an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in ; less of each good will be demanded . A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward ; more of each good will be demanded . Basically this means that since the demand of one good is linked to the demand of another good , if a higher quantity is demanded of one good , a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other , and if a lower quantity is demanded of one good , a lower quantity will be demanded of the other . The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way : if the price of one good rises , so will the price of the other , and vice versa . With substitute goods , however , the price and quantity demanded of one good is related inversely to the price and quantity demanded of a substitute good , meaning that if the price or quantity demanded of one good rises , the price or quantity demanded of its substitute will fall ."},{"query":"johnny mathis in person recorded live at las vegas","short_answer":"","abstract":"Johnny Mathis in Person : Recorded Live at Las Vegas is a live album by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was recorded at Caesar 's Palace and released on December 22 , 1971 , by Columbia Records .

The consensus of the board was that Maine was destroyed by an external explosion from a mine . However , the validity of this investigation has been challenged . George W. Melville , a chief engineer in the Navy , proposed that a more likely cause for the sinking was from a magazine explosion within the vessel . The Navy 's leading ordnance expert , Philip R. Alger , took this theory further by suggesting that the magazines were ignited by a spontaneous fire in a coal bunker . The coal used in Maine was bituminous coal , which is known for releasing firedamp , a gas that is prone to spontaneous explosions . There is stronger evidence that the explosion of Maine was caused by an internal coal fire which ignited the magazines . This was a likely cause of the explosion , rather than the initial hypothesis of a mine . The ship lay at the bottom of the harbor until 1911 . A cofferdam was then built around the wreck . The hull was patched up until the ship was afloat , then towed to sea and sunk .
